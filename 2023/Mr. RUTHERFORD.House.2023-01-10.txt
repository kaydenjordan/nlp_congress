 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a 95-years-young  Walter Raymond Bowers from Jacksonville, Florida.   Walter was born March 16, 1927, in Dayton, Ohio. He moved to  Jacksonville, Florida, as an infant and was raised by his maternal  grandmother, Sadie Perry.   When he was 17, Walter joined the United States Navy and served in  the Pacific theater during World War II where he earned the Philippine  Liberation Ribbon, one star; the World War II Victory Medal; the  American Campaign Ribbon; and the Asiatic Pacific Campaign Medal, five  stars.   After the war, Walter was assigned to the USS Pine Island and  participated in Operation Highjump, which established the Antarctic  research base known as Little America IV.   At the rank of boiler technician III 3rd class, Raymond Bowers was  honorably discharged from the Navy on July 19, 1948. Just one week  later, on July 26, 1948, he married Mary Dopson, the love of his life  and mother of their three children: Walter, Jr., Margaret, and Paul.   Walter returned to Jacksonville and enlisted in the Naval Reserves  where he served for 8 more years. He then began working for the city of  Jacksonville road department where he spent 20 years of faithful  service.   Walter and Mary both surrendered their lives to Christ in 1950, which  led him to a new calling, one of a real ministry.   Walter joined A.B. Wainwright, and for 18 years they were planting  and pastoring Pentecostal churches all across Jacksonville. Even after  his professional retirement in 1968, Walter continued this ministry by  planting a new church in Jacksonville's Dinsmore community. He started  Wayside Assembly of God in 1973 where he served as senior pastor for  more than 32 years.   His commitment to our Lord Jesus, his family, his community, and his  country have contributed to this incredible legacy. May God continue to  richly bless Walter for his amazing life of selfless service.                            ____________________
