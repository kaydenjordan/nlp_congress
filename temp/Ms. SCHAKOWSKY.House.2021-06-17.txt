 Mr. Speaker, today, I will vote, once again, to  repeal the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force because we  cannot continue endless wars.   Congress passed the 2002 AUMF authorization for war again Saddam  Hussein's regime. I voted against that resolution. And, now, here we  are nearly 20 years later, and we have seen three successive  administrations use the AUMF to wage war in ways that were never  intended, that were way beyond the scope of the congressional  authorization that was used.   Only Congress has the authority to declare war. And it is time for us  to reclaim that authority. We can't let another day go by with this  authorization in place. We cannot support endless wars.
