 Mr. Chair, I insert in the Record a letter from the AFL- CIO.                                                         AFL-CIO,                                                   January 30, 2020.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the AFL-CIO, I urge you       to support the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, H.       R. 2474, and to oppose weakening amendments and any Motion to       Recommit when the House of Representatives considers the bill       next week. The PRO Act will restore the original intent of       the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), which was to give       working people a voice on the job so they can negotiate for       higher wages, better benefits, a more secure retirement and a       safer workplace.        For too long, employers have been able to violate the NLRA       with impunity, routinely denying workers their basic right to       join with coworkers for fairness on the job. As a result, the       collective strength of workers to negotiate for better pay       and benefits has eroded and income inequality has reached       levels that predate the Great Depression. (Please see the       attached summary of recent research on unions, inequality and       the economy).        The PRO Act would modernize the NLRA by bringing its       remedies in line with other  [[Page H882]]       workplace laws. In addition to imposing financial penalties       on companies and individual corporate officers who violate       the law, the bill would give workers the option of bringing       their case to federal court. The bill would make elections       fairer by prohibiting employers from requiring their       employees to attend ``captive audience'' meetings whose sole       purpose is to convince workers to vote against the union.        Under the bill, once workers vote to form a union, the       National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) would be authorized to       order that the employer commence bargaining a first contract.       These orders would be enforced in district courts to ensure       swift justice. In addition, the bill would ensure that       employees are not deprived of their right to a union because       their employer hides behind a subcontractor or other       intermediary, or deliberately misclassifies them as       supervisors or independent contractors.        Too often, when workers choose to form a union, employers       stall the bargaining process to avoid reaching an agreement.       The PRO Act would establish a process for mediation and       arbitration to help the parties achieve a first contract.       This important change would make the freedom to negotiate a       reality for countless workers who form unions but never get       to enjoy the benefits of a collective bargaining agreement.        The PRO Act recognizes that employees need the freedom to       picket or withhold our labor in order to push for the       workplace changes we seek. The bill protects employees' right       to strike by preventing employers from hiring permanent       replacement workers. It also allows unrepresented employees       to engage in collective action or class action lawsuits to       enforce basic workplace rights, rather than being forced to       arbitrate such claims alone.        Finally, the bill would eliminate state right to work laws.       These laws have been promoted by a network of billionaires       and special interest groups to give more power to       corporations at the expense of workers, and have had the       effect of lowering wages and eroding pensions and health care       coverage in states where they have been adopted.        Restoring our middle class is dependent on strengthening       the collective power of workers to negotiate for better pay       and working conditions. That is why public support for unions       is the highest it has been in decades. We urge you to support       the PRO Act and help us build an economy that works for all       working families.            Sincerely,                                                    William Samuel,                                      Director, Government Affairs.     Mr. Chair, as one of the few union members in Congress,  let me tell you that the benefits that workers and families earn from  being in a union are significant.   Workers in a union make almost $10,000 more per year, and 70 percent  of workers in a union have a pension plan compared to just 13 percent  of nonunion workers.   The problem is there have been decades-long coordinated attacks on  workers' rights to join or form a union. It is time to make it easier  for workers to have a voice in their workplace, and we have got some  work to do.   There are laws that make it harder to organize, and employees  involved in organizing face barriers, including a one-in-five chance of  getting fired. Even when workers do form a union, employers refuse to  bargain, and more than half of the unions don't get a collective  bargaining agreement within a year.   If you vote to form a union, you should have one and get a contract.  If you are an employee, you shouldn't be misclassified as an  independent contractor. And if an employer violates your labor rights,  they shouldn't be let off the hook.   I am proud to support workers' rights, and I am proud to support the  Protecting the Right to Organize Act.
