 Let me thank my colleague from South Carolina. And I  look forward to working with him. He is going to be the ranking member  of the Budget Committee. We have a lot of work to do, and I look  forward to working with him.   As Senator Graham indicated, in a few moments, at the end of my  remarks, we are going to begin the vote-arama process, where Senators  can offer amendments, with debate limited to 2 minutes--1 minute for  the proponents and 1 minute for the opponents.   The last time I checked--I may be a little behind the times on this-- my Republican colleagues had filed over 550 amendments, which,  theoretically, means that we will be here for days, but I think not. I  have a feeling it will be a very long night, but I assume we will get  out of here at some point.   Unfortunately, many of the amendments being offered have absolutely  nothing to do with COVID relief, which, after all, is what this budget  resolution is all about.   My Republican colleagues have filed amendments to make President  Trump's tax breaks for the wealthiest people in our country and the  most profitable corporations permanent, which would provide a massive  windfall for the top 1 percent and the billionaire class who have  already seen their wealth go up by over $1 trillion during this  pandemic. In my mind, it is not exactly the kind of policy that we need  right now.   Republicans have filed amendments to exacerbate the xenophobia, the  xenophobia which exists in this country, despite the fact that many  undocumented workers are doing some of the most essential and dangerous  work in our country. They are working in meatpacking plants; they are  preparing our food and working on the frontlines, often with very low  pay. We should not be attacking them. We should not be dividing this  country up. We should be bringing our people together.   We have had 4 years of efforts to divide us up. Now is a time for  unity.   Members of the Democratic caucus have made my life easy in this  process because they have filed zero amendments. Republicans, 550  amendments; Democrats, 0. I think that speaks to the strong desire of  our entire caucus to pass President Biden's $1.9 trillion emergency  COVID relief plan as soon as we possibly can.   The reason we have got to pass that plan as quickly as possible is  that the American people are suffering one crisis after another, and we  have got to address those crises as quickly as we can.   Let me briefly--I know there is a lot of media talk about $1.9  trillion, and this, that, and the other thing. Sometimes we forget to  look at actually what is in the proposal. What are we trying to do?  What are the problems that we are trying to address? So let me just,  very briefly, touch on some of the provisions of this budget  resolution.   First, and perhaps most importantly, it will enable us to  aggressively crush the pandemic, which has already taken over 450,000  American lives. That is our top priority: crush the pandemic and allow  people to get back to work as we reopen and strengthen the economy, and  we get our kids back to school. That is an essential part of what this  resolution is about.   This resolution will allow us to provide the funding to establish a  national emergency program to produce the quantity of vaccines that we  need. We don't have enough vaccines now. We need more. And then we need  a process, which we don't have right now either, to get those vaccines  into the arms of people as quickly as we possibly can.   At a time when so many of our people are hurting, have gone through  the worst year in their lives as a result of this pandemic, this budget  resolution will allow us to keep the promises we made to the American  people and increase the $600 in direct payments for working-class  adults and their children to $2,000. That means $1,400 for every  working-class adult and child in this country, an additional $5,600 on  top of the 600 bucks that we sent out a few weeks ago.   Do you know what that would mean t millions of families who are  worried about whether they can pay the rent or put food on the table?  They will understand that maybe, just maybe, we are one country, and  the government and this Congress has heard their pain.    Passing this budget resolution will give us the tools we need to  raise the minimum wage to a living wage of $15 an hour and provide  substantial help to struggling small businesses to help them cover the  cost of these wage increases.   We do understand that restaurants and small businesses are hurting,  and that is why we will provide billions of dollars to help them cover  the cost of increasing the minimum wage.   But let us be clear, the minimum wage in this country has not been  raised since the year 2007. It now stands at $7.25 an hour. That is a  starvation wage. That is an embarrassment, and that minimum wage must  be increased so that we can give a pay raise to some 32 million  workers.   Moreover, this pandemic has caused tens of millions of Americans to  lose their jobs through no fault of their own. For 45 consecutive  weeks, unemployment claims have been higher during the worst week of  the great recession in 2008.   The budget resolution that we are considering this week will provide  the funding to provide 18 million Americans with $400 a week in  supplemental unemployment benefits until the end of September. So we  are saying now to the millions and millions of unemployed workers in  this country, who, through no fault of their own, have lost their jobs,  we are there for you. We are going to extend unemployment benefits to  September and add another $400 on top of the benefits that you normally  would receive.   One of the disgraces that we have allowed to go on for so many years,  and not talk about it, is the fact that in this country--the richest  country in the history of the world--we have one of the highest  childhood poverty rates of any industrialized country. And they are all  over America. You have got single moms and couples, people trying to  take care of their kids, trying to pay for childcare, trying to do all  of the things that good parents want to do, and they are unable to do  it. This budget resolution will provide the resources necessary to  provide childcare to 875,000 kids in America.   This resolution will expand the child tax credit from $2,000 to  $3,000 and $3,600 for kids under the age of 6, which we believe will  cut the child poverty rate in America in half--something we should have  done 20 years ago. That is what is in this resolution.   This budget resolution that we are debating today would provide $350  billion to prevent mass layoffs of public sector workers in State and  local governments. We have lost well over 1 million jobs--talking about  teachers, firemen, cops, municipal workers. This resolution will give  States and local governments the resources to not lay off workers, to  bring those workers back so they could provide the services that their  communities and States require.   We are the only major country on Earth not to guarantee healthcare to  all people as a human right. And, right now, over 90 million Americans  are either uninsured or underinsured. Imagine being uninsured in the  midst of a terrible pandemic. That is the case for 90 million people.   This budget resolution will enable the Senate to substantially  increase access to healthcare for many millions of Americans,  including, very likely, a significant expansion of Medicaid.   This budget resolution will allow more Americans to receive the  primary healthcare they need through community health centers. It will  address the serious shortage of doctors and nurses in rural areas and  inner cities by expanding the National Health Service Corps. And it  will make sure our veterans receive the healthcare they have earned and  deserve by increasing funding at the VA by some $17 billion.   In addition, in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, I  don't  [[Page S432]]  think it is saying too much that people should not go hungry. I get  emotionally wrought when, in my own State--and this is true in every  State in this country--in my own city of Burlington, VT, hundreds of  people line up in their cars to get emergency food packages. Many of  them never, in a million years, would have thought that they would be  in that position.   We are looking at the highest rate of hunger in America in decades.  And if this country means anything, if this government means anything,  we are not going to allow our fellow Americans to go hungry.   This budget resolution will provide nutrition assistance to tens of  millions of hungry families with children, the disabled, and the  elderly by providing billions of dollars for SNAP, WIC, and the  pandemic nutrition assistance program.   One of the outstanding crises this country faces is the fear of many  millions of our people of being evicted from their homes or their  apartments. Today, over 14 million Americans owe an average of $5,800  in back rent. We have a moratorium on eviction right now. But the day  that moratorium ends, I fear that many, many people all over this  country will face eviction. That is why this budget resolution will  provide the funding for rent relief, utility assistance, and mortgage  relief to millions of tenants and homeowners who are in danger of  eviction or foreclosure.   In addition, this budget resolution allows us to address the terrible  crisis of homelessness in America where, a few blocks away from here,  in bitter cold weather, Americans are sleeping out in tents.   Not only is this $1.9 trillion emergency COVID relief package the  right thing to do from a moral perspective and a public policy  perspective, it is exactly what the overwhelming majority of the  American people want us to do. They understand that if we are one  country and they are hurting, now is the time to come together and to  address that pain.   So many of our people have given up on democracy. They have given up  on their belief that government can work to help them. Now is the time  to try to reaffirm people's faith in government.   People want us to go forward. According to a recent poll, over 70  percent of the American people support President Biden's $1.9 trillion  COVID-19 plan, 83 percent support boosting direct payments from $600 to  $2,000, 64 percent support raising the Federal minimum wage to 15 bucks  an hour, and 62 percent support additional unemployment benefits.   In other words, what we are doing is the right thing to do, and what  we are doing is what the American people want us to do. So now is the  time to reaffirm the faith of the American people that their government  listens to them; that, in fact, we are a government of the people, by  the people, and for the people, as Lincoln talked about in the midst of  the terrible Civil War.   So now we can show who we are, and that is, instead of listening to  wealthy campaign contributors and all of the lobbyists who flood  Capitol Hill, let us stand with working families today, the elderly,  the children, the sick, and the poor who want us to stand with them.  Let us pass this budget resolution, and let us then finish the job by  passing a reconciliation bill so that we can get it to the President  for his signature as soon as possible.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  following amendments be called up in the order listed: Wicker-Sinema  No. 261, Tim Scott No. 53, Rubio-Scott No. 69, Blunt No. 48, Thune No.  52, Young No. 54; further, that there be 2 minutes for debate equally  divided in the usual form prior to each vote.    Madam President, there are no tax increases on small  business in this. We support the Rubio amendment.    Yes. We yield back time. We support a voice vote.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 30  seconds.    I do not oppose this amendment. I don't think anybody  here wants to see people making $300,000 or $400,000 get direct  payments.   But let me be very clear, speaking for myself. I absolutely want to  make certain that people who are making $75,000 a year or less do get  their payments and couples making $150,000 a year or less do get their  payments.   I yield the floor.                          Vote on Amendment No. 775     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in  order to call up the following amendments in the order listed and that  the amendments be reported by number: Cardin No. 716; Barrasso No. 653;  Sasse No. 192; Graham No. 687; Ernst No. 132; Collins No. 546; and  Shaheen No. 834.    Mr. President, this amendment is opposed by the  Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, the Center for American  Progress, America's Voice, SCIU, the National Immigrant Justice Center,  and many, many other civil rights and immigration organizations. The  reason they oppose it and why I oppose it is this amendment applies to  people charged, not convicted. I am not a lawyer, but my understanding  is that in this country, we believe that people are innocent until  proven guilty.   What this amendment does is vilify immigrants. Many of them are  working at essential and dangerous jobs right now, often for very low  pay.                                Point of Order    Mr. President, this amendment is not germane to the budget resolution  as required by law; therefore, I raise a point of order that the  pending amendment violates section 305(b)(2) of the Congressional  Budget Act of 1974.    Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment.  Clearly, all across this country rural communities are suffering real  healthcare crises in terms of a loss of hospitals that they desperately  need.   So I would hope that this would be an issue that all of us will work  together to rebuild healthcare in rural America and make sure that our  communities have the hospitals that they need.                          Vote on Amendment No. 546    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in  order to call up the following amendments in the order listed and that  the amendments be reported by number and that the amendments alternate  with a Democratic amendment when one is available to be called up:  Grassley No. 91, Cortez Masto No. 853, Inhofe No. 786, Paul No. 1,  Ernst No. 767, Daines No. 678, Johnson No. 542, Lee No. 821.    Mr. President, at a time when half of our workers are  living paycheck to paycheck, when millions of workers are earning  starvation wages, and when Congress has not voted to raise the minimum  wage since 2007, I will do everything that I can to make sure that a  $15-an-hour minimum wage is included in this reconciliation bill. But  there appears to be some misunderstanding. As the author of the Raise  the Wage Act, it was never my intention to increase the minimum wage to  $15 an hour immediately and during the pandemic. My legislation  gradually increases the minimum wage to $15 an hour over a 5-year  period, and that is what I believe we have to do. We need to do it in  the reconciliation bill, and we need to end the crisis of starvation  wages in Iowa and around the United States.   So I will support this amendment because nobody is talking about  doubling the Federal minimum wage during the pandemic. We are talking  about gradually phasing it in over a 5-year period.    Mr. President, I would accept a voice vote.    I urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment.    Mr. President, at a time when climate change poses an  existential threat to the entire planet, I urge a ``no'' vote.                          Vote on Amendment No. 770     Mr. President, I support this amendment. I hope we can  do it through a voice vote.  [[Page S456]]                               Vote on Amendment No. 816     Mr. President, I regretfully oppose this amendment  because I fear, at the end of the day, what will happen is that we will  be cutting Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, and impacting some  of the most vulnerable people in this country.                          Vote on Amendment No. 803     I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, we accept the amendment and urge a voice  vote.                          Vote on Amendment No. 806     Mr. President, I have been advised that inclusion of  this amendment in the budget resolution would be corrosive to the  privilege status of the resolution. Since this amendment contains  material inappropriate for inclusion in a budget resolution, its  adoption could jeopardize the privilege of this resolution, which would  completely halt our efforts to provide critical pandemic relief.   Additionally, this amendment is not germane to the budget resolution  as required by law. Accordingly, I raise a point of order that the  pending amendment violates section 305(b)(2) of the Congressional  Budget Act of 1974.    Madam President, we now come to the end of a debate that  has gone on for over 14 hours, and we end this debate at a moment in  which our country faces more crises, more pain, and more anxiety than  at any time since the Great Depression. With the passage of this  resolution, we have the opportunity not only to address the pandemic,  to address the economic collapse, and to address the reality that  millions of our kids have seen their educations disrupted, but we have  the opportunity to give hope to the American people and restore faith  in our government by telling them that, tonight, we understand the pain  that they are experiencing, and we are going to do something very  significant about it.   In the strongest possible terms, I ask for a ``yes'' vote on this  enormously important budget resolution.                            Vote on S. Con. Res. 5
