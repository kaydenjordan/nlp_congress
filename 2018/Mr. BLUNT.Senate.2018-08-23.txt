 Madam President, we will vote in a few minutes to move  forward with the Defense, Labor, HHS, and Education appropriations  bill.   That probably sounds like a pretty unusual combination, even though I  think most voters, most taxpayers, understand that to get this work  done in the timeframe we have to do it, we generally need to bring more  than one topic together on the floor at the same time. But why Defense,  Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education?   Well, first of all, that is 62 percent of all the spending. If we can  get this bill passed today, get a conference with the House, get this  single bill on the President's desk by the end of the fiscal year, we  will have funded that much of the government in a timely way for the  first time in a decade.   If we can add the other bills to it that the House and Senate have  passed, we will have 90 percent of the spending on the President's desk  and in place before the spending year starts.   It doesn't sound as if that would be a very big accomplishment, but  by the standards of the last decade, it would be an incredible  accomplishment to bring these bills to the floor, to allow them to be  debated, to allow them to be amended. We have a managers' package that  would include a number of the 60 or so proposed amendments just on the  Labor, Health and Human Services, Education part of the bill. I don't  know how that is exactly going to work out today, but I do know we can  take that managers' package to the conference and say: This is what we  agreed to as a managers' package. Whether we officially are able to add  it or not, every bit of it is germane to the bill, germane, in my view,  to what could happen in conference.   I would also point out that, for decades, the priority of my side of  the aisle, of our side of the aisle, has been that defending the  country first is the No. 1 priority.   One of the top priorities on the other side of the aisle has been:  Well, let's take the biggest of the nondefense bills and be sure we are  equally prioritizing it.   So in my view, for perhaps the first time this has ever happened, the  leaders have decided to bring these two top priorities to the floor  together and let voters, Democrats and Republicans, voters on the  Senate floor, decide how they want to move forward with those bills.   Let me just talk for a few minutes about one of the items in our  bill--the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Subcommittee,  which you and I serve on--and that would be healthcare research,  specifically Alzheimer's and how it relates to that research.   First of all, for a dozen years, ending 4 years ago, there had not  been a penny of increase in health research.   When I became chairman of this committee 4 years ago, Senator Murray  and I began to work on reprioritizing healthcare research, with  Democrats and Republicans getting together to figure out what we needed  to do. For at least the first couple of years, what we needed to do was  eliminate other programs and combine other programs and make tough  choices to be sure that health research was a priority.   When we pass this bill today, we will have increased health research  spending in a budget that for 2 years had no growth at all and has had  some growth in the last 2, but by 30 percent--30 percent--from $30  billion a year to $39 billion a year at a time when we know more about  the human genome, we know more about what makes each of us different  from all the rest of us than we have before.   What are we beginning to see? We are seeing things in immunotherapy  in cancer; we are seeing things in brain research. We are not seeing  the kinds of results we want to see yet in Alzheimer's, but we are  moving in that direction.   Every hour, Alzheimer's disease costs taxpayers at least $21  million--every single hour. Someone in the United States is developing  Alzheimer's every 65 seconds. We are spending somewhere in the  neighborhood of 277 billion tax dollars a year on Alzheimer's and  dementia-related care.   I have just given three numbers. It is hard to talk about  appropriating without giving numbers. Maybe numbers are not the most  riveting thing, particularly when you start talking about millions or  billions or even trillions. What does that really mean?   That means we are spending basically an amount equal to half of the  defense budget on Alzheimer's and dementia-related care. That will have  an overwhelming impact if we don't do something differently than we are  doing right now, just because of the projected long life and  demographics of the country. In 2050, which is 32 years from now, we  will be spending, in today's dollars, $1.1 trillion on Alzheimer's and  dementia care--$1.1 trillion. One point one anything--who knows? Let's  go back to defense again. That is twice the defense budget of last  year--twice the defense budget.   I don't really have a great grasp of what $1.1 trillion is, but I do  have a sense of what every military base everywhere in the world would  be. Add to that every ship, every plane, every piece of equipment, and  add to that every training dollar, and add to that every paycheck for  every soldier, sailor, airman, marine, person in the National Guard,  the Coast Guard, the Reserves, and you will begin to approach a pretty  big number.   We would be spending more than twice that amount. If you add up all I  have just talked about, taxpayer spending would be more than twice that  just on Alzheimer's and dementia.   Obviously, there is a huge taxpayer need to find a solution here.  There is an even bigger individual need. It is not only a devastating  disease for people who have it, it is a devastating disease for the  people who care about them. There is one generally used number out  there that says for every tax dollar we are spending on Alzheimer's and  dementia right now, we are spending two private dollars, almost never  insured. These are caregivers. These are people who care about you, who  give up part or all of their career and time to take care of you  instead of doing what they otherwise would be doing. The person being  taken care of may not have any real idea, at some point, as to what is  going on, but the people taking care of them know. That is a big reason  to find a solution.   If we could just delay the onset of Alzheimer's, if we could figure  out how to come up with something that would slow down the onset of  that disease, if we could delay the onset by an average of 5 years, we  would cut that $1.1 trillion by 42 percent--almost in half. If we could  just have the average person who gets Alzheimer's get it 5 years later  than they are getting Alzheimer's today, almost half, 42 percent, of  that $1.1 trillion would go away. So this is something we obviously  need to prioritize.  [[Page S5875]]    Just 4 years ago, we were spending about $600 million on Alzheimer's  research. We were spending $250 billion on taxpayer-related care. We  were spending $600 million--what is that? Is that one-quarter of 1  percent? We were spending $600 million on research to try to help solve  this problem that we are spending these billions of dollars on every  year.   In 4 years, we have gotten that number beyond the disease goal a  handful of years ago. We said: If we just could have $2 billion for  Alzheimer's research every year, we would have a better chance to find  a solution.   Well, this year, we have passed the $2 billion. We are at $2.34  billion, but we are still spending less than 1 percent on trying to  find a solution to the problem of what we are spending every year on  the problem. It is an important 1 percent.   At Washington University in St. Louis--I didn't know when I started  chairing this committee what great leaders they are in this research  effort. I knew this was one of the top health research universities in  the country. I didn't know where we were in terms of the cutting-edge  on Alzheimer's, but Dr. Randy Bateman at Washington University in St.  Louis is very close. He has unveiled the results of a blood test that  hopefully will detect early on whether you individually are on the way  to developing this problem.   Obviously that matters if we can find things that could be done to  significantly slow down the advance of this disease. It is not  particularly expensive to take a blood test. It is not very invasive.  It gets a quick result. Now what you have to do--you have to have a CAT  scan. Somebody, in an expensive process, looks at your brain and  figures out if you have amyloids developing in your brain that are  likely to cause this.   So early detection--Dr. Hodes at the National Institute on Aging at  NIH says that one of the real reasons we can't find solutions is we  cannot figure out how to get the right group to clinically test. A  blood test would help with that. So we are working on that.   I see my friend Senator Markey is here. I would point out to him that  because of the leader's time, I started talking only about 8 minutes  ago and maybe have only 2 minutes right now.   If you want to use that 2 minutes before the vote--but we do have a  vote--then we will figure out later, maybe, how to get back to your  time. But thanks for your interest in health research. Certainly, Dr.  Blumenthal, the Senator's wife, is a great advocate of this. Why don't  I yield this last minute or so to Senator Markey; then maybe there will  be other time later, but I know we have a vote scheduled in a minute.    I yield back my time as well.                            ____________________     Mr. President, certainly I want to thank my colleagues  today for the credit that they have shared with me and that I am  reluctant to accept. This is clearly an effort to establish what our  priorities are. There are a lot of things in this bill that are goods  things for somebody to do. In some cases over the years, we have not  done them as well as we should have, and well-intentioned programs  didn't work. We have gone through the process of eliminating programs  and combining programs so we could set the priorities mentioned just  this morning by Senator Collins, Senator Capito, and Senator Moran.   When you think about what we are talking about here--healthcare  research, the opioid epidemic, and what is happening in the Alzheimer's  space--we would have never imagined these numbers in cost or family  impact.   There is one thing I want to mention just briefly before we end this  part of our discussion. I think between votes and other things this  morning--Senator Cardin is here and, like me, planned to do what I am  doing now about an hour ago. So I am going to take just a couple  minutes.   I want to talk a little about the labor part of this bill. For the  first time in the 20 years we have been keeping statistics on jobs  available and people looking for work, this is the first time there are  more jobs available than people looking for work. That is a big number  and a big thing to think about.   The other thing to think about is that the match between the people  looking for work and the jobs available is not exact. In fact, most of  the people looking for work don't have the skills for the jobs that  need to be done. Recently, I was in Missouri visiting with a small  manufacturing company. They had 20 job openings and were just waiting  for somebody to come in the door who had the skill set for those job  openings.   What we do to do a better job of combining the skills people need  with the jobs that are out there or the jobs that will be out there-- the apprenticeship programs in this bill that Senator Murray and I have  particularly been focused on with Secretary Acosta give people new ways  to get ready for work. They create new ways for partnering between  people already in the workforce and someone they can mentor, an  apprentice. We are looking at the Pell grant area for ways that the  post-high school Pell grant can be used in different ways that allow  not just traditional college programs but various kinds of certificated  programs that allow people to go to work in areas where there are high  demands. Right now, construction, energy, hospitality, healthcare, and  manufacturing are only a few of the industries where jobs need to be  done.   We have around 400 registered apprenticeship programs in my State,  with more than 13,000 apprentices working with several hundred  employees. There are 530,000 Americans in apprenticeship programs  nationwide--over half a million Americans--getting ready for the jobs  that are out there.   What the Department of Labor is doing with Job Corps--for years, the  major Job Corps measurement has been ``Did you get some kind of  certificate?'' Well, we are now shifting from ``Did you get some kind  of certificate?'' to ``Did you get a job?'' It is great to have a  certificate; it is a whole lot better to have a certificate that gets  you a job.   Over the next 3 years, we are moving from--of course you get the  certificate--that is a basic part of the program--but does it lead to a  job, and do you still have that job or a job like it a year later? That  is how the people running these programs are going to be measured in  the future, as opposed to whether they just got somebody through the  program. Now it will be ``Did you get somebody through your program in  a way that met the goal of the Job Corps?'' It is not the Certificate  Corps; it is the Job Corps--now measuring by getting a job.   This bill is reflective of the new efforts in our society to try to  match people with the jobs that are out there and to do the kinds  things in our economy that ensure that those are jobs that allow people  to raise a family and allow people to have opportunities they wouldn't  have otherwise.   So I am looking forward to later today when I believe we will all  vote for this bill--Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education,  combined with the critically important bill on defense.    Mr. President, I appreciate the concern of my friend from  Wyoming on this. I will be voting to waive the point of order.   My colleague from Wyoming was exactly right when he said this is a  complicated formula. It is a combination of discretionary and mandatory  funding for the Higher Education Act. The discretionary portion of the  maximum award is established annually in the Labor-HHS bill. We changed  the maximum Pell for discretionary funding from $5,035 to $5,135 for  the 2019-2020 school year. That is an additional mandatory funding of  $1,060. Maximum Pell will be $6,195. That is in line with the kind of  increases we have had now for the last 12 years in a row.   I will be voting to waive and urge my colleagues to do the same.    Mr. President, it has been 11 years since this bill has  been on the floor. Consequently, none of these staffers have probably  ever been mentioned on the floor before, even though every single year  they have made this continued, great effort.   Senator Shelby, Senator Leahy, and Senator Durbin decided, along with  Senator Murray and me, that we would bring this combination of bills  together that has never been on the floor at any time--Labor-H and  Defense.   The Defense staff has been recognized, but let me just mention the  Labor, HHS, and Education staff: Mike Gentile, Jeff Reczek, Ashley  Palmer, Courtney Bradford, and Laura Friedel, our staff director. All  of them are on our side of the aisle.   Obviously, Senator Murray's staff played a critically important part  in this as well: Mark Laisch, Lisa Bernhardt, Kelly Brown, Catie  Finley, and Teri Curtin.   Clearly, this bill would not be here today, in the condition it is  in, or we would not have been able to have responded to all of the  suggestions this week without both of these staffs having worked to  have made it happen.   I yield back.    Mr. President, I have 6 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.
