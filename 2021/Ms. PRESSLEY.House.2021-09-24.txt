 Madam Speaker, abortion care is a fundamental human  right. Texas' unconscionable abortion ban is further evidence that  lawmakers who aim to do harm will stop at nothing to attack our  reproductive rights and bodily autonomy. But not on our watch.   It is clear the Supreme Court is no longer on the side of justice and  the pro-choice majority of the House of Representatives has a  responsibility to stand in the gap and to act.   Today, we must, and we will, pass the Women's Health Protection Act.  I am proud to co-lead this bill with Congresswoman Chu to codify the  right to abortion care.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stand with us to reaffirm  reproductive justice and protect this fundamental right.
