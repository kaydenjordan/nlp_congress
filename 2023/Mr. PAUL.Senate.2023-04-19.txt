 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to  10 minutes prior to the scheduled rollcall vote on my amendment No. 79.    Firefighting and emergency medical services are some of the  most important and most inherently local services that people rely on.  The men and women who show up when the call for help goes out are  everyday heroes in communities across America.   City governments have predominantly decided to provide fire services  at taxpayer expense with local taxes, while in rural areas, volunteer  fire departments are still prevalent. Many localities have decided to  provide medical services as well. Although hospitals still are the  primary EMS providers in a lot of locations, private companies are  playing an increasing role in this space as well. But no matter who  provides the services--government employees, volunteers, or private  entities, these are local needs best met by local providers and best  paid for with local taxes.   For the first 225 years of our country's history, this is just what  happened, until 2000, when the Federal Government had its first budget  surplus in almost 50 years--a surplus that disappeared the very next  year, by the way. Congress, in the year 2000, decided to spend a bit of  that surplus to create a new subsidy for local firefighters.   This first year, the program was authorized at a total of $110  million for government and volunteer fire departments; however, the  bill before us today now authorizes $2.3 billion per year for these  subsidies. That's right, in the 30 years for this program, Federal  subsidies for these important, but inherently local, programs have  increased 18-fold.   In that same time, our government has gone from an annual surplus of  about $86 billion to perpetual deficits of over $1 trillion a year. The  national debt has grown from less than $6 trillion to over $32  trillion.   Despite the reality of our fiscal condition, this bill makes no  reforms. It doesn't limit the grants to departments that can't raise  money on their own. It doesn't ask local governments to invest more of  their own funds. The only thing this bill accomplishes, really, is to  increase spending by 25 percent.   The unsustainable increases in spending with no attempt to rein-in  future costs or make offsetting cuts elsewhere in the budget is  concerning. I am glad to see we have an amendment, though, to pay for  the bill by reallocating unspent COVID funds that are still in  existence and haven't already been allocated and could be used for this  program. So we will have an amendment to pay for this program. We will  see if anyone on the other side is actually interested in paying for a  program.   The other major problem with this bill is it rewards governments-- local governments that chose to trample on the freedom of firefighters  and medics to speak their own minds and make their own medical  decisions. One purpose of the grant in this bill is to increase  staffing for fire departments. Over the last few years, even as these  grants were awarded, firefighters around the country found themselves  with a choice: submit to COVID vaccine mandates or lose your  livelihood.   This was no idle threat. In New York, L.A., and Seattle, among other  places, firefighters lost their jobs simply because they insisted upon  living according to their own conscience.  [[Page S1226]]    One of those firefighters who was terminated is Joseph Kimball, who  served in Salt River, AZ, and has six children. His wife is a stay-at- home mom, but this didn't stop local officials from firing him for not  getting a COVID vaccine.   It seems bizarre and contradictory to provide financial support to  increase fire department staffing to departments that are firing people  for not being vaccinated--firefighters that were trained and effective  and there was no good reason to fire them, particularly when we had  shortages of firefighters as reported throughout the country.   Firefighters tend to be young and fit. They are the very people who  have the least to worry about with COVID-19. They also tend to be male,  and young males are the group most likely to suffer the vaccine-related  injury of myocarditis. Firemen and EMTs who chose not to be vaccinated  were never a threat to anyone, never a threat to their communities. On  the contrary, these firefighters served their communities bravely and  made their neighbors safe. They served throughout an entire year when  there was no vaccine. Many of these firefighters contracted COVID and  have naturally acquired immunity.   What was being done to them? What was done to them through firing  them for making their own medical decisions, what was done to the  police and to doctors and to nurses, what was done to first responders  was shameful. And we should stand together to make sure it never  happens again.   To that end, I offer an amendment that will restore sanity and  compassion to this government program. My amendment would make grants  provided for by this bill unavailable to fire departments that  dismissed firefighters for not getting a vaccine. This would bring some  sense of justice to this program. And fire departments would only be  eligible for these grants if they reinstated the firefighters. So this  amendment would actually serve to allow some of the firefighters that  were unfairly dismissed to get their jobs back.   It turns out--and we all know this now--the vaccine didn't protect  anybody from getting infected. It showed some efficacy of increasing  your immunity to resist infection, but there was never any medical  reason to mandate people to be vaccinated. And no one ever offered to  these firefighters: Well, you can be tested. If you have had COVID and  we know you have immunity, you don't have to be vaccinated. There was  never any alternatives. Many of them weren't even given religious or  philosophical or medical alternatives to being forced to be vaccinated.   So if you want to support firefighters, if you want to support your  communities, if you want to support safety, you should support my  amendment that says that fire departments are eligible only if they  reinstate the firefighters they unfairly dismissed.   Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 79 and ask that it be  reported by number.    Mr. President.    There is a longstanding tradition in our country when we  dispense Federal money to localities to have rules. We don't let you  discriminate based on your sex or race or ethnicity. We also should not  let localities discriminate against people who refuse to be vaccinated,  particularly people who have already had COVID.   There is no science behind saying you need to be vaccinated if you  already had it. In fact, the studies show this: They show that if had  you had the disease you are 57 times less likely to contract it again,  whereas the vaccine makes you about 19 times less. So infection does  work and it should be part of the criteria, and we should restrict  funds to any agency that fired people unfairly for not getting a  vaccine.                           Vote on Amendment No. 79     I ask for the yeas and nays.
