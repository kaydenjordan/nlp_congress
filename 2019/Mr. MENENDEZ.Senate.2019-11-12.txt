 Madam President, I am going to yield the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, first, let me congratulate the Senator  from Oklahoma on his upcoming 50th anniversary.    That is the 60th anniversary. Oh, my God. That is a  hallmark under any set of circumstances, and we wish him much health  and happiness with his bride for a lot longer time as well. I say  congratulations.    Madam President, When President Trump welcomes Turkish  President Erdogan to the White House this week, he will be welcoming a  known authoritarian, human rights abuser, and friend to Putin, whose  behavior increasingly runs counter to the interests of the United  States and our allies. It is yet another strategic mistake and a  terrible misuse of the power of the Presidency.   In recent years, the President of Turkey has made a series of  decisions to part ways with NATO, with the United States, and with the  basic principles of democracy. Make no mistake. Erdogan's actions are  intentional. It is stunning to think that any American President would  legitimize Erdogan's harmful policies by welcoming him to the Oval  Office. This meeting is a mistake, plain and simple.   I can only hope that instead of yielding to Erdogan's policies that  are so squarely at odds with U.S. interests, President Trump treats  this misguided meeting as more than just a photo op with yet another  dictator.   The President should instead use this visit to actually stand up for  America, for our principles, and for our allies. He can do this by  raising the many serious questions that Turkey has yet to address.   I would like to use this opportunity to outline 10 critical  questions, each of which deserves real answers.   Question No. 1: Will Turkey reverse course from Erdogan's decision to  buy  [[Page S6513]]  and receive the S-400 air defense system from Russia?   The President's National Security Advisor claims that the  administration is very ``upset'' about Turkey's purchase of Russia's S- 400 weapons system. Well, ``upset'' is not a policy, and it falls well  short of the Trump administration's legal obligations.   Under the CAATSA sanctions law, Turkey's purchase of the S-400 is a  significant and sanctionable transaction. These sanctions should have  been imposed in July when Turkey first took delivery of the S-400s.  Yet, by failing to implement the legal requirements of CAATSA,  President Trump has done lasting damage to U.S. credibility, to the  integrity of our sanctions, and to the rule of law.   Is it too much to ask the President of the United States to follow  the law?   He can start by imposing CAATSA sanctions when Erdogan is in  Washington.   Question Number 2: Will our President sanction the activities of  Halkbank, a Turkish institution that facilitated the biggest evasion of  Iran's sanctions in history? I repeat: It was the biggest evasion of  Iran sanctions in history.   We know that the Justice Department has finally brought charges in  the case, but if the administration had followed the law, they would  have already imposed sanctions on Halkbank and sent a message to other  actors who seek to evade Iran sanctions.   I understand that one of Erdogan's top priorities for his visit to  the White House is to secure relief for Halkbank. That is the opposite  of what the law requires, and I hope President Trump shows some  backbone when Erdogan asks him for yet another favor.   Let's not forget that President Trump's personal attorney, Rudy  Giuliani represented Reza Zarrab, one of the players in Halkbank's  sanctions evasion.   It seems that the President likes to talk tough about his sanctions  policy on Iran and yet all the tough talks suddenly stops when the  interests of his authoritarian pals or his personal lawyer are on the  line.   Question number 3: Will the President accept the commission of war  crimes in Syria by Turkish-backed forces--the war crimes that he in  effect invited Turkey to commit when he green-lighted its invasion of  Syria?   The U.N. reports that more than 200,000 people have been internally  displaced from the so-called safe zone controlled by the Turks. Some of  those displaced have reported that Turkish-backed forces have beaten  civilians and conducted kidnappings and summary executions.   With the pullout of American troops, Turkey was effectively given  license to commit these abuses and unleash unspeakable crimes. That is  ethnic cleansing.   So many in this Chamber have said never again to this kind of horror  in the past. Can we depend on President Trump to do the same?   Last week, I introduced a binding resolution that would require the  State Department to report on Turkish human rights abuses in Syria.  State's findings could have a direct bearing on arms sales to Turkey.  Meanwhile, we have additional legislation to hold Turkey accountable  that has been waiting for a vote for weeks.   But where are we? Did we pass the Risch-Menendez bill on Turkey? No.  Did we pass the House version of that legislation? No. Day after day,  week after week, we sit on our hands, too timid to act on any  legislation that might upset Erdogan while he is in town. Whatever  happened to standing up for our American values?   This weekend, National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien declared that  ``there's no place for ethnic cleansing, for war crimes in the 21st  century.'' Will President Trump deliver that message to Erdogan on  Wednesday? Will he seek to maintain any shred of dignity and U.S.  credibility on human rights issues, or will he let Erdogan engage in  these horrific human rights issues without consequence?   Question Number 4: Will our President stand up to Turkish aggression  against its neighbors throughout the region? Turkish naval ships  routinely violate the exclusive economic zones of Cyprus and may take  measures in Famagusta that would set the peace process on the island  back even further.   Turkey also routinely violates airspace that belongs to Greece,  brazenly disregarding Greece's sovereignty and the safety of Greek  pilots and those on the ground below.   Has President Trump uttered a word of support for our Greek friends  and NATO ally? Will he affirm America's relationship with Greece during  Erdogan's visit to the White House?   The EU has developed a sanctions framework that would address  Turkey's actions in the Cypriot Exclusive Economic Zone. Will Donald  Trump follow suit?   Question No. 5: Will our President condemn or accept Erdogan's  warming relationship with the Russian Federation?   In addition to buying the S-400, Turkey is now in talks to purchase  the Russian Sukhoi aircraft. Last week, Erdogan felt the need to  coordinate with President Putin prior to coming to the United States.  According to Reuters, he said he would hold a phone call with the  Russian President over the weekend to ``form the basis'' of his talks  with President Trump.   Imagine this, a NATO ally--NATO comprised primarily to defend against  the Russian Federation--a NATO ally going to have conversations with  Putin to form the basis of his conversation with President Trump. Aside  from perhaps Hungary, I can't imagine any other leader in NATO  coordinating with Putin before a conversation with an American  President.   Some say we need to tread carefully with Turkey lest we push it into  Russia's arms. Push? It seems to me that Erdogan has jumped into  Putin's arms long ago with no provocation from us.   Question No. 6: Will President Trump call out Erdogan's assault on  the democratic process in Turkey? Will he stick up for civil society  groups, university professors, and others who have been unjustly  detained? Will he stick up for journalists there, even as he demonizes  the free press here at home? More journalists are imprisoned in Turkey  than any other country in the world--in the world.   Under article 2 of the NATO charter, member countries commit to a  certain set of democratic principles. This is the basis of the  alliance. At its core, this is why we commit to the mutual defense of  these allies. They share our values, our belief in human rights, in  human freedom, in democracy, and in the rule of law. Yet all of  Erdogan's actions over the past few years run afoul of the democratic  principles that define the NATO alliance.   I know the President does not like to stand up for democracy at home  or abroad, but I hope this meeting will be different in that he will  finally come to understand what was clear to so many Presidents before  him--Republican and Democratic alike--that how a leader treats his own  people is indicative of how they will act on the world stage. An  authoritarian at home is an authoritarian abroad, and both should  matter to the United States.   Question No. 7: Will President Trump ignore the violent attacks by  Erdogan's security detail in 2017 against peaceful protesters and DC  police? The last time Erdogan visited in 2017, his goons did just that,  resulting in criminal charges against more than half a dozen members of  his security detail.   During his meeting, President Trump should insist that Erdogan hand  over those guards implicated in the 2017 attacks. It is clear that  Erdogan's visit will again attract demonstrators and rightfully so.  While Erdogan may not believe in the right of peaceful protest in his  home country, I hope Erdogan learned his lesson that here in the United  States the right to peaceful assembly is enshrined in our Constitution  and is core to our democracy. I hope President Trump clearly reminds  him of this fact.   Question No. 8: Will President Trump accept efforts by Turkey to  convert Hagia Sophia, which was the largest Greek Orthodox Church in  the world for more than 1,000 years, into a mosque? Will he advocate  for the religious freedom of the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, who  continues to work and live under pressure from the Turkish Government?  I hear a lot about religious freedom. Well, this is one glaring example  where the administration has been silent.   Question No. 9: Will President Trump ignore Erdogan's violation of  the U.N.'s  [[Page S6514]]  arms embargo on Libya? Now, to be fair, Turkey is not the only country  funneling weapons to clients in Libya in clear violation of U.N.  Security Council Resolution 1970, but the grinding, protracted conflict  heightened by these weapons is destabilizing North Africa and allowing  for the trafficking and exploitation of desperate migrants and  refugees.   Will President Trump call on all outside powers, including Turkey, to  engage in Libya with diplomacy rather than weapons transfers and to  encourage the warring parties to find a political solution to the  conflict?   Finally, Question No. 10: Will President Trump call out Turkey's  relationship with Hamas, the Palestinian organization that continues to  terrorize Israel on a daily basis? Will he stand by our ally Israel or  will his personal interest and affinity for strong men win out once  again?   The President says he wants to put America first. Yet on every one of  these 10 issues, the President has cowered to the demands of Ankara and  Moscow.   Look, President Trump can meet with Erdogan--that is his decision and  his prerogative--but on these and so many other issues, President  Trump's actions do not represent the values of the American people or  their representatives in Congress. He does not represent those who  support holding Russia accountable. He does not represent those who  stand against war crimes in Syria. He does not represent those who want  to see a democratic Turkey.   Despite our objections, President Trump will welcome Erdogan to the  Oval Office. At the same time, it is worth pointing out that so many  months into the controversy surrounding Ukraine, President Trump has  yet to set a date for an Oval Office meeting with Ukraine's President  Zelensky.   President Zelensky is a true friend to the United States on the  frontlines of the struggle for democracy in his country. He is standing  up to Russian aggression and corruption. He is respecting the free  press. He is working to strengthen democratic institutions. President  Zelensky is everything that President Erdogan of Turkey is not. Yet it  is Turkey that President Trump continues to admire and Ukraine that he  continues to demonize.   Something is wrong here. Something is wrong. We should not have to  cross our fingers and hope that any American President stands up for  our values, holds our adversaries accountable, and does the right thing  when it matters most. It should not be a question. It should be a  given. Yet all I can do at this time is hope that President Trump will  reverse course and challenge the bad behavior of an authoritarian like  Erdogan rather than celebrate it.   With that, I yield the floor.                            ____________________
