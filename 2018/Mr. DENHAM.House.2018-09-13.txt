 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of America's Water  Infrastructure Act. This bill revitalizes our waterways, bolsters flood  protection, and ensures our channels and harbors can supply America and  the world with U.S. goods.   Most importantly, this bill includes my New WATER Act, a provision  that will help us to build new water storage in California.   The last time we built anything of substance in California for water  storage was 1979. We have waited 50 years--50 years--because we don't  have Federal financing and Federal authorization.   Finally, under this bill, the New WATER Act will set up a bank for  financing for these water storage projects, and we can finally get some  of these big reservoirs under way: Shasta, raising Shasta; building  Sites Reservoir, which has been studied for decades; building Los  Vaqueros; building Temperance Flat.   It is time to build water storage in California. We need to be  solving our own problems, and the New WATER Act helps us with that  financing.   Below-ground water storage projects, water recycling, and  desalination projects are also eligible.   We want to look at all water in California, but this allows us a  Federal financing plan to match State and local dollars as well.   Also, I included the lower San Joaquin County Army Corps chief's  report in this bill to enhance flood protection for more than 50,000  valley residents in San Joaquin County. This will reduce annual  property damage and enhance security at 262 critical infrastructure  sites, including French Camp.    French Camp will be the Army Corps' first VA project,  building a megaclinic for our veterans  [[Page H8227]]  in our local community right in this area in between Lathrop and  Manteca.   We look at revitalizing America's infrastructure. This is a  monumental step forward in America's water infrastructure, and I ask my  colleagues to support this bill.
