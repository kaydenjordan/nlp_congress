 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today with an amendment that would  prevent the Department of Labor from finalizing its recently proposed  fiduciary rule.   This proposal marks the Department of Labor's fourth attempt to issue  a fiduciary proposal. Each version of this decade-long effort has drawn  significant investor as well as bipartisan congressional concern. Most  notably, Congress passed a joint resolution I was proud to lead that  would have stopped the Obama administration's 2016 DOL fiduciary rule.   The 2016 version of the rule was vacated by the U.S. Court of Appeals  for the Fifth Circuit in 2018 due to DOL's exceeding its statutory  authority under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, ERISA, in  writing rules. This court-rejected proposal threatened access to  affordable and reliable retirement investment advice for millions of  low- and middle-income Americans.   Furthermore, this rule caused major disruptions in the market,  created more retirement insecurity, and resulted in fewer product  choices for America's workers and retirees.   The Obama administration's DOL fiduciary rule would have left  Americans who were just starting to build their retirement savings  without access to financial advice or paying more for fewer options and  decreased service. The Biden administration's fiduciary rule is no  different. As Chairwoman Foxx put it just the other day, the proposal,  ``is just new lipstick on the same old pig.''   The last time the Department of Labor meddled with the definition of  fiduciary, we watched more than 10 million Americans lose access to  financial advice.   Do we really want to go down this road again when we know exactly  where it leads?  [[Page H5813]]                                     time  1830    The changes that the Department of Labor is proposing contain overly  burdensome requirements that will increase consumer costs, limit  choices, and cut off access to financial investment products that are  known to provide a secure, guaranteed stream of income for retirees.   At the end of the day, many businesses offering these safe financial  solutions will be forced to switch to a fee-based advisory model, which  would require customers to meet account minimums or pay a large up- front fee.   Ultimately, this will shut millions of low- and middle-income  Americans out of the financial advice market, and we will be left with  two classes of investors: those who can afford investment advice and  those who cannot.   Mr. Chairman, to put it simply, Americans are worried. They are  worried about their future. They are struggling to save for their  retirement, to put a child through college, or to one day open their  own business. On top of all the existing barriers to saving, the Biden  administration wants to make that even more challenging with its--ready  for this?--500-page regulation.   We know these regulations do not work. We have seen them fail. We  have seen them hurt those who can least afford it during the savings  crisis.   Both Chambers of Congress, Republicans and Democrats, have come  together in the past to recognize the harm that this rule will have on  those looking to save for retirement.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support  this amendment that protects retail investors and America's savers, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, the changes the Department of Labor is  proposing contain overly burdensome requirements that will increase  consumer costs, limit choices, and cut off access to financial  investment products that are known to provide a secure, guaranteed  stream of income for retirees.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and shut  down the Department of Labor's fourth attempt at a fiduciary rule that  will hurt retirees and investment savers, and I yield back the balance  of my time.
