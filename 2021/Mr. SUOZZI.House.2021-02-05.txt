 Mr. Speaker, as co-chair of the Labor Caucus, I rise in  support of the National Apprenticeship Act. The Labor Caucus advocates  for America's working men and women, and this legislation helps  America's working men and women.   You see, America continues to create enormous wealth, and that is a  good thing. The problem, however, is that wealth has not been shared  with the people who go to work every day.   Since the 1980s, the Dow Jones has gone up 1,500 percent, 15 times,  and the GDP has gone up 800 percent, 8 times, but workers' wages have  increased by less than 20 percent.   Everybody in America believes, or should believe, that if you are  willing to go to work every day, you should make enough money so that  you can buy a home, have health insurance, and retire one day without  being scared. Unfortunately, that is no longer a reality in America.   We know the more you learn, the more you earn. Sixty percent of  Americans, however, do not graduate from college. Working with  President Biden, the Apprenticeship Act will make the skills necessary  to be a welder, a plumber, a computer machinist, a carpenter, or a  skilled laborer available so American working men and women, whether  they go to college or not, can live the American Dream again.
