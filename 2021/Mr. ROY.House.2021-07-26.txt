 Madam Speaker, I have been listening to my friend from  Texas, the gentleman from New York, and other speakers, my colleagues  on the other side of the aisle, and I can't help but observe the  reality of the Shelby County decision as it was offered by the United  States Supreme Court's majority authored by Chief Justice Roberts.   Now, what my colleagues on the other side of the aisle fail to  mention is the fact that the Voting Rights Act remains intact and the  Voting Rights Act remains fully in effect, and its purpose to ensure  and preserve the ability of Americans to vote remains fully the law of  the land. The core question before the Court back in 2012 or 2013--I  think it was argued in `12 and decided in `13--was whether section 5,  the specific preclearance provision, was, in fact, constitutional.   Now, the fact of the matter is when this was reauthorized back in I  think 2006, it was reauthorized based on a 50-year-old coverage  formula.   Now, my friend from Texas knows that. My colleagues on the other side  of the aisle know that it was using a 50-year-old coverage formula.  Now, people may want to just kind of sweep that aside and say that  doesn't matter, but then go back and read the Supreme Court's opinion  in 1966 on the first challenge on the Voting Rights Act and what the  Court was saying at the time, that when you set aside the fundamental  role of the States in carrying out elections, when you set aside the  10th Amendment, Madam Speaker, as the 1965 Voting Rights Act was  seeking to do, well, then there has to be a particularly strong  purpose.   What was that particularly strong purpose?   Invidious discrimination of the kind of the Jim Crow South of the  poll taxes and of massive disparities in voting rates among populations  in districts where those prohibitions existed.   Fast-forward 50 years through several iterations of the  reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act, and in 2012, 2013, when this  was being debated and when the Court decided it, the Court said: Look,  sorry, you can't apply 50-year-old data to uphold and reauthorize the  Voting Rights Act.   Now, I know that, because I was a lawyer on the Senate Judiciary  Committee, and I pored over every one of those documents that came  before us and read and reviewed them sitting as a staffer on the Senate  Judiciary Committee where we knew full well what the data was showing  us and what the data looked like. But here we are right now and the  American people are only hearing that part of the story that we are  somehow unwinding the Voting Rights Act.   We have done no such thing.    Out of enormous respect for my friend from Texas, despite  the way these hours normally work, I yield briefly to the gentlewoman  from Texas.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman. Let me just  say, I think this body would do a wonder for the American people if we  could engage in this for hours, not seconds. And I think the  gentlewoman agrees that we should have this kind of debate back and  forth so the American people can see so we can flush out our  differences, because there are things we agree on, and there are things  we disagree on.   What I would respond to the gentlewoman about the point of what  occurred, poring over it as a staffer as I did, was that the Members,  including the chairman of the Judiciary Committee then, Mr.  Sensenbrenner, as well as on the Senate side--and I won't speak for the  House, because I was on the Senate side--but I was in the room with  Chairman Specter, I was in the room with all of those that were in 2006  going through all this, and I was in the room with about 15 Republicans  who were sitting over there, each of whom said that it was  unconstitutional, we can't really do this, but we dare not go down this  political road.   Okay, well, that is what that is.   Fast-forward, and for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to  bemoan ``activist Courts,'' well, welcome to the club. Welcome to the  party of being concerned about activist Courts. I would argue this is  not activism, but, fine, let's have that debate about how much power we  want to cede to the building over there across the street, because when  we are talking about activism, we can go way back on activism in terms  of our views in terms of Roe, in terms of Planned Parenthood v. Casey,  and other areas in which the Court has inserted itself into the public  domain.   But, okay, here we are. The legislature acted, and the Court said:  Whoa, whoa, you can't do that.   Why did they do that? Applying the 10th Amendment, applying  fundamentals of federalism, and applying the fact that States have  primacy over election laws.   That is what the Court did. If you believe in judicial review  subsequent to Marbury v. Madison, as I believe my friend from Texas,  who is now leaving the floor, does believe in, well, then that is  actually what the Court was doing. That is what they did. That is what  the opinion says. When you read the opinion, Madam Speaker, it is just  dripping with all of the things that you would expect it to be filled  with in terms of deference to what occurred in 1965, what the Supreme  Court said subsequent to that about why it was in a particularly  important time for Congress to step over the role of the States because  of the nature of the invidious discrimination in Jim Crow South and  other areas of the country.    It wasn't just the South, by the way, there were counties all over  the country.   But, Madam Speaker, when you looked at the data--and I pored over the  data--we showed places there were counties in Florida that were  covered, counties in Florida that weren't covered, and you could see  that the voting rates of Black voters, Hispanic voters, and other  voters, that vast numbers of people were turning out and showing up to  vote, those numbers were even higher in some of the covered  jurisdictions.   So you had no reason or basis to cover one county versus another in  the State of Florida, Madam Speaker.   But I would challenge all of my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle to go open up those views, go look in and look at the data, look  at the tables, and what you will find, Madam Speaker, is that there  were significant numbers of counties and States that were then at that  time covered by the Voting Rights Act that had better turnout rates and  better participation rates than those that were uncovered which left  the Court looking at the law and said: Well, hold on a second.   The whole reason that the Court upheld the law was because there was  a unique circumstance where there were mass disparities because of very  direct actions by those States.  [[Page H3901]]    I want the American people to know that because that is what is being  said right now.                                time  2120    So suddenly, if I say: Hey, we might want voter ID.   Now, why might we want voter ID? Just to ensure that the one person  who is voting in one person, one vote is actually the vote.   I say I want voter ID. Maybe that is because I have witnessed reasons  why that is so. Somehow that is voter suppression?   That is what is so entirely frustrating is that you come forward and  you say: Hey, I think that there is a good reason for this that, in my  mind, I see very clearly as being important for the integrity of the  election.   Let's not get wrapped around in the 2016 or 2020 election cycles. I  have said a lot on the floor of the House at various times about those  matters. Let's just actually focus on voter integrity, election  integrity, and wanting to make sure that the people who vote know that  their vote is going to count fully, and that you are not going to have  someone voting with your ID.   We know for sure that there are individuals who come to the United  States and use the identification of others, of Americans. We know that  for sure. That is a fact.   We know that we end up with multiple people voting. We end up with  all sorts of different possible and potential fraudulent activity.   For example, The New York Times, in 2012: ``Yet, votes cast by mail  are less likely to be counted, more likely to be compromised, and more  likely to be contested than those cast in a voting booth.'' That is The  New York Times, that bastion of rightwing conspiracy.   We know that the Carter-Baker Commission, Jimmy Carter, known  rightwing conspirator from Georgia, and James Baker, again, not really  known to be a rightwing activist, quote in their report, ``Absentee  ballots remain the largest source of potential voter fraud.''   That is just data. It is just analyzing it. It is just fact.   Then, you go through other examples of known fraud.   Madam Speaker, 2016, at least 83 registered voters in San Pedro,  California, received absentee ballots at the same small two-bedroom  apartment.   In a 2018 North Carolina congressional race, a Republican operative,  L. McCrae Dowless, Jr., had allegedly requested more than 1,200  absentee ballots on voters' behalf and then collected the ballots from  voters' homes when they were mailed out. That was a Republican  operative. I am an equal opportunity presenter of the facts here of how  fraud can occur.   I can go through item after item. In 2017, an investigation of a  Dallas City Council election found 700 fraudulent mail-in ballots  signed by the same witness using a fake name.   There is other voter fraud in Texas. Since 2005, the Office of the  Attorney General successfully prosecuted 534 incidents of fraud against  155 individuals, et cetera, et cetera.   I can go through county by county. In Medina County, Texas, four  people, including an elected justice of the peace, were charged in  February with 150 counts of election fraud. The charges included ballot  harvesting and illegal voting. I can go example by example.   Now, were all of those examples I just gave enough to turn an  election? I don't know. That is the point. We would like to know  wherever that truth may lead, in whatever State and whatever county,  wherever that takes us. But those are the facts.   So, when somebody comes forward and says, ``Hey, I think we ought to  have voter ID. I think we ought to have voter ID or a way to attach an  individual to a mail-in ballot,'' suddenly that is voter suppression?  Right.   So, suddenly, Major League Baseball walks in and says: I have an  idea. Let's pull out the All-Star Game from Atlanta, Georgia, where we  could celebrate Hank Aaron in a 50 percent Black city, and let's go  move it over to Colorado, into Denver, which is a 10 percent Black  city. And let's pat ourselves on the back for being so exceptionally in  tune with what is going on in the world. Let's move the All-Star Game  to Colorado.   Why? The laws that were put on the books in Georgia this year, that  were being voted on in Georgia, would basically make parity with what  Colorado already has on the books.   This is the kind of debate we want to be able to have. Can we just,  like, all agree? Let's get a whiteboard up and put the facts up of what  these things are, what the bills are, what these laws are, and then at  least be debating from the same sheet of music.   I may have a few more things to say. I know I have some colleagues  here. I want to be mindful of their time.   I digressed there a little bit because I was hearing my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle. But election integrity is so critically  important right now, and I have colleagues from Texas who are  completely abandoning their duty--I should say State legislature  colleagues, to be clear--who are abandoning their duty to represent  their constituents in the State of Texas in the legislature and have a  full-throated debate about S.B. 1 and H.B. 3, the current bills in the  legislative session, the special session in Texas, and have come to  D.C. They are not doing their jobs.   Look, man, I generally want to flee D.C. to go back to Texas. It is  rare that I see people saying I want to flee Texas to come to D.C.   But these Democratic members of the Texas Legislature have fled  Austin to skip out on working in the Texas legislative session and have  an open debate. They are coming to D.C. to sit down with the Vice  President to go push and promote H.R. 1 or other bills to say we need  to federalize elections instead of actually doing their job, which  brings me to my point.   I will say a few things here, and then I will recognize my  colleagues. At some point, we have to decide what it is that is  actually sacred about what we are doing here as a Nation and as a body.   Our borders, right now, are wide open. Opioids are skyrocketing.  Massive numbers cross the border. I will get into some of these details  in a minute. We do it. I have done it before.    We have the schools that are teaching so-called antiracism.   I walked through the Austin airport today and saw the book by Ibram  Kendi, the antiracism book. I can't remember the title. I saw it  sitting there in the bookstore BookPeople. I didn't see a whole lot of  conservative books in there, but I saw that book, sitting there in the  front.   On page 19 of that book, he writes: ``If racial discrimination is  defined as treating, considering, or making a distinction in favor of  or against an individual based on that person's race, then racial  discrimination is not inherently racist. The defining question is  whether the discrimination is creating equity or inequity. If  discrimination is creating equity, then it is antiracist.''   Interesting definition of discrimination. Not sure that fits within  the Civil Rights Act, but I will leave that for another discussion.   But what I am saying is, we are heightening the level to which every  single aspect of our lives is taken through a political lens, every  single thing.   I am asking my staff to look at every hearing that this body has had  since the beginning of January and tell me what percentage of the  hearings has had a focus or something to do on race, on sexual  orientation, or an issue in that type of framework. I guarantee you--I  don't have to count them--that number is going to be massively high.   I will just go ahead and stipulate right now, without having done any  counting, the percentage of hearings that this body has held, the  percentage of hearings that focused on race, LGBTQ issues, sexual  orientation, those issues will be extraordinarily high as a percentage.   So, the majority believes that is where our focus should be--while we  just spent $6 trillion, while inflation is running through the roof,  while small businesses can't hire people. My colleagues on the other  side of the aisle know this because, assuredly, they have small  businesses in their district, or they go to the restaurants, or they go  to the places like I have gone to and they can't hire people because we  are paying people more not to work than to work.   We have a principal focus on race-related issues, a complete  abandonment of the responsibility of this body to secure the border of  the United States. It is wide open, opioids running amuck.  [[Page H3902]]  Cartels own it. People are pouring across it, to their detriment and  ours. Ranchers are getting overrun in Texas.   Now, today, just yesterday, or, I don't know, the last few days, the  Senate Armed Services Committee voted overwhelmingly to draft our  daughters. Heck, we had 8 Republicans of the 13 vote for that nonsense,  to draft our daughters.   Who are we? Genuine question: Who are we, as a people, as a country?  Where are the sacred boundaries of being able to decide how to live and  to recognize truths that man is man, that woman is woman, and that I,  as a father, do not want to have my daughter get drafted?   You say, well, you can draft your son, use the power of the  government to draft your son.   We can have a debate about ending the draft. Everyone comes back and  says: Well, don't worry. There is not going to be a draft. There hasn't  been a draft in 50 years, so don't worry about it.                                time  2130    What do you mean don't worry about it? When my daughter turns 18 in 8  years and she has to go sign a piece of paper to register, I shouldn't  be worried about my daughter getting drafted and getting sent to a  foxhole in Afghanistan or Iraq or somewhere else? What do you mean  don't worry about that?   Yet, that is precisely what this body is doing. The Senate Armed  Services Committee voted on it; the House already has that language.   Let me be perfectly clear. I will not be honoring whatever law says  it is drafting my daughter. That is the fundamental problem. The rule  of law depends on it being rooted in any basic understanding of who we  are as a people, where we come from, what our values are, and then  actually being able to get the consent of the governed in a way that  actually connects with the governed.   It doesn't just come on down from on high, from a Senate Armed  Services Committee that votes, by the way, behind closed doors, not in  public viewing. And by the way, none of them will go out and enforce  this garbage. But somebody one day will show up and hand a form to my  daughter and say, ``I am sorry, ma'am, you are going to have to  register for the draft.'' And I am going to be sitting there as a dad-- and I promise you, my wife is a little more fired up about this than I  am. My wife is going to be sitting there saying: ``Over my dead, dang  body.''   Now, this is what we do when we rip apart our society, when we forget  where those sacred boundaries are, about what the role of this  institution is, or how we are supposed to govern.   I am going to pause for a few moments. I think both of my colleagues  who are here wanting to speak to the issues that we are seeing unfold  in Cuba, maybe a few other matters of importance to them. I certainly  appreciate their time. I think they share some of the sentiments that I  am sharing.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas, my friend,  for his words, and I am going to yield to the gentleman from California  here in just a moment.   I would ask one question to the gentleman from Texas, and I will  repeat that question to my friend from California.   I share your enthusiasm and commitment for wanting to help the people  of Cuba who are seeking freedom and obviously have been living under  the thumb of tyranny for far too long.   I was chief of staff to Senator Ted Cruz. His father is a dear  friend, and he knew all too well what life was like under that  murderous regime.   Our friend and our colleague, Alex Mooney, his wonderful mother,  similarly, at the same rough timeframe, was subjected to the horrors of  Cuba in that time in the late fifties, early sixties, and then came to  the United States.   But I would ask my friend, that as we watch these individuals from  Cuba seeking freedom--and God bless them; we need to support them--and/ or seeking to come to the United States seeking freedom, do you believe  that our country is itself upholding and adhering to the ideals that  they are seeking?   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas. I will yield to  my friend in California in a moment.   I couldn't agree more with respect to the current situation we find  ourselves and our country in. A country where we are now talking about  vaccine passports, where we are talking about diving into the private  affairs of American citizens in the alleged name of health and welfare  of the people, we are forgetting that fundamental, core liberty of  being free from government coercion.   When you go look at the Constitution and when we talk about the  President of the United States talking about going door to door--and I  know it  [[Page H3903]]  might have been a rhetorical statement, but you never really know. But  when the Constitution contemplates going door to door, it does so only  in a couple of contexts: the Census, and then protecting individuals  against it, by, in the Third Amendment, preventing the quartering of  troops in the homes of American people; by preventing, through the  Fourth Amendment, unreasonable search and seizure.   That is what was on the minds of the Founders. That was why the  Constitution was structured the way it was structured. It wasn't to  empower government in the name of something supposedly greater, in the  ``common good.'' How many hundreds of millions of people in this world  have been slaughtered in the name of the common good? How many?                                time  2140    Let's ask the people of Cuba. Let's ask the people of Cuba, seeking  freedom, seeking to either come to the United States or have the kind  of freedom that they believe exists in the United States, and have that  in Cuba, whether we should be empowering government, supposedly in the  name of the good or the common good of the people.   Our Constitution exists to protect and preserve liberty. That is what  it exists for. That is what this country was founded upon; a belief in  the Almighty and a belief in liberty. And we are tearing that apart by  the thread. Every single day we are tearing that apart by the thread.   Even as people today right now want to have a business, be able to  employ people. They can't, because they are told by some bright-eyed  leftist: Don't worry, just pay them more money. Without any concept of  what that does to a bottom line. Without any concept what that does to  an income statement, being able to actually raise money, risk capital,  put their name on the line, borrow, and then hire people to engage in  the business of their dream.   Maybe they inherited it from their family, their parents, their  great-grandparents. What do we do? We just say: Don't worry about it,  pay them $15 an hour. Like there is some magic fairy dust that tells  people what the wage ought to be.   We destroy businesses in the name of being nice to people. You know  what it does? It limits the numbers of jobs, drives up the prices of  goods, causes people not to have jobs, causes people not to be able to  get the job, and then be able to afford whatever it is they want to  buy. All because somebody said, Oh, gee, I have got a magic number, $15  an hour.   Why not $20? Why not $50? I mean, if we are going to be all generous,  hell, just make it $1,000 an hour. Oh, no, Chip, that is just crazy  talk.   Child tax credits, why stop at $300? Modern monetary theory, just  spend whatever you want to. Why not make it $30,000? Man, then  everybody would be doing great.   My colleagues don't ever want to actually sit down and actually put  pen to paper and figure out what in the heck can we actually afford as  a country and what are we doing to the dignity of work? What are we  doing to the American family? And what are we doing to freedom and the  ability of the individual to prosper according to his or her hard work  and according to what he or she wants to accomplish in their faith and  what they want to put in, the toil they want to put in their life?   We are ripping that apart. We are ripping it apart in the name of  compassion. Just like we are ripping apart the lives of migrants in the  name of compassion, who are getting absolutely decimated by cartels. We  do it and we say: Oh, look at us, how nice we are; when the little 7- year-old girl is sold into the sex trafficking trade because we put  them in the hands of violent cartels along the border of Texas.   Does anybody care about the numbers? Does anybody look at what is  actually happening down at the border? I know, there he goes again,  there goes that crazy Chip Roy talking about the border again. Talk to  my constituents. Talk to the people of Texas, who are getting  absolutely crushed.   The numbers are astounding. We are not just talking about people and  the problems that we are having with ranchers, and we are talking about  the sex and human trafficking trade.   Right here we see the encounters by month. We have never seen  anything like this. When Jeh Johnson headed up the Department of  Homeland Security under President Obama, he said a thousand a month was  a crisis. I was just looking at the numbers. We had a few thousand in a  day just last week in the McAllen sector. We had 20,000 a week. We had  a few thousand in a day in the Laredo sector, a few thousand a day in  the McAllen sector.   We have had, I think--this is from memory--70 Border Patrol agents  get COVID in the last month. We had 20 in Laredo.   All of this is happening in real time. All while the administration  talks about unwinding title 42 and not worrying about what is happening  at our southern border while telling us and preaching to us about  vaccine passports. Oh, no, you better go mask up again.   Fentanyl. Right down here, fentanyl, 2021 versus 2020 fentanyl  numbers. We are bringing in a thousand pounds of fentanyl in a month. A  thousand pounds of fentanyl in a month. That is enough to kill millions  of people. But that is happening right now. Nobody seems to care on the  other side of the aisle. They say: Oh, don't worry, it is just  fentanyl. No problem to see here.   Would you say that to my constituent who died with a valium laced  with fentanyl recently? This is happening across the country. We are  now at 92,000 or so opioid deaths in this country. I will come back to  that in a minute, because I want to yield to my friend from California.  But that is what we are facing.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.  LaMalfa).    Would the gentleman yield for just one second?    Would it surprise the gentleman to learn that I share his  concern about the state of the United States military, given the  politically correct nature of the current leadership?   I just met with a bunch of parents of the individuals that I have  nominated to go to the academies, and these parents are beside  themselves. They are saying, please, can you stop this? It is going to  endanger my kids who are going to go serve their country at the  academies because they hear the facts. They see that the U.S. Special  Forces hired their first chief diversity officer; that the Department  of Defense just hired a chief diversity officer; that a Space Force  guardian was fired for saying the ``diversity, inclusion, and equity  industry and the trainings we're receiving in the military via that  industry are rooted in critical race theory which is rooted in  Marxism.''  [[Page H3904]]    This isn't just embarrassing and un-American. It is making us weak.  Our diplomats are apologizing to the Chinese Communist Party for racism  when Beijing is running concentration camps. This is the reality of  what we are doing to our military, where we are running ads talking  about LGBTQ issues instead of actually just recruiting warriors to go  defend the United States of America. I yield to the gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for his  words, and I appreciate the passion and the commitment to what the  gentleman just shared with not just me and with my friend from Texas,  but with the American people.   I ask the Speaker how much time I have remaining?    Madam Speaker, I appreciate my colleagues for coming down  and joining me. I would only add this: As we sit here and we hear so  much negativity about what is going on, the virus, for example, and  vaccines, we hear nothing from my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle, but everybody is stonewalling and so forth. We have administered  188 million individuals with the vaccine in this country; 340 or so  million doses. About 57 percent of the total population, about 80  percent of those over 65 have had two shots, 90 percent have had one  shot.   We are well above the vast majority of the world in terms of total  numbers. As a percentage, we are a little bit behind, because we are a  large country. When you look at what we have actually accomplished-- remember, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle who last year  were saying: This vaccine stuff, that is all fool's gold.   We know that is true. We know that is what our Vice President said,  and a lot of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle said: Don't  touch the vaccine. That is crazy stuff. Well, now, all of a sudden it  is like: You better go get the vaccine. Run and get the vaccine. You  have to get the vaccine. Get the vaccine.   Okay, I am telling my dad, a polio survivor, 78-years old: Go get the  vaccine, dad. But what if you have natural immunity? Should you go get  the vaccine? What if you are a kid? Should you go get the vaccine?  Those are questions, and they are reasonable questions.   This government, in its infinite wisdom, shut down businesses, shut  down schools, mandated masks, created all sorts of mental health  issues, prohibited people from going to get cancer screenings and take  care of themselves and their families, forced elderly couples who have  been married for 40 or 50 years not to be able to say good-bye when one  of them was passing away, all in the name of the government taking care  of us.   In the infinite wisdom of the government I should just go run down  and say: Oh, sure, let me run down and get the vaccine when how much  money has been given to the pharmaceutical companies? How many billions  of dollars are they getting, and how much do they get for the boosters?   By the way, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle were going  after the profitability of the pharmaceutical companies at an oversight  hearing that I was in last year, 2 years ago.   The bottom line here is: This country is a great country filled with  great people, doing great things, every single day, and when this body  and this government gets out of the way of the American people, they  continue to do great things. The greatness and the future of our  country lies with them and with the people.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
