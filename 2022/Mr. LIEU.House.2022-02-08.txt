 Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the life of Mr. John C.  Law, who passed away on January 20, 2022. A resident of the city of  Santa Monica, John was a beloved husband, father, and champion of  affordable, high-quality healthcare.   John dedicated his life to serving others and was a generous  philanthropist through Los Angeles County during his time on the board  of directors at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. During his tenure, John  championed efforts to bring women and people of color onto the board of  directors and to better the health and well-being of the community.   As President of the Los Angeles Free Clinic, John also worked to  improve healthcare quality, access, and outcomes for underserved  communities in the region. John also contributed to healthcare causes  and research not only through his leadership, but through his  tremendous generosity. John and his wife, Hope, made their first gift  in 1992 and contributed frequently to its prostate cancer research and  healthcare leadership funds. An accomplished businessman, John served  as president of the LA County Capital Asset Leasing Corporation and as  co-managing director of Warland Investments.   John is survived by his loving wife, Hope Warshaw, and their son,  Jack Warshaw. He had an amazing spirit that was dedicated to serving  his family and especially those most in need.   John will be greatly missed by his friends, family, and all who knew  him.                            ____________________
