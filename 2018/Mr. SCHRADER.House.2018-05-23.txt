 Mr. Speaker, the Pacific Northwest is facing an  unprecedented and growing problem of sea lions who are decimating our  endangered salmon and steelhead runs in the Columbia and Willamette  Rivers.   Right now, in front of my district office in Oregon City, there are  24 sea lions sitting at the base of Willamette Falls gorging themselves  on the spring salmon run. This is 127 miles from the Pacific Ocean,  their natural habitat.   This salmon buffet of endangered fish costs Northwest ratepayers  nearly $1 billion a year: a third of our electric bill.   We need to pass H.R. 2083, the Endangered Salmon and Fisheries  Predation Prevention Act, now. I introduced this bill, along with my  Northwest colleague, Jaime Herrera Beutler.   It will provide Oregon and Washington wildlife managers with the  tools they need, that they requested, to quickly act to remove problem  sea lions to protect these endangered fish.   If we don't act now, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife says that  there is a 90 percent chance the Willamette winter steelhead run will  go extinct in the next few years.   Mr. Speaker, it would be unconscionable to let this happen. We know  the problem, and it is identified. Let's take action.                            ____________________
