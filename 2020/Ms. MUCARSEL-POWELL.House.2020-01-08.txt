 Mr. Speaker, with the escalation of conflict in  Iran, we are currently living through uncertain times. Today and every  day the safety of Americans is my priority, and I am grateful for the  brave men and women in our armed services who put their lives on the  line for our safety.   While we are all united in supporting our troops in service, we must  always remember our veterans at home.   Throughout my district, I have heard so many stories from veterans  and their loved ones who have told me just how difficult the transition  back to civilian life can be.   Our veterans should not have to worry about putting a roof over their  family's heads, having access to quality healthcare, and obstacles to  pursuing further career opportunities.   Although we can never fully repay them for their service and  sacrifice, we must all be committed to ensuring that veterans and their  families have access to all of the benefits they have earned from their  service.   Let's not forget our troops, our veterans, and all the brave women  and men in uniform who sacrifice each day for our Nation.                            ____________________
