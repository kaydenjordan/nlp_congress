 Madam Speaker, in 1884, residents of Salem County,  south Jersey gathered at the local library with the intent of  protecting the history of the region. This group established the Salem  County Historical Society and began regular meetings all the way back  in 1885. Now the museum allows visitors to wander the exhibits and  admire the historical artifacts.   It was Albert Einstein who once said, ``learn from yesterday, live  for today, hope for tomorrow.'' It has also been said that you cannot  truly understand who you are and what you are about as a society if you  don't know who you were and where you were in the past.   It is because of the crucial role of the Salem County Historical  Society that we are better able to learn from our past in south Jersey  as we move towards a better tomorrow.   Thank you for preserving the past of south Jersey and providing  educational experiences for the members of our community. You truly are  stars.                            ____________________
