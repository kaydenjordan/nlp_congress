 Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a truly  great American, Mr. Edward C. Mahen, who unfortunately died last fall.  This was an amazing man, and he will be missed.   Mr. Mahen was a dedicated civil servant, an Air Force combat veteran,  and an extraordinary engineer with more than 50 years of service to our  country.   In 1972, Ed joined the Air Force. In Vietnam, he earned two  Distinguished Flying Crosses and eleven Air Medals flying 144 combat  missions. He retired as a colonel in 1997 after a career of assignments  in classified strategic and electronic warfare programs.   In 1998, Ed was recruited by the director of the NRO to become the  chief technology officer for the Advanced Systems and Technology  Directorate.   He was a remarkable leader. He left a legacy within the IC by hiring  and guiding a new generation of IC professionals.   May he rest in peace. May his wife and family be comforted knowing he  was a true patriot, a true friend, and one who endlessly loved his  family and this country.                            ____________________
