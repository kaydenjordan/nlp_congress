 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of  H.R. 1333, the NO BAN Act, of which I am an original cosponsor and  which passed the House earlier today. I thank and salute our good  friend Judy Chu as well as Chairman Nadler and the Speaker for their  leadership in bringing this to the floor.   This bill strengthens the Immigration and Nationality Act to prohibit  discrimination on the basis of religion and restores the separation of  powers by limiting overly broad executive actions.   President Biden's recent executive order overturned Donald Trump's  racist and discriminatory ban, but we need to ensure that broad,  xenophobic policies that are not based on actual national security  concerns do not ever go into effect again.   Make no mistake, the NO BAN Act would help ensure that this kind of  discrimination ceases, prevent future such discrimination, and promote  our Nation's core value of religious freedom.   The Muslim and African bans were an abuse of Presidential authority  and based off of hateful campaign promises. The ban separated parents  from their children and spouses from one another. This bill begins to  repair the damage of the past 4 years.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Jackson  Lee for yielding. I also was born and raised in El Paso, Texas, so I  thank my sister.   Let me say tonight that I rise to celebrate the remarkable life of  our dear friend, a dedicated public servant and a warrior for justice,  the Honorable--he truly was the Honorable--Alcee Hastings.   I thank Congresswoman Beatty for organizing this Special Order to  honor our friend this evening.   I would like to offer my deepest condolences to Congressman Hastings'  family; his wife, Patricia; his staff; all of his loved ones; his  children; and his grandchildren. I know that this loss is deeply felt,  and I am praying for the Hastings family and also for his constituents  whom I had the honor to meet during my visits to his district.   Congressman Hastings was a trailblazer, and he lived a life of firsts  as the first African-American Federal judge appointed to the State of  Florida and the first African American to lead the Helsinki Commission.   I have had the privilege to travel with Alcee to Europe several times  and to work with him to establish a transatlantic dialogue to improve  social and political inclusion of people of African descent in Europe  and the United States. This was a visionary idea that Congressman  Hastings wanted to see happen in his lifetime, and he has made so much  progress toward achieving that goal and his dream.   Alcee's political and diplomatic acumen was strengthened by his very  warm and caring spirit. Many may not be aware, but while he was  fighting the fight for human rights and democracy, he was also a  devoted caregiver to his ailing mother. When I was struggling with the  health challenges of my own beloved mother, he was there to offer  comfort and guidance. He made me realize how blessed I was to be able  to take care of her during her last years on Earth. For that I will be  deeply grateful.   When I first met Judge Hastings back in the 1980s, even before I was  an elected official, I knew I had met someone special. He gave me his  honest opinion and offered guidance without hesitation even before I  was elected to office.   Despite his no-nonsense attitude and direct nature, myself, like all  of us, had our own inside jokes. He called me Bob. I loved his socks-- like so many of us--so much so that he gave me six pairs for my  birthday. They are my Alcee socks which I will always cherish and wear.   Congressman Hastings always supported and guided me when I presented  my bills to the Rules Committee, and he encouraged me by always saying:  ``I'm with you, Bob. I'm with you, Bob.'' Even if he disagreed with my  progressive bills, he would say: ``I'm with you, Bob. I'm with you,  Bob. We are going to get this out.''   He taught me some colorful words to use during very challenging  times.   I feel beyond blessed to have known Alcee Hastings. His loss will be  felt not only in Florida, in his district, throughout the country and  here in Washington, D.C., but also around the world. He was truly a  beloved and brilliant world leader.    I am reminded of 2 Timothy 4:7. I am reminded of Alcee tonight as I  think about and read this Scripture: ``I have fought the good fight, I  have finished the race, I have kept the faith.''   Yes, our brother, our friend, our colleague, our warrior for justice  and for peace fought the good fight, and now may he rest in peace and  may he rest in power.   Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Jackson Lee for yielding and for  this Special Order tonight.
