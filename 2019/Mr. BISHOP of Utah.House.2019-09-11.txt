 Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, we are here on September 11. It is an anniversary of an  event that has been impactful for all of us and has definitely changed  our country. We cannot forget that. Hopefully, as a Nation, we can  learn from that experience and from the dedication that people gave  during and after that particular experience.   Mr. Chair, we are here in what the Democrats have called their energy  week with their energy week proposals. Their proposals are three very  disjointed bills not based on science but based on the idea of paying  off specific political interest groups for political purposes.   Earl Weaver, when he used to coach the Baltimore Orioles, loved to  bait the umpires. One time, he went out to the umpire and said: Is this  as good as it gets, or are you going to get better?   Of course, they threw him out of the game for saying that.   However, today, I want to turn to the Democrats and say: Guys, is  this as good as it gets, or are you going to get better? Because what  we have before us is not an energy policy, it is an energy nonpolicy.   When I was in college, gas was $0.25 a gallon. I remember driving my  car into those gas stations, and there would be a kid who would be my  age or younger coming out and filling up my tank, cleaning the  windshields, and checking the oil and the tires. Then, they gave me  either a plate or a towel for showing up.   I then went to Europe for 2 years, and when I came back, the oil  embargo had hit. No one came out to help me. Everything was self- service. No one gave me any more towels or dishes. Gas prices in the  embargo era were going up to the astounding almost $1.40 a gallon,  which we could not believe.   Our new President at the time put on a sweater, started a fire in the  fireplace, and came before the American people and told us, basically:  Get used to it. Live with less. Take it as an honor to be cold in the  dark. That is the process.   Fortunately, this country didn't go along with that, nor did the  industry go along with that. Instead of being a country in which we  were dependent upon OPEC countries, 60 to 70 percent of our energy  coming from OPEC--and I am sorry, that is not what an Irish chicken  does; that is a cartel. That is a cartel that was very against the  interests of the United States. Instead of being that which was in the  position to be bullied not by a major power but a secondary power into  thinking they could extort this country into changing our foreign  policy simply by exploiting our energy vulnerabilities, America  changed, and instead, we decided that would not be our policy.   We came up with a process of not only expanding our energy production  in the United States, but we expanded it in a way that produced energy  more efficiently; that used it in a cleaner fashion; that used a  smaller footprint to do it; that made us energy independent to the  point where we could be, instead of an importing country, an exporting  country in the concept of energy; and that energy was used not only to  support the United States' independence but also to support our allies  and be able to confront negative forces like Russia, which was using  energy as a political weapon and still would like to use energy as a  political weapon.   Now, we are faced with three bills here today, one much different  than the other two. But the end result of the Democratic vision of  energy presented to us in this energy week is basically to use the  rearview mirror and take us backward 50 years into the past, where we  go back to the time when our economy was fragile, and our enemies  thought they could take advantage of our energy dependency, and they  could do that to bully the United States.   That is not what the process should be in creating an energy future  for this particular country.   Mr. Chair, we have three bills that will be before us today. None of  them are scientifically grounded. All of them are actually political,  paying off political experts, taking science and basically throwing it  in the trash and saying okay--which the majority can do. They have the  votes to do it but don't have the audacity to stand up and say this  administration or this side of the aisle doesn't believe in science  because these particular issues are politically motivated.    There is no logic to what we are doing. In our committee, it was  wonderful. We had the entire committee on the same day that the first  bill was voted out also voting for LWCF. Everyone loved the Land and  Water Conservation Fund, so we wanted to make this permanent. We wanted  to triple the amount of money that we were putting into that fund. At  the same time that we voted to triple the amount of money in that fund,  we also voted for bills that would basically cut the revenues from  those areas that produce the money to go into the fund in the first  place, and we call that logical.   I call this hypocrisy as well because there is the vested interest,  as the majority here was saying, that Governors in their States should  have the ability to make decisions on Federal waters that are not  within the boundaries of their States but in the same breath saying  that Governors in the interior States should not have the ability to  have decisions made on Federal lands within our States.   I am sorry. That is pure hypocrisy.   This is a lack of focus. It is a lack of focus when, a year ago, the  Democratic leadership asked the President to find a way to cut down the  cost of energy, oil and gas, to use his personal contacts to cut down  the cost of that, and then we are bringing bills in here today that  will drive up the costs, which will cut down our possibility of doing  that in the future.   You can do it, but there is a hypocrisy to the very essence of what  is going on.   Unfortunately, the three bills that will be thrown out here today by  the  [[Page H7608]]  Democrats as their policy will have the net effect of destroying jobs  and harming our economy, potentially turning us to an economic  tailspin. That can happen.   More importantly, it is nice to have a visual contrast, because this  morning, Republican leaders, led by Mr. Scalise and Ms. Cheney and  several others, introduced a comprehensive energy package, an energy  package that is for all energy, all of the above, both fossil fuel and  alternative, one that will grow our economy, which will create more  jobs, which will give a logical standard of what we should do going  forward with a clear view.   The clear view of what Republicans would like to do with having a  logical, comprehensive approach is in vast contrast to three  disjointed, dispirited, nonscientific bills that simply want to pay off  political communities.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from South Carolina (Mr. Duncan), who has unusual socks on today and  who has been through these wars before.                                time  1245     Mr. Chairman, once again, I appreciate the  opportunity to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.  Tipton), someone who realizes that not only does the base bill stop  drilling, but if you add one of the amendments they have, you are going  to stop any kind of seismic activity that would allow alternative  activity to be developed in these sources, as well.    Mr. Chairman, I am happy to yield 2 minutes to  the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Cline), our new Member in his first  term here.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. Bost), who happens to be the Republican co-chair of  the House Congressional Steel Caucus.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I continue to reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a Statement of Administrative  Policy, which indicates the President's advisers would recommend a veto  of this particular bill in the unlikely event that it will actually be  considered by the Senate, but, Mr. Chair, you can bet your Social  Security payments it won't be.                     Statement of Administration Policy     H.R. 205--Protecting and Securing Florida's Coastline Act of 2019--                  (Rep. Rooney, R-FL, and 18 cosponsors)    H.R. 1146--Arctic Cultural and Coastal Plain Protection Act--(Rep.                     Huffman, D-CA, and 182 cosponsors)       H.R. 1941--Coastal and Marine Economies Protection Act--(Rep.                    Cunningham, D-SC, and 51 cosponsors)         The Administration opposes H.R. 205, the Protecting and       Securing Florida's Coastline Act of 2019, H.R. 1146, the       Arctic Cultural and Coastal Plain Protection Act, and H.R.       1941, the Coastal and Marine Economies Protection Act. These       bills would undermine the Administration's commitment to a       prosperous American economy supported by the responsible use       of the Nation's abundant natural resources. Development of       our resources enhances our energy security and energy       dominance, and produces high-paying American jobs; provides       increased revenue to the Treasury, States, tribes, and local       communities; and is a critical source of conservation       funding.        H.R. 1146 would prohibit the Department of the Interior's       Bureau of Land Management from administering an oil and gas       leasing program in the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National       Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska. The bill would repeal a       provision of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that directed       the Secretary of the Interior to establish a program for the       development of the Coastal Plain that would allow the use of       no more than about 0.01 percent of the total acreage of ANWR       for surface development of production and support facilities.       The Administration supports environmentally responsible       energy development in the Coastal Plain, also known as the       1002 Area, of ANWR. Such development is expected to increase       America's energy security and independence, create jobs, and       provide affordable, reliable energy for consumers while       providing much-needed revenue to both the State of Alaska and       the Federal Government.        Similarly, H.R. 205 and H.R. 1941 would both restrict       future oil and gas development in the Federal waters of the       U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). H.R. 205 would amend the       Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act (GOMESA) to make permanent       the current temporary leasing moratorium on offshore leasing       in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, off the west coast of Florida.       H.R. 1941 would amend the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act       (OCSLA) to permanently remove from consideration acreage for       offshore leasing on both the Atlantic and Pacific OCS. Both       of these bills would undermine OCSLA, which established a       periodic, multi-stage planning process involving State and       tribal consultation and a thoughtful comparison and balancing       of the benefits and impacts to all the regions of the OCS.       These bills would permanently constrain this careful       administrative process. Under the bills, large swaths of the       OCS would be off limits for resource development without the       benefit of periodic assessments of the potential economic,       social, and environmental effects of development, as required       by existing law. Excluding these areas from leasing       consideration could place more pressure for development on       other OCS areas and constrain our ability to meet national       energy needs as required by OCSLA.        Additionally, each of these bills would eliminate the       potential for future direct revenue that would otherwise be       provided to the Treasury, and through revenue sharing, to the       States, tribes, and counties where the development activities       occur. In Fiscal Year  [[Page H7613]]       2018, energy development on Federal and Indian lands and       waters generated approximately $9 billion in direct revenue       from royalties, bonus bids, and rents. Of that revenue, $1.78       billion was disbursed to 35 States. The top States receiving       Fiscal Year 2018 revenues were New Mexico ($634.9 million);       Wyoming ($563.9 million); Colorado ($112.5 million);       Louisiana ($91 million); and Utah ($76 million).       Additionally, more than $1 billion was disbursed to Indian       tribes and individual Indian mineral owners; $1.22 billion to       the Reclamation Fund; $970 million to the Land and Water       Conservation Fund (LWCF); $150 million to the Historic       Preservation Fund; and $3.5 billion to the general fund of       the Treasury.        Prohibiting energy development in new Federal areas would       hinder future administrations' efforts to make up for revenue       lost as production declines from leases in aging energy       fields. Such restrictions will tie the hands of future       administrations and reduce their ability to enhance energy       security through strong domestic energy production and to       ensure affordable energy for American families.        If these bills were presented to the President, his       advisors would recommend he veto them.    Mr. Chair, I also include in the Record a letter  of strong opposition to the bill by over 20 entities, including the  U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Consumer Energy Alliance, and a letter in  opposition from the Laborers' International Union of North America.                                                  September 5, 2019.      U.S. Congress,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: We rely on American made energy to       power our daily lives, communities and to grow a more       prosperous future. Americans deserve clean, safe, reliable,       abundant and affordable energy so that our families,       communities and businesses can all share the opportunities       American energy creates. Our country cannot afford to block       access to new energy supplies and risk losing our energy       advantage. That's why we ask you to oppose legislation being       considered by the U.S. House of Representatives next week       that would slow scientific surveys and prevent access to new       sources of American offshore energy in the Outer Continental       Shelf.        For more than seven decades, energy development in the Gulf       of Mexico has worked collaboratively alongside tourism,       fishing and Defense Department training activities. But H.R.       205 would permanently extend the eastern Gulf of Mexico       moratorium on oil and natural gas activities. The       Congressional Budget Office conservatively estimates that       this could cost taxpayers $400 million in revenue over the       next 10 years. Similarly, H.R. 1941 would block offshore       energy development in the Pacific and Atlantic planning       areas, and H.R. 1146 would lock up energy resources in the       Alaskan Coastal Plain.        Congress should support progress. Modern energy       technologies have enabled an impressive record of       environmental stewardship and innovation. But when the       government chooses to arbitrarily and permanently close off       areas to exploration and potential development, we simply       increase our dependency on foreign sources. This reality is       visible in places like California and Massachusetts. Despite       abundant offshore oil and natural gas resources, California       imports 57 percent of its oil supply, a staggering 37 percent       of which comes from Saudi Arabia. Meanwhile, to meet energy       needs each winter, Massachusetts imports liquefied natural       gas from Russia.        American energy is produced with a smaller carbon footprint       under significantly stronger environmental protections than       energy produced anywhere else in the world. We ask you to       embrace these homegrown opportunities that benefit American       families, create high-wage jobs, strengthen the U.S. economy       and protect our environment.        Next week, the House of Representatives is expected to       consider legislation undercutting domestic energy security       and economic opportunity by limiting American energy access.       We urge you to reject these bills and instead stand up for       energy produced in America, by American workers for the       benefit of American families.            Sincerely,        American Chemistry Council, American Council of Engineering       Companies, American Forest & Paper Association, American Gas       Association, American Iron and Steel Institute, American       Petroleum Institute, American Pipeline Contractors       Association, Consumer Energy Alliance, Distribution Pipeline       Contractors Association, Energy Equipment and Infrastructure       Alliance, Independent Petroleum Association of America.        International Association of Drilling Contractors,       International Association of Geophysical Contractors,       Laborers' International Union of North America, National       Association of Manufacturers, National Ocean Industries       Association, National Utility Contractors Association,       Offshore Marine Service Association, Portland Cement       Association, Power and Communication Contractors Association,       U.S. Chamber of Commerce, U.S. Oil and Gas Association.                                   ____                                                  September 9, 2019.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader McCarthy: On behalf       of the 500,000 members of the Laborers' International Union       of North America (LIUNA), I want to express our opposition to       H.R. 205, which would permanently extend the moratorium on       oil and gas leasing in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico; H.R. 1146,       to once again prohibit oil and gas drilling in the Arctic       National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR); and, H.R. 1941, which would       bar offshore drilling along the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts.        Once again, jobs of LIUNA members who work in the energy       sector are being targeted for elimination by environmental       radicals for purely political purposes. There is absolutely       no chance for these ``message bills'' to be enacted into law       this Congress. So, instead of working to enact real job       creating infrastructure legislation, union members see their       jobs once again being denigrated and belittled.        Energy independence is central to the future of the       American economy and our standard of living. Unfortunately,       the enemies of job creation continue to try to wall off and       strand our domestic energy resources from development;       killing jobs, prolonging our energy dependence on unfriendly       foreign regimes, and saddling middle-class and lower-income       families with rising energy costs.        LIUNA members, in Alaska and elsewhere, know first-hand       that when done responsibly, with union-trained workers,       energy development can coexist with environmental       stewardship. LIUNA and the other building trades unions       invest significant resources into the training of our members       that help develop the knowledge and skills they need to work       safely and productively while constructing energy and other       infrastructure to the highest standards.        For the hard-working members of LIUNA and other building       trades unions, these jobs put food on their families' tables       and roofs over their heads. These jobs enable them to put       their children through college, to save for retirement, and       to spend money in business establishments that employ others.        I urge you to vote against these ill-conceived bills.        With kind regards, I am            Sincerely yours,                                                  Terry O'Sullivan,                                                 General President.     Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    If the gentleman asks nicely.   Yes. I am waiting for one more speaker coming over who may or may not  be here.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Arizona (Mr. Gosar), who is head of the Congressional Western  Caucus and a valuable member of our committee.    Mr. Chair, I have no further speakers, and I am  ready to close.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, I appreciate the concern that the gentleman from  California (Mr. Lowenthal) has for the LWCF.   The issue though at hand is not necessarily what we have been  appropriating for LWCF. The issue at hand is that you want to triple  that amount.   If you are actually going to cut the potential revenue that is going  to come from these areas, don't ask to triple it at the same time. And  I would still ask you--and remind you--I have got a park backlog bill  that I want to have funded here. Don't take those funds away from the  park maintenance backlog. That is far more significant than what we are  talking about.   But the real issue we are having here is a difference in the approach  to the country's energy solutions, our future. You have three  disjointed bills, none of them based on science--a lot of them based on  mythology that we have heard here today, none of them scientifically  based--but they are here in an isolated way, which the whole goal is to  cut stuff. Let's just not produce.   Now, at least when Jimmy Carter put on that sweater and started the  fire and he talked to the American people, he was at least honest  enough with them to say, You are going to have to lower your  expectations. You won't be able to live the lifestyle you want to have  in the future.   At no time has anyone who is purporting this type of an approach that  has been pushed by the Democrats talked about lowering or being willing  to lower their thermostats in the winter or cut down on their air- conditioning in the summer, or stop driving their boats as often as  they want to, or no longer going on planes, trains, and automobiles.   Now, they just expect--miraculously--energy to be produced by other  areas that they can then enjoy it in some particular way. That is not a  logical approach. It can be done, but it is not a logical approach. It  doesn't just miraculously happen.   The difference is, what the Republicans have placed on the table  today is an overall approach to energy, a comprehensive approach to  energy. Not just a comprehensive approach of how we build on our fossil  fuels, but also how we build alternative energy and how we involve the  States in that concept, because every State has a different  requirement, a different initiative, and a different need. And we are  trying to do that, not some one-size-fits-all blanket approach as we  are going to have in this bill and the third bill that we will actually  have tomorrow.   The approach the Democrats are doing is saying we won't develop  American sources because we might spill. Instead, we will try to rely  on, maybe, them coming from somewhere else. Some of our colleagues have  already talked about how the Russians are already importing into  Boston. How California is already getting 57 percent of its energy  coming from Saudi Arabia, and they come in tankers.   And, Mr. Chairman, the problem is that we fail to realize, if you  really want to have a higher mathematical possibility of oil spills, it  is significantly higher when it comes from tankers than it is if we do  our own drilling.   So not only are we not talking about being self-sufficient, not only  are we not talking about now trying to be a source of support for our  allies, not only are we not trying to be somewhere where we can be a  major player in this world, we are going to cut back automatically and  actually make a greater risk in the process of doing it.   This is a silly approach, and it contrasts specifically with what we  are attempting to do. We can have jobs and we can have a future. And we  can have a country that will no longer be bullied by other countries,  seeing that we are energy-weak, if we approach it the way the  Republicans want to approach it.   But if we still do this disjointed, dispirited, nonscientific  approach based on more myth than reality, then, actually, we are going  in the opposite direction.   The Democrats in their energy-weakness, would march us back 50 years  to a time when America was much more fragile and in which second-rate  powers thought they could bully us into submission simply by taking  advantage of our lack of a strong, coherent energy policy. And that is  what Republicans do not want to see happen again.   And that is why I would urge you all to look at the bill that was  introduced today--the Republican approach to it. That is the way of the  future.   It is bright. It is big. It is positive. It moves us forward. Not  what we are doing today with a bunch of bills that piece-by-piece take  us back from where we came, and we should never return again.   Mr. Chairman, with that, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    This amendment is perhaps well-intentioned. I am  going to make that assumption. But the problem with this amendment is  it is not a comprehensive amendment.   The goal of this amendment is to specifically illustrate what kinds  of issues will be studied by this GAO report, and they are all the  negative aspects that could come from this report.   There is no aspect here, I mean, it neglects totally to try and set  any kind of benefits that would happen from development of oil or gas  consumer. Now, that would be a true study. That would be a fair study.  That would be a good study. That would be a valuable study.   What this has done, in a statement of what will be considered,  basically skewed what the GAO will do, so you have come up with a  predetermined outset. We can predict exactly what will come out from  this study because it is not comprehensive and it hasn't tried to be  inclusive.   What you should have done is simply direct the GAO to evaluate how  taking resources off the table like this will affect our dependence on  imports from foreign actors like Russia, whose environmental standards,  whose efficiency standards, and whose human rights standards certainly  are unacceptable to us in the United States. Doing so--if you had done  that, that would have been a comprehensive, that would have been an  accurate representation, and that would have been a good and decent  study.   So I oppose this particular amendment because I think it missed the  mark.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, in the original speech the  gentleman from Rhode Island said he yielded back the balance of his  time. Had he not yielded in the first speech?    I am sorry. Had that actually been said after the  first speech, I would have reserved. But I have yielded back. I am done  with this. Unless you really want to go on, I would urge the gentleman  to yield back and we will go on with the vote.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I guess kind of in opposition. It  really is not in opposition to the amendment in and of itself, except  it illustrates some of the problems the Democrats have in creating this  approach to an energy policy coming through here, because the  inspection fees that we have mandated by the amendment, if you tack it  on to the bill itself, really are based on politics and not the cost of  the administration of this particular inspection. In fact, it actually  no longer becomes a cost of a service; it actually becomes a tax levied  on the committee.   What it illustrates is a deeper problem on how the Democrats decided  to put these three bills up here on their energy week, and it also  maybe indicates why they don't really expect it to go any further,  because the offsets are so bizarre.   In each of the bills, the Democrats have decided to use--the rules  require an offset. In each of the bills, there is a different offset  that is required. For the one that we will talk about tomorrow, it is  going to be $900 million. I think this one is $400 million. The next  one is $200 million. And in each bill, the Democrats have decided to  use the same offset to pay for each bill.   Now, ironically, if you did the one tomorrow and then you paid for  the bill with that offset, then you would have taken that off the  table. But that is not good enough here. Now we are using that same  offset money to pay for this particular bill.   I am sorry. This is simply an accounting smoke and mirrors trick that  is being used by the Democrats to actually get these three bills onto  the floor. For that, I don't really mind it, per se, because it doesn't  affect the impact of it, but it is a sneaky way of trying to cover the  bases and check the boxes and using money in double and triple amounts.   If this offset is actually the way we are doing offsets in the  future, then my parks bill doesn't have a problem going forward because  we can use this money for that at the same time.   Although, it is ironic that the money that they are going to use to  offset these bills will be reduced because you are stopping the energy  production in all of these areas. Everything comes together in some  particular way.   This is cute. This is not necessarily effective, but it is cute, and  it is not the way the rules for offsets were intended to try and bring  clarity to the situation within the House.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I will make it easier for him.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I am opposed to this amendment  simply because the seismic activity that we are talking about has not  been updated since the 1980s. So the biggest problem we have in here  is, if you are going to do it with the Atlantic, you are doing this in  the darkness of not actually understanding or knowing what the  scientific results will be, and this will eliminate that permanently.   So the technology for seismic studies has improved significantly over  the years and is getting better at all times, but now we have a  situation where the underlying bill stopped production on these lands,  and this amendment would stop any scientific study to know what we  could have done or what we should do at this time.   But it is a little bit more insidious than that because this  amendment only stops seismic study for oil and gas development; it  doesn't stop seismic study for anything else.   So, if, indeed, the argument is that the seismic study hurts the  animals, that Flipper is offended by these seismic studies, all this  amendment does is say Flipper can be offended and harmed if you are  going to put in a windmill, but Flipper can't be offended and harmed if  you are going to put in an oil rig. And no one really knows, because we  won't do the study, whether Flipper is going to be offended. For all we  know, Flipper is out there laughing at us right now for going through  this silly exercise.   But this amendment is not comprehensive, it doesn't meet the need,  and it stops us once again from doing any science to know about it. So  once again, this bill, these approaches, this is politics. This is not  science. This is pure politics. For that reason, I oppose the  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume  to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Once again, as we talk about seismic, realize there is a different  approach to it. Not this administration, but the prior administration  said there is no scientific policy that says any seismic study actually  hurts any of the animals, whether it is for fossil fuels or it is for  alternative types of energy.   But the issue at hand is, if you are going to try and deny any  seismic so you don't have any studies and we are going to go in the  darkness and not really know what we are talking about, then you do it  for everything. To try and distinguish between oil and gas and  alternatives is simply an arbitrary reason that has no purpose in being  there.   However, if the underlying bill passes and you are not going to be  drilling  [[Page H7621]]  there anyway--in which case we basically say as a Congress we don't  care about understanding what we are doing, we are just thinking it is  the right thing to do, so we will go ahead and do it--this is bad  policy. It is bad policy for the underlying bill. It is bad policy for  the amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, clearly, the best thing that can be  said about this amendment is it is the last one of this particular  bill, and we can move on.   The negative part that I have to say about this amendment is the same  thing I said about the other amendments. It is a study that is halfway  there; it is not comprehensive; it doesn't cover all elements that  should be studied; and in fact, it will produce a skewed result because  of what narrowly comes within it.   There should be a study that says what jobs will or will not happen  from this. That would be a study. That would be a portion of it that  would be worth it. But it is not covered in what we are attempting to  do here.   In fact, if you think about it, this is kind of a bizarre approach to  things. We already have a base bill to be passed that will ban this  activity, and then we are going to institute a whole bunch of studies  to see if we should have done the base bill in the first place. This is  totally backward in the way bills should be done.   If the gentleman really believed in the study and wanted to get the  data, for heaven's sake, do that before introducing a bill that bans  the activity in the first place.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, once again, same thing: It is  superfluous.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, we have three bills in this package of supposed  Democrat energy. This is different than the other time.   In the last bill we were talking about here on the floor--at least  the five people who actually were here on the floor to talk about it-- that was an ideological approach. This is different. This deals with  the military. This deals with military issues on water that is  legitimately put off limits for its military purpose.   There are military bases of significance in Florida, specifically  Eglin. There is a military test and training range on the waters in  Florida. They are significant, they are important, and, indeed, they  need to be preserved for our military.   If, indeed, the military has an area that is essential to military  preparedness and readiness, we should be cognizant of that. There is no  problem with that. The problem was in this military line, it was simply  arbitrarily drawn.   You take the latitude and the longitude and you just go down the  line, which means the line, itself, is bizarre and arbitrary. The line,  itself, is actually closer to New Orleans than it is to Florida. The  line, itself, has a greater impact on the economies of Alabama,  Mississippi, and Louisiana than it does in Florida.   What we should have done, were we wise in this process, is to try to  seek some kind of variance to make sure that the science was actually  used and that we don't just take a ruler and draw a straight line on  some map. Already in the areas that are west of this line--the other  things that are already open for oil and gas exploration--there is  cooperation between the Interior Department and the Department of  Defense in how you do it.    Thirty-six percent of all the drilling that is done in the rest of  the Gulf is already under some kind of stipulation with the Department  of Defense. In fact, there is a memo of understanding between the  Department of Defense and the Department of the Interior that has been  there since 1983 which mandates they cooperate and they consult and  they work through these things in an appropriate way.   Were something like that to be part of this bill, I know I could  support it. And to everyone else who is on the floor, I would argue to  do the same thing. The sad part is this bill doesn't do that. Instead,  it simply locks up the issue on the one line that happens to be there.   Now, here is where I don't blame anyone seated on the floor, the six  of us who actually are here. I do blame the Rules Committee.   The Rules Committee made a very bad rule and abused some of the  powers that the Rules Committee has to deal with it. Not only did they  make several amendments self-executing--and, I am sorry. I was on the  Rules Committee for a long time. I thought when we did that, that was  lousy policy. But it was also lousy policy in this rule to make some of  the amendments self-executing.  [[Page H7624]]    But then they forgot other amendments that could have brought  something into conclusion so that we could simply say, if there is a  military reason, then, yes, and allow the military to make that  decision. That would have been something I would have bought, and I  would have been happy to support this particular bill.   But instead, the Rules Committee insisted that there be miscellaneous  amendments that have nothing to do brought up here and that have  nothing to do to try to bring some kind of cooperation together.   So we are now faced with a bill that will be done on an arbitrary  standard without study. It will be done on an arbitrary line without  science being given to it. It will be an arbitrary line that will  simply call everything out simply because somebody drew a line on a map  without thinking about it.   It did not have to be that way. That is the sad part about this  particular bill.   I respect the sponsor of this particular bill. I respect what he is  trying to do. I agree with most of what he is trying to do. But this  could have been a much better bill. This could have been a bill that I  could support and I think most other people could support and we could  move forward, that would have a much better option and chance of actual  passage in the Senate as well as passage by a President who would sign  it, rather than actually putting forth an SAP which indicates that he  would be advised to veto it. That did not have to happen.   The reason it is not happening in a better way is simply because the  Rules Committee refused some of the options that were in front of them,  and they should have done it. They could have done it, and it would be  a much better situation than what they had done.   So, in this situation, because we now have a bill which, once again,  takes science and throws it into the trash can like the other bill did  and like the next one tomorrow will do, I have a bill here which I have  to oppose, and it did not have to be that way in the long run.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from South Carolina (Mr. Duncan).    Madam Chairwoman, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Johnson).    Madam Chair, I appreciate the last gentleman's  statements. He may remember he still has the land range in Utah to use.   Madam Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  McClintock).    Madam Chair, I include in the Record a Statement  of Administrative Policy on this particular bill.                     Statement of Administration Policy   H.R. 205--Protecting and Securing Florida's Coastline Act of 2019--Rep.                      Rooney, R-FL, and 18 cosponsors     H.R. 1146--Arctic Cultural and Coastal Plain Protection Act--Rep.                     Huffman, D-CA, and 182 cosponsors       H.R. 1941--Coastal and Marine Economies Protection Act--Rep.                    Cunningham, D-SC, and 51 cosponsors         The Administration opposes H.R. 205, the Protecting and       Securing Florida's Coastline Act of 2019, H.R. 1146, the       Arctic Cultural and Coastal Plain Protection Act, and H.R.       1941, the Coastal and Marine Economies Protection Act. These       bills would undermine the Administration's commitment to a       prosperous American economy supported by the responsible use       of the Nation's abundant natural resources. Development of       our resources enhances our energy security and energy       dominance, and produces high-paying American jobs; provides       increased revenue to the Treasury, States, tribes, and local       communities; and is a critical source of conservation       funding.        H.R. 1146 would prohibit the Department of the Interior's       Bureau of Land Management from administering an oil and gas       leasing program in the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National       Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska. The bill would repeal a       provision of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that directed       the Secretary of the Interior to establish a program for the       development of the Coastal Plain that would allow the use of       no more than about 0.01 percent of the total acreage of ANWR       for surface development of production and support facilities.       The Administration supports environmentally responsible       energy development in the Coastal Plain, also known as the       1002 Area, of ANWR. Such development is expected to increase       America's energy security and independence, create jobs, and       provide affordable, reliable energy for consumers while       providing much-needed revenue to both the State of Alaska and       the Federal Government.        Similarly, H.R. 205 and H.R. 1941 would both restrict       future oil and gas development in the Federal waters of the       U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). H.R. 205 would amend the       Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act (GOMESA) to make permanent       the current temporary leasing moratorium on offshore leasing       in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, off the west coast of Florida.       H.R. 1941 would amend the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act       (OCSLA) to permanently remove from consideration acreage for       offshore leasing on both the Atlantic and Pacific OCS. Both       of these bills would undermine OCSLA, which established a       periodic, multi-stage planning process involving State and       tribal consultation and a thoughtful comparison and balancing       of the benefits and impacts to all the regions of the OCS.       These bills would permanently constrain this careful       administrative process. Under the bills, large swaths of the       OCS would be off limits for resource development without the       benefit of periodic assessments of the potential economic,       social, and environmental effects of development, as required       by existing law. Excluding these areas from leasing       consideration could place more pressure for development on       other OCS areas and constrain our ability to meet national       energy needs as required by OCSLA.        Additionally, each of these bills would eliminate the       potential for future direct revenue that would otherwise be       provided to the Treasury, and through revenue sharing, to the       States, tribes, and counties where the development activities       occur. In Fiscal Year 2018, energy development on Federal and       Indian lands and waters generated approximately $9 billion in       direct revenue from royalties, bonus bids, and rents. Of that       revenue, $1.78 billion was disbursed to 35 States. The top       States receiving Fiscal Year 2018 revenues were New Mexico       ($634.9 million); Wyoming ($563.9 million); Colorado ($112.5       million); Louisiana ($91 million); and Utah ($76 million).       Additionally, more than $1 billion was disbursed to Indian       tribes and individual Indian mineral owners; $1.22 billion to       the Reclamation Fund; $970 million to the Land and Water       Conservation Fund (LWCF); $150 million to the Historic       Preservation Fund; and $3.5 billion to the general fund of       the Treasury.        Prohibiting energy development in new Federal areas would       hinder future administrations' efforts to make up for revenue       lost as production declines from leases in aging energy       fields. Such restrictions will tie the hands of future       administrations and reduce their ability to enhance energy       security through strong domestic energy production and to       ensure affordable energy for American families.        If these bills were presented to the President, his       advisors would recommend he veto them.    Madam Chair, I include in the Record a letter in  strong opposition to the bill signed by over 20 entities, including the  U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Consumer Energy Alliance, and the  Laborers' International Union of North America, and a letter in  opposition from the Laborers' International Union of North America.                                                 September 5, 2019.      U.S. Congress,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: We rely on American made energy to       power our daily lives, communities and to grow a more       prosperous future. Americans deserve clean, safe, reliable,       abundant and affordable energy so that our families,       communities and businesses can all share the opportunities       American energy creates. Our country cannot afford to block       access to new energy supplies and risk losing our energy       advantage. That's why we ask you to oppose legislation being       considered by the U.S. House of Representatives next week       that would slow scientific surveys and prevent access to new       sources of American offshore energy in the Outer Continental       Shelf.        For more than seven decades, energy development in the Gulf       of Mexico has worked collaboratively alongside tourism,       fishing and Defense Department training activities. But H.R.       205 would permanently extend the eastern Gulf of Mexico       moratorium on oil and natural gas activities. The       Congressional Budget Office conservatively estimates that       this could cost taxpayers $400 million in revenue over the       next 10 years. Similarly, H.R. 1941 would block offshore       energy development in the Pacific and Atlantic planning       areas, and H.R. 1146 would lock up energy resources in the       Alaskan Coastal Plain.        Congress should support progress. Modern energy       technologies have enabled an impressive record of       environmental stewardship and innovation. But when the       government chooses to arbitrarily and permanently close off       areas to exploration and potential development, we simply       increase our dependency on foreign sources. This reality is       visible in places like California and Massachusetts. Despite       abundant offshore oil and natural gas resources, California       imports 57 percent of its oil supply, a staggering 37 percent       of which comes from Saudi Arabia. Meanwhile, to meet energy       needs each winter, Massachusetts imports liquefied natural       gas from Russia.        American energy is produced with a smaller carbon footprint       under significantly stronger environmental protections than       energy produced anywhere else in the world. We ask you to       embrace these homegrown opportunities that benefit American       families, create high-wage jobs, strengthen the U.S. economy       and protect our environment.        Next week, the House of Representatives is expected to       consider legislation undercutting domestic energy security       and economic  [[Page H7628]]       opportunity by limiting American energy access. We urge you       to reject these bills and instead stand up for energy       produced in America, by American workers for the benefit of       American families.            Sincerely,        American Chemistry Council, American Council of Engineering       Companies, American Forest & Paper Association, American Gas       Association, American Iron and Steel Institute, American       Petroleum Institute, American Pipeline Contractors       Association, Consumer Energy Alliance, Distribution Pipeline       Contractors Association, Energy Equipment and Infrastructure       Alliance, Independent Petroleum Association of America.        International Association of Drilling Contractors,       International Association of Geophysical Contractors,       Laborers' International Union of North America, National       Association of Manufacturers, National Ocean Industries       Association, National Utility Contractors Association,       Offshore Marine Service Association, Portland Cement       Association, Power and Communication Contractors Association,       U.S. Chamber of Commerce, U.S. Oil and Gas Association.                                   ____                                                            LiUNA,                                  Washington, DC, September 9, 2019.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader McCarthy: On behalf       of the 500,000 members of the Laborers' International Union       of North America (LiUNA), I want to express our opposition to       H.R. 205, which would permanently extend the moratorium on       oil and gas leasing in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico; H.R. 1146,       to once again prohibit oil and gas drilling in the Arctic       National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR); and, H.R. 1941, which would       bar offshore drilling along the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts.        Once again, jobs of LiUNA members who work in the energy       sector are being targeted for elimination by environmental       radicals for purely political purposes. There is absolutely       no chance for these ``message bills'' to be enacted into law       this Congress. So, instead of working to enact real job       creating infrastructure legislation, union members see their       jobs once again being denigrated and belittled.        Energy independence is central to the future of the       American economy and our standard of living. Unfortunately,       the enemies of job creation continue to try to wall off and       strand our domestic energy resources from development;       killing jobs, prolonging our energy dependence on unfriendly       foreign regimes, and saddling middle-class and lower-income       families with rising energy costs.        LiUNA members, in Alaska and elsewhere, know first-hand       that when done responsibly, with union-trained workers,       energy development can coexist with environmental       stewardship. LiUNA and the other building trades unions       invest significant resources into the training of our members       that help develop the knowledge and skills they need to work       safely and productively while constructing energy and other       infrastructure to the highest standards.        For the hard-working members of LiUNA and other building       trades unions, these jobs put food on their families' tables       and roofs over their heads. These jobs enable them to put       their children through college, to save for retirement, and       to spend money in business establishments that employ others.        I urge you to vote against these ill-conceived bills.        With kind regards, I am            Sincerely yours,                                                  Terru O'Sullivan,                                                 General President.     Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman  from Louisiana (Mr. Graves).    Madam Chair, I yield an additional 2 minutes to  the gentleman from Louisiana.    Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.    Madam Chair, I appreciate the debate that we have had on this  particular bill--kind of.   Florida does have the right to do whatever it wishes to do on its  property and on its State lands and State waters, and they should have  the right to do it unless there is some kind of impact to Louisiana,  Texas, Alabama, and Mississippi, in which case, them doing something  strictly for Florida's purposes that doesn't take into account the  other States is wrong-minded.   But for this particular bill, we are really not talking about the  economy and the tourism and everything else. This bill is about a  military line and military issues.   As I have stated earlier, yes, there are military positions in  Florida. There is a military testing training range on the water, which  is not as good as the land-based one but is on the water in Florida.   Those are there and they deserve to be protected, and when the  military wants those things set aside without any kind of disturbance,  that is logical. That is limited. That is logical, and it is something  we should approve, which is why this issue should not be a bill before  us. This bill should have been decided as part of the NDAA.   But the question here is: Is everything on this arbitrary line that  was drawn, is it all needed for military use? It should be the military  that makes that decision; and, I am sorry, in the past, they have  simply said, no, they don't need it all.   So if we were wise, if we were really doing the right thing for this  country, if we were really doing the right thing on this issue, we  would simply say the military can exclude what the military needs; and  what they don't need should be allowed to be open for other kinds of  exploration that could benefit Mississippi and Alabama and New Orleans  and Texas, because they happen to be closer to the line than Florida  is. That is the right thing to do.   We should not do an arbitrary rule that just says to take the ruler  and make the damn line down the middle of the map. That is wrong. That  is a violation of everything that is logical. That is a violation of  everything that is scientific that we are supposed to do. That is a  violation of even taking away the ability of the military to make  decisions for themselves. That is why this is a failed opportunity on  our part.   Had the Rules Committee simply decided to take more rules into  effect, we could have modified this bill to make it something that  almost everybody in this room could have accepted. But the Rules  Committee refused to do that. For whatever political purposes they had  in mind, they simply refused to do that.   So, we have the option of instead of doing a bill that is the right  thing to do and a good thing to do, we have a bill that is going to be  questionable here. It is going to be questionable in the Senate. It is  going to be questionable on the deck.   We could have done the right thing. We should have done the right  thing. Hopefully, before this bill is all the way through the system,  we will do the right thing. But for that, this is a failed opportunity,  and I do blame the Rules Committee for refusing to try and expand the  discussion so we could actually make a bill that is viable.   Madam Chair, I appreciate the opportunity and all those who have  spoken on this bill. I appreciate the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Grijalva), and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    The administration, rightfully, took a second  look at the well control and production safety system rule that was  implemented by the prior administration. They didn't make a whole lot  of changes. About a 17 percent change to the overall rule was all that  was done there.   But the colleagues that I have heard and, also, those in the press  who have talked about this have been opposed to the revised rules  because they erroneously argue that they allow BSEE to issue the so- called waivers to oil companies that give them a free pass to comply  with the well control rule. In reality, that just is not what is  happening.   The rule allows BSEE to approve alternative compliance measures for  companies that can prove there is a better way of handling a particular  requirement that is at least as safe as the original regulatory rules  were. So, in fact, the practice is nothing new.   In the Obama administration, they approved these types of measures  more than the current administration is doing it. The average during  the Obama administration was roughly four times per day. The current  administration does it roughly 2.3 times per day.   BSEE isn't allowing oil companies to get away with not complying with  the well control rule. They have simply found a better way of doing it.   To codify this rule the way it was before takes away the flexibility  and the ability to use technology and new ideas and new science to come  up with a better way of solving the problem.   This amendment does great harm not only to the process. To attach it  to this bill, which ought to be about the military line, simply means,  were this to pass, this amendment would make it more difficult for the  ultimate bill to reach a solution in the Senate.   It is an amendment to the wrong bill. It should have been on the  earlier one. It is an amendment that is not needed. It is an amendment  that moves us back. It is an amendment that takes out of the  administration the ability, simply, to do things the right way. If they  can find a better way of doing it, let the administration, at any time,  authorize that better way of doing the well control protection rule.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, once again, I am somewhat confused  as to the point and direction of this particular amendment.   If it is about the military line, this amendment does nothing to it.  If it is about protecting the coast of Florida, this amendment does  nothing to it.   It is about having a better way of doing the system to provide more  protection. It moves us back and removes the ability of the  department--BSEE, in this situation--to protect and realize that  because it takes away their creative alternatives.   There are always better ways of doing something. This prohibits us  from doing it. This is the wrong amendment on the wrong bill that gives  us the wrong direction.   Madam Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to  the amendment.    Madam Chair, I don't want to try to be snarky on  these kinds of amendments, but it is already being done.   It is a nice concept. It was stopped, but it has also started again.  So this calls for a study to continue and resume. They have already  done it.   Back in October, in the Department of the Interior, they already  resumed the meetings. They are ongoing. Everything you want is actually  happening.   I think a better study may be figuring out how five noes can be  outweighed by three ayes. Nonetheless, this is a redundant amendment  because it is already happening.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I am going to end with the final  conclusion, again, that it is a redundancy because it is already being  done.   Why don't you just mandate that everything we are doing in every  other department be done at the same time? It would have the same kind  of impact, the same kind of effect. It is cute, but it is a waste of  our time.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
