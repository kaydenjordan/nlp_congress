 Madam Speaker, in the Supreme Court decision to overturn  Roe v. Wade, Justice Thomas wrote an alarming concurring opinion  explicitly calling for the reconsideration of the constitutional right  to contraception.   Republican State lawmakers have attempted to restrict birth control  for years, and this concurring opinion serves as a rallying call to  escalate attacks on access to contraceptives.   I will not stand idly by and watch extreme politicians obstruct  women's private healthcare choices and diminish reproductive freedom.  Access to birth control is key to achieving gender equality, improving  health outcomes for women, bolstering educational and economic  opportunities for all, and ensuring people are in control of their  family planning.   That is why this week I introduced the Right to Contraception Act. My  bill would codify the right to access birth control into Federal law  and put a stop to violations of Americans' right to this essential  reproductive healthcare.   I urgently ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support my  legislation to protect birth control and safeguard women's right to  make their decisions about their own bodies and futures.                            ____________________
