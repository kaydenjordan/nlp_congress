 Madam Speaker, this morning, today, we have arrived  in Washington to fight for postal workers, the United States Postal  Service, in H.R. 8015. But I take this moment to acknowledge close to  almost 175,000 dead Americans who have died from COVID-19. I applaud  those who have taken a moment out of their lives to march for those who  have passed and mourn for those families.   This is not America. And I acknowledge something else that comes to  my attention that hurts my heart as a mother, and that is the Trump  administration's policy to separate children. That the United Nations  has condemned it as torture and abuse of children--some upwards of  5,000 children. Their own White House immigration specialists, if you  will, want it to be 25,000 children. This is not America.   Today, we fight for those who have come to our doors in rain, snow,  or shine. We must also fight for the children and never again in  America see any policy that snatches children away from their families.  Immigrant or nonimmigrant, we are Americans who have values that stand  for something--equality and justice.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise with a sense of urgency. I  rise because the Postal Service is near collapse. I rise in the name of  Army Sergeant Retired Boudreau, stage 4 cancer, and Katy, stage 4  breast cancer. These are the desperate people that are feeling the  brunt of a collapsed Postal Service. The voices I listen to are the  letter carriers who are denied the ability to deliver mail, or the  postal workers who have no machines to deliver mail.   H.R. 8015 is an emergency SOS act, Delivering for America. It is  crucial that we meet today, not because we are political, because we  had to get here as fast as we could to be able to acknowledge that the  Postal Service is a crucial lifeline for Americans.   Madam Speaker, I submitted an amendment. I am glad that the Rules  Committee moved on a closed rule. This is an emergency. Later on today,  I will introduce Protecting Democracy by Securing the Right to Vote,  that will allow you to request ballots online, by phone, or mail, and  most importantly, setting a 10-business-day mail return time for  ballots sent by mail and are postmarked on election day.   Why?   Because as we are working today to ensure that mail ballots are safe  and secure under H.R. 8015, we have seniors who are listening to the  scare tactics that are being said from the highest office in the land.  They are frightened.   Yesterday, I was at the house of a blind senior citizen, she can't  get out to vote, she will have to do a mail ballot.   So I rise enthusiastically to support the H.R. 8015 rule because we  are in a collapse of the postal system. It is urgent. We need $25  billion, and we need to do it now. I ask my colleagues to support it,  and let it be bipartisan.   Madam Speaker, I rise to speak on the Rule for H.R. 8015, the  Delivering For America Act.   I thank Chairman McGovern for the work of the Rules Committee to  bring this important measure to the Floor of the House for  consideration.   I also thank Chairwoman Maloney for her leadership in drafting H.R.  8015, which is being debated under the Rule.   I offered an Amendment to improve this very good bill, but it was not  included in the Rule for H.R. 8015.   The Jackson Lee Amendment, if it had been included would have ensured  that ballots postmarked on or before Election Day would have ten  business days following that date to be delivered by the Postal Service  to local elections officials to have it counted for the election.   I offered this amendment out of consideration for the nearness of the  election and the likelihood that the U.S. Postmaster will not change  the policies that have led to the decommissioning of mail sorters and  mailboxes, which is slowing down the U.S. Mail.   The job of the United States Postal Service is to receive, process,  and deliver the mail without favor or special consideration to anyone.   I applaud the work done in the underlying bill to provide relief to  the Postal Service, and I appreciate the desire to narrowly focus the  bill only on addressing the issues arising out of intentional efforts  to disrupt mail service.   I believe that we must be more aggressive in our approach to protect  the election and make sure that Election Day does not become a victim  of COVID-19.   I will work with my colleagues to ensure that all available means are  provided to ensure that every voter, no matter their party or  preference has access to cast a vote that will be counted in the  November election.   I support the Rule for this bill because it provides much-needed  protection to postal workers and relief for those who are dependent on  the mail service for sustaining life and health as well as commercial  needs and business.   In 2019, the Postal Service:   Delivered 142.6 billion pieces of mail to 260 million addresses in  America;   Delivered 1.2 billion prescriptions, including most of the  medications ordered by the VA;   Employed 633,108 of our friends and neighbors, including more than  100,000 veterans;   Served 70 percent of businesses with fewer than ten employees;   Had a 90 percent favorabilty rating, making it the most popular  federal agency.   The Postal Service:   Is often the only delivery option for rural America where service is  not profitable;   Delivers 48 percent of the world's mail with one of the world's  largest civilian vehicle fleets;   Is a vital service for the more than 18 million seniors who do not  use the Internet.   The Postal Service has become a pharmacy of choice for millions of  Americans who live in pharmacy deserts--locations where there are no  pharmacies to serve communities.   The Postal Service is an essential component to Veterans' health  because they deliver medicines to our veterans.   The VA has now confirmed to us that the United States Postal Service  (USPS), which is responsible for delivering about 90 percent of all VA  mail order prescriptions, has indeed been delayed in delivering these  critical medications by an average of almost 25 percent over the past  year, with many locations experiencing much more significant delays.   Under the urgent need to fix the postal service, we must not forget  that the Postal Service employees are essential workers in COVID-19,  and if they are essential it means that the work they do is essential.   In addition to delivering prescriptions and business mail, they are  also delivering democracy to millions of voters who will need to cast  their ballot by mail this election year to reduce their risk of  contracting COVID-19.   The U.S. mail service has provided essential mail service for  absentee voting for well over 100 years by enabling Union troops to  vote during the Civil War, World War I, World War II, Korean War,  Vietnam War, Iraqi Freedom, and to this day.   Since that time, absentee or not, in-person voting has grown in  popularity across the United States and is now a welcomed and valued  component for assuring citizen participation in public elections.   In 2016, 20.9 percent of all votes cast in that federal election were  done so by absentee ballots and this year that number is expected to be  much higher due to COVID-19.   The attack on the viability and value of absentee voting should be  viewed as just one component of many assaults on our elections system  that may make this a very difficult election year.   This view is shaped by the decades of elections filled with  disinformation and misinformation tactics designed to suppress or  repress black, LatinX, and young voters from voting or having their  votes counted.   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in  support of the Rule for H.R. 8015.    Madam Speaker, over the last couple of hours, I have  heard my friends on the other side of the aisle say this is not  serious. Do you know why this is serious? Madam Speaker, 176,000 dead  Americans from COVID-19 and the projection that there may be 300,000  dead by December 1.   Madam Speaker, I left and got on a plane from a hotspot--14 to 20  percent infection. So my constituents who are suffering from stage IV  cancer need the mail.   If they want the proof, I read the words of General Counsel and  Executive Vice President Thomas J. Marshall of the U.S. Postal Service:  ``We are currently unable to balance our costs with available funding  sources to fulfill both our universal service mission and other legal  obligations.''   The post office says they have no money. We need to be able to  deliver this money to them and vote on this bill.   Madam Speaker, I support the bill and urge my colleagues to vote for  it.   Madam Speaker, I rise to speak in strong support of H.R. 8015, the  Delivering For America Act.   I thank Chairwoman Maloney for her leadership in drafting H.R. 8015.   As a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee and member of the  House Budget Committee, I am particularly interested in why and how  this Administration has tampered with the proper functioning of the  U.S. Postal Service.   The drafters of the 1789 Constitution of the United States knew the  vital importance of communication to the nation and its people, so they  vested authority with the Congress to sustain and maintain a national  postal service.   Article I, Section 8, clause 7, in the Constitution of the United  States provides that the Congress has the power ``To establish Post  Offices and post Roads . . .''   The Postal Clause was added to the Constitution to facilitate  interstate communication as well as to create a source of revenue for  the early United States.   The freedoms of the press and of speech are guaranteed in the First  Amendment to the Constitution and the establishment of a national  postal system, an authority vested by the Constitution in the Congress,  are indispensable features of a strong and stable democracy.   A national postal system to collect and distribute mail efficiently,  affordably, reliably, and without regard to the sender's or recipient's  race, creed, color, national origin, religion, region of residence, or  political affiliation strengthens and fortifies democracy by enabling  all persons to communicate with any and all other Americans.   A functioning and effective national postal system strengthens the  economy by facilitating the efficient delivery of goods and services,  promotes the public health by facilitating the timely delivery of  needed medical supplies and prescription drugs to senior citizens and  veterans, and enriches civil society by facilitating the delivery of  letters of greetings, sympathy, congratulations, and love, thus  strengthening the mystic bonds of affection of Americans for each other  and for the United States.   Fifty years after the Constitution went into effect the population of  the United States ballooned at a greater rate than it has ever since.  [[Page H4291]]    During that period, the population grew from 3,929,214 in 1790, the  year of the first census, to 17,069,453 in 1840.   For those who may think mail tampering is fine so long as it is an  absentee ballot or absentee ballot request--they need to know that  tampering with the U.S. mail is a federal felony.   Mail theft carries a penalty of up to five years in federal prison  and fines of up to $250,000 for each violation.   It is also a crime to injure, deface, or destroy any mail deposited  in a mailbox.   For each act of vandalism, you could be imprisoned for up to three  years and fined up to $250,000.   Communication for the purpose of commerce, linking and strengthening  bonds among family, and friends as well as keeping citizens informed  was of the utmost importance to the health and wellbeing of the young  democracy.   Over the centuries, the arrival of new technology that supported  communication did not end the need for an affordable and easily  accessible national postal service.   The telegraph, telephone nor the Internet ended the need for the  delivery of letters, cards, packages, and newspapers or magazines.   The American people are depending on the House and the Senate, just  like they depend on the Post Office to deliver a secure and voter  centered November Election that empowers them to cast ballots for the  candidates of their choice.   Election Day must not become a victim of COVID-19 through  manipulation of the postal service or by any other means foreign or  domestic.   I will work with my colleagues to ensure that all available means are  provided to ensure that every voter, no matter their party or  preference has access to cast a vote that will be counted in the  November election.   For over 200 years, the American people have relied upon the National  Postal Service to be there--no matter what--they have delivered the  mail during a civil war, pandemics, hurricanes, forest fires, and  terrorist attacks.   The Postal Service employs 633,108 of our friends and neighbors,  including more than 100,000 veterans.   The Postal Service is one of the leading employers of minorities and  women, with minorities comprising 39 percent and women comprising 40  percent of the workforce.   The Post Office has become a path to good paying jobs that lifts  people out of poverty.   Postal workers have been determined to be essential workers during  the pandemic and they have delivered service without complaint or fail  during this national crisis.   As of July 2020, nearly 5,400 USPS employees tested positive for  COVID-19 among its workforce of 630,000.   A May a report stated that of the 130 Federal Employees who had died  due to COVID-19, 60 of them were employed at the U.S. Postal Service.   In June, a staggering 17,000 workers, or 3 percent of the United  States Postal Service workforce, had been quarantined since the start  of the pandemic, according to a recent report by Government Executive  magazine.   By the beginning of July, around 70 percent of those quarantined have  been cleared to go back to work.   Earlier this summer Postal Service management acknowledged that 2,830  workers had tested positive for COVID-19, out of a total workforce of  approximately 630,000.   However, USPS officials have not made publicly available the number  of deaths.   With the urgent need to fix the postal service, we must not forget  that the Postal Service employees are essential workers in COVID-19,  and if they are essential it means that their work is essential.   For 55 cents, anyone can send a first class letter anywhere in the  United States and there is no private sector mail service that can do  this at this low price.   In 2019, the Postal Service:   Delivered 142.6 billion pieces of mail to 260 million addresses in  America;   Delivered 1.2 billion prescriptions, including most of the  medications ordered by the VA;   Served 70 percent of businesses with fewer than ten employees; and   Had a 90 percent favorability rating, making it the most popular  federal agency.   The Postal Service:   Is often the only delivery option for rural America where service is  not profitable;   Delivers 48 percent of the world's mail with one of the world's  largest civilian vehicle fleets; and   Is a vital service for the more than 18 million seniors who do not  use the Internet.   The Postal Service has become a pharmacy of choice for millions of  Americans who live in pharmacy deserts, which are locations where there  are no pharmacies to serve communities.   The Postal Service is an essential component to Veterans' and  seniors' health because they deliver medicines to our veterans.   The VA has now confirmed to us that the United States Postal Service  (USPS), which is responsible for delivering about 90 percent of all VA  mail order prescriptions, has indeed been delayed in delivering these  critical medications by an average of almost 25 percent over the past  year, with many locations experiencing much more significant delays.   In addition to delivering prescriptions and business mail, they are  also delivering democracy to millions of voters who will need to cast  their ballot by mail this election year to reduce their risk of  contracting COVID-19.   The U.S. mail service has provided essential mail service for  absentee voting for well over 100 years by enabling Union troops to  vote during the Civil War, World War I, World War II, the Korean War,  the Vietnam War, Iraqi Freedom, and to this day.   Since that time, absentee or not in-person voting has grown in  popularity across the United States and is now a welcomed and valued  component for assuring citizen participation in public elections.   In 2016, 20.9 percent of all votes cast in that federal election were  done so by absentee ballots and this year that number is expected to be  much higher due to COVID-19.   In 2018, there were 153.07 million people registered to vote in the  United States, which is lower than the peak of 157.6 million registered  voters in 2016.   Montana had the highest voter turnout rate with 45.6 percent for the  2020 presidential primary elections.   The voter turnout rate in Texas for the 2020 presidential primary  elections was 21 percent.   More than 4 million Texans voted in the 2020 presidential primary  election, with turnout among Democratic voters at 12.81 percent  compared to 12.39 percent of Republican voters.   In Texas, there were 16,211,198 registered voters and 4,084,431 votes  for the 2020 primaries. In comparison, in 2016 there were 14,238,436  registered voters and 4,272,383 votes.   The attack on the viability and value of absentee voting should be  viewed as just one component of many assaults on our elections system  that may make this a very difficult election year.   Over the past several weeks, sweeping operational and organization  changes at the Postal Service have resulted in delays in the mail  across the country, including in rural communities, among veterans and  seniors, and in blue and red states alike.   Some of those changes include curtailing overtime, restricting  deliveries, eliminating sorting machines, and removing mailboxes.   Concerns have been raised by both Democratic and Republican officials  at the federal, state and local levels.   These changes are being rushed through--in the midst of a global  pandemic just months before the November elections--without adequate  consultation with Congress, the Postal Board of Governors, the Postal  Regulatory Commission, postal employees unions, state election  officials, business organizations, and other stakeholders.   The Postmaster General also recently reassigned 23 postal executives  in an overhaul that experts warn ``deemphasizes decades worth of  institutional postal knowledge'' and ``centralizes power around  DeJoy.''   The restructure also proposed a hiring freeze, early retirements,  unit realignments, and regional downscaling.   On August 11, 2020, the Postal Service's General Counsel sent a  letter to Congress explaining that state election workers had been  notified that paying Marketing Mail rates instead of First-Class rates  for election mail ``will result in slower delivery times and will  increase the risk that voters will not receive their ballots in time to  return them by mail.''   This breaks from the Postal Service's long-standing practice of  prioritizing the delivery of all election mail to meet First-Class  delivery times.   The 2011 Canadian RoboCon suppression scandal is the political  scandal stemming from events during the 2011 Canadian federal election.   It involved robocalls and real-person calls that were designed to  result in voter suppression.   Elections Canada and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police conducted  investigations into the claims that calls were made to dissuade voters  from casting ballots by falsely telling them that the location of their  polling stations had changed.   Further possible electoral law violations were alleged as the  evidence unfolded.   Under the Canada Elections Act, it is an offense to willfully prevent  or endeavor to prevent an elector from voting in an election.   On Election Day, May 2, 2011, reports of voter suppression, mostly  centered on the riding of Guelph, led to the discovery that a computer  in the Guelph Conservative campaign office may have been used to make  the calls.   While the Elections Canada investigation initially focused on calls  sent into Guelph amidst  [[Page H4292]]  nationwide complaints, the investigation expanded to complaints in  other ridings across the country.   Court documents filed in mid-August 2012 by the Commissioner of  Canada Elections indicated that the elections watchdog had received  complaints of fraudulent or misleading calls in 247 of Canada's 308  ridings, recorded in all ten provinces and at least one territory.   The deciding margin for control for the government was within the  margin of error created by the fraudulent robocalls, which were  successful in misdirecting voters resulting in them not being able to  cast votes in that national election.   It is my strong view that we must prepare voters from all  socioeconomic backgrounds and ethnic cultural experiences to be  prepared to deal effectively with efforts to misinform them about their  participation in the November Election.   We must focus on the unsuspecting among the voting population who  have no idea what is coming their way and prepare them to meet that  challenge by linking them to the election protection efforts to allow  them to develop the needed resources so they are prepared to exercise  the most precious of rights and do the work of citizenship by casting  their votes for a government that serves We The People and works to  make our union more perfect.   This view is shaped by the decades of elections filled with  disinformation and misinformation tactics designed to suppress or  repress black, LatinX, and young voters from voting or having their  votes counted.   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in  support of H.R. 8015.         USPS Email from Constituent        Ms. Jennifer        SUBJECT: USPS concerns MESSAGE: First, thank you for having       a ``post office'' category. Neither senator does. Second,       this is ridiculous. The postmaster has conflicts of interest.       He is dismantling the postal service, which is explicitly       required by the constitution. I depend on the USPS as a       constituent. My company depends on it for correspondence and       service with clients, especially while we work from home due       to Covid. My clients depend on it to get services and       benefits. Please vote or act to hold the postmaster       accountable and to stop these ridiculous changes he is       making. They make no business sense for a ``business'', and       they are unethical for a government-provided,       constitutionally-mandated service.
