 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, let's be clear. Everybody in this Chamber supports  lowering prescription drug costs, lowering these outrageous costs that  all of our constituents are paying across the country. We all support  clean, affordable energy and access to those resources. We all support  lowering inflation.   The difference is, where the credibility gap exists, is that the very  problems, the very crisis that our country is experiencing today, were  actually caused by the Biden administration's policies.   We went from, in my hometown, $1.80 a gallon for gasoline to,  recently, I paid $4.20. We have seen a tripling of natural gas costs.  Their own policies have caused this.   Nearly a quarter of all Americans today can't even afford to pay  their electricity bills. The Biden administration policies have caused  record inflation, making Americans unable to even afford grocery costs.   The Biden administration policies have resulted in higher emissions,  not lower emissions, as compared to the previous administration. Biden  administration policies resulted in this President going to countries  like Saudi Arabia and asking them for energy while telling Americans  that we can't produce.   Mr. Speaker, I can't help but reminisce over Jack Abramoff, a  disgraced lobbyist, convicted, who created problems and then charged  clients to fix them. The difference between this bill and Jack Abramoff  is that Jack Abramoff actually fixed problems for his clients.   This bill is a disaster. There is a credibility gap. They have caused  problems, and now we are being asked to trust them to fix them, and we  simply can't. Oppose this legislation.
