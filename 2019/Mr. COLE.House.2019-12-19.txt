 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend, the  gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Torres) for yielding me the customary  30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this is our third rule debate in what has turned out to  be a pretty eventful and memorable week. Unfortunately, today's debate  is on a deeply partisan and misguided tax bill.                                time  0915    H.R. 5377 would temporarily remove the cap on the deduction for State  and local income taxes, property taxes, and sales taxes. The bill also  pays for this temporary tax break for a few by permanently increasing  the top marginal tax rate.   What is worse, Mr. Speaker, the permanent tax increase isn't limited  to individuals but applies to small businesses, as well.   Two years ago, Congress passed and President Trump signed into law  the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This monumental legislation not only  reformed the corporate tax code to make American business more  competitive and  [[Page H12215]]  simplified the personal tax code, but it also ensured that the vast  majority of Americans are getting to keep more of their hard-earned  money than they did 2 years ago. Between lower tax rates, the expanded  standard deduction, the child tax credit, and changes to the  alternative minimum tax, the benefit of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are  numerous and reach far and wide across the Nation.   Today, the majority is seeking to undo some of that progress and is  seeking to push a temporary tax break that will only benefit a few  wealthy individuals in a few States. The State and local tax deduction,  or SALT deduction, as it is called, primarily benefits only a select  group of individuals, generally wealthy people in the top 20 percent of  income, in a few high-tax States, who own expensive homes. H.R. 5377  would allow these individuals to temporarily claim an unlimited SALT  deduction for only the years 2020 and 2021.   Mr. Speaker, the benefits of this bill will overwhelmingly go to  those who are already wealthy. According to the Center on Budget and  Policy Priorities, the top 1 percent of households would receive 56  percent of the benefit of repealing the SALT deduction cap. Let me  repeat that: The top 1 percent get 56 percent of the benefits of  repealing the SALT deduction cap. The top 5 percent of households will  receive over 80 percent of the benefit. Again, let me repeat that: The  top 5 percent of income earners in the country are going to get 80  percent of the benefit of this bill. Amazing. The bottom 80 percent of  all households would receive precisely 4 percent of the benefit.  Amazing.   What is worse, in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we have already acted to  offset the reduced SALT deduction by doubling the standard deduction.  In the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we doubled the standard deduction from  $12,000 to $24,000 for married couples, which offset an increase  resulting from lowering the SALT deduction cap for a vast majority of  taxpayers.   Before TCJA, 30 percent of all taxpayers itemized deductions and  could potentially benefit from a SALT deduction. Today, just under 90  percent of all taxpayers take the standard deduction. This has made tax  filing significantly easier. More importantly, for our purposes, it has  meant that the vast majority of taxpayers who potentially could have  benefited from a SALT deduction are already benefiting from the  increased standard deduction.   In the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the drafters of the bill made sure that  the benefits were spread across all taxpayers. Between doubling the  standard deduction, doubling the child tax credit and making it  partially refundable, and simplifying the tax code, there is hardly a  taxpayer in America who did not see some benefit from the bill.   Here, unlike the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the benefits of H.R. 5377  will go only to a select group of people in a few key States, and it  will overwhelmingly go to people who are already wealthy--already  wealthy. Though the majority likes to claim that Republicans only want  to cut taxes for the rich, it is ironic that the majority is now  pushing a special tax break that literally benefits only the rich.   But the bill is worse than that, Mr. Speaker. To pay for this short- term tax break for a few, the bill also increases the top marginal tax  rate for all taxpayers on a permanent basis. That is correct. The bill  imposes a permanent tax hike on all Americans to give a short-term tax  break for a wealthy few.   That type of tax change simply doesn't make any sense, Mr. Speaker.  The tax code does need further reforms, no doubt about it. But those  reforms should be those that increase the competitiveness of American  business, simplify the tax code further to make it more comprehensible  to taxpayers, and ensure further fairness for everyone. Giving a few  select people in a few States a short-term and complicated tax break  simply doesn't meet these goals.   Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the rule, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a Statement of Administration  Policy on this particular bill, noting that the President's advisers  would advise him to veto this bill, were it to pass.  [[Page H12216]]                          Statement of Administration Policy    H.R. 5377--Restoring Tax Fairness for States and Localities Act--Rep.                      Suozzi, D-NY, and 52 cosponsors         The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R.       5377, the Restoring Tax Fairness for States and Localities       Act. This legislation would unfairly force all Federal       taxpayers to subsidize a tax break for the wealthy, as well       as excessive government spending by fiscally irresponsible       States. H.R. 5377 would likely cause State and local       governments to raise taxes, all while hindering the growth of       small businesses and opportunities for workers.        The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA), which passed       Congress without a single Democrat vote, is a signature       achievement of the Trump Administration. This bill, which       President Donald J. Trump signed into law on December 22,       2017, has spurred economic growth across the Nation by       lowering individual tax rates, nearly doubling the standard       deduction, simplifying the tax code, and closing special       interest loopholes. Workers and middle-class Americans are       reaping the benefits of the TCJA in the form of record low       unemployment and substantially higher wages. H.R. 5377 would       turn back the clock by adding a special interest provision       back into the Federal tax code that unfairly requires middle-      class Americans to subsidize fiscally irresponsible States       and wealthy taxpayers. In doing so, H.R. 5377 would violate       the principle that States should raise their own revenue       rather than rely on tax subsidies from the Federal       Government. The bill would also reduce incentives for States       to be fiscally responsible.        Additionally, the provision in H.R. 5377 that would raise       the top income tax rate from 37 percent to 39.6 percent would       stifle economic growth by placing an undue burden on       thousands of small businesses. Because it is unfair to       middle-class taxpayers, encourages excessive spending by       States, and would stunt economic growth, H.R. 5377 is poor       tax policy that should not be enacted into law.        If H.R. 5377 were resented to the President his senior       advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.    Mr. Speaker, there is nobody I like better than my friend  from New Jersey, quite frankly. We are very good friends. We have  worked together on a lot of good things. But I have to tell you, on  this one, we just disagree.   The middle class is going to benefit from this bill? Let me just go  through the figures again. The top 1 percent of income earners in  America get 56 percent of the benefits in this bill. The top 5 percent  get 80 percent. The bottom 80 percent get 4 percent.   This is not a middle-class bill. This is not even an upper-middle- class bill. This is a bill for pretty wealthy people. Ninety-six  percent of the benefits go to households that make more than $200,000 a  year.    No, I won't yield. I want to yield to another speaker in a  moment. You are the one who raised the issue, so I am just going back  to the numbers.   The numbers here are pretty clear. This is a targeted tax cut for  wealthy people in a very few States. That is just the truth.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs.  Lesko), my good friend and fellow Rules Committee member.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, before I get into my prepared remarks, I want to advise  my friend that I certainly have no objection to raising the tax credit  for teachers or first responders. Those things are, I think, perfectly  laudable parts of the bill.   Our main objection is simply that the main benefits of this are going  to the top 1 percent and 5 percent of incomes, and that is just  indisputable.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to immediately bring up H.R. 750, a resolution  that expresses the sense of the House that it is the duty of the  Federal Government to protect and promote individual choice in health  insurance for all American people and prevent any Medicare for All  proposal that would outlaw private health plans such as the job-based  coverage in Medicare Advantage plans.   Earlier this Congress, the House Rules Committee held the first-ever  legislative hearing on the Democratic Medicare for All proposal. During  that hearing, we heard promises about the Democrat-proposed, one-size- fits-all, government-run healthcare system. But we also heard about the  realities of that plan: how it would require doubling income and  corporate tax rates to implement, how it would lead to long waits for  care, and how it would lead to 158 million Americans losing their  current coverage.   That is all because Medicare for All, if implemented, would outlaw  private healthcare coverage. This includes coverage offered through the  popular Medicare Advantage program, which gives 22 million Americans  healthcare.   Given that reality, it is wholly appropriate for the House to take  this stand now. Protecting individual choice and protecting the private  healthcare plans should be a priority for this House.    If we defeat the previous question, we will give every Member of the  House an opportunity to say so together, with one voice.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with the extraneous material,  immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, just to quickly respond to my friend, I would remind the  gentleman that Republicans offered, in committee, an amendment which  would have, frankly, given the SALT deduction to the bottom 90 percent  of all Americans in exchange for continuing to charge it on the top 10  percent. I suspect that would cover the vast majority of the  gentleman's constituents who might benefit.   I also remind everybody that the standard deduction was double, so,  for most people, the average person actually came out ahead. It is only  the very wealthy people who lost ground under this particular measure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.  Green), a distinguished former general.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, nobody admires my friend from New York more than I do.  We worked on a number of issues. But let's be real. Democrats are going  to make the rich, I guess, in every State pay for the rich in your own  State. That is just the fact.                                time  0945    Most of the benefit of this thing--56 percent of the benefits--goes  to the top 1 percent of income earners. That is the fact. Eighty  percent of it goes to the top 5 percent, and 94 percent goes to  households that make over $200,000 a year. Those are just the numbers.   Now, some of this is used for worthy causes. I would agree with that.  But a permanent tax increase for a temporary tax cut, frankly, just  doesn't make a lot of sense, and that is what we are dealing with here.   So I would also suggest that my friends remember that the tax cut  that they revile so much doubles the personal exemption for most people  so that more than offsets for most people the SALT tax reduction that  was reduced. It is not eliminated; it is still there.   Mr. Speaker, $10,000 a year is still a pretty good deduction to be  able to take. If you make that much income that you can take a  deduction that large, then you are probably doing pretty well.   So, again, I don't have any problem with people defending the  interest of  [[Page H12219]]  their States, that is a perfectly appropriate thing to do. I don't have  any problem with people wanting to use money for good purposes. That is  a perfectly appropriate thing to do. But let's be real about who is  getting the benefit of this tax package, and it is very-high-income  people.   In fact, I am going to oppose it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I advise my friend I am prepared to close  whenever she is. In the interim, I will reserve if she has more  speakers.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I oppose both the rule and the underlying  measure. H.R. 5377 is a deeply misguided and partisan tax bill that  sets up a temporary tax break for a privileged few and seeks to trade  it for a permanent tax hike for the entire country.   The bill temporarily removes the cap on the State and local tax  deduction, a benefit that will primarily go to wealthy taxpayers living  in expensive homes in a few key States and localities. But to pay for  this temporary boondoggle, the majority is adding a permanent hike at  the top marginal tax rate. The benefits will go only to a few key  privileged areas, but the costs are spread across the entire country.   It makes very little sense to me to trade a temporary tax break for a  permanent tax increase, and it makes even less sense to me to ask the  entire country to pay for it in perpetuity for a short-term tax break  for a few areas with high State and local taxes.   Now, my friends have talked about the relative tax burden and who  gives what and what States give what. As a former member of the Budget  Committee, those numbers are, by the way, usually based on the  discretionary portion of the budget. The reality is--I hate to say  this, because we have a big problem in front of us that I don't think  either party has confronted very well, certainly not mine, but I don't  think my friends have either, and I don't think this administration  has, and I don't think the last one did--every State in America is a  debtor State if you start adding in Medicare, Medicaid, and those type  of nondiscretionary expenditures.   So we have a big problem. It is really related to an aging population  more than it is anything else, but the idea that some States are so- called donor States, I have to tell you, Mr. Speaker, nobody is a donor  State in America. We are running nearly a $1 trillion deficit. That  deficit comes almost primarily because we have simply not readjusted  Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security to pay for the benefits that  are drawn out. I hope someday we will work on that.   I actually have a bipartisan bill, I used to carry it with Mr.  Delaney--a very good friend and Presidential candidate from my good  friends on the other side--that would go back and set up what we did in  1983. When Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill worked together, we had a  Social Security Commission. We actually increased the revenue going  into Social Security. I think that would have to be one of the long- term fixes, not simply cuts, reductions, and reforms. That is a debate  for another day.    In closing, Mr. Speaker, American taxpayers, in my view, deserve  better than what is in front of us here today. Rather than making the  tax code more regressive and complicated, which this bill would do, we  should further reform and simplify the tax code to make it easier for  all taxpayers to understand. We should be making American businesses  more competitive, and we should be taking steps so that American  workers can keep more of their hard-earned earned income, something I  know we all want to do.   In closing, again, just remember this: 56 percent of the benefits of  this bill go to the top 1 percent of income earners. The top 5 percent  get 80 percent, and the bottom 80 percent in terms of income get 4  percent. That should explain it all and why we should reject this bill.   So, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous  question, ``no'' on the rule, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
