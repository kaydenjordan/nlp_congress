 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, 1.7 million people, that is the record- shattering number of illegal immigrants detained along our southern  border in just the last 12 months. In 1 year, 1.7 million people tried  to take advantage of the Biden administration's intentionally unsecure  border and come here illegally. This is the most ever recorded.   There are 11 States whose populations are smaller than 1.7 million.  Of the 1.7 million, more than 1 million were single adults. That is  nearly two-thirds--not family units, not unaccompanied children, but  adults on their own.   In many cases, this is not about escaping disaster or persecution;  this is about wanting a better job in America. It is less about  emergency refugees and more about economics. Legal immigration in  pursuit of a better future is a core part of our country. It reflects  our values, and it makes us stronger.   We are a generous country that wants to welcome ambitious new  Americans who come here the right way. But it is beyond disingenuous  for the Biden administration to pretend that huge numbers of people who  simply want better jobs are emergency refugees. Those are two entirely  different things.   In this 12-month span, authorities arrested people from 160 different  countries. In this 12-month span, authorities arrested people from 160  different countries.   Think about that. The U.S. recognizes 195 countries in the entire  world. Customs and Border Protection ran into people from all but 35 of  the entire number of countries in the world.   On numerous occasions, these people have told reporters they are  coming specifically--specifically--because of President Biden. His  campaign rhetoric and his policy decisions have directly--directly-- created this crisis.   Late last December, about a month before the President took office,  he literally said ``the last thing we need'' would be if his  administration pursued policy changes that caused us to ``end up with 2  million people on our border.''   That was the President last December. That is how President-elect  Biden himself defined failure on our border last December: 2 million  people showing up.   Well, that is exactly what he has brought about, all because of the  liberal misapprehension that a weak and porous border is a  compassionate border. It is not.   Even now, even as President Biden faces the exact definition of  failure, which he himself laid out, the administration won't change  course. A few weeks ago, Secretary Mayorkas released radical new  guidance that essentially tries to create amnesty by executive fiat.   This Mayorkas memo told ICE that, now, being in the country illegally  ``should not alone be the basis'' for making arrests--a baseline policy  of no enforcement, with exceptions for certain extenuating  circumstances.   Last week, before the Judiciary Committee, under questioning from  Senator Cornyn, even the President's own nominee to CBP had to admit  that nonenforcement policies are a magnet that make the problem worse.   Even before the new Mayorkas memo, over the whole last 12 months,  immigration arrests in the interior of the country fell--fell--to their  lowest level in more than a decade. ICE arrested half as many people  this past year as they did on average in previous years.   Put two and two together: CBP encounters at the border are at  historic highs, but ICE enforcement is down to a decade low--encounters  at the border at a historic high, but enforcement down to a decade low.   This doesn't make any sense, unless we are looking at functional  amnesty through nonenforcement.   But even now, Democrats keep pushing more new policies to incentivize  illegal immigration. Their next reckless taxing-and-spending spree  proposes to double down on Democrats' new monthly welfare deposits that  can flow directly to people who are here illegally. This is a Democrat- created crisis from top to bottom.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now, on another matter. On the whole,  the taxing-and-spending spree the Democrats want to ram through will  hurt families and help China. But when you take a close look, there are  some special groups of people here at home who would make out like  bandits. There are specific special interests that Democrats take great  pains to look after.   Let me give you an example. A whole chunk of money the Democrats'  proposal supposedly sets aside for patient healthcare would actually  finance ultragenerous benefits for members of the powerful leftwing  union, the SEIU.   The Big Labor bonanza doesn't stop there. Democrats' tax plans would  allow the expiration of Americans' above-the-line deduction for  charitable and nonprofit donations. But in its place, they want to  create a brandnew subsidy for--listen to this--union dues. Tough luck  for the Red Cross and your church collection plate; Washington  Democrats say Big Labor bosses come first.   Democrats also propose lavishing billions of dollars on something  they call environmental and climate justice block grants--environmental  and climate justice block grants. That sounds like a gift-wrapped  giveaway to the universe of nonprofits and activist groups that  seemingly exist to grift off of government grants.   They would spend billions more on tax credits to subsidize luxury  purchases that are overwhelmingly made  [[Page S7351]]  by wealthy people, like electric cars and $8,000 electric bicycles.   Then there are billions more in special subsidies and loans for the  next generation of Solyndras.   The gravy train doesn't stop there. When the Biden administration  proposed spending $40 billion on public housing renovations, the senior  Senator from New York urged them to double down and spend $40 billion  exclusively on his hometown--exclusively on his hometown. That is $40  billion to a housing authority that is apparently well known for  bribery and mismanagement simply because the Democratic leader  requested it.   Meanwhile, in Speaker Pelosi's backyard of San Francisco, the elite  trustees of a massive park and development project--oh, boy, they are  licking their chops. The Speaker plans to set aside $200 million of the  spending spree for this park that is specifically not meant to receive  taxpayer money, so they can focus on ``environmental and social  justice.''   The Democrats' spree would also tear down longstanding, bipartisan  Hyde amendment protections so they can directly fund abortion providers  like Planned Parenthood with taxpayer dollars. Today's left cannot miss  an opportunity to send Planned Parenthood a new slush fund.   Then there is the Democrats' obsession with the so-called SALT cap.  Even as our colleagues draft the biggest tax hikes in half a century,  they cannot resist the concept of special tax cuts for high earners in  blue States. They want to reintroduce the Federal tax subsidy for  living in high-tax States. One outside analysis found that a 2-year  repeal of the SALT cap would send more than--listen to this--more than  $300,000 to the average household in the top 0.1 percent of our  country. The average household in the bottom 60 percent would get $15.  This isn't a joke; this is literally the SALT policy that Democrats  want--300 grand for the richest folks on the coast and 15 bucks for  normal families.   It is the same setup everywhere you look. Special interests who are  connected to the Democratic Party would make out like bandits, and  middle-class families, they will get the bill.                            ____________________     Madam President, last week, more than 76 years after  he was killed in the Second World War, Army Private First Class Berton  J. McQueen was returned home to Jackson County, KY. His family reburied  him with full military honors outside the Wind Cave Baptist Church in  McKee, ending a seven-decade journey from Kentucky, to Italy, to  France, and finally back home again. Today, I  [[Page S7363]]  recognize Private First Class McQueen as a Kentucky hero who fought and  died defending our sacred freedoms and honor the steadfast family  members and public servants who brought him home.   McQueen was only 20 years old when, as part of Operation Dragoon, he  and his platoon landed in the Rhone Valley to liberate France from its  German occupiers. Facing stiff resistance and heavy fire, his unit  scattered across the countryside. By the time the smoke cleared and the  enemy retreated, McQueen was lost.   Two years later, the American Graves Registration Command recovered a  soldier's body from a farmyard in the area where McQueen had gone  missing. Local authorities could not verify the soldier's identity, so  he was reburied in an anonymous grave in Normandy. Back home in Jackson  County, the McQueen family prayed their lost son would be found.   Last week, those prayers were finally answered. With the help of new  DNA technology, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency identified the  body as Berton McQueen's. They sent him home to Jackson County, where  he is now buried next to the church where he was baptized, nearly a  century earlier. With bagpipes and bugles playing, an honor guard  marching, and the extended McQueen family gathered together again,  Private First Class Berton McQueen was finally given the hero's return  he deserved.   Our Nation's military is diligent in finding and honoring its missing  servicemembers. All over Kentucky and across the country, the POW/MIA  Accounting Agency has reunited lost sons and daughters with their loved  ones. This program offers important help to grieving families and  honors our country's most sacred obligation to those who serve. The  Agency's motto is ``fulfilling our nation's promise,'' and, as the  McQueen family's story demonstrates, they go to extraordinary lengths  to carry out that creed.   The Lexington Herald-Leader published a comprehensive account of  Private First Class Berton McQueen's life and journey in a recent  article. I ask unanimous consent the article be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:              [From Lexington Herald-Leader, October 17, 2021]  `I've Waited For This.' Kentucky WWII Soldier Unidentified for Decades                                 Comes Home         Nannie McQueen was desperate to find out what had happened       to her son in World War II.        Army Pfc. Berton J. McQueen had been badly wounded by       artillery fire while his unit was fighting German troops near       a small town in France in November 1944.        He died at an aid station set up in a barn, and amid the       chaos of war, someone buried him in a garden.        American troops didn't recover his body until after the war       in Europe ended months later, and he couldn't be identified.        The Army notified McQueen's parents in Jackson County that       he was listed as killed in action, but with few details and       no one to bury, his mother couldn't accept it.        She wrote letters to soldiers who served with him to try to       figure out what had happened to him and put advertisements in       a farming magazine and other publications seeking       information, said his niece, Genevieve Palm.        When her grandmother went to town, she left the door at her       house unlocked so her son could get in if he came home, Palm       said.        ``She couldn't give up,'' Palm said of her grandmother.        ``I can't imagine what kind of torture that would have       been.''        Now, Berton McQueen is home.        Based on historical research, dental records and analysis       of DNA samples from Palm and other family members, officials       with the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency identified the       body recovered from the garden in France as McQueen,       according to a news release.        McQueen was accounted for in July, more than 76 years after       he was killed at age 20.        He was reburied Saturday with full military honors in       Jackson County, in the hillside cemetery at the Wind Cave       Baptist Church. McQueen attended the small wooden church as a       boy and was baptized in a creek nearby.        A bugler played ``Taps,'' and a bagpiper played ``Amazing       Grace'' before members of the honor guard fired a 21-gun       salute and folded the flag from his casket to give to his       family.        McQueen was raised on a small farm in the Wind Cave       community, the youngest of seven children of John and Nancy       Jane ``Nannie'' McQueen, said Palm, whose mother was one of       Berton McQueen's sisters.        Like thousands of others who grew up on Kentucky farms in       those days, McQueen moved to Indiana to find work. He was       living in Connersville when he was drafted, Palm said.        McQueen was wounded fighting in Italy in February 1944,       spending 11 weeks in the hospital, and was wounded again in       August 1944, spending several more weeks in the hospital.        His family hoped he would come home, but McQueen wanted to       finish the job. He believed that if the U.S. and allies       didn't carry the fight to the Nazis in Europe, the war would       come to America, said Palm, who has letters he sent to his       family.        ``He felt a strong duty,'' Palm said. ``He said, `I will       come home when the rest do.' ''        McQueen landed in southern France in August 1944 as part of       Operation Dragoon, pushing north through the Rhone Valley to       meet up with forces that had gone ashore in the massive D-Day       invasion and then turn to the final assault on Germany.        McQueen saw plenty of combat but didn't write about the       horror of war in his letters home because he didn't want to       worry his parents, Palm said.        Instead, he wrote about the people and the beauty he saw,       Palm said, though he did mention in one letter in mid-1944       that U.S. troops were driving the Germans back.        ``He said, `We have'm on the run now,' '' Palm said.        But his unit ran into stiff resistance in a battle in a       hilly region near the border with Germany, according to the       Army's account.        As German infantry pursued his unit, McQueen was going to       get more ammunition for his machine-gun platoon when he was       hit by shrapnel.        One soldier later told Army investigators he helped carry       McQueen to an aid station, and that when he asked later how       the badly wounded man was doing, he was told McQueen had       died, Palm said.        McQueen's battalion, which suffered heavy casualties, was       forced to pull back and was in ``disarray'' for a period       before regrouping, according to an account from the Army,       Palm said.        It's not clear why McQueen went missing or who buried him.       After German troops withdrew a few days later, U.S. troops       didn't find his body.        A woman who lived on the farm later disclosed that an       American soldier had been buried there. The American Graves       Registration Command recovered a body in April 1946 but       couldn't identify the soldier.        He was reburied under the designation X-6093 at the       Normandy American Cemetery in Colleville-sur-Mer, France,       until science could solve the mystery.        Palm was born 10 years after her uncle died but lived close       to her grandmother and heard stories about him.        ``We really grew up with that grief for her, and that       loss,'' said Palm, a retired property manager who lives in       Laurel County.        McQueen's mother died in 1972. Years later, the local bank       president called Palm's mother to report there was money in       an account Nannie McQueen had kept.        She had been putting money away for her son to use when he       came home, Palm said.        Palm read a letter at the church Saturday from an Army       buddy of McQueen's that her grandmother had contacted just       before Christmas in 1945.        Louie Hughes said in his letter back to McQueen's mother       that McQueen often talked of his home and his family while he       was overseas, and that the two of them talked about the Bible       into the night at times.        McQueen had drawn a sketch of how to get to his house in       Jackson County in Hughes' Bible so he could visit after the       war.        The two later got assigned to different companies, and then       Hughes was captured and spent 16 ``horrible months'' in a       German prison camp, he said, so he hadn't heard that McQueen       had been killed before McQueen's mother wrote him.        He told McQueen's parents to be brave because that's what       their son would have wanted. The ``brave deeds of such men as       Berton'' were the reason ``that we enjoy peace today,''       Hughes wrote.        Palm wishes her mother had lived to know her brother had       been identified, but she died in 2008. Palm, a Christian,       believes her mother and grandmother were reunited with       McQueen in heaven long ago.        Family members felt new grief when the Army notified them       McQueen had been accounted for but were also thankful.        ``I consider it a miracle,'' Palm said. ``My whole lifetime       I've waited for something like this.''                            ____________________
