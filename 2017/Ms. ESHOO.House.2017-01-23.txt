 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss H.R. 290, the FCC  Process Reform Act of 2017.   I'm particularly proud of a bipartisan provision I first authored in  the 112th Congress that I'm pleased is included in this legislation  today. This provision would modify current FCC rules to allow three or  more Commissioners to hold non-public collaborative discussions, as  long as no agency action is taken.   Today, under the FCC's ``Sunshine Rule,'' three Commissioners or more  are prohibited from talking to each other outside of an official public  meeting. The FCC oversees industries representing approximately one- sixth of the American economy. It must be able to collaborate freely  and deliberate on our nation's most pressing communications issues,  from enhancing universal service and public safety, to making more  spectrum available for mobile broadband.   As Congress looks at ways to help modernize the FCC, this bipartisan,  commonsense provision will help to promote greater discussion among the  five FCC Commissioners and ensure they can benefit from each other's  expertise and experience. Through greater collaboration, the FCC will  be better positioned to respond to a fast-paced and rapidly growing  telecommunications industry in the 21st century.   I thank Chairman Walden for including this provision in the bill the  House has passed today.
