 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  now proceed to the immediate consideration of a bill, which is at the  desk, that provides alternative minimum funding rules for certain  single-employer plans maintained by a community newspaper; that the  bill be considered read a third time and passed; and that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.
