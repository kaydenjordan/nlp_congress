 Mr. President, I rise this evening in opposition to the  tax bill before us. I think the problem in our country isn't that  wealthy people in this country aren't wealthy enough; the problem is,  the wealth gap has grown to the highest levels in my lifetime. This  bill would make that wealth gap even bigger.   Senator Paul Wellstone often said: ``We all do better when we all do  better.'' He knew the economy does better when there is a strong middle  class and when working families have more money to spend.  Unfortunately, the Republican tax bill does the opposite of what Paul  Wellstone argued for. Instead of helping working families, it raises  taxes on at least 14 million of them, and it uses this revenue to give  $1 trillion to the superrich, all while adding $1.5 trillion to our  national debt. This is, at its core, an awful bill.   When President Trump took office, he pledged that he would look out  for the ``forgotten men and women,'' not the wealthy. This bill is a  betrayal of that commitment.   I believe Congress should work on a bipartisan basis to make our Tax  Code fairer and simpler for working families, and that is what I have  advocated for since I joined the Senate. Democrats have made a good- faith effort to work in a bipartisan manner on a tax reform bill with  Republicans, but Republicans have chosen, from the very start of this  Congress, to take a purely partisan approach that has left Democrats  entirely out of the discussion.   We all know this bill is being rushed through Congress so Republicans  can claim a legislative achievement by the end of the year. That is not  the way you get a fairer, simpler Tax Code. You get a fairer, simpler  Tax Code by having hearings with outside witnesses.  [[Page S7674]]  You get a fairer, simpler Tax Code by giving Americans an opportunity  to weigh in as it is being drafted, to review the bill, and to share  their views. You get a simpler, fairer Tax Code by doing it in a  bipartisan manner, not by excluding Democrats entirely from the  drafting of the bill.   The fast-track process Republicans are using is just like the  Republicans' equally partisan, equally secretive, and equally rushed  attempt to repeal and replace ObamaCare earlier this year. Americans  deserve better.   In their effort to get this bill through before Americans realize  just how damaging it is, many Republicans have made some misleading  claims about it.   For example, Republicans often cite the fact that the bill would  double the standard deduction that families can claim on their tax  return. That is true, but they always seem to leave out the very  important fact that their bill would also eliminate the personal  exemption. The personal exemption is about $4,000 for each family  member, so when compared with a $12,000 increase in the standard  deduction, it means households with two parents and more than one child  would be worse off under the Republican tax bill than under current  law; for example, with two children.   Sometimes they argue that doubling the child tax credit from $1,000  to $2,000 would offset the loss of the personal exemption, but under  their plan families who most need the help would get hardly anything  from the increase in the child tax credit, which is not refundable. So,  for instance, a family living off a minimum wage earner would benefit  by only about 75 more dollars under this bill's revised child tax  credit, not the full $1,000 some Republicans promise, but the  Republican bill would also now allow people earning up to $500,000 a  year to claim the full tax credit of $2,000 per child. That is $500,000  a year, up from $110,000 as it is now. So that is $75 more per child  for a minimum wage earner and $2,000 per child for someone making  $500,000 a year. That is just not fair.   We hear from my friends on the Republican side that tax cuts always  pay for themselves. Ask the people of Kansas about that. When Kansas  cut taxes in 2012 and in 2013, State revenues plummeted, Kansas slashed  university budgets, canceled highway projects, and had to borrow $1  billion to fund their public pension plan. Schools around the State  started going 4 days a week. Teachers moved across the river from  Kansas City, KS, to Kansas City, MO. From 2013 to mid-2017, the Kansas  economy underperformed that of nearly all its neighbors and the United  States overall in economic growth, private sector job creation,  passthrough business formation, and labor force participation. Finally,  corporations begged the legislature to raise their taxes, which they  did, over the Governor's veto.   That is Kansas; take the whole country. Bruce Bartlett, Ronald  Reagan's economic adviser, wrote a few weeks ago:         The Tax Reform Act of 1986 reduced the top personal tax       rate to just 28 percent from 50 percent, and the corporate       percent to 34 percent from 46 percent. Yet there was no       increase in the rate of economic growth in subsequent years,       and by 1990, the economy was in deep recession.    Tax cuts don't magically pay for themselves.   I would also like to highlight the Republican hypocrisy on budget  deficits. For many years, Republicans have used budget deficits as an  excuse to block important pieces of legislation. In fact, even now, we  are in danger of stripping health insurance away from 9 million  children because of difficulties finding offsets for reauthorization of  the Children's Health Insurance Program. Yet, when it comes to the tax  bill, only a handful of Republicans have raised concerns about the fact  that it would add $1.5 trillion to our national debt.   We know from experience that as soon as the ink is dry on this bill,  Republicans will cite the rising national debt caused by this bill as a  reason to cut key programs that millions of Americans use every day-- things like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, job training,  education, infrastructure, and affordable housing. In fact, under their  budget resolution that Republicans adopted just 2 months ago, they laid  out their plans for these reductions, which would include over $1  trillion in Medicaid cuts and $470 billion in Medicare cuts.   This bill would also trigger automatic cuts to some key programs. So  in exchange for the bill's minimum tax cuts for some working families,  starting in 2018, there would be an automatic 4-percent reduction in  Medicare payments and a zeroing out of other key accounts--a zeroing  out of the Crime Victims Fund, farm price support programs, and the  social services block grant that provides funds to Meals on Wheels,  youth counseling, and other important services for vulnerable people.   There are many better uses for $1.5 trillion. President Trump said he  wanted to work with Congress on a $1 trillion infrastructure package to  rebuild our roads, our airports, our ports, and to build broadband  across America. I have said I would like to work with the President and  my Republican colleagues on a comprehensive bill, but this bill would  make it impossible to enact a $1 trillion infrastructure package the  President promised and which we have really heard nothing about.   There are too many other flaws with the Republican bill to highlight  them all now, but I would like to raise one that is particularly  important to Minnesotans. The bill before us today would eliminate the  State and local tax deduction. It is an important deduction because  when people deduct the taxes they pay to their State and local  governments, first of all, it prevents the double taxation of their  income, and it enables our local communities to make investments in  public safety and education, childcare, and infrastructure. According  to the Tax Policy Center, 34 percent of Minnesotans claim the State and  local tax deduction, with an average deduction of almost $13,000.  Eliminating this deduction means a significant tax increase for those  families and would make it harder for local communities in Minnesota to  raise the revenue necessary to make vital investments.   I have heard outrage over the Republican approach to tax reform from  a very wide range of my constituents. I have heard from Minnesota  farmers about how it would undermine agricultural cooperatives, which  are really important to Minnesota. I have heard from Minnesota students  who are concerned it will force them out of graduate school. I have  heard from Minnesota homebuilders and developers who say it would cut  affordable housing construction in half. I have heard from Realtors who  say the bill could crater the real estate market. I have heard from  many ordinary Americans who say the bill is simply unfair.   Americans deserve a fairer, simpler Tax Code, not the debt-funded  giveaway to the wealthy that Republicans are trying to force through  the Senate today. That is why I oppose this bill, and I urge my  colleagues to oppose it as well.   I yield the floor.
