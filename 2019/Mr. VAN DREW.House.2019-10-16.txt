 Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this time to  congratulate Nathan Mattias of Woolwich Township in south Jersey. He  achieved the honor of being an Eagle Scout.   For his Eagle Scout project, Nathan built benches with an improved  design to accommodate those in wheelchairs for easier access when  gardening for the Sisters of St. Francis, a retirement facility for  nuns in the Philadelphia area.   Through this project, Nathan discovered his passion of engineering  and plans on continuing his interest when he is in college. It is  people like Nathan who enact change by listening to the needs of those  in our local communities.   Keep up the good work, Nathan. I thank him for all he does for south  Jersey, and for the United States of America. He is truly our hero and  we are truly proud of him.                            ____________________
