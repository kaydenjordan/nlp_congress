 DAVIS of Illinois, Mr. Speaker, again, I stand on this  Floor and oppose the myopic, Republican mission that asks hard-working  Americans to pay for wasteful tax cuts for wealthy corporations.   With baby boomers retiring and needing security, the first Republican  tax cuts seriously damaged the health of the Medicare Trust Fund. This  bill is more of the same--exploding the deficit and threatening Social  Security, Medicaid, and Medicare.   After decades of wage stagnation--when over 41 million laborers earn  less than $12 an hour, when almost none of their employers offer health  insurance, when more than one-quarter of Americans struggle to cover  housing costs--the Republican bill preferences health care industries  over lower health care costs for consumers.   Rather than fixing their Failed Tax Law's harmful provisions toward  hard-working Americans, this bill makes fixes for industry moguls.   This bill fails to roll back the double taxation on residents in  Illinois via the cap on the State and Local Income Tax Deduction.   This bill fails to restore the personal exemptions taken from  millions of families with children. This bill fails to help home owners  whose houses lost value by capping the mortgage interest deduction.   Rather than helping all Americans affected by disasters, the  Republicans are picking and choosing which disaster victims that they  feel deserve relief.   Rather than uniting Americans, this bill seeks to divide our places  of worship by allowing churches and religious organizations to make  political statements.   People in Chicago expect government to help real people. I oppose  this dangerous bill that threatens the economic security of our country  and citizenry.
