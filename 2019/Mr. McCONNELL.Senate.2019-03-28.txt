 Madam President, in recent months, my home State of  Kentucky has been hit by severe weather. Over half of our 120 counties  have reported flood damage. Governor Bevin has placed the entire  Commonwealth under a state of emergency and mobilized resources to help  with recovery. Local, State, and Federal emergency officials have  started assessing the flood damage. My staff and I are monitoring the  progress to provide assistance wherever we can. I look forward to  meeting with the Kentucky emergency management director later today to  get the latest updates.   Unfortunately, my State is not alone--far from it. Many States are  currently bearing heavy burdens in the wake of powerful natural  disasters. Families in Florida and the Carolinas are still picking up  the pieces from a damaging hurricane season. In Alabama and Georgia,  recovery is just beginning after vicious tornadoes. The effects of  serious flooding remain across the Southeast. In places in the Midwest,  such as Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, and Nebraska, many Americans are still  waiting, praying, and working to mitigate the destruction from  devastating flooding. Many communities are still literally under water.   I know right now the entire Senate is especially mindful of the  destruction in America's heartland, so I am grateful for the efforts of  several colleagues to bring forward a package of supplemental disaster  relief funds to address the most urgent needs.   The legislation we are considering this week would help growers and  producers with storm-related crop losses. It would help local  infrastructure--from roads to schools and hospitals--resume full  operation. It would help our Nation's military restore readiness at  bases and installations that were caught in harm's way.   Thanks to Chairman Shelby, Senators Isakson, Perdue, Scott, Rubio,  and others, we will have the opportunity to deliver critical resources  to the communities facing the long road back to normal. I hope each of  our colleagues will join me in supporting this measure, which will do  just that.                            ____________________     Now, Madam President, on an entirely different matter,  this week, the American people saw our Democratic colleagues go on  [[Page S2064]]  the record on a truly astonishing policy proposal--a truly astonishing  policy proposal.   After months of enthusiastic declarations of support, after tripping  over one another to prove their devotion to the far-left core of the  new Democratic Party, the vast majority of our colleagues across the  aisle were unable to vote against even an obviously ludicrous proposal  to tank the U.S. economy and to leave American workers out in the cold.   You might think that after their radical proposal met with such an  inglorious end, my colleagues might choose to pause and take stock.  Well, think again. Just yesterday, our Democratic colleagues introduced  a Senate version of Speaker Pelosi's sweeping legislation to rewrite  the rules of American politics to benefit one side--new Washington  rules for how citizens can exercise political speech, new Washington  systems to funnel taxpayer dollars into the pockets of political  campaigns, and an unprecedented Washington intrusion into State and  local election law all across our country.   As I have argued before, it conveniently turns out that the vast  majority of their proposed changes seem tailored to help more Democrats  get elected and stay elected; hence my name for this legislation: the  Democratic politician protection act.   Apparently, our friends are under the impression that if Democrats  aren't winning as many elections as they would like, then the entire  process by which we elect our representatives must certainly be broken.  If Democrats don't like an outcome, then the rules themselves need to  be tossed aside. This seems to be emerging as a kind of pattern on the  other side of the aisle.   When our Constitution, our institutions, or the American people  disappoint our Democratic colleagues, instead of taking the hint and  perhaps making their own positions more mainstream, they instead look  to change the rules.   After they failed to defeat the nomination of Justice Kavanaugh last  year, liberal leaders decided the underlying structure of the American  judiciary needed to be radically overhauled to suit their whims.   They set out to rehabilitate the absurd notion of ``court-packing''-- a term that since the 1930s has been synonymous in American history  with the idea of an unprincipled power grab.   The idea that Democrats sometimes lose Presidential elections and  that Republican Presidents sometimes subsequently appoint Supreme Court  Justices is apparently no longer tolerated. Instead of filling the  existing vacancies, why shouldn't the next Democratic President just  make up a bunch of new ones--create a bunch of new ones--so the far  left can stack the Court? Forget about nine Justices. Forget about  judges who don't wear red robes or blue robes but black robes. Forget  about interpreting and applying our laws and Constitution the way they  are written instead of how partisans might wish they were written. The  far left wants to forget about all of that because Democrats would  rather rewrite the rules.   So out of the ash heap of history came this talk of ``court- packing''--a notion that would threaten the rule of law and our  American judicial system as we have long understood it. It is a truly  radical proposal that has been dead and buried by bipartisan consensus  for almost a century. But now President Obama's Attorney General, Eric  Holder, says: ``We should be talking even about expanding the number of  people who serve on the Supreme Court, if there is a Democratic  president.'' One of our Senate colleagues, who is currently running for  President, called this an ``interesting idea that I would have to think  more about.'' The New York Times reported that at a recent campaign  event, another Democratic candidate said that he is open to the idea  after being asked about it by a member of a new far-left group that is  literally named--this is their name; listen to this--``Pack the  Courts.''   I hope the lion's share of our Democratic colleagues will speak out  forcefully against exhuming this thoroughly discredited idea. I hope my  colleagues will have the courage to look these far-left agitators in  the eye and tell them that some traditions and some institutions are  more important than partisan point-scoring. But given that we have  already seen Democrats rush headlong to embrace schemes like the  Democratic politician protection act, Medicare for None, and the so- called Green New Deal, I have to say, at this point, that kind of  courageous statement would come as a pleasant surprise.                            ____________________     Madam President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk due for a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw  Amendment Nos. 5 and 6.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I have an amendment at the desk and ask the clerk to  report.    I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.    I have a second-degree amendment at the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the reading be dispensed  with.    I have an amendment to the text of the underlying  bill.    I ask unanimous consent that the reading be dispensed  with.    I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.    I have a second-degree amendment at the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum  calls for the cloture motions be waived.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, what is the pending business?    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk for  H.R. 268.    Mr. President, I come to the floor to discuss the  unprecedented obstruction that has faced President Trump's nominees for  the past 26 months--and counting--and to announce that the Senate is  going to do something about it.   The systematic, across-the-board delay and obstruction that have  crippled this administration's nominations are unique in American  history.   Every Presidential election since Adams beat Jefferson in 1796 has  left some Senators disappointed that their side lost. There is always a  losing side, and they are never happy about it. But the past 2 years  have been the first time--the first time ever--that the unhappy party  has used Senate procedure to systematically blockade the new  President's nominees and prevent him from even staffing up his  administration. Let me say that again. Since January 2017, for the  first time in the 230-year history of the U.S. Senate, a minority of  Senators have used Senate procedure to systematically prevent the  President of the United States from putting a full team in place.   During the first 2 years of the last six Presidential administrations  before President Trump, 24 total cloture votes had to be held to  advance a nomination, but in President Trump's first 2 years, there  were 128 cloture votes on nominees.   For 42 different executive branch positions, cloture votes have been  required for the first time in history--the first time ever.  Uncontroversial Assistant Secretaries and Agencies' general counsels  never required cloture votes before--ever--until this particular  Democratic minority.   Just compare President Trump's first 2 years to President Obama's.  Overall, we have confirmed 22 percent fewer nominations for President  Trump and sent more than twice as many back to the White House.   Take just the Foreign Relations Committee as one example. The share  of nominees sent to the Foreign Relations Committee who were still not  confirmed after President Trump's first 2 years was more than three  times--three times--what it was for President Obama.   To be clear, the lion's share of all of these are not controversial,  high-profile figures. In most cases, they are unambiguously well- qualified nominees for critical but lower profile jobs.   For example, it took more than 6 months--6 months--and several tragic  railroad accidents that made national news before a minority of  Senators would allow us to confirm the President's nominee to head the  Federal Railroad Administration. That is 6 months and several railroad  accidents to get us to confirm the President's nominee to head the  Federal Railroad Administration.   He had worked in railroads as an engineer, manager, and executive for  45 years. Our colleagues on the Commerce Committee voice-voted him out  of committee. Actually, when Democrats finally allowed his nomination  to come to the floor--when they finally allowed that--he was confirmed  by voice vote. Despite the fact that nobody actually objected to this  nominee, this important job was held empty for 6 long months. It is  obstruction for obstruction's sake.   It is the same story with even the least controversial judicial  nominees. Last January, it took more than a week of floor time to  confirm four district judges, all of whom had been voice-voted out of  the Judiciary Committee the previous autumn, but there were still  months of delays. Then cloture votes were required for each, but once  we finally plowed through to the confirmation votes, they were all  confirmed unanimously.   There were months of delays and procedural roadblocks for four  bipartisan nominees whom not a single Senator actually opposed.   This is not a principled maneuver, not thoughtful use of minority  powers, but obstruction simply for the sake of obstruction.   This historic campaign isn't fair to our duly elected President, and,  more importantly, it is not fair to the American people. The American  people deserve the government they elected. They deserve important  positions to be promptly filled with capable individuals, not held open  indefinitely out of political spite.   As we all acknowledge, from an institutional perspective, this is  completely unsustainable, but if we allow it to persist, it seems  guaranteed to become standard operating procedure for every  administration going forward.   Let's assume 2 years from now that my side is in the minority, and  there is a Democratic President. If we allow this to persist, we will  be doing the same thing to those guys that they have been doing to us.  It will be the new norm.   Some of our colleagues who are leading the systematic obstruction are  actually running for President themselves. Well, these tactics will  virtually guarantee that any future Democratic administration is  subjected to the same paralysis. Everybody will be doing it.   Is this how the American Government is supposed to work from here on  out--whichever party loses the White House basically prohibits the new  President from standing up an administration?   We can't accept this. This just can't be allowed to continue. We need  to restore the Senate to the way it functioned for literally decades.   Remember, the idea that nominees would regularly require cloture  votes was completely foreign to the Senate until this sad chapter began  during the administration of President Bush 41, in the early 2000s.   As of 1968--1968--cloture had never been required for any  nomination--any nomination. As of 1978, it had been required for two-- two as of 1978.   Until 2003, in no conference--none--had more than 12 cloture motions  ever been needed for nominations. But now, again, President Trump's  chosen nominees faced 128 cloture votes in the Congress that just past.  So this entire conversation is a modern aberration. This hasn't been  going on forever. This is a fairly recent thing. This behavior is new.  We need to restore the Senate's tradition in this area. Fortunately, we  have a clear roadmap to do just that.   In 2013, immediately after President Obama's reelection, 78 Senators,  including me, passed a bipartisan standing order to speed up the  consideration of many Presidential nominees. Seventy-eight Members of  this body passed a standing order to help President Obama speed up the  Executive Calendar.   It reduced the postcloture time for most nominations without touching  the Supreme Court, circuit courts, or the highest levels of the  executive branch. Essentially everything else got  [[Page S2082]]  a more streamlined process so nominees could be confirmed more  efficiently.   Again, President Obama had just been inaugurated for the second time  days earlier. You better believe Republicans were disappointed we had  lost, but we did not throw a systematic tantrum. Instead, a sizable  number of us came over and joined the Democrats to help the Senate  process noncontroversial nominations, as it had for the vast bulk of  the history of the Senate. I was a Republican leader in the minority,  and I still supported it. We judged if it was the right thing to do,  and we did it. The standing order passed 78 to 16.   So, today, I am filing cloture on a resolution that takes that  bipartisan effort as its blueprint. This resolution from Senator Blunt  and Senator Lankford would implement very similar steps and make them a  permanent part of the Senate going forward.   The Supreme Court, circuit courts, Cabinet-level executive positions,  and certain independent boards and commissions would not change, but  for most other nominations--for literally the hundreds of lower level  nominations that every new President makes--postcloture debate time  would be reduced from 30 hours to 2 hours.   This would keep the floor moving. It would facilitate more efficient  consent agreements, and, most importantly, it would allow the  administration--finally, 2 years into its tenure--to staff numerous  important positions that remain unfilled with nominees who have been  languishing.   This resolution has come up through the regular order, through the  Rules Committee, and next week we will vote on it. It deserves the same  kind of bipartisan vote that Senator Schumer and Senator Reid's  proposal received back during the Obama administration.   I understand that many of my Democratic colleagues have indicated  they would be all for this reform as long as it doesn't go into effect  until 2021, when they obviously hope someone else might be in the White  House, but they are reluctant to support it now. Give me a break. That  is unfair on its face.   My Democratic colleagues were more than happy to support a similar  proposal back in 2013 under President Obama. They whisper in our ears  privately that they would support it now if it took effect in 2021, oh,  but they can't support it now, especially under these unprecedented  circumstances, simply because we have a Republican President.   Fair is fair. Members of this body should only support reforms that  they would be as ready to support in the minority as they are in the  majority.   Put another way, if my side is in the minority 2 years from now, I  don't think this will be unfair, and it will not disadvantage us in the  wake of a new Democratic President. This is a change the institution  needs--a change the institution made already, basically, with a 2-year  experiment when President Obama was in office. This is reform that  every Member should embrace when their party controls the White House  and when it does not control the White House.   I urge every one of my colleagues: Let's get the Senate back to a  normal historical pattern for handling Presidential nominations. Let's  give President Trump, as well as all future Presidents, a functional  process for building their administrations. Let's give the American  people the government they actually elected, and let's seize this  chance to do so through the bipartisan regular order that we are  pursuing here, both in committee and now on the floor.   The status quo is unsustainable for the Senate and for the country.  It is unfair to this President and to future Presidents of either  party. It cannot stand, and it will not stand.    I still have the floor.    I move to proceed to Calendar No. 24, S. Res. 50.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session for the consideration of Calendar Nos. 130  through 156 and all nominations on the Secretary's desk; that the  nominations be confirmed; that the motions to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate; that  no further motions be in order; that any statements related to the  nominations be printed in the Record; that the President be immediately  notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative  session.    Mr. President, I understand the Senator from Oregon is  propounding a question. If he would repeat it, I would appreciate it.    Is the Senator asking me a question?    Mr. President, let me say that we have had a number of  bills that were brought to the floor open for amendment. One of the  things we devolved into here, another unfortunate precedent, is Members  objecting to time agreements on amendments from either side. So even if  the majority leader calls up a bill and has it open for amendment,  unless Members of the Senate in both parties will allow there to be  time agreements so that we can actually have votes on amendments, it  gets bogged down.   I think the complaint of my friend from Oregon is legitimate. I have  been very frustrated by the fact that when I  [[Page S2083]]  call up a bill and open it up for amendments, I have Members on both  sides preventing each other's amendments from getting a vote. I share  the frustration of my colleague from Oregon, but I assure him that when  I call up a bill and say that it is open for amendment, it is open for  amendment. It is just that it requires Senatorial bipartisan  cooperation to set time agreements to actually have such votes.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent--I think I have a UC  agreement, a UC pending.    Mr. President, in order to guarantee a particular  amendment would get a vote without consent, we would have to be able to  get 60 votes and vote cloture to advance the amendment.   I will just reiterate to my friend from Oregon that his complaint is  legitimate, but it does require, no matter what the majority leader  says with regard to openness of the bill, some level of bipartisan  cooperation in order to process amendments. We have tried that on  numerous occasions, and Members on both sides have sort of hunkered  down and objected to each other's amendments, thereby making the  amendment process, in an open fashion, simply impossible.   I do have a consent agreement pending. I don't know whether the  Senator from Oregon wants to continue to object to all of these--   --nominations, which would include people from the  Marine Corps, the Navy, the Air Force, and the Army. I was seeking the  military promotions of these people who are serving our country in the  Armed Forces.    I ask unanimous consent that the Senate be in a period  of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to  10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions be discharged from  further consideration of H.R. 276 and the Senate proceed to its  immediate consideration.    I further ask unanimous consent that the bill be read  a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Judiciary Committee be discharged from further consideration and the  Senate now proceed to S. Res. 69.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to; the Burr amendment to the preamble at the desk be agreed to; the  preamble, as amended, be agreed to; and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Indian  Affairs Committee be discharged from further consideration and the  Senate now proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 100.    I know of no further debate on the resolution.    I ask unanimous consent that the preamble be agreed to  and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Judiciary Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. Res.  118 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Foreign Relations Committee be discharged from further consideration of  S. Res 124 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the filing  deadline for first-degree amendments with respect to the cloture  motions filed during today's session relating to H.R. 268 be at 4 p.m.,  Monday, April 1, 2019.
