 Madam Speaker, this impeachment sham needs to stop. We  all know what this is really about: overturning the results of the 2016  election.   From the outset, Speaker Pelosi and Chairman Schiff have conducted  this inquiry behind closed doors, out of sight of the American people  and us, without a vote to authorize it.   They have ignored due process, completely disregarded precedent, and  made it clear that politics and partisanship are more important than  fairness and transparency.   They denied our side of the aisle the right to subpoena evidence.  They have excluded the President's legal team from participating in  hearings, cross-examining witnesses, or presenting evidence. This body,  quite simply, has been turned into a kangaroo court fixated on  unseating the President at any cost.   Our Constitution, our basic, fundamental principles of fairness, and  the millions of Americans who made their voices heard in the 2016  election are being snubbed.   Madam Speaker, it is time to stop this sham.                            ____________________
