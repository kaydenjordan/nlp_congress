 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle for voting to include my amendment to the NDAA that  will allow our armed services to aid small farmers across the country.   Two weeks ago, the USDA released its congressional district-specific  data for the ``Census of Agriculture'' and reported that in my  district, New York's 19th Congressional District, 96 percent of the  farms there are small family farms.   During our most recent in-district work period, I visited small farms  back home in Rensselaer and Montgomery Counties and learned more about  their work with organizations to help veterans gain the skills needed  to transition to jobs in agriculture.   Today, the House passed my amendment that requires a report from  certain Defense agencies on programs, policies, and practices relating  to small farms, farms owned by new and beginning farmers, veteran  farmers, and minority farmers in order to better understand how much  the Armed Forces are working with small farms to supply commissaries  and feed servicemembers.   With this data, Congress and Defense agencies can work together to  expand opportunity for our small family farmers.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for standing with me on this very  important issue.                            ____________________
