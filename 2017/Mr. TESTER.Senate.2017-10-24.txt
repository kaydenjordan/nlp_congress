 Mr. President, Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria have  left a path of destruction along the Texas gulf coast, Florida, and  Puerto Rico. The damage caused by these storms will be felt for many  years to come.   This emergency supplemental is another step forward to recovery for  the millions of Americans who call these places home. But I want to  remind my colleagues that there is still an ongoing natural disaster in  the West that is leaving families displaced, costing taxpayers billions  of dollars, destroying structures, and taking human lives.   As of today, 5,000 firefighters are still battling more than a  quarter of a million acres of wildfires burning across the West.   In my home State of Montana, despite an early snowfall, families this  last weekend in Musselshell County were forced to evacuate after a fire  ripped through a dry landscape and put their homes and livelihoods at  risk.   In California, more than 8,000 structures have been lost to wildfires  this year alone, and with temperatures expected to be in the 90s all  week, there doesn't seem to be any end in sight.   Across the country, in total, fires have burned nearly 9 million  acres--significantly more than the yearly average--and 1.2 million of  those acres are in Montana. These fires have cost the taxpayers nearly  $3 billion to date.   Quite frankly, these wildfires have been devastating in Montana and  in States across the West. It is critically important that we take  quick action to mitigate the damage caused by these fires and get  communities back on their feet.   The funds in this emergency package will reimburse the Forest Service  for the funds borrowed to fight wildfires. When the Forest Service has  to borrow from its nonfire accounts to cover firefighting on the  ground, we lose out on critical maintenance, mitigation, and  restoration work. This funding will pay back those accounts and support  the work needed to recover after a recordbreaking fire season. This  funding can help restore the trails and roads that were lost in fires,  as well as keep our fishing streams clean and clear from runoff this  spring. It will get folks back in the woods, thinning, cutting, and  removing debris. It can provide the Forest Service with the resources  to quickly salvage the dead and dying trees that are still usable and  get that timber into our local mills.   Unfortunately, though, this bill fails to provide a long-term budget  fix to pay to fight wildfires. Fire seasons are getting longer and more  intense, which is quickly transforming the Forest Service from a forest  management agency into a forest firefighting agency.   Folks, our climate is changing. History is telling us that our fire  seasons are becoming more intense and they are becoming longer. Longer  fire seasons will mean more borrowing from the Forest Service to fight  these wildfires. We need a long-term fix.   Fires are burning a hole through the Forest Service budget, which too  often leaves our forests unmanaged and at further risk for more  catastrophic fires in the future. Money that should be used to curb the  fire risks, maintain and improve forest health, research and develop  better forest policies, and fund the work that must get done to make  our forests more resilient is borrowed to fight wildfires. We must  change the way we are paying for fighting wildfires.   The bipartisan Wildfire Disaster Funding Act is one step toward that  fix. We must keep pressing forward to get this bill signed into law.  Then we need to adjust the disaster budget cap to make sure this is  truly a long-term fix.   As I said, this bill doesn't contain all of the answers we need to  reduce wildfires, but it is no doubt a step in the right direction. It  lets the Forest Service treat wildfires just like other natural  disasters. This means more reliable support for forest management  projects and emergency funding for catastrophic wildfire seasons.   These important wildfire and forest resources, combined with  providing the necessary FEMA, flood insurance, and food assistance to  those displaced by hurricanes, will take us a major step forward after  a series of devastating natural disasters. But I want to underscore  that we aren't at the finish line yet, and I will work with Chairman  Boozman on the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee to ensure  that all Montanans and all Americans impacted by natural disasters  aren't left waiting for Congress to act.   Folks from both parties are going to have to work together to ensure  that every community impacted by hurricanes, floods, and fires will  have the resources to recover and turn the page. Americans directly  impacted by these natural disasters continue to wake up each morning  displaced, hungry, without power, and surrounded by destruction.  Congress must remain diligent and ensure these communities have the  support that they need and that they deserve.   Finally, I will just say this: We are here today talking about the  disaster funding bill. We are talking about the disaster funding bill  because disasters are becoming more and more common. It is not going to  change. We need to address the root cause of this, which is an ever- changing climate. Until we do, we are going to continue to see taxpayer  dollars go out the door for disasters year after year.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Strange). The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I rise today to honor two titans of  military and community service, who will be laid to rest forever in  Arlington National Cemetery.   Frederick Hollister Campbell and Amy Strohm Campbell were, together,  a force to be reckoned with.   Fred served the United States in the Marine Corps during World War  II, the Korean war and the Vietnam war--one of only 46,000 Americans to  fight in three wars. Fred was a member of the American Legion Post 27  in Missoula, MT.   Amy earned a master's degree and began a teaching career during a  time when few women did either. She became active in the Navy-Marine  Corps Wives, Daughters of the American Revolution, and the  Philanthropic Educational Organization and was a life member of both  the Veterans of Foreign Wars and American Legion Auxiliaries.   At the Battle of Iwo Jima, Fred dug trenches while taking heavy  Japanese fire from the mountains above. His bravery saved the lives of  250 of his fellow marines and earned him the Navy Commendation Medal.  He fought in the Battle of Okinawa and was a part of the reconstruction  effort in Japan after the war ended. Fred picked up the language and  enjoyed friendships with the locals, spurred on by a shared love of  stamp collecting.   During law school, Fred was selected for officer's candidate school.  His transition from private to officer earned him the informal title of  a mustang in military circles. Fred reenlisted for Active Duty to serve  in the Korean war.   It was during this period of service that he met Amy on a blind date  at a square dance.   They danced through life together for 61 years. The life they built  brought them a treasured daughter, Susan, and many trips to Europe and  one voyage through the Panama Canal.   Fred continued his career as an attorney for the Marine Corps, and  his service culminated with a third enlistment during which he served  in Vietnam. He retired from the U.S. Marines as a lieutenant colonel  after 25 years, 2 months, and 17 days. Amy and Susan were able to fill  a large shadowbox of Fred's medals as a gift for his 85th birthday.   Fred and Amy didn't slow down once they hit retirement. Fred earned a  Ph.D. in American history at the age of 73. He taught at Colorado  College and the University of Colorado for 13 years. Amy continued her  involvement in service and military organizations in Colorado, Montana,  and California.   Fred and Amy enriched the lives of friends, family, and strangers  alike. Now, they will rest forever in Arlington near the statue  commemorating the battle of Iwo Jima, where Fred proved his mettle by  saving 250 fellow marines' lives 72 years ago.   It is my honor to present their story today.   On behalf of a grateful nation, I commend Lt. Col. Frederick  Hollister Campbell and Amy Strohm Campbell for their lives of service  to our Nation.                            ____________________
