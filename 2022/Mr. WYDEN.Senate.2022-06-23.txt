 Mr. President, I am honored to recognize Karen Fisher for  her decades of leadership toward innovation and systematic change to  improve the health of Americans. Karen may be retiring from a momentous  health policy career, but the Nation will long feel the positive impact  of her work.   From 2011 to 2016, the Senate Finance Committee was fortunate to  benefit from Karen's expertise on the Medicare program and other key  health policy issues. Serving as senior health counsel, Karen led the  committee's work in 2015 to permanently repeal the outdated and flawed  sustainable growth rate--SGR--formula previously used to determine  Medicare physician payments and to replace it with a new payment system  that advances value-based care for the millions who rely on the  Medicare program as a lifeline.   In addition to her historic role in permanently retiring the SGR,  Karen oversaw legislative activities related to the Center for Medicare  and Medicaid Innovation--CMMI--and the Patient-Centered Outcomes  Research Institute--PCORI--as she uplifted the transformative effect  alternative payment models could have in driving greater commitments to  quality and value in healthcare. She also served--and continues to  serve--as a mentor to early-career staff on the Committee and across  Capitol Hill, offering professional guidance and networking  opportunities for the next generation of female leaders.   At the Association of American Medical Colleges--AAMC--Karen has  continued her commitment to improve healthcare through public policy.  Throughout her nearly 6 years as chief public policy officer, the AAMC  has been an important voice on the need to expand access to healthcare  nationwide by strengthening coverage through both the Affordable Care  Act and the Medicaid program and by addressing shortages of physicians  and other health professionals.   Her more than 25 years of experience also have been an essential  asset during the COVID pandemic, as she liaised between Federal  policymakers and the academic medicine community to support the heroic  efforts of the country's health professionals and scientists in  treating patients, expanding access to telehealth, developing and  administering COVID tests, advancing research on new countermeasures,  developing and deploying vaccines, and enhancing health equity  interventions.   I know that I speak for health policy professionals nationwide as I  express my gratitude for Karen's dedication, talent, mentorship,  leadership, and persistence in public service and in betterment of the  Nation's health.   Thank you, Karen. I am wishing you and your family all the best for a  very well-deserved retirement.                            ____________________
