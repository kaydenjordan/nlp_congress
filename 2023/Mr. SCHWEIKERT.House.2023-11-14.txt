 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, to the chairman and ranking member,  their stamina is impressive while going through all of this. I still  think we should change the House rules and allow us to drink coffee on  the floor.   Mr. Chairman, the first amendment here is basically just shifting  some money to diabetic retinopathy. The reason for this is that we have  a fixation about diabetes and cures and procedures that are actually  now making a difference. In the last couple of years, there are now a  couple of drugs but also a laser procedure.   What is important about this is if you are 40 years old with  diabetes, one out of three people is going to start to suffer this  disease of the eye where the veins are being traumatized by the  diabetes.   All I am trying to do here is move some money because there is  progress being made, and I would like it to continue being made in this  category.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, to the gentlewoman, I am trying to be  just an honest actor on this one. It is something we have spent a lot  of time on.   The reality is that diabetes itself is something I wish as a body we  would actually have a much more honest and, in some ways, brutal  conversation.   We expect it to be about 33 percent of all healthcare spent, 31  percent of Medicare. It turns out if we were willing to talk about  diabetes and even the more difficult discussion of obesity and the  cursors, it could be the single biggest effect on U.S. debt but also in  labor force participation. Let's be honest. We are taking on misery.   Where this partially also came to us is the new procedures partially  pioneered and advocated by these is now a diabetic retinopathy eye  laser surgery and trying to get these more into the field.                                time  0010    So this is a shift. We actually believe it is reasonably well-vetted.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this is actually one of the occasions  where we as Members of Congress actually should take a little bit of a  victory lap.   For those of us in the desert Southwest we have something called  Valley fever. It is a fungus in the soil. For most people it causes a  little bit of scarring in the lung, It may seem like you have a flu for  a few days. For some people--and I always mispronounce this--there is a  differentiated version where it breaks out of the lung. I have a  neighbor who is a former Vietnam helicopter pilot that within his hands  he has to have the Valley fever carved out of his bones. It is  horrible. I met someone at the National Institutes of Health a few  years ago, a young African-American male that was just traveling  through the Southwest, picked up these fungi, picked up a spore, and it  was dissolving his spine. They were wiring him back together.   Well, guess what has happened? Almost 8 years ago Kevin McCarthy, who  is also in one of the pandemic areas, as I am, myself, in the Maricopa  County area, we actually started to do this. We moved some resources  around. We are on the cusp of the vaccine. The canine vaccine is out,  we believe, this December, and it turns out they believe that basically  the same formulary will work with humans, and the phase I trials in  humans, I actually believe, begins this coming year.   What is miraculous about this is the concept of a vaccine for a  fungus, and it may actually cover much more than what we call Valley  fever. This is a big deal. This is actually in some ways a small amount  of money, considering the amounts that are spent on this particular  disease, but it is partially because as we are getting ready to head to  the human trials now, it just seemed rational to sort of keep the  progress going.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, should I be creeped out that we are  about to have a group hug? It is late at night.   Look, for those of us that refer to this often as cocci, this is more  than just the desert Southwest. Do you understand we are now actually  seeing versions of these fungi in northern Minnesota, Wisconsin, and  other parts as it moves through the country.   Why this one is important, instead of just plussing up something to  just continue to maintain services, this is actually moving some  resources around because we are on the cusp of the cure. For those of  us who have ever tolerated my evening diatribes, I believe the morality  is in the cure, in the misery, in the cost.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.  [[Page H5850]]     Mr. Chairman, look, this is actually a just an  amendment I have introduced on a number of these bills to make a point.  I am not going to ask for a vote on it, but I do want us to  conceptually think about something, and I have been trying to find  forms to say it over and over and over.   We borrow every dime we as Members of Congress vote on. Every dime of  defense is now borrowed. Every dime of nondefense discretionary now is  borrowed. Last fiscal year we had, what, 300 billion, maybe 400 billion  of let's call it Medicare, but in mandatory, that was borrowed.   In this piece of legislation 26.2 percent is our best calculation of  the resources here--and many of them are really good programs, but we  are borrowing it to send it to entities that do have their own taxing  authority.   It is an uncomfortable conversation, but I do want us to think about  it as we get more and more of our financial stresses, as our borrowing  costs now--we saw Treasury yesterday basically released an update  saying gross interest this fiscal year will top a trillion dollars.   Do you know what that means? Social Security is our number one spend;  interest just became our number two spend; Medicare is our number three  spend; and defense now is our number four spend. We are not going to  balance the budget through discretionary, but somewhere here--I don't  know how to get it into our lexicon and our culture that everything we  now vote on as Members of Congress comes off of borrowed money.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I am not going to go into correcting the  TCJA math, but I would point out Democrats functionally, through the  Biden administration, have borrowed $4.8 trillion in functionally 3  years. The 1.7, actually the multiplier, if you look at the tax  receipts, being on Ways and Means.   I do want to go to a point. The gentlewoman actually just made my  morality argument. These are important programs. They serve a purpose,  but yet our failure to actually address the debt, because the fact of  the matter is the primary driver of U.S. debt is our demographics,  something we don't like to say. We got old. Today, and the 30 years  forward, 100 percent of the growth of debt--and our office now is  calculating $130 billion to $140 billion during that time, particularly  if we start to calculate in the new interest rate regime. Medicare, and  if we backfill Social Security in 9 years when the trust fund is gone,  it is going to consume every available dollar. You are going to see  programs like this that we care about squeezed.   Actually, my point is, if these are moral, if they serve a purpose,  our inability to have an honest conversation about the debt is immoral.  I have come here today--and even last night, I spent 1 hour showing  Democrat tax hikes, fine, but the tax hikes that have been proposed for  every category on $400,000 and up only brought in about 1.5 percent of  GDP when adjusted. We borrowed 8.4 last year.   We have a math problem, and I am saddened because it will always  break down to Republican versus Democrat. It is demographics.   I think the reason I do this amendment is to force a little bit of  contemplation of the reality we are at, that if we don't do this, these  are the sort of cuts that are in our future.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
