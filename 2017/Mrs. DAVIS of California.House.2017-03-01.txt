 Mr. Chairman, I rise to protect student  loan borrowers. Protecting our young people should be a priority for  every single Member of this Chamber. A major way that we are able to  defend our students is through the safeguards that are at stake today.   These protections, like provisions which ensure students are able to  find gainful employment or have recourse if a school misleads them,  have been integral in the wake of unethical practices by certain  schools. We have seen the damage that schools like ITT Tech and Ashford  University have done in districts like mine. And as a military town,  the students in San Diego are particularly vulnerable to bad actors in  the for-profit education industry.   I can tell you, Mr. Chair, I have heard from students who can't get  the degrees they need to provide a better life for their families;  veterans who write to me imploring us to protect the men and women who  would have spent their lives protecting us; students who write to me  frustrated by this Chamber's insistence on deregulation for  deregulation's sake; and many more who write letters saying, education  is important to us. And we believe it should be important to you as  well.   Let's prove them right, Mr. Chair. Let's show that education is  important to us, and let's commit to keeping key provisions for  students intact.                                time  1315     Mr. Chairman, I rise to suppose the ESEA  title I protection amendment.   We all know education, at its core, is a civil rights issue. We have  a responsibility to ensure that every student has access to a world- class education, and this is especially true for children who come from  families with limited means.   For our working class families, a quality education can be--and  actually is--the ladder which raises an entire family's prospects. The  protections that we are debating today ensure that these students and  their schools are not shortchanged from the resources they need in  order to be successful. These are resources that they are entitled to  by law.   Last year's Every Student Succeeds Act was a very successful  bipartisan compromise, so let's not gut the protections that are  crucial for its effective implementation before it is even given a  chance.  [[Page H1411]]    A student's ZIP Code should not determine the quality of his or her  education. A family's income should not determine their child's career  prospects, and a school's location should not determine its resources.   Let's come together to protect our most vulnerable students because,  as we all know, today's investments in education will determine our  future.
