 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, all signs seem to suggest that later  this week, the House Democrats are finally going to do what many of  them have been foreshadowing for 3 years now and impeach President  Trump. It appears that the most rushed, least thorough, and most unfair  impeachment inquiry in modern history is about to wind down after just  12 weeks and that its slapdash work product will be dumped on us over  here in the Senate.   I will have much more to say to our colleagues and to the American  people if and when the House does move ahead. As we speak today, House  Democrats still have the opportunity to do the right thing for the  country and avoid setting this toxic new precedent. The House can turn  back from a cliff and not deploy this constitutional remedy of last  resort to deliver a predetermined partisan outcome. This morning, I  just want to speak to one very specific part of this.   Over the weekend, the Democratic leader decided to short-circuit the  customary and collegial process for laying the basic groundwork in  advance of a potential impeachment trial. The preferable path would  have been an in-person conversation, which nonetheless I still hope to  pursue. Instead, he chose to begin by writing me an 11-paragraph letter  on Sunday evening, delivering it by way of the news media, and  beginning a cable television campaign a few hours later.   The Democratic leader's letter is an interesting document from the  very beginning. For example, in the second of his 11 paragraphs, our  colleague literally misquotes the Constitution. That error actually  aligns with our colleague's apparent confusion about some of the deeper  questions. I will come back to that in a moment.   At first, our colleague's letter appears to request that a potential  impeachment trial adopt similar procedures to the Clinton impeachment  trial  [[Page S7060]]  back in 1999. Now, I happen to think that is a good idea. The basic  procedural framework of the Clinton impeachment trial served the Senate  and the Nation well, in my view. But the problem is that while the  Democratic leader notionally says he wants a potential 2020 trial to  look like 1999, he goes on to demand things that would break with the  1999 model.   In President Clinton's trial, we handled procedural issues in two  separate Senate resolutions that passed at different times. The first  resolution passed unanimously before the trial. It sketched out basic  things like scheduling, opening arguments, and the timing of a motion  to dismiss. Other, more detailed questions about the middle and the end  of the trial, including whether any witnesses would be called, were  reserved for a second resolution that was passed in the middle of the  trial itself. As a matter of fact, we passed it only after a number of  Democrats, including Senator Schumer himself, voted to dismiss the  case. They got a motion to dismiss before the Senate had even decided  whether to depose a single witness.   Instead of the tried-and-true 1999 model--start the trial and then  see how Senators wish to proceed--the Democratic leader wants to write  a completely new set of rules for President Trump. He wants one single  resolution up front instead of two or however many are needed. He wants  to guarantee up front that the Senate hear from very specific witnesses  instead of letting the body evaluate the witness issue after opening  arguments and Senators' questions, like back in 1999.   Very tellingly, our colleague from New York completely omits any  motions to dismiss the case, like the one he was happy to vote for  himself as a new Senator back in 1999.   Almost exactly 20 years ago today, prior to the Senate trial, Senator  Schumer said this on television--a direct quote--this is what he said:         Certainly any senator, according to the rules, could move       to dismiss, which is done. . . . Every day, in criminal and       civil courts throughout America, motions to dismiss are made.       And if a majority vote for that motion to dismiss, the       procedure could be truncated.    That was Senator Schumer in January of 1999, but now the same process  that Senator Schumer thought was good enough for President Clinton, he  doesn't want to afford President Trump. Go figure.   Look, most people understand what the Democratic leader is really  after: He is simply trying to lock in live witnesses. That is a strange  request at this juncture for a couple of reasons.   For one thing, the 1999 version of Senator Schumer vocally opposed  having witnesses--even when the question was raised after hours of  opening arguments from the lawyers, hours of questions from Senators,  and a failed motion to dismiss. How can he have prejudged that he  favors live witnesses so strongly this time before the Senate even has  articles in hand?   Moreover, presumably it will be the House prosecutors' job to ask for  the witnesses they feel they need to make their case. Why does the  Democratic leader here in the Senate want to predetermine the House  impeachment managers' witness request for them before the House has  even impeached the President? Might he--just might he be coordinating  these questions with people outside the Senate?   Here is one possible explanation: Maybe the House's public  proceedings have left the Democratic leader with the same impression  they have left many of us: that from everything we can tell, House  Democrats' slapdash impeachment inquiry has failed to come anywhere  near--anywhere near--the bar for impeaching a duly-elected President,  let alone removing him for the first time in American history. So those  who have been eagerly hoping for impeachment are starting to scramble.   Chairman Adam Schiff and House Democrats actively decided not to go  to court and pursue potentially useful witnesses because they didn't  want to wait for due process. Indeed, they threatened to impeach the  President if they had to go to court at all. That intentional,  political decision is the reason why the House is poised to send the  Senate the thinnest, least thorough Presidential impeachment in our  Nation's history.   By any ordinary legal standard, what the House Democrats have  assembled appears to be woefully, woefully inadequate to prove what  they want to allege. Now the Senate Democratic leader would apparently  like our Chamber to do House Democrats' homework for them. He wants to  volunteer the Senate's time and energy on a fishing expedition to see  whether his own ideas could make Chairman Schiff's sloppy work more  persuasive than Chairman Schiff himself bothered to make it. This  concept is dead wrong. The Senate is meant to act as judge and jury, to  hear a trial, not to rerun the entire factfinding investigation because  angry partisans rushed sloppily through it.   The trajectory that the Democratic leader apparently wants to take us  down before he has even heard opening arguments could set a nightmarish  precedent for our institution. If the Senate volunteers ourselves to do  House Democrats' homework for them, we will only incentivize an endless  stream of dubious partisan impeachments in the future, and we will  invite future Houses to paralyze future Senates with frivolous  impeachments at will.   This misunderstanding about constitutional roles brings me back to  something I raised earlier. The Democratic leader's letter to me, by  way of the press, literally misquoted the Constitution. Senator Schumer  wrote that we should exercise ``the Senate's `sole Power of  Impeachment' under the Constitution with integrity and dignity.'' He  attributed to the Senate the ``sole Power of Impeachment.'' Well, there  is his problem. That is the role the Constitution gives, actually, to  the House, not to the Senate. It gives it to the House. Article I,  section 2 says: ``The House of Representatives . . . shall have the  sole Power of Impeachment.'' It doesn't sound ambiguous to me.   If my colleague wants to read about our responsibilities here in the  Senate, he needs to turn to the next page. Article I, section 3 says:  ``The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments.'' We  don't create impeachments over here; we judge them.   The House chose this road. It is their duty to investigate. It is  their duty to meet the very high bar for undoing the national election.  As Speaker Pelosi herself once said, it is the House's obligation to  ``build an ironclad case to act.'' That is Speaker Pelosi. ``It is the  House's obligation to build an ironclad case to act.'' If they fail,  they fail. It is not the Senate's job to leap into the breach and  search desperately for ways to get to guilty. That would hardly be  impartial justice.   The fact that my colleague is already desperate to sign up the Senate  for new factfinding, which House Democrats themselves were too  impatient to see through, well, that suggests something to me. It  suggests that even Democrats who do not like this President are  beginning to realize how dramatically insufficient the House's rushed  process has been.   Well, look, I hope the House of Representatives sees that too. If the  House Democrats' case is this deficient and this thin, the answer is  not for the judge and jury to cure it over here in the Senate; the  answer is that the House should not impeach on this basis in the first  place. If the House plows ahead, if this ends up here in the Senate, we  certainly do not need jurors to start brainstorming witness lists for  the prosecution and demanding to lock them in before we have even heard  opening arguments.   I still believe the Senate should try to follow the 1999 model--two  resolutions--first thing's first. The middle and the end of this  process will come later.   So I look forward to meeting with the Democratic leader very soon and  getting our very important conversation back on the right foot.   (Mr. ROUNDS assumed the Chair.)                            ____________________     Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, there  remains a great deal of outstanding legislation the Senate must  complete for the American people before we adjourn for the holidays.   I was glad to see yesterday's overwhelming bipartisan vote to advance  the conference report to the 59th consecutive National Defense  Authorization Act. We moved it in the Senate by a vote of 76 to 6.   For months, unprecedented partisan delays threatened a nearly six- decade  [[Page S7061]]  tradition of expressing Congress's bipartisan commitment to our  national defense, but with the Senate's final vote later today, we will  finally put this vital legislation on the President's desk. I look  forward to voting to pass the NDAA today by another overwhelming  bipartisan vote for our servicemembers and the critical missions they  carry out.   Of course, the Senate needs to follow up the Defense authorization  bill with appropriations measures and funding our national defense and  domestic priorities. Ensuring the Federal Government makes careful use  of taxpayer dollars is an uphill battle by definition. So it is  critical that we plan in advance and deliver clarity for the full year  ahead, rather than careen from one short-term stopgap to another. This  point is especially crucial for our Armed Forces. Underwriting the  commitments we make to the security of America's interests and our  allies are the investments we make in a 21st century fighting force.   Our Nation's top military commanders have been crystal clear: This  requires stable and predictable annual funding. It is as simple as  that. As the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Milley, put it  recently, continuing resolutions are ``a very ineffective and  inefficient use of the taxpayers' dollars.''   The Secretary of Defense hasn't minced words either: ``Every day that  a CR continues is one less day that we can invest in future  capabilities and future technologies.''   As a simple matter of good governance, avoiding another stopgap CR is  an important step. So I am encouraged that the House is preparing to  advance full-year appropriations bills this week. Obviously, what is  actually in these bills certainly matters. So I am glad to say the  efforts of Chairman Shelby, Senator Leahy, and their counterparts in  the House and White House negotiators have produced a bipartisan  package of full-year funding measures that will make needed investments  in our Nation's top priorities.   First is a topline increase in funding that our national defense  requires. For the third consecutive year, President Trump and  Republicans in Congress will deliver on our commitment to continue  rebuilding America's military after nearly a decade of forced belt- tightening.   As threats to the United States, our allies, and our interests  continue to emerge and evolve, this work is more important than ever.  America no longer stands unchallenged in the international system.   As Russia tests the reach of its meddling influence in Europe and the  Middle East, as China invests heavily in reshaping the order of the  Asia-Pacific region in its image, a new era of great power competition  demands our attention and our action.   The defense funding measure the House will consider today answers  these realities with a significant increase in defense funding. Our  commanders will have more resources to modernize force structure,  develop cutting-edge weapon capabilities, and ensure that American  servicemembers receive the best training, equipment, and support  available. It includes much needed upgrades to the nuclear force that  backs up America's strategic posture, investments in hypersonic  technologies to keep pace with our biggest adversaries, and renewed  commitments to our servicemembers and their families here at home.   But our efforts are about more than equipping the U.S. military to  win a fight. The funding bill takes a comprehensive approach to the  security of the United States and our allies. It will unlock targeted  resources for countering the creeping influence of authoritarian powers  so military engagements become less likely in the first place.    I am particularly proud that, thanks to my own efforts, the  legislation modernizes the reporting requirements of the Hong Kong  Policy Act I sponsored back in 1992. It expands our support for  democracy in Hong Kong, including legal support to Hong Kong activists,  and increases the Countering Russian Influence Fund.   Of course, our work goes beyond defense and foreign affairs. We are  talking about full-year funding for the Federal Government's domestic  work as well, for example, big wins for the President's agenda to bring  more security to the southern border. This year's funding bills provide  another $1.4 billion for the border wall system plus more flexibility  on location than last year's funding. Despite the efforts of some House  Democrats during this process, Presidential authorities to transfer  necessary funds remain intact.   The bills also fund critical transportation infrastructure grants and  inland waterways projects. They provide for our Nation's continuing  fight against the opioid epidemic and help equip local authorities and  first responders combating the scourge of addiction nationwide.   I am very proud and pleased that this legislation also includes  Tobacco 21 legislation that I introduced with my friend from Virginia,  Senator Kaine, this year. Raising the age of purchasing vaping devices  and other tobacco products to 21 years old nationwide will take bold,  direct action to stem the tide of early nicotine addiction upon our  Nation's youth.   In another provision I fought to include in this legislation, we will  secure the pension benefits of nearly 100,000 coal miners and their  dependents in Kentucky and across the country.   Another key section provides hundreds of millions of dollars more for  election security, another step in the work by Congress and this  administration to make sure the lapses that took place on the Obama  administration's watch in 2016 are not repeated.   The list goes on and on. All manner of important priorities will  benefit this bipartisan legislation. It is not just about what these  bills will continue, it is also about what this legislation will end.   It will take several more big bites out of the failures of ObamaCare  by repealing more of its burdensome taxes. Already Republicans have  repealed the board that ObamaCare set up to micromanage healthcare and  zeroed out the individual mandate penalty. We have already done that.  Now this legislation the House will pass today will repeal even more of  ObamaCare's misguided measures such as the medical device tax and the  Cadillac tax.   So there are two timeless truths about the appropriations process in  divided government. First, neither side will ever get what they would  consider to be perfect bills, but, second, full-year funding definitely  beats drifting endlessly from CR to CR. This legislation we expect the  House to send us today satisfies the important priorities for the White  House, for each of my colleagues, and for the American people. I look  forward to supporting it, and I hope Senators on both sides of the  aisle will do the same.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
