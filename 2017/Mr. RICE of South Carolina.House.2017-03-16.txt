 Mr. Speaker, 4 percent of the people of  South Carolina have individual policies under ObamaCare. I submit to  you that if you have a health insurance policy that pays nothing, with  a deductible so high that you can't use it, regardless of the fact that  statistics may say you are covered, you are not covered.   Sadly, that is what many of my constituents back home in South  Carolina are dealing with under ObamaCare. I have statement after  statement from folks in South Carolina that are being horribly damaged  by this law. They are faced with rising premiums, high deductibles, and  limited choice.   In my State, premiums went up nearly 30 percent last year. At one  time, South Carolina had five different providers. Now there is only  one, and they are threatening to pull out.   What happens then?   By now it is clear that this law is not helping South Carolinians the  way it was intended. But what I also want to make clear is Republicans  have a plan to fix it. Our plan does a blanket repeal of harmful  ObamaCare taxes, like the individual and employer mandates. It  preserves patient protections so people won't be denied for preexisting  conditions. It gives individuals and families  [[Page H2093]]  better control of their health care by allowing them to spend their  healthcare dollars as they see fit.   Simply put, our plan moves us from an unsustainable path to a  sustainable one.                            ____________________
