 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I wanted to come down to talk about a  topic that a number of Senators have been talking about and that a  number of Senators have been focused on. That is the topic of Taiwan  and potentially the defense of Taiwan and the support for Taiwan.   As this body knows, in 1979, the Senate passed a very important bill  called the Taiwan Relations Act--a very bipartisan bill. From that time  on, the Senate has played a very important oversight role in U.S.  relations with Taiwan, and it has always been very bipartisan.   Recently, a bipartisan codel, led by the chairman of the Foreign  Relations Committee, Senator Menendez, with many other Senators-- Senator Graham, Senator Portman, Senator Sasse--traveled to Taiwan. I  just got an out-brief from some of those Senators--a very good meeting.  I was part of a bipartisan codel about a year ago, with Senator Coons  and Senator Duckworth, also to Taiwan.   So there is a long tradition in the U.S. Senate, in a bipartisan way,  with all of us working together, of addressing this question: To what  degree should we be supporting and defending Taiwan against a very  aggressive Chinese Communist Party, led by the dictator Xi Jinping? Why  does it matter? Why should we all be working together, as we have done  for decades here in the U.S. Senate, Democrats and Republicans, to  deter a military invasion of Taiwan?   What will be happening in the next few weeks I want to talk about  because I am concerned about the direction of the Biden administration,  and I think every Senator here should be concerned. So I am going to  ask my colleagues to lift up their voices when they talk to the Biden  administration on a topic I am going to mention here in a minute. But  why does it matter? Well, this issue of the potential invasion of  Taiwan could take place in a few years.   The INDOPACOM commander, a little over a year ago, in front of the  Armed Services Committee, opined that the threat of an invasion of  Taiwan by an aggressive Chinese Communist Party would manifest itself  during this decade--``in fact, in the next 6 years.'' That was Admiral  Davidson, former INDOPACOM commander, and that is not a lot of time.   Here is why I think it matters: Right now, Taiwan is on the frontline  of freedom in Asia. It is not some peripheral sideshow; it is, in many  ways, central to freedom in that part of the world like West Berlin was  during the Cold War. A violent military takeover of Taiwan by the  Chinese Communist Party would be a sea change in how the entire world  is ordered. It would change the history of the 21st century in the way  that the Guns of August of 1914 changed the 20th century.   Now, some see the defense of Taiwan and the support that is required  from the United States because of the Taiwan Relations Act--again, led  by this body--some see the defense and support of this island democracy  as a luxury that we can't afford in an age shaped by great power  competition.   I actually believe--and I believe many Senators, Democrats and  Republicans, believe the opposite--that a Taiwan under China's control  would decisively advance Beijing's campaign to export its authoritarian  model around the world; to separate the United States from our  democratic allies; and it would certainly be part of Xi Jinping's goal  of excluding the United States from the INDOPACOM theater.   Taiwan--a thriving, prosperous Chinese democracy that holds free  election and bounds its power by the rule of law--is central to the  free world and its future.   By the way, if you are an American citizen, regardless of political  party, you should take pride in the fact that this country--or this  island democracy--is free because it wouldn't have happened without the  sacrifice and resources of the United States and our military, and that  is a fact.   A few months ago, I gave a speech on this topic, and I talked about  how, when you think of the defense of Taiwan and deterrence, which is  what we all want--deterrence; nobody wants a war in the Taiwan Strait-- there are really three layers of deterrence for the island of Taiwan.   The first is Taiwan's ability to militarily defend itself, the so- called hedgehog approach or porcupine approach. Right here, they are  defending themselves in the way the Ukrainians are defending  themselves. Senator Roger Wicker had a very good op-ed in the Wall  Street Journal just today on that very topic. We need to make sure  Taiwan has that capability--it is in the Taiwan Relations Act that we  have that responsibility--so that it can defend itself, and they are  undertaking the right approach with regard to the military weapons they  are buying from the United States and other places.   The second level of deterrence that you see here on this chart would  be America's capability to defend Taiwan militarily should the  President of the United States decide to do so if there is an invasion  by the Chinese Communist Party. Over several decades, through many  different crises in the Taiwan Strait, this layer of deterrence,  wherein the United States has shown up with military force, has proven  to be decisive in keeping the Taiwanese people free, and our deep  network of allies in the region augments this second level of  deterrence.   But there is also a third level of deterrence. The third level of  deterrence is often not discussed, but in many ways, particularly now,  it could be more powerful than the first and second levels, and that is  the level that relates to bringing in the instruments of American power  beyond our military, such as our global economic and financial  strengths, to deter China from an invasion. You see this third level:  economic and financial sanctions.   This is exactly what my bipartisan bill, the STAND with Taiwan Act,  would do. I am working with several Senators on this bill right now. We  [[Page S2351]]  have introduced it already, but we are going to recalibrate it,  particularly with regard to the lessons learned from Ukraine.   One of those lessons that we learned from the brutal Ukrainian  invasion by the Russian dictator Vladimir Putin in Ukraine is that  comprehensive economic and financial sanctions have the best chance of  deterring a conflict when they are clearly articulated and ready to go  before the conflict begins. That wasn't the case in Ukraine, and we  will never know, had sanctions already been teed up and ready to go, if  they could have deterred that conflict.   With the STAND with Taiwan Act, which stands for Sanctions Targeting  Aggressors of Neighboring Democracies--STAND--the whole point of this  would be to deter Xi Jinping from making the decision. That third layer  of deterrence is saying: OK. If you militarily invade Taiwan, here are  the massive sanctions that we and our allies are going to hit you with,  and they will be devastating.   This bill makes it clear that we should be engaging with Taiwan  economically, across the board, in many sectors. And this is where I  have deep concern--and I believe many of my colleagues here in the U.S.  Senate have deep concerns--about the direction that might be happening  with regard to the Biden administration.   Now, look, I am somebody who, you know, will be critical of the Biden  administration when I think they are not doing a good job on certain  things. And I do that a lot, particularly on a topic I am going to talk  about here in a minute, energy. But in other areas, particularly as it  relates to the Biden administration's relationship with regard to our  allies and Taiwan, I have been supportive of a number of their  initiatives vocally because I think they have strengthened American  interests in the INDOPACOM theater. What are those?   Well, for example, the Biden administration took this initiative from  the Trump administration--it actually started in the Bush  administration--called the Quad. That is the biggest democracies in the  INDOPACOM theater: us, Japan, Australia, and India. They have taken  that grouping, which, during the Trump administration, was  reinvigorated, particularly by Secretary Pompeo, at the minister level,  and the Biden administration has taken that to the leader level. The  President of the United States meets with the leaders of Japan,  Australia, and India on a regular basis. That is good. That is smart  policy.   They have also launched another very innovative policy, the  Australia-UK-U.S. agreement to work together on military and defense  issues: submarines, nuclear subs, AI, quantum computing. It is called  the Arcus initiative. I think it is a really innovative initiative, and  I have been very--one of the most vocal supporters of it in the U.S.  Senate.   The Biden administration has also been pressing the G-7 to do more as  it relates to Taiwan--the first time ever in the G-7. That is a good  initiative.   In a lot of these areas, I have been supportive. So what am I  concerned about?   This is a concern I have, but it should be a concern that every  Senator has. The administration is getting ready to announce what they  are calling the Indo-Pacific economic framework. This is going to focus  on more economic engagement with our allies in other countries in the  INDOPACOM theater. OK. I support that in general. We will see what the  details are. But right now, that initiative, which we need in terms of  an initiative with regard to economics and other elements of  connectivity with our allies in the region, appears to be on the verge  of missing two critical factors.   No. 1, and the real purpose of what I wanted to talk about, right  now, we are hearing from administration officials that the Indo-Pacific  economic framework is going to exclude Taiwan. Whoa. Whoa. That would  not be a good thing, and I don't think many U.S. Senators--Democrats or  Republicans--would agree that the Biden administration's first big  economic initiative is going to exclude Taiwan, a very important  economic player, very important technical player in terms of chip  fabrication. Why would they do that? Well, it is not clear.   I have been pressing a number of Biden administration officials  saying, you can't make that move. A, the Senate is not going to like  it. And we have had a lot to say about U.S. relations with Taiwan for  decades. And, B, it just doesn't make sense.   Some of the things I have heard is, well, there is this argument that  trade is really not national security, so it doesn't relate to Taiwan.  Well, that is not correct. Trade and economic issues are clearly  national security issues as it relates to our country, as it relates to  our allies.   The other thing I have heard is that, well, some of the other  countries in the Indo-Pacific framework don't really want Taiwan in it.  Again, we are the United States. We are the leader in that part of the  world. If another country is saying, hey, I don't want Taiwan in it,  you know, I think we need to politely tell them that, too bad. They are  going to be.   So I am primarily giving these remarks right now to let all of my  Senate colleagues, many of whom--Democrats and Republicans--I know care  about this issue.   I have been trying to raise the alarm with the administration,  saying, bad idea if your big, first economic initiative for the  INDOPACOM theater is not going to include Taiwan. I hope other  colleagues of mine will do the same.   Let me give you one final area that this administration should be  focused on as it relates to our partners in the region, and that is  energy--that is energy. We have so many opportunities to do more with  our allies--of course, in Europe but also in Asia--as it relates to  energy.   I put forward legislation called the Quad energy initiative that  would be an initiative dealing with the export and importation of LNG.  Think about the Quad: the United States and Australia, two of the  biggest exporters of LNG; Japan, probably the world's biggest importer;  and India, who wants to be to help their economy, to help their  environment. This is something else I have been pressing this  administration on.   It will help our trade deficits, it will help our energy security,  and--you know I have talked about this a lot--it will help global  emissions. The United States right now, since 2005, has been the leader  in reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, right there. The climb- down was 15 percent since 2005. India, China, everywhere else,  significant increases; more American clean burning LNG to our allies in  the region, the Quad. But, heck, even China would help us, our national  security, our workers at home, and our environment and the global  environment.   I just want to end with this: I hope all of my Senate colleagues in  the next couple of days can reach out to the Biden administration and  say: Look, on a number of initiatives--the Quad, Arcus--you have been  going in the right direction, and you have strong bipartisan support.  But the INDOPACOM economic framework led by the United States, if it is  leaving out Taiwan, that is going to be a huge problem, and I don't  think many U.S. Senators think that that would be a good idea.   Given our long history of leading in a bipartisan way on issues  related to Taiwan, I am asking my colleagues to also reach out to the  administration and say, there has to be a better way. We cannot  economically isolate and forget about Taiwan when we need to be  supporting them now more than ever.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, it is Thursday, and it is my favorite  time of the week. And I can see the pages are getting all excited about  another edition of the ``Alaskan of the Week.'' We get to talk about  someone who is making a big difference in Alaska, someone whose spirit  is helping others.   We always like to end the week on a positive note here in the U.S.  Senate, usually with an ``Alaskan of the Week'' speech. So before I get  to talk about our special Alaskan, an incredible woman named Alison  Kear, I am going to give a little update about what is going on in  Alaska.   So, as I mentioned last week, winter is no longer coming; winter is  on the run. The sun is out longer and longer every day. Let me give you  a real cool example. In Utqiagvik, known as Barrow--the northernmost  city, community, in North America at Point Barrow--the sun is getting  out longer and longer each day.   Now, remember, just 3 months ago, Utqiagvik had no sun--zero, zilch.  Utqiagvik gained more than 17 minutes of daylight from yesterday. Isn't  that cool? It is kind of amazing. The sun rose at 4 a.m. and will set  tonight after midnight. Four months ago there was no sun. So a lot  going on.   In Anchorage, the home of Alison, our Alaskan of the Week, it is in  the 50s, balmy this weekend. So it is a great time to be in Alaska.  There isn't a person who doesn't long to visit the great State and join  us up there. So please come and join us.   So let me go back to Alison Kear, who is doing a great job in Alaska,  our Alaskan of the Week. She runs a very special organization called  Covenant House, one of 33 Covenant Houses in the United States, Canada,  and Latin America.   Covenant House's mission is to help with youth homelessness. That  means, of course, helping provide short- and long-term housing for  young people who are experiencing homelessness. But to really help our  young people--all people--get into a stable situation, whether that  means to reunite with family or get into a permanent home, what  Covenant House does involves so much more.   At Covenant House Alaska, they offer so much more, and that has been  Alison's incredible legacy. So let me talk about Alison, who started  with Covenant House in 1997. So she is celebrating 25 years with the  organization, a silver anniversary. Way to go, Alison. We are so proud  of her.   She was born and raised in Florida. She went to college in Texas. She  arrived in Alaska in 1994 armed with a graduate degree in healthcare  management, a job at a local hospital in Alaska, and big ideas about  where her life would lead her. Initially, at least, those plans did not  involve Covenant House. In fact, according to Alison, they didn't  involve Alaska for too long. She arrived--as she said recently to some  of my team as we were putting this together--in the last frontier with  big hair, a couple of fancy suits, and a plan: If she spent 3 years in  Alaska  [[Page S2355]]  working at a hospital, she would probably get transferred to a big city  of her choice in the lower 48 to run a hospital of her own.   So that was the initial plan, Madam President. But like so many  before her, her plans started to change. And like so many before her,  the change of heart toward Alaska started making her think: Hmm, maybe  I am going to stay here. Maybe I have a great life ahead of me in the  great State of Alaska.   Now, it happened a bit slowly. Alaska grew on her, as it does for so  many people. She moved into a house with a great group of people her  age. She began to ski, enjoy the great outdoors, have fun, make  friends, friends who eventually turned into her extended family.   Slowly, Alison began to question that earlier plan she had that she  was so committed to, and that started to lead to her thinking: I think  I am going to have a great life here in Alaska. Her best friend was the  executive director of Covenant House Alaska. Then--25 years ago--it was  a crisis shelter that offered few services and, to be honest, was  struggling to actually stay open.   Her friend asked Alison if she could volunteer a few hours of her  time helping with grant writing. So Alison said: Sure. I will do that,  a little bit of time.   And when her 3 years were up, that same friend said to her: You know,  Alison, I think you should stay. I think you need a mission right here  at Covenant House.   Something about that rang true for Alison. So in 1997, she started  work at Covenant House in development for $9 an hour--with no health  insurance, by the way. So she started kind of at the lower levels of  Covenant House and started to work her way up.   And then the mission that she never knew she needed found Alison. She  tells a story about a Thanksgiving celebration they were having at  Covenant House. There was a boy sharing the meal with them, someone  whose own story was filled with unspeakable trauma, even horror. He  talked about his family: ``I don't think my mom ever loved me,'' he  told the group, ``but I am glad that she had me because you guys here  at Covenant House love me.''    That is powerful. That is very powerful. That simple statement hit  Alison. She called her mother, Mary Whittemore, that evening, crying to  her mom. You always loved me, Alison told her mom. When she  internalized that and realized how important that love is, the concept  of who she was and what she could be changed forever.   And I would say it changed Covenant House forever. Because of the  love her mom gave her, she realized, too, that she had a big enough  heart for love, especially at that wonderful organization. And Alison  has spread that love, that devotion and commitment to thousands of  Alaska's youth since that time, she and her team--her ``rock stars,''  as she calls them--at Covenant House.   When she started--get this in terms of progress--Covenant House, as I  mentioned, was a crisis shelter with a budget of about $900,000. Under  Alison's leadership and the hard work of so many others, it is now an  organization with a budget of about $15 million, with a new job  training center and more education and employment services than ever  before.   Great job, Alison.   And it has also become a nationwide model for helping youth. Through  sheer tenacity, determination, and grit and through deep partnerships  throughout the communities--not just in Anchorage but even beyond-- Alison has led that effort. Roughly 200 kids a day from all over our  State--thousands a year--are served by Covenant House Alaska.   So how do they do it? Let's say you are a teen. I know our pages  can't imagine being a teen. Let's say you are a teen and you can't stay  at home any longer. Maybe there is abuse or family addiction or you  have aged out of foster care, and you don't have a place to sleep.  Think about that. Unfortunately, a lot of teens have that problem in  America.   And in Alaska, remember how cold it is--often below zero in the  winter--and how horrible it is to sleep outside. So many of these kids  are from rural parts of our State and have had to travel hundreds of  miles to get to Anchorage. So now they are in the big city. They are  likely to be traumatized, confused, lonely. It is bitterly cold  outside. They have no place to go.   These are children, and it is heartbreaking whether you are in Alaska  or anywhere else in the lower 48. So imagine that.   Now imagine this. Enter Covenant House Alaska. Covenant House has an  outreach program, an incredible team of dedicated employees and  servants to the people, to the kids, who walk the streets, go to malls,  to homeless camps, wherever the kids might be. They give them some  food, basic essentials, and tell them about Covenant House. That is  what Alison's team does. They begin developing a relationship of trust  because most of these youth have actually never had a trusting, stable  adult in their lives.   What do the youth find when they get to Covenant House? First, there  are people who welcome them, who smile at them, who treat them with  kindness, who treat them with respect. If they are hungry, they get a  warm meal, and they get shelter. And if they are dealing with trauma,  they get counseling.   Eventually, if they decide they need to finish school or earn their  GED, there is a classroom there. If they are pregnant or already have a  baby, they will learn positive parenting skills.   Covenant House Alaska partners with several other amazing Alaskan  organizations onsite--this is a big deal--what they call wraparound  services, so the kids don't need to go back on the streets. These  different partners who work with Covenant House offer everything a teen  needs to learn about in terms of life skills that so many of us take  for granted.   And what is so amazing is that someone at Covenant House will stay  with you for as long as you need it. They provide those services,  even--this is really important--even after you leave the shelter, to  help these teens navigate the system, apply for jobs, get an apartment,  get transportation, get them through a crisis that they might be  having.   All the things that we as parents do for our own kids, Covenant House  does in so many ways for these kids--almost everything they might need  to have a chance, an opportunity, a bright future.   Now, of course, Madam President, it is not that easy. It sounds easy,  but it is not easy at all. Some of these youth have experienced  unspeakable trauma. And I am going to talk a little bit about a tough  subject, but it needs to be spoken about. For far too many of these  youth, especially the young women and even some of the young men, they  have been trafficked by bad people.   And the statistics are horrific. A 2017 study from Loyola University  found that 28 percent of the young people being served at Covenant  House Alaska identified themselves as survivors of human trafficking-- 28 percent. A disproportionate number of these teenagers are Alaskan  Native--young women, many of whom who have been lured out of their  villages with a promise of a better life, and they have been lured into  trafficking.    At Covenant House, the leadership has not shied away from these  statistics, and I think that is a testament to Alison and her  leadership. Instead, they talk openly about it. They have studied it.  They work tirelessly and diligently with law enforcement and other  agencies in Alaska to address this scourge, which, of course, we have  in Alaska, and we have throughout America.   Importantly, they make these survivors--and all the young people who  come to Covenant House--feel safe. They call it ``creating sanctuary''  for the youth at Covenant House, and it works. It works. Alison said  there are countless stories of young people who walked into Covenant  House Alaska in crisis--traumatized, scared, lonely, very hurt--who are  now happy high school and college graduates, working, with their own  families, doing great things for the State. Some have even come back to  be staff at Covenant House. I have had the honor of meeting a number of  these young Alaskans who are contributing so much.   Alison is the key reason why this has all happened successfully. She  is tenacious. She is smart, stubborn--that is not my language, by the  way; that was  [[Page S2356]]  her own language--ambitious and loving for her kids. Joe Hemphill,  Covenant House Alaska's chief development officer, calls Alison a  ``visionary for kids.'' He has known her for 25 years, and Joe said  this about Alison:         One thing . . . hasn't changed [in over 25 years]: she has       never taken ``no'' for an answer and she still doesn't.    But her heart leads. When you talk to her, she will tell you that  love is truly the answer for all that ails our communities and  certainly for all that ails our young people in them.   ``How great it is to create a space where someone can . . . feel  love,'' Alison said, ``to take it and to give it.'' She continued:         It's the only thing that has truly changed communities       [when you think about it]. Homelessness is not a singular       experience. It's about a void in relationships, it's about a       void of love.    Again, Alison credits her mother--that is very sweet, especially as  we are approaching Mother's Day--for helping her understand what love  means and how she can give it to others and how it can make a huge  difference in all of our communities.   So I want to thank all the staff at Covenant House Alaska for doing  such great work, day in, day out, 24/7, 365 days a year. As I  mentioned, I want to thank you. My wife Julie also wants to thank you.  Julie has had the honor of working at Covenant House for several years  as staff and on the board and she has seen firsthand all the great work  that Alison and her team have done for our youth in Alaska.   Again, to all of Covenant House, thank you for walking alongside our  youth who have not had love in their lives and yet who are resilient  and working hard to find a positive path in life. The Covenant House  team is making that happen.   And, of course, thank you to Alison for leading this exceptional  team. By the way, Alison, I know your birthday is coming up, so happy  birthday. And most importantly, thank you, again, for being our Alaskan  of the Week.   I yield the floor.
