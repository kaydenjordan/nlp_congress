 Mr. Speaker, it is vitally important to remember the  sacrifices of America's fallen servicemembers and their families every  day. Today I rise to recognize a special tribute to those who paid the  ultimate sacrifice.   This weekend, the New York Run for the Fallen will travel across the  22nd District to pay homage to our Nation's fallen heroes. The run  seeks to honor the families and the sacrifices of those who answered  the call to serve our great Nation.   Leading the charge in our community is Kristi Mangine, an advocate  for our veterans and member of the  [[Page H4763]]  Colgate University community. She is also a core runner for the New  York chapter and has recruited a number of members of our community to  participate in this great tribute.   The event is a 175-mile run across the State of New York, each mile  representing one hero killed who served during the war on terror,  including Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom, and  Operation New Dawn.    I would like to thank Kristi Mangine and those involved in this  year's run for inviting me to participate in this important event to  honor those who paid the ultimate sacrifice in our Nation's longest  running overseas conflict.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to also join us, as well as any  community members who have a moment to pick up a time slot for one of  our fallen heroes and give them a special tribute to their sacrifice.                            ____________________
