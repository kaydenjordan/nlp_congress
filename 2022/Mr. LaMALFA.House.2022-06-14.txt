 Mr. Speaker, as the 4-day tour occurs inside the Capitol  on January 6, where a loaded, biased committee attempts to parse the  words of the President on the day, we have many other crises to deal  with in this country that are directly affecting and harming the  American people, their ability to do their basic day-to-day operation  of their homes, get to their jobs, get their kids to school.   So what are we doing? What are we doing? Chasing January 6. Look at  our border right now, where under the current Biden policies, we are  attracting the largest caravan ever of illegal aliens heading toward  our border. The idea that we are going to get rid of title 42 or just  the general porosity of the border anyway. It has been a giant magnet  ever since January 20, 2021, when this President came in and started  shredding our border policy.   We had success under President Trump, where we had the best control  of the border we had in quite a while, with approximately 450  additional miles of rebuilt or new fence that was very effective in  those zones.   So what do we have now? We have warehouses and stacks and pallets of  fence material, millions of dollars' worth of it, lying about on our  southern border being stored instead of installed.   We heard some chatter here a couple months ago from the Biden  administration, well, maybe we should just go ahead and put up those  additional pieces there where there are some obvious gaps.   I had a chance to visit Yuma, Arizona a few weeks ago. It was pretty  incredible because there would be miles of fence, but there would be  these gaps occasionally, and that is where people would pour through  illegally. Amazing.   We could rectify that by just filling a lot of the gaps, thereby  making our Customs and Border Patrol job much easier by being able to  focus on fewer areas instead of wide-open spaces or gaps all along our  border.   But, no, it seems to be about some other agenda. 15,000 people  possibly will crowd the border here soon under the idea that we are  going to possibly let title 42 go. Thankfully, two different courts  have stopped that.   So what are we doing? The terrorists come across our border really  almost unchecked. They capture a handful of them, but how many are  getting by that get away? We don't know that. Are they starting cells  right here in our country? Why not?   As we know, in April, there were over 230,000 encounters, they call  them, at the southern border. That is the highest in U.S. history for  one month. Why is this? Because we have a giant magnet, again, turned  on by this administration saying, come on across. You only need to have  a sliver of an excuse for asylum.   The asylum law needs to be changed if that is how they are going to  enforce it because it has to be for a true threat. You also have to  seek asylum in the country closest to you, if you are an asylum seeker  and that is what you are really after, but one closest to you, not pick  and choose what country you are going to move up to, basically the  United States with all the benefits it hands out.   According to polling, when you ask the American people, who are  worried about gas and groceries or whether another load of formula is  going to come in from Europe on a military transport in time for their  small children to be able to have the type of food that they are  accustomed to, the majority of Americans disapprove of the Biden  administration's operation of our borders, especially the elimination  of title 42, which is a health risk issue.   When you talk about the issue of formula, we are putting Americans  last, when the Biden administration prioritized shipments of pallets of  baby formula to the border holding stations instead of across the  fruited plain. It is pretty pathetic. Indeed, it was this  administration whose FDA stepped in on the major producer of formula  and said: We are going to shut you down because we had a couple of  incidents that have been reported.   So what happens? The FDA didn't call back when the company that is  the major producer of formula asks, What is it we need to do to be in  compliance in your eyes? The administration knew about this, yet they  prioritized what  [[Page H5493]]  formula was available to go down to the border stations there.  Thankfully, recently, we passed legislation so that we could release  more supplies to have them be eligible for those who are on assistance.   As we see the disaster on the border, I don't see a single remedy  even being talked about by the Biden administration. They don't really  care about the American people.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, as we endure more and more of the Biden- induced energy crisis in this country, I have to point out another  aspect of that which is very important that we get a handle on soon.  Our ability for our trucks to deliver the goods, the products we expect  to be in the stores, is going to be hampered even more not just in my  home State of California $7 diesel or $6 in the rest of the country,  and the ability to get truck drivers, but also, interestingly enough,  there is a product called diesel exhaust fluid that is part of the  newer truck engines that is going to run out.   It is already in short supply. The railroads are having a hard time  shipping it. It is not even produced enough in this country. We have to  rely on one important component, urea, that the major exporters of it  are China, Russia, and Qatar. We are going to run out of the DEF that  you put in the trucks. The trucks will not run without it because the  computers will not let the truck run without this fluid, which is a  component in the diesel exhaust system.   If we run out of DEF, the trucks can't move, and they will not move  the products you need, your food, your other supplies to the stores for  you to purchase. So we have yet another crisis within a crisis if we  run out of DEF. DEF needs to be produced in this country. We need to  produce the urea in this country.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I appreciate my neighbor from  Pennsylvania for the time here today and for this effort.   I also oppose the previous question and want to, instead, bring  forward H.R. 6858, the American Energy Independence from Russia Act. It  really begs the question: With what is going on in the world, why are  we dependent upon Russia for anything, especially our energy?   If the number was somewhere around 7 percent of the barrels of oil we  use, we can easily make it up by our own production in this country,  the amazing hydraulic fracturing that put America back on the map for  being an exporter of natural gas and all the other development that we  can be doing to bring prices back down.   This administration just seems impervious to the suffering of the  American people right now on the cost of energy and the cost of just  about everything else.   Well, there is another crisis that is going to be coming out of this,  too. We are dependent on Russia and China for a product called urea.  Now, what is that? Well, it is made into a fertilizer, basically, that  is used extensively in American crops. Also, urea has a use as a  component in what is called diesel exhaust fluid. That is a part of  making our diesel engines run clean on our trucks and tractors and  whatever else uses a diesel engine with DEF in it.   We are going to run out of DEF pretty soon. The railroads are having  a hard time delivering it. When that happens, that means our trucks  don't run anymore because they will not run without this fluid.   So, we are dependent on Russia for urea, dependent on Russia for  energy, and want to blame Russia for everything. No. We blame this  administration because we are not doing the steps it takes to make  ourselves independent that we easily have within our grasp to do in  order to go for what is this great reset or the incredible transition  the President talks about.   We are being transitioned by this administration, and it is very  dangerous. It is harmful to families, harmful to people's bottom lines  on running their households, going to work, getting their kids to  school, all because we don't have an energy policy that works.   Whether the trucks don't have DEF to be able to deliver the goods to  the store or get it out of the field, whatever it is, because we are  dependent on Russia for energy and all these things, we are putting  ourselves in a real bad spot.
