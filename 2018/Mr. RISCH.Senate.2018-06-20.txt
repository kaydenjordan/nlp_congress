 Mr. President, as you may know, I voted in favor of the  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that became law last year. Every day we are  learning more about the positive impact this law is having on the  economy and about average Americans having more money in their  paychecks. While it is important to appreciate the effects that the tax  law had on individuals, we should not forget that small businesses have  benefited from the law as well. As chairman of the Senate Committee on  Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I supported the legislation  because I believed it would allow small business owners to invest in  their businesses, increase overall economic growth, and reduce taxes  for the millions of small businesses who employ the majority of  Americans in every part of the country. I also saw the potential that  the legislation would have, not just to give an economic boost to small  businesses in my home State of Idaho, but to spark renewed confidence  from small businesses across the country. A couple of weeks ago, I  began this series of speeches to bring attention to small businesses  that have benefited from this law.   While there are many stories about small businesses benefitting from  tax reform, I rise today to talk about Dempsey Wood Products in  Orangeburg, SC. Dempsey Wood Products offers a wide variety of high- quality pine and hardwood products to its customers. The company serves  many different industries with kiln-dried lumber for the housing  industry, pallet stock for pallet manufacturers, debarked chips for the  paper industry,  [[Page S4277]]  mulch for landscapers, and sawdust for alternative fuel use. The  company employs about 80 to 100 workers and has an extensive sawmill  and dry kiln operation. Ronny Dempsey started the company in 1988 and  has spent all of his life around the lumber industry. His father,  Charles Parker Dempsey, worked in various sawmills over the course of  his career and eventually was the coowner of a sawmill that he later  sold. Today Parker Dempsey, a third-generation sawmill operator, has  taken over as president, though his father, Ronny, is still by his side  as vice president of the company.   This family-owned small business has already benefitted greatly from  the tax law that was passed last year. They have announced plans to  upgrade their sawmill, purchase a new dry kiln, and invest in a new  planer mill over the next 5 years. They expect the capital expenditure  to total $7 million and estimate that they could add a second shift in  the near future, thereby creating new jobs in the Orangeburg community.  These investments were viable for the company due to the accelerated  depreciation provisions contained in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This  section of the law allows companies to deduct the value of any new  equipment purchased in a single year, instead of over several years.  Tax reform has had a material impact on small businesses like Dempsey  Wood Products and their employees. Overall, the new law has increased  small businesses' confidence, employee bonuses and wages, while  lowering taxes and spurring new capital investment.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today, Senator Crapo and I recognize and  congratulate Mr. Alan L. Gunn on his upcoming retirement from the U.S.  Department of Energy after more than 40 years of distinguished service  in various roles at the U.S. Navy and U.S. Department of Energy.   In 1980, Mr. Gunn received a bachelor of science degree from  Mississippi State University and went on to complete graduate work in  business administration at Louisiana State University, Virginia  Polytechnic Institute, State University of New York at Albany, and  Idaho State University.   In February 1982, Mr. Gunn completed the Navy officer candidate  school as a distinguished military graduate and was commissioned as a  Navy officer. He was selected for duty in the Naval Nuclear Propulsion  Program and served as both a member of the staff of the Director, Naval  Nuclear Propulsion program in Washington, DC, and as a field  representative for the director in Schenectady, NY, and Idaho Falls,  ID.   In 1996, Mr. Gunn completed the College of Naval Warfare program in  residence at the U.S. Naval War College, Newport, RI, and received a  master of arts degree in national security and strategic studies.   Since the completion of his Active-Duty service, Mr. Gunn has served  as a civilian with the U.S. Department of Energy and the National  Nuclear Security Administration in numerous leadership and management  positions with the Office of Naval Reactors in Washington, DC, the  Idaho branch office of Naval Reactors, the Naval Reactors Laboratory  field office, and the Idaho operations office.   In 2007, after completing over 28 years of Active and Reserve  military service, Mr. Gunn retired as a captain in the U.S. Navy.   Most recently, Mr. Gunn served as the principal deputy manager for  Nuclear Energy and served as the assistant manager for programs and  facilities at the Department of Energy's Idaho Operations Office, DOE- ID. In his current capacity, he provides exceptional leadership for  DOE-ID's nuclear programs and Idaho facilities management divisions,  national security programs, the Radiological and Environmental Science  Laboratory, and the Office of Project Management project.   Mr. Gunn's organization is responsible for oversight of the Idaho  National Laboratory, INL, and other contractor performance on nuclear  energy, education, national security, and other research and  development projects and programs, including strategic partnership  projects and the INL laboratory directed research and development  programs; as well as facility and infrastructure operations,  maintenance, planning, and other activities associated with facility  and infrastructure operations at the INL. Mr. Gunn also provides direct  support to the specific manufacturing capability, SMC, project that  includes the oversight of the maintenance and operations of the SMC  facilities, as well as the programmatic oversight of the armor  production.   Through his years of dedicated service, Mr. Gunn exemplifies the best  qualities of Idaho. Senator Crapo and I want to thank Alan for his  service and wish him well in all of his future endeavors.                            ____________________
