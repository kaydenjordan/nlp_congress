 Mr. President.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I have  consistently opposed spending outside of the budget unless it is offset  by spending cuts elsewhere. It is not only an opinion I hold, it is  actually the law. It is called pay as you go.   We passed the law many years ago--more than a decade ago--to try to  balance our books by having people come forward with things that sound  good, want to spend it but not offset it by spending cuts elsewhere.   There is no question that the United States has been a very good ally  of Israel. Over time, probably funds exceeding $80 to $100 billion have  been expended to Israel over the last four decades. Just on missile  defense, the United States has given Israel $7 billion: $1.6 billion  for Iron Dome, $2 billion for David's Sling, and $3.7 billion for  Arrow. In fact, the NDAA that just passed this week gives them another  $100 million for this.   I am not disputing whether or not the extra billion dollars would  help them. I will vote for the extra billion dollars, and that is what  I will propose today. But it should be offset with spending cuts  elsewhere.   There is a $3 billion fund that is left over from money we were  giving to the Afghan national government. There is no Afghan national  government. There is a bunch of hoodlums, the Taliban, who have taken  over.   I asked Secretary Blinken: Can you assure me you are not going to  give these funds to the Taliban?   He says: It depends on how they behave.   So it isn't so certain that this money is not going to go to the  Taliban. The current law may say future money goes, but this old money,  and we don't want it going to the Taliban. We think it should be better  spent.   It is money that can be reclaimed. Why wouldn't it be a good thing to  take money that might go to our enemy and actually give it to our ally?  It makes perfect sense. Why would we be so obstinate that we are  unwilling to take a pay-for? It is a pay-for that is sitting there  waiting for us to use.   Three billion dollars is supposed to be given to the Afghan national  government. It no longer exists. Let's take a billion of that, let's  give it for Iron Dome; let's give $2 billion back to the Treasury. It  sounds like a win-win-win all around.   Why can't we, for once in our lives, spend money on something good  and take away money from something where we shouldn't be spending it?  This money was never intended to go to anything but the Afghan national  government. They don't exist anymore. We should reclaim that money,  spend a billion on the Iron Dome, and put $2 billion back in the  Treasury. It might be the first time in decades that we actually did  something fiscally responsible around here. But that is a problem. I  don't understand why we can't do it.   So I would--rather than just give another billion dollars out of the  Treasury that actually makes us weaker, makes us more in debt, let's  offset it by taking money that is in a fund for an entity that no  longer exists.   So, Mr. President, I, therefore, ask the Senator to modify his  request so that instead of his proposal, the Senate proceed to the  immediate consideration of Calendar No. 140, H.R. 5323; further, that  the only amendment in order be my substitute amendment, which is at the  desk. I further ask that there be 2 hours of debate, equally divided  between the two leaders or their designees; and that upon the use or  yielding back of that time, the Paul substitute amendment at the desk  be considered and agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be considered  read a third time, and the Senate vote on passage of the bill, as  amended, with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President.    Reserving the right to object, I think it is very important  that the American people know and those who support Israel know that we  can get this done today. We can get a billion dollars additional, in  addition to the $100 million, in addition to the $7 billion we have  already given to Israel, in addition to the $80 to $100 billion we have  given to them over the decades--we can do an extra billion today. All I  am asking is that it is paid for.   The objections coming from Democrats is that they are unwilling to  pay for the Iron Dome spending so, in reality, the funding won't happen  today because of Democrat opposition to Iron Dome being paid for. It  can happen right now. All you got to do is agree to take money from a  defunct fund to a defunct entity. Three billion dollars is in a fund to  an entity that no longer exists. The Afghan national government no  longer exists. This is such an easy pay-for. This one is dangling low  fruit that we can pay for. You can get exactly what we want to do, that  is a billion dollars extra, in addition to the money we already have  given Israel for Iron Dome, but pay for it. That is a responsible way.  So I object.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the attached  issuance of the Government Accountability Office's Decision B-33501  printed in the Congressional Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:  [[Page S9207]]                                       Decision       Matter of: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-          Applicability of Congressional Review Act to Requirement           for Persons to Wear Masks While on Conveyances and at           Transportation Hubs      File: B-333501      Date: December 14, 2021                                    DIGEST         On February 3, 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and       Prevention (CDC) published a document in the Federal Register       entitled Requirement for Persons to Wear Masks While on       Conveyances and at Transportation Hubs, 86 Fed. Reg. 8025       (Mask Requirement). Under the CDC's Mask Requirement all       persons using public conveyances such as planes, trains, and       buses must wear facial coverings while on the conveyance and       at transportation hubs such as airports and bus stations. CDC       did not submit a CRA report to Congress or the Comptroller       General on the Mask Requirement.        The Congressional Review Act (CRA) requires that before a       rule can take effect, an agency must submit the rule to both       the House of Representatives and the Senate as well as the       Comptroller General, and provides procedures for       congressional review where Congress may disapprove of rules.       We conclude that the Mask Requirement meets the definition of       a rule for purposes of CRA and, therefore, is subject to       CRA's requirements for submission and congressional review.       With this decision, we are not taking a position on the       policy of imposing a mask requirement or what steps the       agency or Congress may take next; our decision only addresses       CDC's compliance with CRA's procedures for congressional       review.                                   DECISION         The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a       component of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services       (HHS), issued a document entitled Requirement for Persons to       Wear Masks While on Conveyances and at Transportation Hubs,       86 Fed. Reg. 8025 (Mask Requirement) that was published in       the Federal Register on February 3, 2021. Senator Rand Paul,       M.D., subsequently requested our legal decision as to whether       the Mask Requirement is a rule for purposes of the       Congressional Review Act (CRA). Letter from Senator Rand       Paul, M.D., to Comptroller General (Aug. 9, 2021). For the       reasons explained below, we conclude that it is.        Our practice when rendering decisions is to contact the       relevant agencies to obtain their legal views on the subject       of the request. GAO, Procedures and Practices for Legal       Decisions and Opinions, GA0-06-1064SP (Washington, D.C.:       Sept. 2006), available at https://www.gao.gov/products/gao- 06-1064sp. Accordingly, we reached out to HHS to obtain the       agency's legal views. Letter from Managing Associate General       Counsel, GAO, to Acting General Counsel, HHS (Aug. 12, 2021).       We received HHS's response on September 28, 2021. Letter from       Acting General Counsel, HHS, to Managing Associate General       Counsel, GAO (Sept. 28, 2021).                                  background       CDC Mask Requirement        On January 31, 2020, in response to confirmed cases of       Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the Secretary of       HHS declared a public health emergency under the Public       Health Service Act. The Secretary has renewed that       declaration, most recently on October 15, 2021. Subsequently,       the President declared that the COVID-19 outbreak constitutes       a national emergency under the National Emergencies Act.       Proclamation No. 9994, 85 Fed. Reg. 15,337 (Mar. 18, 2020).       The national emergency declaration was continued on February       24, 2021. 86 Fed. Reg. 11,599 (Feb. 26, 2021).        On January 29, 2021, CDC issued the Mask Requirement       pursuant to its regulatory authorities under the Public       Service Health Act with an effective date of February 1,       2021. Mask Requirement, at 8025-26. It was published in the       Federal Register on February 3, 3021.        The Mask Requirement states that masks help prevent the       spread of COVID-19. Mask Requirement at 8028. The stated       intent of the Mask Requirement is to preserve human life;       maintain a safe and secure operating transportation system;       mitigate further introduction, transmission, and spread of       COVID-19 into and within the United States; and support       response efforts. Id. at 8027 (statement of intent).        Under the Mask Requirement, a person must wear a mask while       boarding, disembarking, and traveling on any conveyance (such       as an aircraft, train, road vehicle, or vessel) into or       within the United States. Id. at 8026, 8029. A person also       must wear a mask while at a transportation hub (such as an       airport, bus terminal, port, or subway station) that provides       transportation within the United States. Id. It also requires       conveyance operators to only provide service to masked       passengers and to use best efforts to ensure passengers stay       masked during the entire trip. Id at 8029.        The Mask Requirement provides several exemptions based on       the characteristics of a passenger or the travel scenario.       Id. at 8027-28. For instance, passengers under the age of two       are exempt, as is travel by private conveyance for personal,       noncommercial use. Id. at 8027, 8029. Other federal agencies       are required to take additional steps to enforce the Mask       Requirement. Id. at 8028, 8030. The Mask Requirement will       remain in effect until rescinded by CDC or the public health       emergency is ended by the Secretary of HHS. Id. at 8026.      Congressional Review Act        CRA, enacted in 1996 to strengthen congressional oversight       of agency rulemaking, requires federal agencies to submit a       report on each new rule to both Houses of Congress and to the       Comptroller General for review before a rule can take effect.       5 U.S.C. 801 (a)(1)(A). The report must contain a copy of the       rule, ``a concise general statement relating to the rule,''       and the rule's proposed effective date. Id. Each House of       Congress is to provide the report on the rule to the chairman       and ranking member of each standing committee with       jurisdiction. 5 U.S.C. 801 (a)(1)(C). The CRA allows Congress       to review and disapprove rules issued by federal agencies for       a period of 60 days using special procedures. 5 U.S.C. 802.       If a resolution of disapproval is enacted, then the new rule       has no force or effect. Id.        CRA adopts the definition of rule under the Administrative       Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 551(4), which states       that a rule is ``the whole or a part of an agency statement       of general or particular applicability and future effect       designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy       or describing the organization, procedure, or practice       requirements of an agency.'' 5 U.S.C. 804(3). CRA excludes       three categories of rules from coverage: (1) rules of       particular applicability; (2) rules relating to agency       management or personnel; and (3) rules of agency       organization, procedure, or practice that do not       substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency       parties. Id.        CDC did not submit a CRA report to Congress or the       Comptroller General on the Mask Requirement. In its response       to us, CDC stated the Mask Requirement was not subject to the       CRA because it was an emergency action under CDC's regulatory       authorities and that any delays could result in serious       harms. Response Letter, at 1.                                  Discussion         The issue here is whether the CDC Mask Requirement is a       rule under CRA. Applying the statutory framework of CRA, we       first address whether the Mask Requirement meets the       definition of a rule under APA. We conclude that it does.       Second, we address whether any of the CRA exceptions apply.       We conclude they do not. Therefore, we conclude the Mask       Requirement is a rule for purposes of CRA.        CDC considers the Mask Requirement to be an order issued       under its regulatory authorities implementing the Public       Health Service Act. See Response Letter, at 1-2 (``[t]he mask       order is an emergency action taken under 42 C.F.R.       Sec. Sec. 70.2, 71.31 (b), and 71.32 (b) . . . implementing       regulations of 42 U.S.C. Sec. 264''). Although an agency's       characterization should be considered in deciding whether its       action is a rule under the APA definition (and whether, for       example, it is subject to notice and comment rulemaking       requirements), ``[an] agency's own label . . . [is] not       dispositive.'' Chamber of Commerce of the U.S. v. OSHA, 636       F.2d 464,468 (D.C. Cir. 1980); B-329272, Oct. 19, 2017.        The APA defines a rule as ``the whole or a part of an       agency statement of general or particular applicability and       future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe       law or policy or describing the organization, procedure, or       practice requirements of an agency. . . .'' 5 U.S.C.       Sec. 551(4). By contrast, the APA defines an order to be       ``the whole or a part of a final disposition, whether       affirmative, negative, injunctive, or declaratory in form, of       an agency in a matter other than rule making but including       licensing.'' 5 U.S.C. Sec. 551(6). As we have noted in our       prior decisions, these two definitions make rules and orders       mutually exclusive categories. See B-332233, Aug. 13, 2020,       at 3.        Here the Mask Requirement meets the APA definition of a       rule rather than an order. Regarding the first element of a       rule, the Mask Requirement is an agency statement because it       is an official document published in the Federal Register by       CDC. Mask Requirement at 8025-26. It is of future effect,       satisfying the second element, because the order states that       it remains in place until rescinded or the public health       emergency is terminated. Id. at 8026. Third, it implements       and prescribes law or policy as it requires all travelers to       wear a mask where previously they were not required to do so.       Id. at 8028-29. Thus, the Mask Requirement falls within the       APA's definition of rule.        Conversely, despite its label, the Mask Requirement is not       an order for purposes of the APA because it is not the result       of an adjudicatory process. See Coalition for Common Sense in       Gov't Procurement v. Sec'y for Veterans Affairs, 464 F.3d       1306, 1316-17 (Fed. Cir. 2006). As noted previously, an order       is defined as ``the whole or a part of a final disposition,       whether affirmative, negative, injunctive, or declaratory in       form.'' 5 U.S.C. Sec. 551(6). Thus, an order results from an       adjudicatory process. See Coalition for Common Sense in Gov't       Procurement, 463 F.3d at 1316-17. Here, the Mask Requirement       was not the result of an adjudicatory process but a       prospective requirement setting process. In its response to       us, CDC described its process for drafting the Mask       Requirement. ``[It] was drafted and cleared by the CDC       program (Division of Global Migration and Quarantine), Center       (National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious       Diseases), and CDC's Office of the Director before it was       provided to HHS for Departmental review. Following HHS review       and clearance, it was provided to OMB.'' Response Letter at       2. This is a process used to draft rules, not an adjudicatory       proceeding.  [[Page S9208]]         In support of its position that the agency action here is       an order not a rule, CDC asserted that its long-standing       regulations permit it to act quickly to prevent the spread of       communicable diseases and any delay in issuance of the Mask       Requirement ``could result in serious harm.'' Response       Letter, at 1. CDC further stated that the order was an       emergency action and requiring the order to go through notice       and comment before taking effect ``would exacerbate the       substantial harm that the order was intended to mitigate.''       Id.        While CRA does not provide an emergency exception from its       procedural requirements to submit rules for congressional       review, CRA and APA address an agency's need to take       emergency action without delay. Agencies can waive the       required delay in effective date requirement when an agency       for ``good cause'' finds (and incorporates the finding and a       brief statement of reasons in the rule issued) that notice       and public procedure are ``impracticable, unnecessary, or       contrary to the public interest.'' 5 U.S.C Sec. Sec. 553(b),       808(2). Therefore, an agency can provide for a rule to take       effect immediately while still complying with the agency's       statutory obligation to submit the rule to Congress for       review.        Having determined the Mask Requirement meets the definition       of a rule, we must determine if any of the CRA exceptions       apply. We conclude they do not. First, it is not a rule of       particular applicability as it applies to all travelers using       public conveyances and is not limited to specific parties.       Mask Requirement, at 8028-29. Second, it does not deal with       agency management or personnel but with travelers and       conveyance operators. Id. at 8026. Finally, it is not a rule       of agency organization, procedure, or practice that does not       substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency       parties as it imposes new requirements on people who are       traveling to wear masks while in transit and at       transportation hubs. Id. at 8028-29. It also requires       operators to only provide service to masked passengers. Id.       Thus, no exception applies.                                  Conclusion         The Mask Requirement is a rule for purposes of CRA because       it meets the APA definition of a rule and no CRA exception       applies. Accordingly, before it can take effect, the Mask       Requirement is subject to the requirement that it be       submitted to both Houses of Congress and the Comptroller       General for review, which provides Congress a period of 60       days in which it may disapprove the rule using special       procedures in accordance with the CRA. While CDC asserted the       need to act quickly as its justification for not submitting       the Mask Requirement for congressional review, there is not       an emergency exception under CRA. An agency may, however,       invoke the CRA's good cause exception and provide for a rule       to take effect immediately while still complying with the       agency's statutory obligation to submit the rule to Congress       for review. With this decision, we are not taking a position       on the policy of imposing a mask requirement or what steps       the agency or Congress may take next; our decision only       addresses CDC's compliance with CRA's procedures for       congressional review.
