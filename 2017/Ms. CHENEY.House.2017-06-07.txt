 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 374 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 374         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 2213) to       amend the Anti-Border Corruption Act of 2010 to authorize       certain polygraph waiver authority, and for other purposes.       All points of order against consideration of the bill are       waived. The amendment in the nature of a substitute       recommended by the Committee on Homeland Security now printed       in the bill shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as       amended, shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill,       as amended, and on any further amendment thereto, to final       passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of       debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Homeland       Security; (2) the further amendment printed in the report of       the Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution, if       offered by the Member designated in the report, which shall       be in order without intervention of any point of order, shall       be considered as read, shall be separately debatable for the       time specified in the report equally divided and controlled       by the proponent and an opponent, and shall not be subject to       a demand for division of the question; and (3) one motion to       recommit with or without instructions.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 374,  which provides a structured rule for consideration of H.R. 2213, the  Anti-Border Corruption Reauthorization Act, and makes in order one  amendment.   H.R. 2213 is a commonsense, bipartisan bill, introduced by Ms.  McSally from Arizona, that will help ensure we have sufficient Border  Patrol agents to secure our border. At this point in  [[Page H4661]]  time, where we are facing tremendous challenges overseas, where we are  facing tremendous national security challenges, our Customs and Border  Protection is understaffed and unable to meet the congressionally  mandated staffing levels for Customs officers and Border Patrol agents.   With these ever-increasing threats to our national security, it is  vital that we ensure CBP can quickly hire capable and trustworthy  individuals to secure our border. Currently, prospective officers and  Border Patrol agents are required to undergo a background check that  includes passing a polygraph test. This process has been very long and  has drastically delayed the CBP's ability to hire officers and Border  Patrol agents.   H.R. 2213 simply provides a limited, voluntary exemption to the pre- employment polygraph requirement for State and local law enforcement  officers that are in good standing and who have already passed a State  and local law enforcement polygraph test, for Federal law enforcement  officers who are in good standing, and members of the armed services or  veterans who have received or who are eligible to receive an honorable  discharge and have held a security clearance and undergone a thorough  background check in the past 5 years.   Mr. Speaker, this exemption is very narrow and only applies to men  and women that we already trust to protect and defend us at home or  abroad: men and women who have already been through relevant security  background checks. The CBP would not be required to use this waiver  authority; and, if there is anything in any applicant's history that  warrants further investigation, the CBP Commissioner is fully  authorized and encouraged to use a polygraph test to resolve any  outstanding questions.   Mr. Speaker, for years, the CBP has struggled to recruit and vet  potential employees. There is no more urgent need that we have right  now than securing our border and making sure we have the resources  there to be able to do that job.                                time  1230    H.R. 2213 is a commonsense approach that will help address this issue  and ensure the CBP has the men and women it needs to keep our borders  and our Nation secure. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the  rule to allow for consideration of H.R. 2213, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I welcome the opportunity to share the floor today with the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Hastings), my good friend from the Rules Committee. I  just would point out that, as a Congress, as a body, we have actually  passed more pieces of legislation, gotten them on the President's desk,  and gotten them signed at this point in Congress than at any time since  President Truman was in office.   So it may be that my colleague is not in agreement with many of the  things that we have done, but, Mr. Speaker, we have actually been  working very hard to begin the process of recovery from 8 years of  rules and regulations that have really strangled the people of this  Nation.   We have passed, as the gentleman noted, healthcare reform out of this  body. We repealed ObamaCare, and every single day we get more and more  indication about the failures of that healthcare plan, with insurance  companies pulling out of markets and leaving citizens all across this  Nation unable to get access to affordable care. The Republican plan  will change that.   We are also in the process and will, tomorrow, be voting to repeal  the Dodd-Frank legislation, which has had a devastating effect on our  community banks all across this country and on our communities, and  moving away from the really misguided approach of the last 8 years that  centralized power here in Washington, D.C.   One thing that didn't happen in the last 8 years though was the  security of the border. And far too often we saw laws that weren't  enforced. We saw people turning the other way for sanctuary cities, for  example, and the failure on the part of the last administration to do  what was necessary to make sure that we could know who is coming into  this country and that we had the resources necessary to secure our  border.   So I am very proud to be here today, to be able to debate this rule,  to be able to debate the underlying legislation, which is sadly needed,  so that we can get those resources we need.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Rutherford).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Byrne).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Alabama.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Florida for his  participation in this debate today.   I think it is important for the record to be clear and to be  accurate, Mr. Speaker. This House of Representatives, in the time that  we have been in session, has been the most productive House during the  first 100 days of a Presidency in 30 years.   I am sure that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle may not  want to agree to that. They may not want to acknowledge that because  Speaker Pelosi held the record previously when she was Speaker, but I  am very proud of that, that we have done a tremendous amount for the  American people in the time that we have been in session.   We have overturned 14 Obama regulations in this Congress alone, which  has had a tremendous impact on our constituents. We have already taken  steps that will save them $3.7 billion in regulatory costs, 4.2 million  hours in paperwork.   Mr. Speaker, when I think about the communities across my home State  of Wyoming, this relief could not have come soon enough. We are in a  position today where we have faced strangling regulation out of  Washington, D.C., for the last 8 years, regulation that was truly  intended in too many instances to drive businesses out of business, to  drive our community banks out of business, and to create a situation  where Washington, D.C., was creating one-size-fits-all policies. But  those days are over. This is a new day, and we take very seriously our  obligations to put country ahead of party.   With respect to Russia, Mr. Speaker, as my colleague is well aware,  there are multiple investigations underway in the Congress. We on the  Republican side--I think this is a bipartisan issue--take very  seriously the sanctity of our electoral process and will make sure that  we get to the bottom of it.   We have got to ensure that we recognize and understand the extent to  which Russian hacking was going on--frankly, not just in the United  States, but around the world--and make sure that we do everything  necessary to stand up against both Russian hacking, to stand up against  the kind of Russian attacks that we are seeing on electoral processes  in Europe, and, Mr. Speaker, to ensure that we secure ourselves.   At the end of the day, that is what this debate is about here this  afternoon. We have got to make sure that we all recognize in this body  that there is nothing more important than the security of our Nation.   Frankly, Mr. Speaker, we are at a crisis moment. We are at a crisis  because, for the last 8 years, our military has been strangled. For the  last 8 years, our borders weren't secure. We have had threats growing  around the world.   We have seen the rise of ISIS. We have seen the rise of al-Qaida--the  expansion of al-Qaida around the world into many more countries than it  ever existed before.   We have seen the Iranians make steady progress towards obtaining a  nuclear weapon under what is the most misguided treaty agreement ever  entered into by any American President: the Iranian nuclear agreement.   We have seen Chinese aggression in the South China Sea. We have seen  Russian aggression in Europe.   Mr. Speaker, we have seen North Korea attempting, on a near weekly  basis it sometimes seems, to make sure that it has perfected and  acquired ballistic missile technology, while they also work to make  sure that they are able to put a nuclear warhead on those ballistic  missiles.   Mr. Speaker, we are living in a very dangerous world. We are living  in a world in which America's ability to defend and protect itself is  under threat in a way that it has not been certainly since the end of  the Cold War, and maybe even since World War II.   Defending and protecting this Nation, Mr. Speaker, will require,  both, that we provide the resources our military needs to defend us so  that we can, Mr. Speaker, get out from underneath the policies of the  last 8 years, but it also will require that we secure our border.   This bill today on the floor will provide the relief necessary for  the CBP to do what is necessary to keep us safe. We have no greater  responsibility than providing for our security.   I would remind the gentleman from Florida that this bill passed out  of the Homeland Security Committee on a voice vote, on a bipartisan  basis, with sponsors from both sides of the aisle. It is crucially  important that we take this step to provide the relief--and not  mandatory relief, but the relief--that the CBP can use if it needs.  [[Page H4664]]    Mr. Speaker, as we discuss the range of accomplishments that we have  had that I am very proud of in this Congress and the accomplishments  still to come, I think that we have to also recognize that nothing is  more important than the security of the Nation. This bill goes to the  heart of that, to making sure that the CBP can do its job. Therefore,  Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of both the rule and H.R. 2213.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Hastings is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 374 Offered by Mr. Hastings         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       356) to establish the National Commission on Foreign       Interference in the 2016 Election. The first reading of the       bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and       reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then       on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately       after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of       rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 356.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution. . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
