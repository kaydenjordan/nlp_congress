 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate Cranberry High School and Middle School robotics teams  from Venango County, Pennsylvania's 15th Congressional District.   Cranberry High School sent 19 students and 2 teachers to Dallas,  Texas, to compete in the 2022 VEX Robotics World Championship in May.  While in Dallas, Cranberry High School teams competed against more than  800 other teams from around the country and the world.   When it came time to compete, each team was paired randomly with  another team to showdown against two other randomly paired teams. Each  team participated in 10 2-minute rounds throughout the tournament.   To win, each team's robot had to coordinate with their allied team's  robot to complete certain tasks in the rink before their opponents did.  This required each team to work together with a team of strangers,  sometimes from another country.   This opportunity allowed Cranberry High and Middle School students to  broaden their horizons, as well as explore future careers in the  robotics and engineering fields.   Congratulations to the 19 students who participated in such a great  event.                            ____________________
