 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 286, line 24, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(increased by $177,000,000)''.        Page 288, line 15, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(reduced by $355,000,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentlewoman  from Florida (Ms. Castor) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida.    Mr. Chairman, this Republican bill weakens  America's commitment to clean energy. It harms the huge number of jobs  that are being created in the renewable energy sector. And it stalls  consumer cost savings tied to energy efficiency.   Democrats have a different vision. It is one that lowers costs on our  neighbors back home, and helps create the higher paying jobs of the  future.   My amendment increases funding for the Energy Efficiency & Renewable  Energy account by about $177 million, and it reduces funding for the  fossil Energy Research and Development account by about $355 million.   Energy efficiency and renewable energy initiatives across America  have a proven return on investment for taxpayers. This amendment is  paid for by reducing, but not eliminating, accounts that do not have  the same return on investment for taxpayers.   Investments in energy efficiency and renewables create jobs and help  make our businesses more competitive. Energy efficiency reduces costs  for consumers. And wouldn't that be a positive development for  taxpayers back home, that the Congress is asking to put more money back  into their pockets?   The amount proposed for energy efficiency and renewable energy in the  Republican bill is so low that America will have to reduce the number  of research, development, and demonstration projects that are often  supported with industry, at our great national laboratories, and at our  fantastic universities.   Mr. Chairman, America should be a leader in innovation and  technological advancement. But, instead, the Republican bill says  America should take a back seat. Well, America should not take a back  seat to anyone. We are in the midst of a technological revolution when  it comes to energy and energy efficiency.   Look what is happening all across America. We have a very diverse  energy portfolio and a growing clean energy and efficiency sector. This  is especially important as we tackle the costs and challenges of the  changing climate.   Look at what we are today because of robust investments of the past  decade. The solar industry is creating jobs 12 times faster than the  overall U.S. workforce. In 2016, 1 out of every 50 new jobs was in  solar energy.   Republicans used to say they were for all-of-the-above sources of  energy. Well, you can't say that anymore.   The Trump administration and House Republicans are ceding America's  leadership role in the world by failing to invest in technologies that  will save families and businesses money.   Instead, we should work together and face the challenges of the  changing climate head-on and not bury our heads in the sand. Sixteen of  the 17 hottest years on record have occurred since 2001; including  2016, which was the third consecutive record-breaking year.   The rising costs of the changing climate are a real threat to  everyone, especially to the families I represent back home in Florida,  which is why I filed another amendment that was not ruled in order, an  amendment that would limit the Department of Energy from removing the  term ``climate change'' from their publications.   That is right, the Trump administration has already removed mention  of climate change from government websites, and has deleted a sentence  linking climate change to sea level rise in a press release. Ignoring  or trying to hide the cost of the changing climate will simply cost us  more in the long run.   We should be working together on investing in a clean energy future,  but that, unfortunately, seems farther away today, unless we adopt an  amendment like mine and begin to understand the realities that we are  facing.   If we don't unleash American ingenuity now, our neighbors back home  will face higher AC bills, property insurance bills, flood insurance  bills, and have to put more property taxes into replacing water and  wastewater infrastructure.   I appreciate Ranking Member Kaptur's vision. A little while ago, she  was talking about our national labs--the fact that we have the best  scientists in the world. Don't hamstring them by cutting back on our  investments in clean energy and energy efficiency. She understands that  this is our future that we are talking about. I appreciate her work. I  appreciate the work of Chairman Simpson. I urge an ``aye'' vote on the  Castor amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from West Virginia is recognized for  5 minutes.   Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, let's step back a minute on this issue.   As you can see from this chart, coal, natural gas, and oil--fossil  fuels--make up 81 percent of this country's energy consumption--81  percent.   But the proportion of R&D funding, you can see, is only 18 percent,  which is far below what is currently being spent on renewables and  nuclear.   The reality is that America and the entire world are going to be  dependent on fossil fuels for years to come. The Energy Information  Administration estimates that by the year 2040, fossil energy will  still make up 78 percent of the energy used around the globe.   Are my friends on the other side serious about addressing these  emissions?   Shouldn't America's goal be to develop the technologies so that we  can utilize coal and natural gas around the world in the cleanest, most  efficient way possible?   Shouldn't America be that global leader on energy technology?   You can't do that without research.   Mr. Chairman, we can't be cutting research on fossil fuels and  technology. We should actually be increasing it.   Fossil fuels will be around for the foreseeable future. I think we  have a responsibility for our children and our grandchildren to make  sure that it is burned and used in the most efficient, clean manner  that we can, and this requires research.   Mr. Chairman, the House has soundly defeated similar amendments to  this in the past, year after year, and I hope they will defeat this  one, too.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the remarks of the  gentleman from West Virginia. He is a well-spoken advocate for his  State.   I am not zeroing out the fossil fuel research for R&D, but, instead,  we have got to look towards the future.   Where are the jobs being created now?   It is in renewable energy and energy efficiency, things that are  going to put money back into the pockets of consumers and unleash this  technological revolution so America can stay the leader in the world.   Mr. Chairman, I ask for an ``aye'' vote on the Castor amendment, and  I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate Ms. Castor's remarks, and I  enjoy working with her in committee. But the realization is fossil  fuels are consumed in all 50 States. It is not West Virginia we are  dealing with.   I think Ms. Castor is concerned about her State, the water quality in  her State, and that is what this research is going to take care of.   We have got to maximize the amount of money that has been put into  it. In  [[Page H6433]]  the past, we had far more amount of money in this.   We need to preserve what we have, and, actually, I am hoping we can  plus it up a little bit.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Castor).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Florida  will be postponed.                   Amendment No. 39 Offered by Mr. Norcross    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 39  printed in House Report 115-259.
