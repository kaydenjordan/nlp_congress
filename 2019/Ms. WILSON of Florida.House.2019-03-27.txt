 Madam Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R.  7, the Paycheck Fairness Act. I thank Representative DeLauro for her  efforts in continuing to push this bill to fruition.   As chair of the HELP Subcommittee and as an African American woman, I  feel very strongly about the issue of pay fairness. Our Nation cannot  adequately improve labor conditions without addressing the stark  inequities that exist along gender and racial lines. The fact that, on  average, women currently earn just 80 cents for every dollar a man  earns for the same position and amount of work is just plain wrong and  is a disgrace.   By passing the Paycheck Fairness Act and promoting wage parity, we  can lift families out of poverty and keep harmful biases out of the  workplace. There are too many poor working people in America working  two and three jobs to keep their families whole. Research has shown  that a woman's level of education and work experience or chosen  industry do not necessarily shield her from unfair pay. This problem is  widespread and can be found across all sectors of the economy,  affecting even the most prepared women.   Economically disadvantaged women are hit extremely hard, as are women  of color. There are two Americas, a rich and prosperous America and a  poor and struggling America. Black and Latina women earn 61 cents and  53 cents, respectively, for every dollar earned by men who perform the  same job--such a discrepancy, such a stark statistic, such a shame. The  wage gap is too wide and narrowing much too slowly for Congress not to  act.   I strongly support H.R. 7 as a positive step toward correcting this  glaring injustice. I reiterate my strong support for H.R. 7, and I urge  all my colleagues to vote ``yes'' for paycheck fairness.   Madam Chair, I include in the Record a letter of support from the  National Education Association.                                 National Education Association,                                                     March 26, 2019.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of our three million members       and the 50 million students they serve, we urge you to VOTE       YES on the Paycheck Fairness Act of 2019 (H.R. 7). Votes       associated with this issue may be included in NEA's Report       Card for the 116th Congress.        Equal pay for equal work is NOT today's reality.        The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that in 2017,       the median weekly earnings of full-time, salaried female       workers were 82 percent of those of full-time, salaried male       workers.        According to AAUW, the pay gap is even bigger for women of       color with African Americans earning 61 cents, American       Indian/Alaskan natives 58 cents, and Latinas 53 cents for       every dollar paid to white men.        The gender pay gap exists in all demographics, all parts of       the country, and nearly all occupations--including female-      dominated professions like teaching and nursing.        The Institute for Women's Policy Research reports that       closing the pay gap would cut the poverty rate for working       single mothers in half and lift 2.5 million children out of       poverty.  [[Page H2855]]         The Paycheck Fairness Act of 2019 would help by:        Requiring employers to demonstrate that gender is NOT the       reason they pay employees different amounts to perform the       same jobs.        Prohibiting employers from asking job candidates about       their salary histories.        Protecting employees from retaliation if they discuss their       pay with colleagues.        Strengthening enforcement of equal pay laws by requiring       employers to provide to the Equal Employment Opportunity       Commission (EEOC) data on salaries, promotions, and       dismissals, broken down by race and gender.        Putting in place robust remedies for discrimination.        For all of these reasons, we urge you to VOTE YES on H.R.       7.            Sincerely,                                                         Marc Egan,                                  Director of Government Relations.
