 Mr. Speaker, today I reflect on the imperatives of two  sons of Massachusetts:   John Adams, who, in one sentence, captured the very foundation of our  country, saying, we are a government of laws, not men--translation: no  one is above the law; and   John F. Kennedy, who, in his iconic City Upon a Hill address,  cautioned that any one of us holding public office would be judged by  the high court of history on whether we were truly men and women of  courage, with the courage to stand up to one's enemies and the courage  to stand up, as well, to one's associates, the courage to resist public  pressure as well as private greed, and on whether we are truly men and  women of integrity who never run out of the principles in which we  believe and for whom neither financial gain nor political ambition  could ever divert from the fulfillment of our sacred trust.   President Donald Trump, indifferent and disdainful of this sacred  trust, conspired to extract personal benefit from his office.   He dishonored his oath. I refuse to abandon mine.                                time  1730
