 Mr. Speaker, I thank the Congressional Black Caucus for  holding this important discussion.   For the past 4 years, courts have held that public sector unions can  charge a  [[Page H668]]  small fee to workers that benefit from the collective bargaining  agreements that unions negotiate and enforce. Reversing that precedent  is not an honest shift in legal interpretation. It is a political  attack against American workers and the organizations that represent  them, and it has been years in the making.   For decades, a relentless, coordinated campaign supported by large  corporate interests, advanced by political partisans, and funded by the  Koch brothers has tried to rebrand union membership as a burden on  American workers. Their campaign is as cynical as it is misleading.   For nearly a year, the United States Senate refused to give the  highly respected Judge Merrick Garland even one hearing, then overruled  at least 100 years of Senate tradition to steal a seat on the Supreme  Court.   That seat is now the difference between a Court that upholds the  rights of public sector unions and one that undermines their existence.  Today, President Trump, the real estate billionaire who promised to be  a voice for American workers, has pursued the most aggressive  antiworker agenda in recent memory.   Thank you to my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus for  holding this important discussion.   This evening I am speaking--not just as a strong supporter of public  sector unions--but as a former union member myself. Throughout my 24  years in the classroom, I was a proud, dues-paying member of the  California Teachers Association.   And here's why: Union membership means higher pay, better training,  and safer working conditions. It means access to paid sick leave if you  or a loved one gets sick. It means medical benefits, life insurance,  and retirement security for families in communities across the country.  It means a compassionate, humane workplace. And it means greater  opportunities and a better future for the children of union workers.   At a time when income inequality is high. middle-class wages are  stagnant, and workers' benefits are rapidly disappearing, collective  bargaining is the last remaining source of leverage for American  workers.   And now the conservatives on the Supreme Court are preparing to strip  that leverage away.   For the past 40 years, Courts have held that public sector unions can  charge a small fee to workers that benefit from the collective  bargaining agreements that unions negotiate and enforce. Reversing that  precedent is not an honest shift in legal interpretation. It is a  political attack against American workers and the organizations that  represent them . . . and it has been years in the making.   For decades, a relentless, coordinated campaign, supported by large  corporate interests, advanced by political partisans, and funded by the  Koch Brothers, has tried to rebrand union membership as a burden on  American workers.   Their campaign is as cynical as it is misleading.   For nearly a year, the United States Senate refused to give the  highly respected Judge Merrick Garland even one hearing, and then  overruled at least 100 years of Senate tradition to steal a seat on the  Supreme Court.   That seat is now the difference between a Court that upholds the  rights of public sector unions and one that undermines their existence.   And today, President Trump--the real estate billionaire who promised  to be a voice for American workers has pursued the most aggressive  anti-worker agenda in recent memory.   In the White House, in Congress, and now in the Supreme Court,  American workers are being deprived of the protections that built the  middle class. And instead of accepting blame for exacerbating the  challenges facing working families, Republicans are pointing the finger  at immigrants and refugees in an attempt to divide and distract our  nation from the true source of inequality.   The decision in Janus v. AFSCME must be the beginning of a new  effort, supported by all my colleagues here this evening, to restore  the respect and benefits that American workers deserve.                                time  2115    Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman  from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).
