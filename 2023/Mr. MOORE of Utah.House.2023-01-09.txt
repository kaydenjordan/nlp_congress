 Mr. Speaker, today, we begin the work to reform  our government to work better for the American people and not against  them.   So what do I mean by that?   The last 2 years Democrats have had control of the White House,  House, and Senate, and they have passed and attempted historic spending  provisions. In order to do that, you have to raise revenue. This bill  became a ploy to leverage the IRS to be able to essentially do that  without directly raising taxes. That is what we are talking about here.   I represent thousands of IRS employees. They are some of the best,  most hardworking people in my entire district. As I talk to them, they  care about two major things: customer service, and that technology  needs to be improved. That is what I love about this bill because that  keeps that in here, and we actually want to focus our spending to be  able to directly support them.   As we put forth this bill, we are sincerely trying to take what all  of our constituents have been saying: We need the IRS to have more  support on customer service and technology.   That is why I urge everybody to vote ``yes'' on this bill.
