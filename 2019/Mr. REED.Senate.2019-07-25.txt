 Mr. President, I am introducing the Stop Subsidizing  Multimillion Dollar Corporate Bonuses Act with Senators Blumenthal,  Whitehouse, Merkley, Baldwin, Warren, Van Hollen, and Brown. This  legislation would end special tax deductions for huge executive bonuses  by closing a loophole that still allows publicly traded corporations to  deduct the cost of multimillion-dollar bonuses from their corporate tax  bills. U.S. taxpayers shouldn't have to subsidize these massive  bonuses.   Under section 162(m) of the tax code as amended by the 2017 Trump tax  law (TCJA), when a publicly traded corporation calculates its taxable  income, it is generally permitted to deduct the cost of compensation  from its revenues, with limits up to $1 million for some of the firm's  most senior executives.   In the last Congress, the TCJA closed some of the pre-existing 162(m)  loopholes by incorporating provisions from my Stop Subsidizing  Multimillion Dollar Corporate Bonuses Act, including removing the  exemption for performance-based compensation, which previously  permitted compensation deductions above $1 million when executives met  performance benchmarks set by the corporation's Board of Directors.   In addition, a technical correction from my bill to ensure that all  publicly traded corporations that are required to provide quarterly and  annual reports to their investors under Securities and Exchange  Commission rules and regulations are subject to section l62(m) was also  included in the TCJA. Previously, this section of the tax code only  covered some publicly traded corporations who are required to provide  these periodic reports to their shareholders.   While these were positive steps, even more should have been done,  such as applying section 162(m) to all employees of publicly traded  corporations so that all compensation is subject to a deductibility cap  of $1 million. This was the lone provision from my Stop Subsidizing  Multimillion Dollar Corporate Bonuses Act from the 115th Congress that  was not incorporated into the Trump tax law.   Partially closing these 162(m) loopholes saved taxpayers $9.2 billion  according to the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT), but according to  Americans for Tax Fairness, ``Extending the $1 million deductibility  cap to all forms of compensation for all employees might generate about  $20 billion over 10 years. This is based on JCT's original $50 billion  revenue estimate, discounted to $30 billion because of the 40%  corporate tax cut, and subtracting the $9.2 billion already being  raised by the TCJA's partial reform.''   This is why we are introducing a revised version of the Stop  Subsidizing Multimillion Dollar Corporate Bonuses Act to finish what  was started. Our legislation would extend section 162(m) to all  employees of publicly traded corporations so that all compensation is  subject to a deductibility cap of $1 million. Publicly traded  corporations would still be permitted to pay their executives as much  as they desire, but compensation above and beyond $1 million would no  longer be subsidized by other hardworking taxpayers through our tax  code.   Our legislation tackles this issue head on by ending the public  subsidy of excessive executive compensation. This is simply a matter of  fairness, ensuring that corporations--and not hardworking taxpayers who  face their own challenges in this economy--are paying for the multi- million dollar bonuses corporations have decided to dole out to their  senior executives.   We need to prioritize tax breaks that grow our economy and strengthen  the middle class, and this bill helps eliminate some of the unfairness  in the tax code.   I thank Public Citizen, the Institute for Policy Studies, Global  Economy Project, Americans for Financial Reform, the AFL-CIO, and MIT  Professor Simon Johnson for their support. I also want to thank Senator  Blumenthal for working with me on this issue, and I urge our colleagues  to join us in cosponsoring this legislation.                                  ______                                         By Ms. HIRONO (for herself and Mr. Tillis):   S. 2281.
