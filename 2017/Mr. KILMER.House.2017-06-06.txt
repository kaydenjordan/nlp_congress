 Mr. Speaker, there are people in a person's life that  have a lasting influence, educators who help shape the person that you  become. Ron Jones of Port Angeles, Washington, was one of those people  for me and for hundreds of others.   For the last 42 years, Mr. Jones has been an outstanding music  teacher who, for generations of students, was a difference maker in a  way that would make Mr. Holland and his opus jealous. On multiple  occasions he brought musicians to perform in Carnegie Hall and other  places all around, and in doing so, he didn't just enhance a student's  musical skills, he broadened the horizons of young people. I know he  did that for me. He made you want to be better. He made you want to try  harder. He made you want to perform well enough to get that genuine Ron  Jones smile.   Mr. Speaker, as Mr. Jones prepares for his retirement, it is my honor  to recognize him here on the floor of the United States House of  Representatives, to wish him well, and, on behalf of many grateful  students, to simply say: Thank you, Mr. Jones.                            ____________________
