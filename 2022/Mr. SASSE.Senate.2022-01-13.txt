 Mr. President, first, I want to commend the senior Senator  [[Page S212]]  from Arizona for an extraordinary stand of courage and just a great  speech on the floor a few minutes ago.   I rise today to defend the filibuster again from the latest round of  attacks. I did this repeatedly in the last administration, earning the  ire and frustration of a President of my own party over and over again  as I defended the Senate's purpose and the supermajority requirements  that forge a consensus in a big, broad, diverse, continental nation.  Today, I rise to defend the filibuster again when it is a President of  the other party who has decided to go full demagogue.   For his entire career in the Senate--basically, Joe Biden served in  this body as long as I have been alive, plus or minus a few years--Joe  Biden was a stalwart defender of the filibuster. He said that weakening  the filibuster would ``eviscerate the Senate.'' But earlier this week,  the President was pushed around by a bunch of rage-addicted 20- somethings on his staff and agreed to go down to Georgia and just read  whatever nonsense they loaded into his teleprompter. It was shameful.  It was sad.   The President of the United States called half of the country a bunch  of racist bigots. Think about that--half the country a bunch of racist  bigots. He doesn't believe that. This was a senile comment of a man who  read whatever was loaded into his teleprompter.   His speechwriters puppet-mastered him into saying that anyone who  disagrees with him is George Wallace, Bull Connor, Jefferson Davis. If  you disagree with Joe Biden, you are Jefferson Davis. It is pretty  breathtaking. Equating millions of Americans to some of the ugliest  racists in all of American history isn't just overheated rhetoric; it  is a disgusting smear. Does President Biden really believe this in his  heart of hearts? Based on the conversations I have had with him over  the years, I don't think he believes this at all.   So let's go back to last year. Candidate Joe Biden ran for office,  promising that he would unify the country. That is why the man was  elected--because he said that the crap we went through the last 4 years  was wrong. He said he was going to try to unify the country, but now he  has decided to surrender to a tiny, little far-left group in the  mistaken belief that the loudest voices on Twitter actually represent  America.   It would be useful for us to pause and recognize that the  overwhelming majority of all political tweets in America come from less  than 1\1/2\ percent of Americans. Let's just say that again because  there are a bunch of morons around this building who have decided to  take their Twitter feed as reality. It is not reality.   What the President said in Georgia was nonsense, and Joe Biden, with  his decades in the U.S. Senate, knows that.   The President will be coming to Capitol Hill in the next hour. If  President Biden really believes that Jim Crow is the same thing as a  lot of States that have decided to reconsider some of their COVID  expansion policies around voting--that Jim Crow and redeliberating  about COVID expansions are the same thing--he needs to make that  argument in person.   If Joe Manchin is really as big a racist as Joe Biden apparently  thinks and if Kyrsten Sinema is really a racist--if that is what  animates Kyrsten Sinema--in the eyes of Joe Biden, he should have the  courage to say that to their faces. He is not going to say that to  their faces because he doesn't believe it. Ron Klain has an army of  Twitter trolls that he has decided are reality, and he has decided to  have President Biden become something completely different than the  person who ran for office last year or who served for decades in the  U.S. Senate.   In fact, if Joe Biden really believes that Joe Manchin and Kyrsten  Sinema are bigots, why has he not called for them to be kicked out of  his party? If they are as racist as Bull Connor and Jefferson Davis,  why does Joe Biden want them in his party?   The stuff he said in Georgia is nonsense, and you wouldn't say it to  regular Americans in New Jersey or West Virginia or Arizona or Nebraska  because it is not true.   In fact, if Joe Biden really believes that Lisa Murkowski is George  Wallace, if Tim Scott is Bull Connor, if Susan Collins and I are  Jefferson Davis, I would hope he would have the guts to come and say it  to our faces, but he will not because this is performative politics. It  was nonsense, and everybody knows that it goes away after this weekend.   But Chuck Schumer might have a primary from AOC, so it is really  useful to shift the blame for his disastrous leadership of the Senate  over the last 13 months from himself to Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin.  That is really what is happening right now.   President Biden ought to have the courage to stand up to his own  staff, and he ought to be enough of a man to apologize to the Senate  and to the American people for the nonsense he said in Georgia. The  vast majority of what he said in violating the Ninth Commandment and  disparaging people was not what he really believes, and he wouldn't say  it to me face-to-face. This fiasco was ugly, and it was entirely  unnecessary.    It makes no sense to federalize our elections right now. By the way,  you can differ with me about that. You can believe that federalizing  all elections is a good idea--it is in our constitutional system--but  to demonize people as racist bigots because they are not in favor of  federalizing the elections is a pretty bizarre leap.   So let's just review a little bit of history. Last year, we had a  President who disgraced his office by trying to steal an election. What  stopped that? Our decentralized State-based systems of elections are  what stopped last year's attempt to steal an election.   It makes absolutely no sense to try to go into nuclear partisanship  now when we should actually be talking about how you prevent another  January 6 by doing the hard and actual bipartisan work--not the  grandstanding for Twitter but the hard and bipartisan work of reforming  the Electoral Count Act, which is 130 years old and obviously doesn't  work that well. We should reform the Electoral Reform Act.   This is about the subversion of an election, not the suppression.  There are real problems in our electoral system, and we could be doing  work to actually fix that and try to stop the institutional arsonists  in Congress who want to build political brands on the wreckage of  American institutions. We could do real work. The President decided to  do something completely different this week.   Here is the silver lining. President Biden, Leader Schumer, and  everybody in this body know that the charade we have been going through  for the last 3 days is great for the 1\1/2\ percent of people addicted  to rage on Twitter. I get it. There are 1\1/2\ percent of people who  get their jollies out of this. It is bad for America, and it is just as  undermining of the public trust in elections as what Donald Trump did  last year.   But here is the thing: Everybody going through this charade knows  that it dies this weekend. Why? Because Members of the Democrats' own  conference know that there is no exception to the way the Senate rules  work. Every single Senator knows that the filibuster is not going to  die this weekend, and every Senator knows that, if it would, the  nonsense rhetoric about one exception--it is like losing your virginity  just once--is not really how it works. Once the filibuster goes for x,  it goes for y, and it goes for z. Today, it is election centralization.  Tomorrow, it is gun politics. The next day, it is climate debates.  Every red-hot issue in American culture and American politics would be  in the same exception because every issue would be just as urgent next  week, next month, and next year.   Fortunately, Senator Manchin knows this, Senator Sinema knows this,  and by the way, a whole bunch more colleagues of mine in the Democratic  Party also know this. They just don't have as much courage to say it in  public as those two. A whole bunch of my colleagues--I tried to count  this morning; it is between 15 and 18 of my colleagues in the  Democratic Party--have privately told me they regret following Harry  Reid over the tribalist cliff in the summer of 2013 for just the one  exception of judicial confirmations to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.  I think 15 to 18 Democrats have privately told me they regret this.  Why? Because that one-time exception is now how the entire Executive  Calendar works. Everybody knew, when Harry Reid set this  [[Page S213]]  place on fire in 2013, that that was what it was going to produce and  that the exact same thing would happen on the legislative calendar with  the supposed one-time carve-out for the legislative filibuster.   Let's remember what this institution is for. What the Senate is  supposed to be about is we are supposed to be the one part of Congress  and the one part of the American Government that thinks beyond a 24- month window. It is the job of the people who serve in this body--only  100 people right now and only, I think, 2,100 people across 230-some  years of U.S. history. Only 2,000 people have had the honor of serving  our States in this body. It is supposed to be our job to take the long- term view, not just 24 hours of Twitter. We are supposed to think  beyond the 24 months of the next election. That is what our job is  supposed to be.   There are a lot of people around this place who apparently can't  think beyond 24 hours right now. That is their right, but they  shouldn't be Senators because the purpose of this place is supposed to  be to take a long-term view.   Some of my colleagues are convinced that Americans are polarized  because Congress doesn't act more or faster, and they think that the  solution is, supposedly, to eliminate the filibuster. They are kidding  themselves. That would not extinguish the fires of red-hot tribalism in  this country. It would throw gasoline on them. Addressing the real  tribal disease in America requires a Senate that becomes less tribal,  not more tribal.   Senator Sinema's speech should be commended to every Member of this  body to go back and read. She said there are two fundamental questions  before us today. One is, Where does the descent into tribalism in this  institution ultimately land? And what can each of us do to stop that?   Those are the two big questions that she said should be before us  today.   Getting rid of the filibuster means this: It means that you turn one  razor-thin majority imposing its will on the American people and on  legislation into a pendulum-swinging, another razor-thin majority, 24  months later, that sweeps all of that aside and jerks the American  people around to the opposite legislation of what was just passed 50- 50--51-50 in today's Senate. And all of it flips 11 months from now,  and the legislation all gets undone, and new legislation gets put in  place.   Do you really think regular folks in New Jersey and Nebraska want  that? Hardly any of them want that.   Imagine what the current situation would look like if you have that  federally imposed whiplash on our most sensitive issues inside every 24  months. We think tribalism is bad now. I guarantee you can make it  worse. And eliminating the filibuster accelerates that descent into  tribalism.   There is a place, of course, where simple majorities rule. It is  right down that hallway. We have a House of Representatives already.  Does anybody want to make the argument that that place is healthier  than we are because it is a simple majoritarian body? No, it is plain  to see, in an age of hyperpartisanship and social media grandstanding,  that the House is being more and more ruled by demagogues and dolts.  That is not what the Senate is called to do.   The Senate is supposed to be a different place. The Senate is  supposed to be the place where passions are tempered and refined by  people who are responsible for thinking beyond our next election, which  is why every election cycle in America only has one-third of Senators  even up for reelection. That is the whole reason we have 6-year terms.  If I had my will, I could be King for a day and write some  constitutional amendments and pass them. I would have a single 12-year  Senate term, and everybody would be out of here. It is a little bit  longer than 6 years, but one term, no reelection, and get back to life,  go back to serving in your community.   If you get rid of the filibuster, you will turn the Senate into the  House, and you will ensure that this body, too, ends up consumed by  demagogues, conspiracists, and clowns. That is what will happen in this  body. The American people don't have time for that crap. Nobody wants  that.   Americans don't want one-party rule, by the Democrats or by the  Republicans. Both of these parties are really crappy. The American  people are not fans of these political parties.   Getting rid of the filibuster means you don't have to try to talk to  people on the other side of the aisle and get to a 60-vote threshold  for legislation or a 67-vote threshold for rules changes. It means that  one of these two terrible parties gets to do a lot more stuff a lot  faster that will inevitably be incredibly unpopular with the American  people.   The American people do not want revolution. They do not want  fundamental change. What they want is competence. What they want is  more honesty. What they want is less performative grandstanding.   Institutions like the Senate provide frameworks and processes for  competent, responsible self-government, for more honesty. We are not  living up to it right now, but we could live down to something worse,  and ending the filibuster would accelerate that. It would accelerate  tribalism. It would accelerate people following Senators into  bathrooms, screaming at them, trying to bully them. It will not lead to  more productive, compromise legislation that tries to bring along a  larger share of the American public.   The rules and the norms of this place have been built up over a very  long time, and they exist to discourage demagoguery. Putting cameras in  every room we are in around here tries to undermine so much of what the  Senate is about. I am for lots of transparency. I am for pen-and-pad  reporters everywhere. But the cameras we have put in this place have  encouraged so much demagoguery. That is so much of the problem of why  we have so much tribalism here and tribalism more broadly in the  country.   And if you eliminate the filibuster, you accelerate all those most  destructive, short-term performative trends. You encourage more rank  partisanship, and you discourage consensus, compromise, and  collaboration.   Friends, please do not--like the President did in Georgia this week-- surrender to the angriest voices on social media in the mistaken belief  that they reflect the majority of America. They don't. They reflect the  majority of Twitter.   Political Twitter is like the ninth most popular topic on Twitter. K- pop music is exponentially more popular on Twitter than politics. The  share of Americans paying attention to political Twitter bounces around  between one-tenth and one-sixth. And something like 80 percent of all  political tweets come from under 2 percent of the public. We should  remind ourselves of that again, and again, and again, because there are  people here who regularly mistake Twitter with reality and with the  American public. We are called to serve the American public. We are not  called to serve rage-addicted people on social media.   Now, perhaps more than ever, it is our job to stop giving ear to  political arsonists who would burn down our institutions and intensify  our divisions. Now is the time for us to think together over the long- term how we renew those institutions.   The filibuster is a part of what can lead us to broader consensus,  and eliminating the filibuster will accelerate the political arson  around this place and across our land.   Senate, we can do better.                            ____________________
