 Mr. President, I rise today to honor an exceptional  member of the Department of the Air Force. I would like to recognize  Lt. Col. Terrell ``T'' Tillery's distinguished service and dedication  to enhancing the relationship between the U.S. Air Force and my office.   Lieutenant Colonel Tillery has distinguished himself through his  professional character and leadership by serving our Nation in uniform.  A leader and expert communicator, he has provided exemplary service to  our country while assigned to the Air Force Senate Liaison Office.  Terrell is a career force support officer with experience in manpower,  personnel, and services, including assignments as a force support  squadron commander, recorder for the USAF Selection Board Secretariat,  and a squadron section commander. He has served tours at the base,  major command, agency, center and air staff levels. He has deployed in  support of Operations Willing Spirit, Iraqi Freedom, Enduring Freedom,  and Freedom's Sentinel. It was this experience that made Terrell the  perfect fit to serve as a legislative liaison officer for the  Department of the Air Force for the past 2 years on Capitol Hill.   Terrell served as a legislative liaison officer from July 2019 to May  2021, skillfully performing his duties throughout. His attention to  detail and responsiveness strengthened the capabilities of my office in  support of our special relationship with the Air Force. Specifically,  Terrell shaped numerous engagements between my office and Air Force  senior leaders. Of special concern to me was the related dialog  concerning the Air Force's future to include that of the KC-46 and B-21  aircraft, the Next Generation Air Dominance Program, and the Ground  Based Strategic Deterrent. Additionally, Terrell's direct support  provided me and my staff with critical information necessary for our  consideration of two National Defense Authorization Acts.   After concluding this challenging assignment, Lieutenant Colonel  Tillery will take command of another U.S. Air Force squadron, this time  the 355th Force Support Squadron at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, AZ.  In closing, I express my gratitude and appreciation to Lieutenant  Colonel Tillery for his excellent support of me and my staff in  furtherance of the Air Force and Space Force missions and my  appreciation to his supportive family, Mrs. Catherine Tillery, and  their three children Tucker, Collier and Chandler Grace. I wish this  Air Force family all the best in their next chapter of service to our  Nation.                            ____________________
