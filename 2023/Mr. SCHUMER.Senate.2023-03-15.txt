 Mr. President, this morning, I sent a letter to the  National Transportation Safety Board Chair, Jennifer Homendy, urging  her to expand NTSB's investigation of Norfolk Southern into a  comprehensive review of all seven class I freight railroad companies'  safety practices.   Though the NTSB is currently investigating the toxic derailment in  East Palestine and Norfolk Southern's questionable safety culture, I  want to make something very clear: Norfolk Southern isn't the only rail  company that has spent years lobbying to loosen regulations, neglect  safety upgrades, and lay off workers.   Norfolk Southern is just one example of a dangerous, industry-wide  trend within the rail industry that puts profits over people's safety.   In the last 5 years alone, there have been over 26,500 accidents and  incidents in the rail industry, but instead of prioritizing safety, the  industry cut over 30,000 employees from the workforce--roughly 20  percent.   We need the NTSB to expand its investigation because the current data  can only tell part of the story. The data tells us how many accidents  have occurred, but we want to know if they occurred in populated areas  and how many gallons of oil were spilled or which toxic chemicals were  released.   We also need to know which of these accidents occurred because the  tracks were severely degraded or poorly designed.   We also want to know which negligent company policies contributed to  the 2,700 deaths in recent years and if any of those could have been  prevented.   These are just some of the questions that my letter asks--ones that  can only be answered by a complete, comprehensive, and rigorous  investigation of the rail freight industry.   I hope NTSB expands its investigation to include the safety practices  and culture of all class I freight railroads. It is a necessary step to  assure Americans that freight rail safety will improve.   In the meantime, I again commend my colleagues Senators Brown and  Vance of Ohio and Fetterman and Casey of Pennsylvania for introducing  bipartisan legislation to improve rail  [[Page S782]]  safety and provide a check on the railroad industry. I will continue  working with them to move it forward.                                    H.R. 1    Mr. President, now, on the House Republicans' H.R. 1, today, House  Republicans are rolling out a partisan, dead-on-arrival, and unserious  proposal for addressing America's energy needs that they have  laughingly labeled H.R. 1. It is a nonstarter in the Senate.   Republicans' so-called energy proposal is as bad and as partisan as  it gets. H.R. 1 will lock America into the most expensive and volatile  dirty sources of energy and will set America back a decade or more in  our transition toward clean, affordable energy.   Even a brief glance at the House GOP proposal is enough to show it is  not a serious package. The package is a wish list for Big Oil, gutting  important environmental safeguards on fossil fuel projects, while doing  none of the important permitting reforms that would help bring  transmission and clean energy projects online faster.   Considering America's serious energy challenges--and not to mention  the disruptions caused by the war in Ukraine--it is bewildering to see  House Republicans waste time on a Big Oil wish list, instead of taking  our energy needs seriously, and ignoring clean energy as they do.   Thankfully, many Democrats and Republicans understand that the only  way we will pass a genuine energy package this Congress is through  bipartisan cooperation. I am glad that there are good-faith talks  underway right now between both parties in both Houses to figure out  what sort of permitting deal is possible.   I strongly support these efforts because Americans should not have to  go broke just to meet their daily energy needs. We should work on a  comprehensive, bipartisan permitting package that can secure enough  votes to pass the Congress and reach the President's desk.   Any serious permitting package must also focus on the needs of the  future. As America transitions to clean energy, we need to take steps  in Congress to ease that transition and ensure clean energy is  reliable, accessible, and, most importantly, affordable. That includes  efforts to expedite the onshoring and construction of industries  critical to our economic and national security, like work we did in  CHIPS and Science. Permitting reform is an essential step toward laying  the foundation for a clean energy future, and Republicans must work  with Democrats on a package that meets this challenge, if we are going  to get anything done.   What House Republicans have come up with, in the meantime, is  something that falls pathetically short.    I ask unanimous consent to complete my remarks prior to  the scheduled recess.    My remarks are very simple. The United States-India  relationship is extremely important, and it is a very good thing that  we now have an Ambassador.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  confirmation vote on the Taylor-Kale nomination be at a time to be  determined by the majority leader in consultation with the Republican  leader; further, that the cloture motions filed during yesterday's  session ripen at 11:30 a.m. on Thursday, March 16; that following the  cloture vote on the Clarke nomination and notwithstanding rule XXII,  the Senate resume legislative session and vote on the motion to invoke  cloture on the motion to  [[Page S794]]  proceed to Calendar No. 25, S. 316; further, that if cloture is invoked  on the Clarke nomination, at 1:30 p.m., the Senate resume legislative  session, all postcloture debate time be considered expired, and the  Senate vote on the confirmation of the nomination; finally, if any  nominations are confirmed during Thursday's session, the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the President  be immediately notified of the Senate's actions.
