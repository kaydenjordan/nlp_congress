 Mr. President, the United States is facing an urgent  nuclear crisis with North Korea. President Trump should not trigger  another nuclear crisis with Iran.   North Korea's nuclear program presents a clear and direct threat to  the United States. Our top military official, General Dunford,  testified last month that North Korea has the capability to strike the  U.S. mainland with an intercontinental ballistic missile. North Korea  has ramped up the pace of its ballistic missile tests, firing two ICBMs  over Japan in recent months. Just last month, North Korea conducted its  sixth test of a nuclear weapon, the largest yet.   Meanwhile, President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are  engaged in nuclear brinkmanship. Trump has threatened to ``totally  destroy'' North Korea, has tweeted that North Korea ``might not be  around much longer,'' and has rebuked his own Secretary of State for  attempting to find a diplomatic solution. With each reckless  pronouncement, Trump's threats could bring the United States closer to  a war that would put at risk millions of lives, including tens of  thousands of American soldiers.   Confronted with the North Korean nuclear threat, President Trump is  seeking to provoke another nuclear crisis, this time in the turbulent  Middle East. He has repeatedly threatened to withdraw from the  agreement that the United States and the international community forged  to prohibit Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. He has called the  Iran deal an ``embarrassment,'' ``the worst deal ever,'' and has vowed  to ``rip up'' the agreement. In making those threats, Trump is putting  our security and credibility at risk.   The Iran deal is working. It has verifiably shut off Iran's pathways  to a nuclear bomb, imposed tough constraints on Iran's nuclear program,  and subjected Iran to the most comprehensive inspection and monitoring  regime ever negotiated. How do we know? We know from Donald Trump  himself.   Just 2 weeks ago, President Trump found Iran in compliance and waived  nuclear-related sanctions on Iran. In fact, the Trump administration  has twice certified Iran's compliance with the deal, acknowledging that  adherence to the agreement is in the vital national security interests  of the United States. Our State Department, our Defense Department, and  our intelligence community have all assessed that Iran is in compliance  with the nuclear agreement. Most importantly, President Trump has  presented no evidence to Congress, as he is required to do by law, of  any potential Iranian breach of the deal. In fact, the administration  has yet to brief the Senate on its strategy for Iran, despite weekly  requests from my colleagues.   Despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, Trump has suggested  that he will refuse to certify Iran's compliance with the deal by  October 15, the next deadline. This will effectively kick the deal's  fate to Congress, which will then have 60 days to decide whether to  reimpose the nuclear-related sanctions on Iran waived under the deal.   Make no mistake: Trump's reasons for not certifying Iran's compliance  are based on politics, not national security. He wants to tear up an  agreement that has prevented Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, simply  because it was negotiated by a democratic administration. Trump has  threatened to do this without offering any alternative plan to block  Iran from getting a nuclear bomb.   In the absence of any evidence of an Iranian violation, Trump and his  team are manufacturing reasons not to certify the deal, citing issues  not addressed in the nuclear agreement, such as Iran's sponsorship of  regional terrorism, its ballistic missile tests, and its human rights  violations.   Iran is subject to sanctions for those malign activities. Since the  Iran deal has been implemented, the United States had designated over  100 individuals and entities for sanctions. Congress passed a new law  this July, that I cosponsored, sanctioning Iran for these aggressions.  It is worth underscoring this point: Donald Trump has yet to issue  instructions to his administration on how to implement that sanctions  law.   In short, the Iran deal has not prevented the United States from  taking measures to hold Iran accountable for its destabilizing actions  elsewhere. It has, however, prevented Iran from conducting those same  actions with a nuclear weapon. That is where our focus should continue  to be. A nuclear-armed Iran would be a far greater menace in the region  than a nonnuclear Iran.   The truth is, if the United States had tried to expand the nuclear  agreement to also address Iran's ballistic missile tests and its  regional terrorism, there would simply be no deal. Russia and China  would not have agreed to its terms. Preventing Iran from obtaining a  nuclear weapon was the only point on which all parties were united.  Critics of the deal who argue otherwise are not being straight with the  American people.   In a world of alternative facts, that point is worth reiterating. No  deal, including this one, contains everything we want. That is the  nature of a negotiation. Unilaterally withdrawing from the agreement  will not produce a better deal today. In fact, we have much less  negotiating leverage today. The United States does not have the backing  of our allies and partners around the world for withdrawal. Our  partners have been crystal clear. They will not renegotiate the deal  while it is working. Without that international backing, we have no  leverage with Iran.   This brings to bear another, equally important, point. This  administration  [[Page S6353]]  is already putting American credibility at risk; if we manufacture a  specious excuse for abandoning the Iran agreement, our word will mean  little. That will make it nearly impossible to negotiate a diplomatic  solution to the nuclear crisis in North Korea, already an extremely  challenging prospect. Put simply, our allies, partners, and adversaries  would have no reason to trust the United States.   That is why Secretary of Defense Mattis, when asked whether it was in  the national security interest of the United States to stay in the Iran  deal, said, ``Yes, Senator, I do.''   I want to end by outlining the choice we face right now. The choice  we face right now is between a deal or no deal. It is between cutting  off Iran's pathways to a bomb or allowing Iran to push forward with its  nuclear weapons program. It is between maintaining U.S. leadership in  the world or empowering our adversaries. It is a choice between  diplomacy or heading down a path toward war.   For these reasons, I urge President Trump to certify Iran's  compliance with the nuclear agreement by October 15. If he fails to do  so, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to preserve the deal.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to a  Marylander, John Gabriel ``Gabe'' Smith, whose courage not only broke  barriers for himself but whose courage advanced the cause of the  betterment of humanity.   On October 14, he will be recognized at the Gonzaga High School  homecoming by the Gonzaga Onyx, a group of African-American alumni of  Gonzaga, due to his achievement of being the very first African- American to graduate from Washington, DC's Gonzaga College Preparatory  High School with the class of 1954.   He was born in the turbulent times of the early 40s in St. Mary's  County, MD, where he and his two sisters grew up. His parents relied on  hard work and diligence to pursue excellence and committed their  children to a Catholic education and religious fellowship at St. Peter  Claver, a church with a predominantly African-American parish in rural  Ridge, MD. As an eighth grader, Gabe decided to serve as an altar boy;  little did he know, it would change his life and place him in the  annals of American history.   He listened to Father McKenna describe the ways that people had  traveled to find God and become a priest. Interested in pursuing this  vocation, he asked Father McKenna how he, too, could achieve it and was  surprised when Father McKenna told him that he would, at a minimum,  need to know Latin.   Unfortunately, there were no schools in St. Mary's or the surrounding  areas that taught Latin, let alone the tools necessary to launch his  vocation, so Father McKenna told him about a school in Washington, DC,  where he could learn Latin and all the other requisites. That school  was Gonzaga College High.   Several years before the Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954  to end segregation, Archbishop O'Boyle ordered the integration of all  Catholic schools and churches in the Archdiocese of Washington. Thus,  in 1951, he entered the halls of Gonzaga.   Fortunately, during his time at Gonzaga, his classmates stood with  him in the face of adversity and strife when they walked outside the  school walls. As a member of the Gonzaga Purple Eagle football team, he  encountered additional support from Coach Joe Kozik who stood by him,  along with his teammates. Whenever the Eagles would play an opponent  that vehemently rejected the idea of teams with African-American  players, Coach Kozik and his teammates always stuck together like a  family to overcome hate and ignorance.   In 1954, he completed his education at Gonzaga College High School as  the first African-American graduate. Poised with his education and  command of Latin, he entered Howard University and graduated with a  degree in pharmacy, where he commanded his field for over 40 years,  just retiring this past spring of 2017. He is now spending time with  his wife and children.   Gabe says that ``he had angels who helped him through and they  continue to be with him today.'' He will forever leave an outstanding  legacy for the State of Maryland and the halls of Gonzaga College High  School. He was the first African American at Gonzaga, paving the way  for over 1,100 esteemed African-American alumni to follow in his  footsteps.                            ____________________
