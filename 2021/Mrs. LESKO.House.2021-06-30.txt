 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill.   This bill should be focused on proposals that make the United States  more competitive in the global economy, and update our Nation's  infrastructure; but instead it is filled with detrimental mandates.   Despite the fact that rail offers one of the most environmentally  efficient ways to transport goods, this bill includes regulations that  undermine the railroad industry's ability to offer competitive  services. The bill effectively prohibits movement of liquefied natural  gas by rail, despite extensive research into the safety of this method  by the Department of Transportation.   This legislation also would allow the EPA to enact burdensome  regulations on drinking water utilities, driving up costs for low- income consumers.   Under these new regulations, drinking water utilities that serve  smaller, lower-income communities cannot receive direct funding from  the EPA. This harms low-income consumers and those on fixed incomes.  They will have to jump through burdensome hoops and will face increased  costs that many of them cannot afford.   In drafting this bill, Democrats have pushed aside commonsense  solutions to push their radical, partisan agenda.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.
