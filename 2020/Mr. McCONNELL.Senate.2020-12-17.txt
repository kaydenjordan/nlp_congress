 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, well, we in Congress are no strangers  to December funding deadlines or the occasional pre-Christmas  cliffhanger.   In that respect, the situation we face now is familiar. Funding for  the Federal Government is hanging in the balance. In the next few days,  Congress will either succeed or fail at providing secure and stable  funding for our military commanders, our Federal Departments, and key  investments for our future.   Fortunately, our colleagues on the Appropriations Committee and their  House counterparts have been on the case. Bipartisan, bicameral  committee work has full-year government funding legislation on the 1- yard line.   I am optimistic that if we can close out our other parallel business,  we should be able to fund the government and move forward together.   But that brings me to the way in which this year is unlike anything  we have seen before. It has been more than 9 months since our Nation  began to feel the full force of the COVID-19 pandemic. The American  people have done what Americans do when crises come knocking.   Essential workers have kept our Nation running. Healthcare  professionals have worked day and night to care for strangers. Heroic  American businesses have adapted, reinvented, and obeyed the advice of  medical experts.   Now we can see the light at the end of the tunnel. Operation Warp  Speed has given us safe and effective vaccines in record time, but the  American people need another bridge to those better days that are not  so far off. The country needs Congress to come through with another  targeted rescue package. They have waited months. They have waited and  suffered, and some have died while needless political games have played  out. The American people's wait for more emergency assistance ought to  be over.   For months, I have called for a targeted, bipartisan package that  would put hundreds of billions of dollars into payroll support,  testing, vaccine distribution, extended unemployment aid, safe schools,  and other essential priorities.   So I am encouraged that our Democratic colleagues have now embraced  this framework that has been the right solution for our country all  this time. And a bipartisan, bicameral agreement appears to be close at  hand.   The outline that I have been discussing with the Democratic leader,  Speaker Pelosi, and Leader McCarthy would get another huge dose of  bipartisan support out the door as fast as possible.   We have yet to nail down every detail, but in broad strokes, we have  been discussing the targeted second round of the job-saving Paycheck  Protection Program that Republicans have sought since last summer.   We are discussing many tens of billions of dollars for distributing  vaccines, COVID testing, and equipping safe schools to get our kids'  educations back on track. We are discussing extending important  unemployment programs.   At the particular urging of President Trump and Secretary Mnuchin,  who continue to be the champions of cash relief for American families,  we are discussing more direct impact payments for individuals, plus the  bonus for families with children.   These are just some of the major pillars. And equally important, we  are agreeing to be smart about financing these extraordinary policies.   Now listen to this. We intend to repurpose more than $400 billion in  unspent funds which we have already allocated in the CARES Act. It  turned out these funds did not need to be tapped to restore basic  stability to our economy. It is time we put that money to urgent use.   Like I said at the time yesterday, I am heartened by our discussions  and our progress. I believe all sides are working in good faith for our  shared goal of getting an outcome.   But I will say this. In my judgment, we are very close to a point  that arises in every major negotiation. It is the point where each side  faces a fork in the road.   Do we want to lapse into politics as usual and let negotiations lose  steam? Do we want to haggle and spar like this were an ordinary  political exercise, get wrapped around the axle of language or policy  riders that we know are controversial, or, on the other hand, after  months of inaction, do we want to move swiftly and with unusual  bipartisanship to close out our issues, seal the deal, and write text  that can quickly pass into law?   In short, we are near the point in this process where we decide if we  are going to stay on the fast track or drift back toward business as  usual.   I say the answer should be obvious. After all these months,  struggling Americans don't just need action; they need action fast-- fast.   So I continue to appreciate our productive discussions, but I hope we  also remember just how urgent the situation is for millions and  millions of our fellow citizens.   So for the information of all Senators, we are going to stay right  here--right here--until we are finished, even if that means working  through the weekend, which is highly likely.   And if we need to further extend the Friday funding deadline before  final legislation can pass in both Chambers, I hope we will extend it  for a very, very short--short--window of time.   Our citizens can't afford for us to get bogged down in the back-and- forth. Let's finish up our bipartisan framework. Let's make law as soon  as possible. That is what our people deserve.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, here is where we are: Conversations are  still underway and making progress on the major pandemic relief package  we have all been seeking for the American people.  [[Page S7579]]    As I have been saying, families across the Nation have waited far too  long already for another significant dose of assistance. We must not  slide into treating these talks like routine negotiations to be  conducted at Congress's routine pace.   So we need to complete this work, and we need to complete it right  away. That is what I have said. The Senate is not going anywhere until  we have COVID relief out the door. We are staying right here until  COVID relief is out the door.   In the meantime, we are going to stay productive while these  negotiations are going on. So for the information of all of my  colleagues, we should expect continued votes on nominations throughout  the weekend. We will continue accomplishing other aspects of the  people's business--confirming well-qualified nominees to important  posts--until we can act on the major rescue package the American people  deserve.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 895.

Mr. President, over the course of this year, dedicated  citizens in a small Jackson Purchase community have poured through  their hometown's historical record. The bicentennial of Lynnville, KY,  was coming, and they wanted to celebrate every detail. Today, it is my  privilege to join these passionate Kentuckians in marking 200 years of  Bluegrass history and heritage.   Lynnville is no ordinary town. Near the Tennessee border in Graves  County, this agricultural community has survived all-consuming fires,  devastating tornadoes, and even the Black Patch Tobacco War. Through  perseverance and grit, Lynnville has certainly earned its nickname  ``The Little Town That Won't Die.   For 200 years, stalwart Kentuckians have overcome challenges, come  together to rebuild, and made Lynnville a wonderful place to live. I am  proud of their resilient spirit, and I look forward to this community's  bright future.   Unfortunately, the ongoing coronavirus pandemic canceled some aspects  of Lynnville's bicentennial celebrations, but the Kentucky Historical  Society joined the festivities with a special commemoration. They  delivered a new historical marker to Lynnville to detail this  community's rich heritage. It is a well-deserved tribute. I am grateful  to everyone who made the historical marker and this  [[Page S7587]]  year of celebration possible. On behalf of the Senate, I share our  congratulations with every Lynnville family on its 200 years of proud  Kentucky history.                            ____________________
