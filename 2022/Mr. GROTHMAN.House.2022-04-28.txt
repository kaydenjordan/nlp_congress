 Madam Speaker, yesterday, upon returning to my office,  I heard testimony from Secretary Mayorkas from Homeland Security saying  that he inherited a mess at the border and that he is doing the best he  can.   The American public ought to know what the numbers are. Two Marches  ago, between got-aways who weren't vetted by the Border Patrol and  people who were vetted by the Border Patrol, about 11,000 people a  month were coming here. A year ago in March, it was around 60,000. We  are right now at 153,000.   When you inherit a March with 11,000 and 2 years later you are at  153,000, you have not been doing the best you can.   This is threatening the end of America. It signals that America is  very weak. I have felt all along the policies at the southern border  are one of the reasons we have to deal with Ukraine right now, because  no normal leader would allow this many people to cross the border.   In any event, I urge my colleagues, anybody who has the ear of  Secretary Mayorkas or the President, to point out that when you go from  11,000 to 153,000 people a month in 2 years crossing the border, you  have failed and something has to be done.                            ____________________
