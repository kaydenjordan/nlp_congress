 Mr. Speaker, many Americans have worked hard  their entire lives paying into pension programs with the promise that,  after a career of hard labor, they would have a secure transition into  retirement.   Our multiemployer pension plans, of which there are 114, covering 1.3  million workers, are severely underfunded and in trouble. The Butch  Lewis Act is an important step in responsibly securing the pensions  that millions of American workers have earned throughout their years of  hard work.   We must ensure that the pensions that American union workers have  earned over a lifetime of work are protected well into the future. This  Congress needs to take action now to ensure the promise of those who  were promised after years of contributions to have a pension in their  retirement years.                            ____________________
