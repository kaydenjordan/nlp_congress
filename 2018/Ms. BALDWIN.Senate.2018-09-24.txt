 Mr. President, today I wish to honor Phil Neuenfeldt,  president of the Wisconsin State AFL-CIO,  [[Page S6274]]  on his retirement. Throughout his long and remarkable career, Phil has  been a passionate champion of fair wages and safe work environments for  hard-working Wisconsinites.   After serving our country in the U.S. Navy from 1969 to 1971, Phil  began his career on the shop floor of a manufacturing company. He  joined International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Local 1916  in 1973 and quickly became indispensable in the union's fight for fair  contracts and improved working conditions. In his 32 years at the  Wisconsin AFL-CIO, Phil's responsibilities grew from legislative  director to secretary-treasurer and finally to president in 2010.   Phil Neuenfeldt has long been one of Wisconsin's strongest voices for  the middle class and greatest protectors of fundamental freedoms for  working people. Phil believes unequivocally in the dignity of work and  the responsibility of employers to pay wages that can support a family,  and he believes with every fiber of his being that workers deserve a  seat at the bargaining table.   Of his many accomplishments, Phil is perhaps best known for the  Wisconsin Regional Training Partnership and Worker Centered Learning,  which are programs he helped initiate that have become national models  for job creation and training. He was also instrumental in defending  the Family and Medical Leave Act, ensuring workers and families are  protected when life circumstances required them to take care of loved  ones. Phil is also known for pushing legislation to require public  schools to teach the history of the labor movement, ensuring that  generations to come would know the celebrated history of organized  labor.   Phil deserves to be proud of his outstanding leadership during some  of labor's most tumultuous times in State history. Facing unprecedented  attacks on worker protections and the right to bargain collectively in  2011, he steered the Wisconsin labor movement through rough waters  while the Nation looked on. Thanks to his leadership and perseverance,  the Wisconsin labor movement is back on the rise, once again building a  stronger middle class and restoring faith in the American dream.   Today, as Phil retires as president of the Wisconsin AFL-CIO, I know  he will never give up the fight that has made him the voice of those  who work hard for a living. His engagement, his activism and his  efforts to organize for change are a true reflection of Wisconsin's  progressive traditions. I will be forever grateful for Phil's  passionate and loyal advocacy on behalf of Wisconsin workers and  forever honored to call him my friend.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 100th  anniversary of St. Matthew Christian Episcopal Church in Milwaukee, WI.  St. Matthew Christian Episcopal Church was established on September 15,  1918, and has been a pillar in the community for the last 100 years.   The first service was held by Pastor W.S. Ferguson in his home with  the church's membership originally constituting only seven people,  including three family members and four Christian followers. As the  congregation slowly began to grow, the church sought out a permanent  location of worship in Milwaukee, and with the determined efforts of  the membership and personal sacrifices of the Pastor's family, an  initial payment for a church building on 538 West Walnut Street was  made.   St. Matthew's went on to play a significant role in the civil rights  movement of the 1960s, particularly during the campaign to desegregate  Milwaukee Public Schools. A coalition comprised of over a dozen civil  rights groups known as the Milwaukee United School Integration  Committee, MUSIC, was formed, and then-St. Matthew's Pastor B.S. Gregg  was a prominent member of the group. MUSIC conducted a series of  demonstrations with the goal of pressuring the Milwaukee school board  to put an end to de facto segregation in the city. A series of school  boycotts were held, during which Freedom Schools were created to offer  an alternative curriculum emphasizing African-American history and  activism. St. Matthew's was proud to house one of the Freedom Schools  during this time.   The members and leaders of the church are proud of their rich  heritage and the expansion of their Christian influence in the  community, which are demonstrated by their many active ministries that  care for those in need. Rev. Richard D. Shaw has been leading the  church since 2010, and under his guidance, St. Matthew's has  experienced a renewed and revived spirit. In the last 10 years,  Reverend Shaw has worked on various boards and committees throughout  Milwaukee, including MICAH--Milwaukee Inner-City Congregations Allied  for Hope--and has developed many ministries within St. Matthew's as  well.   St. Matthew Christian Episcopal Church provides a beacon of hope and  a place of comfort during times of trial and uncertainty. Under the  devoted guidance of its growing membership, may it continue to be a  shining asset to the community for the next 100 years.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the Green Bay  Packers on the team's 100th anniversary. I am honored to pay tribute to  this iconic Wisconsin organization.   In August of 1919, Green Bay, WI natives Earl ``Curly'' Lambeau and  George Whitney Calhoun set out on a mission to find money to buy  uniforms for their newly formed football team. They eventually found a  willing donor in the Indian Packing Company, with the condition that  the team take on the company's name. Thus, the Green Bay Packers were  born.   Lambeau laid the foundation of the Green Bay Packers during the  team's first 30 years of existence as its founder and coach. He led the  organization through some of the most tumultuous as well as some of the  most successful times in the franchise's history, winning multiple  championships throughout the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s. Following his  death in 1965, the Green Bay Packers changed the name of their City  Stadium to Lambeau Field in his honor. The stadium, more commonly  referred to by Wisconsinites as simply Lambeau, has become an historic  monument and icon for professional sports fans throughout the world.   In 1959, the Packers hired a new coach and general manager named  Vince Lombardi. Lombardi's success is legendary, coaching the Packers  to five National Football League championships and victories in the  first two Super Bowl games in 1966 and 1967. Considered by many to be  the greatest coach in football history, the NFL Super Bowl trophy bears  his name. Just as important as his coaching skills were the values he  instilled in the organization.   Lombardi had a zero-tolerance policy towards racism, making it known  that players and staff would be removed from the team for racist  comments. Lombardi made it known that he recruited players for their  talent not their race, famously stating he ``viewed his players as  neither black nor white, but Packer green.''   Today, head coach Mike McCarthy has guided the team through one of  the most successful stretches in Packer history. He joins Vince  Lombardi and Mike Holmgren as coaches who have led the Packers to Super  Bowl victories. The team is also fortunate to have immensely talented  Aaron Rodgers as quarterback. Rodgers, who was named NFL MVP in 2011  and 2014, has set numerous franchise records, including single season  passing yards and touchdowns.   The Green Bay Packers are the last of the small-town teams that were  common in the NFL during the league's early days of the 1920s and  1930s. Today, Green Bay is the smallest major league professional  sports market in North America by far, but it hasn't hampered the  team's success one bit. The Packers have won 13 league championships-- nine pre-Super Bowl NFL titles and four Super Bowl victories--the most  in NFL history. The Packers are also the only community-owned,  nonprofit franchise in American professional sports. The team is owned  not by a single individual but by more than 360,000 stockholders.   No tribute to the Packers would be complete without a nod to the  team's  [[Page S6275]]  hardy and loyal fans. Every Packers game since 1960 has been sold out,  and the season ticket waiting list is so long that it is estimated that  a fan who puts his or her name on the waitlist today would first be  able to purchase tickets in 2966. It is common for season tickets to be  passed down to future generations as a precious inheritance. The  willingness of Wisconsin ``cheeseheads'' to endure harsh Wisconsin  winters to watch their beloved team is also legendary. The stands were  still full on December 31, 1967, with 16 seconds left, when Green Bay  future Hall of Fame quarterback Bart Starr dove into the end zone to  beat the warm-weather Dallas Cowboys 21-17 to claim their third  consecutive NFL title. The temperature on the field at the end of the  now-famous ``Ice Bowl'' was a frigid 18 degrees below 0.   The trials and successes of the Green Bay Packers are woven into the  fabric of Wisconsin culture. Generations of hard-working Wisconsinites  have grown up cheering for the ``Green and Gold.'' I am honored to  count myself among the team's loyal fans who will celebrate their 100th  anniversary this year and who look forward to many more hard-fought  victories in the years to come. ``Go Pack Go!''                            ____________________
