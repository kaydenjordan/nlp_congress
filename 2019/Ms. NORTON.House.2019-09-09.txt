 Madam Speaker, on Thursday, September 19, the Committee  on Oversight and Reform will hold a historic hearing on D.C. statehood.  It will be the first hearing on H.R. 51 in 26 years.   This is not an informational hearing, Madam Speaker. This is a  jurisdictional hearing in every meaning of that word.   The State will still be called Washington, D.C., but D.C. will stand  for Douglass Commonwealth after the immortal Frederick Douglass, who  championed equal rights for D.C. citizens.   D.C. residents pay the highest Federal taxes per capita in the United  States. No wonder this bill has almost enough cosponsors to pass right  now. It is not too late to cosponsor. Don't let H.R. 51 go to the House  floor without you.                            ____________________
