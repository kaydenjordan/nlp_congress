 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4403) to amend the Tariff Act of 1930 to protect personally  identifiable information, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4403         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Moving Americans Privacy       Protection Act''.       SEC. 2. PROTECTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION.         (a) In General.--Section 431(c)(2) of the Tariff Act of       1930 (19 U.S.C. 1431(c)(2)) is amended to read as follows:        ``(2)(A) The information listed in paragraph (1) shall not       be available for public disclosure if--        ``(i) the Secretary of the Treasury makes an affirmative       finding on a shipment-by-shipment basis that disclosure is       likely to pose a threat of personal injury or property       damage; or        ``(ii) the information is exempt under the provisions of       section 552(b)(1) of title 5, United States Code.        ``(B) The Secretary shall ensure that any personally       identifiable information, including Social Security account       numbers and passport numbers, is removed from any manifest       signed, produced, delivered, or electronically transmitted       under this section before access to the manifest is provided       to the public.''.        (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a)       shall take effect on the date that is 30 days after the date       of the enactment of this Act.      Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 4403, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to speak today in support of H.R. 4403, the  Moving Americans Privacy Protection Act, a bipartisan, commonsense  bill, authorized by Congressman Jeff Denham and gentleman Bill  Pascrell. It was favorably reported out of the Ways and Means Committee  by a voice vote last week.   This legislation will help put an end to the inadvertent disclosure  of personally identifiable information, such as Social Security numbers  and passport numbers that are transmitted on certain shipment documents  to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection.   CBP, as it is called, is required by law to make certain shipment  data available to the public, but that information should not include  personally identifiable information which may be erroneously included  on shipment documents by carriers.   CBP maintains procedures for individuals to request confidential  treatment for their personal information, but that process is slow.  Plus, individuals probably would not seek confidential treatment if  they don't realize that their personal information was included on  shipment documents in the first place.   Even if the release of such information is unintended, Federal  agencies should not be putting Americans at risk for identity theft,  credit card fraud, and unwanted solicitations. We can, and should, do  more to protect Americans from such risks and hold Federal agencies  accountable.   This legislation would do just that by requiring CBP to ensure that  such personal information is no longer disclosed.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Denham and my good friend,  Congressman Pascrell, the ranking member on the Subcommittee on Trade,  for introducing this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this  bipartisan bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Denham), the coauthor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, while I respect my good friend's right to voice his  opinion and I respect the fact that he shared that information with us,  I am disappointed, however, that he chose this moment to make those  comments.   This is a bipartisan bill. In fact, last week, in the Ways and Means  Committee, the information and the comments shared by members on both  sides of the aisle were ideas that were shared that were bipartisan in  nature. The bill was talked about in a positive way, and it was my hope  today that we could have that same congeniality on the floor today  rather than take a left turn into the land of the President's taxes,  because today we are talking about Americans and the need to protect  their identity, and I think that is what Americans want to hear, is how  is Congress able to help them today.   So from this side of the aisle today, Mr. Speaker, we are focused on  just that. We are focused on passing H.R. 4403, the Moving Americans  Privacy Protection Act.   It is a straightforward, commonsense, and once again I will say it,  bipartisan, unusual in this day and age, but true in this case.   It puts an end to the inadvertent disclosure of personally  identifiable information contained on shipment documents to CBP and  holds the agency accountable.   The American people want to know that we are doing this kind of work.   This is a good piece of legislation that protects their  identification, and helps the CBP and Congress by giving the language  to Congress to hold the CBP accountable.   We are committed to providing legislative solutions that help protect  Americans from having their identities stolen, and this bill does just  that.   I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this bipartisan bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
