 Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Johnson for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, in the last few days, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic  jihad have fired 4,000 rockets targeting millions of Israeli civilians  across the country. Thanks to Israel's Iron Dome, many of these rockets  have been intercepted, saving thousands of lives. The Iron Dome is a  byproduct of bipartisan support from Congress that provides critical  missile defense and cooperation.   Tragically, not all of these rockets have been intercepted, resulting  in senseless deaths of many innocent civilians, women and children  among them.   These terrorist attacks against our strongest ally must stop, and  Palestinian leaders have a responsibility to do all they can to stop  it.   I commend my colleagues and our government leaders from both sides of  the aisle who have condemned this violence, telling the world and our  mutual enemies that America stands strong with Israel.   To those who blame Israel and accuse them of terrorism, I will say  what I have always told my children: Don't be the first ones who start  a fight, but you must be willing to finish it.   Israel has a right to defend their citizens and their nation's  sovereignty.  [[Page H2602]]    The Lord told Abraham: I will make of thee a great nation, and I will  bless them that bless thee, and I will curse them that curseth thee;  and in thee shall all families of the Earth be blessed.   I am proud to stand firm with Israel. Pray for the peace of  Jerusalem; may they be secure who love you.   Psalm 122.6.
