 Madam Speaker, I am glad we are finally  considering SECURE 2.0, which will help every American family save. The  Savers Credit improvements in this bill will help low-income families  start putting aside money for the future, certainly a key to getting  out of poverty.   The enhanced credit for small employers offering retirement plans  will  [[Page H3941]]  help more businesses offer plans, an important factor in recruiting and  retaining talent.   New tools--like allowing employers to match workers' student loan  repayments with retirement contributions--eliminate the need for young  workers to choose between paying their debt or saving for retirement.   Provisions like enhanced catch-up contributions and delaying required  minimum distributions until age 75 will help older workers have more  control as they near retirement. This is a strong package for savers of  all ages.   Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their  efforts to get this to the floor and I certainly urge support.
