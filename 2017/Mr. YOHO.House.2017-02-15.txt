 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.J. Res. 42, and I  thank Chairman Smith for taking the lead in fighting for American  workers with this commonsense piece of legislation.   I believe there has been a misconception about the intent of this  CRA. Congress is not acting because we have a malicious intent to  punish American workers. We are not even trying to disincentivize them  from participating in the program.   My colleague, Mr. Davis, said we should strengthen our programs, and  what we are attempting to do is exactly that: strengthen the system  that is intended to help unemployed Americans and allow them to prepare  to reenter the workforce.   The 2012 Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act made  commonsense reforms to the unemployment insurance system with the goal  of assisting Americans in returning to gainful employment. Yes, this  included allowing States, like my own of Florida, to determine whether  or not they wanted to include drug screening and test unemployment  insurance applicants. And, yes, the law specifically stated two  conditions: if the applicant had lost their job due to drug use and if  they were seeking a new job that regularly required new employees to  pass a drug test.   Now, when the Department of Labor drafted the rule, they clearly went  beyond the intent of Congress and tailored it too narrowly. This will  only hurt prospective employees in the long term.   The rule covers occupations such as those that require the employees  to carry firearms, flight crews, transportation, and the like.                                time  1400    The problem here is that employers in occupations outside of this  narrow scope also regularly require drug testing of their employees.   So under this rule, unemployed Americans who are using and looking  for employment outside of the specific occupations outlined in the rule  could potentially find employment in a different industry, be drug  tested, and subsequently terminated.   How is this helping American workers? It doesn't make sense to me,  and it shouldn't make sense to any of my colleagues either. This is a  bad rule, and it needs to be repealed so the Department of Labor can go  back to the drawing board and craft a rule that will actually  strengthen the unemployment insurance, help the American worker, and  ultimately strengthen the economy.   Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee).
