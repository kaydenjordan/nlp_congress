 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask a simple  question: Who is the National Rifle Association here to protect?   I ask this question because Philando Castile, exercising his  constitutionally protected right to bear arms, was shot dead in front  of his girlfriend and his young daughter.   At that time the NRA claimed that they were awaiting ``more facts.''  A year later, the investigation is over and the trial is complete. The  facts are clear. Philando's killer remains free, but, Mr. Speaker, I  and many Americans across this Nation remain confused and dissatisfied.   Mr. Speaker, dashcam video released yesterday confirmed that Second  Amendment protections simply do not apply to Black, law-abiding,  concealed carry permit-holding, compliant Philando Castile. And still  the NRA has had nothing to say.   Mr. Speaker, I ask again: If the NRA isn't here to protect law- abiding gun owners like Philando Castile, then just who are they here  to protect?                            ____________________
