 Mr. Speaker, President Trump campaigned to drain the  swamp, but his administration has only accelerated the revolving door  between the executive branch and industry lobbyists.   Last week, I introduced a bill to restore the rules surrounding  executive appointee lobbying to the higher standards of the previous  administration.   The Ethics in Public Service Act would make commonsense changes to  make government more transparent and accountable. For example, it would  close loopholes in the Trump administration's ethics pledge allowing  former appointees to communicate with the agency where they worked and  permitting former lobbyists to join an executive agency that they  lobbied within the previous 2 years.   Government officials should not be shamelessly trading on their  service for personal gain or to help out the special interests that  previously employed them.   Our democracy will function more effectively, and the American people  will be better served, by a stronger separation between public service  and corporate lobbying. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of  this legislation to clean up the system in Washington.                            ____________________
