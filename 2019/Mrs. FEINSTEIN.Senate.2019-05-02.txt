 Mr. President, I rise today in support of overriding  President Trump's veto of the Sanders-Murphy resolution.   The resolution would end U.S. involvement in the war in Yemen, which  I believe is long overdue.   Saudi Arabia's conduct in the war in Yemen has been deplorable.   It has purposefully attacked civilian infrastructure, including  electricity generation facilities, water sanitation plants and, medical  facilities. They have employed cluster munitions in civilian areas and  used disproportionate force to attack military targets. In one attack,  the coalition killed more than 40 children on a school bus, claiming to  this day that the bus was a legitimate military target.   While I am pleased that the United States is no longer refueling  coalition aircraft, I support ending all U.S. assistance for the Saudi- led coalition before thousands more die. To date, more than 63,000  people have been killed as a direct result of the conflict. If the  conflict continues, an estimated 22,000 more people will be killed this  year. That is only direct combat deaths, which is highly misleading.  The ongoing war, with U.S. support, has indirectly killed far more,  with Yemen's children bearing the brunt of the suffering. Since 2014,  more than 85,000 children have died of starvation. That is worth  repeating: More than 85,000 children have starved to death in the last  4 years in Yemen.   By the end of 2019, the total number of people in Yemen who will die  from a lack of food, health services, and infrastructure is expected to  top 131,000. Sixty percent of those killed will be children under the  age of 5. In fact, a child in Yemen will die every 12 minutes unless we  end this war.   The Saudi coalition's purposeful destruction of Yemen's civilian  infrastructure, targeting of medical facilities and withholding of aid  has led to the world's worst humanitarian crisis: 14 million people  require emergency food aid. A majority of Yemen's population does not  have access to clean water, sanitation, or adequate public healthcare.  Cholera and other diseases are rampant throughout Yemen as public  services have collapsed. There have been 1.2 million suspected cases of  cholera, resulting in 2,500 fatalities from this entirely preventable  disease. Nearly three-quarters of the population--almost 22 million  people--need some form of humanitarian assistance.   Sadly, the actions of the Trump administration have worsened the  humanitarian harm. Through the President's ``Muslim ban,'' the  administration has effectively trapped civilians in Yemen, sealing  their fate.   The Trump administration has not accepted a single refugee from Yemen  since October 2017. It has banned permanent immigration from Yemen,  including immediate family members of U.S. citizens, and it has stopped  issuing temporary visas. The Trump administration has even refused to  redesignate Temporary Protected Status for Yemen, making more than a  thousand protected Yemenis subject to deportation.   The United States can help end the suffering in Yemen by halting all  assistance to the Saudi-led coalition. It could also accept Yemeni  refugees, resume normal immigration and extend TPS to Yemenis currently  in the United States. The Trump administration has callously decided to  do nothing.   The Sanders-Murphy resolution would direct the President to end all  U.S. support for the war in Yemen. Given the horrific consequences of  the conflict, I strongly supported the resolution when it passed the  Senate on March 13, 2019.   I am disappointed but not surprised by the President's veto of it.  The President's apparent plan is to continue to support the Saudi  coalition even though it is clear that there is no military solution to  this conflict. That is unacceptable.   Unfortunately, the President's unconditional support for Saudi Arabia  is not limited to its conduct in Yemen. Under the direction of Crown  Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia murdered, dismembered, and  disposed of the remains of a U.S. resident, Jamal Khashoggi. To this  day, the Saudi Government continues to blame ``rogue agents'' for this  heinous murder. They are holding a secret trial for the so-called  accused, refusing to cooperate with international investigations, and  continuing to rely on the Trump administration to shield it from  accountability.   Any nation that would murder a journalist inside its own diplomatic  facility is no friend of the United States. Any leader who would direct  another human being to be dismembered with a bone saw is not fit to  lead.   Let's be clear: Mohammed bin Salman is responsible for Khashoggi's  murder. He is not fit to lead the kingdom and must be held accountable  for this crime.   Saudi Arabia has also arrested, tortured and prosecuted peaceful  political activists, including women. It has kidnapped and forcefully  repatriated  [[Page S2592]]  Saudi nationals, executed religious minorities, and even illegally  detained U.S. citizens.   The vote before us today would send a clear message to Saudi Arabia  that we do not support its heinous policy and actions.   I urge my colleagues to join me in sending that message.    Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the ``West  Coast Ocean Protection Act.''   This bill would amend the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to  permanently block new leases for offshore oil or gas in federal waters  off the coast of California, Oregon or Washington.   I'm pleased to be joined today by Senators Harris, Wyden, Merkley,  Cantwell, Murray, Menendez, Booker, Sanders, Whitehouse, Markey,  Gillibrand, Peters in sponsoring this bill, which has been introduced  in every Congress since the Deepwater Horizon disaster in April 2010.   11 people were killed and 17 others injured when the Deepwater  Horizon well blew out. Oil and gas spewed into the Gulf of Mexico for  87 days.   Oil slicks covered the Gulf. Tar balls and toxic sludge covered  beaches and wetlands. More than one-third of Federal waters in the Gulf  were closed to fishing.   The impacts of the Deepwater Horizon disaster continue to affect  birds and marine life, and marine biologists are still learning about  the long-term effects, demonstrating the risks of offshore oil and gas  extraction. Californians know all too well the dangers posed by  offshore drilling. Before Deepwater Horizon and Exxon Valdez, there was  the 1969 oil spill in Santa Barbara.   A well blowout on an offshore rig spilled more than 3 million gallons  of crude oil according to some estimates--the worst spill in U.S.  history at the time.   The spill closed local beaches--which were covered by a thick layer  of oil--and thousands of marine mammals and birds were killed. Tourists  were turned away and commercial fishing operations were halted, hurting  the local economy.   After the Santa Barbara spill, California had enough. The State  blocked all new offshore drilling in state waters--which extend three  miles from the shore--and in 1994 enacted a permanent offshore drilling  ban.   Through local ordinances, congressional opposition, and presidential  moratoria, all new drilling in federal waters off California has been  blocked since 1984. Today, opposition to offshore drilling is higher  than ever. Recent polling has found that nearly 70 percent of  Californians oppose new drilling off our coast.   Yet, on January 8, 2018, the Trump administration proposed to allow  drilling in nearly all Federal waters, including in all three regions  off the California coast. The leases are proposed to begin in 2020 and  would lead to the first new drilling operations in these areas in more  than 35 years. Sixty-eight cities and counties representing a majority  of California's population have voiced their strong opposition to  President Trump's misguided plan.   In an addition, California's Governor, Senate, Assembly, Attorney  General, Coastal Commission, Fish and Game Commission, and State Lands  Commission have shared their opposition to the administration's  drilling plan. Fortunately, the Administration has already suggested  that its plans for offshore drilling have been delayed as they  determine how to respond to legal setbacks. The plans are flawed, and  should be withdrawn altogether.   Those of us on the Pacific Coast do not want any further offshore oil  and gas development.   It is long past time to respect the substantial local opposition by  passing the ``West Coast Ocean Protection Act'' to permanently ban  offshore drilling and protect our coast for generations to come. I  yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the ``West  Coast Ocean Protection Act.''
