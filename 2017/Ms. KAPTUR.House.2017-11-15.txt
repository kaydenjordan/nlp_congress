 Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from  Massachusetts, Ranking Member Richard Neal, for his exceptional  leadership in trying to fix this horrendous bill.   Madam Speaker, the GOP-led tax and deficit disaster rewards the big  corporations and billionaires. It will accelerate job outsourcing.  Indeed, 50 percent of the tax benefits go to the top 1 percent.   This tax scam locks in--get this--a $621,500 tax bonus to each  billionaire in the billionaire class, the top one-tenth of 1 percent.  Do you really think they need it?   Meanwhile, this tax scam raids money from the pockets of 38 million  middle class taxpayers, likely those caring for their sick relatives or  trying to help their kids in college. Do you  [[Page H9353]]  really think the one-tenth of 1 percent need more?   Money-trading Wall Street megabanks like Goldman Sachs and J.P.  Morgan, already making billions, will get more tax bonuses courtesy of  the middle class.    This job outsourcing tax bill of the rich, by the rich,  and for the rich, well, if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck,  it must be a duck, and this duck belongs in a swamp, which voters may  have thought they were draining in the last election.   Well, folks, this bill makes the swamp wider and deeper, and the fat  ducks will be even fatter and happier in it.   I urge my colleagues to vote for the middle class, not the  billionaire donor class. Vote ``no.'' Drain the swamp.
