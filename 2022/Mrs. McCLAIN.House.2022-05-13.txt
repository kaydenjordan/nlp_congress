 Madam Speaker, I would agree with my colleague across  the aisle, this bill should be about lifting families out of poverty  and providing hope to underserved communities. Let's do that, and let's  actually for once in agreement, let's put our money where our mouth is  and let's actually make sure that the dollars are actually used for  what the bill intends them to be used for.   We should not be blurring lines between workforce issues and  political campaigns. This isn't a political campaign, correct?  Facilities used for community service block grants should not be open  to political activities during operation hours. Sadly, this is exactly  what my colleagues on the other side want, and they are notorious for  talking about a bill and then packing it full of something that has  nothing to do with the bill. So let's do what we say we are going to do  and actually help the communities.  [[Page H4950]]                                     time  1030    Where does this end? This is the foot in the door to allow real  partisan action to be commingled with Federal programs. We have a clear  example of this that is happening today.   Need I remind everyone about ACORN? That should be example enough to  illustrate why this is a terrible idea but, apparently, not for my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle.   My amendment is simple. It would remove the troubling language in  this bill that allows taxpayer-funded community action centers to be  used to increase voting registration.   Let's keep the bill to what you say it is going to be. It would also  prohibit community service block grant funds from any lobbying  activities. Again, let's actually use the funds for the people in the  community, not the politics.   We all want eligible Americans to register to vote and actually get  to the polls on election day. But that is not the purpose of the  community block grants. This bill should not blur the lines between  educational and political activities.
