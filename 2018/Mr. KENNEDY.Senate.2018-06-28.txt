 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 3383 to the  language proposed to be stricken by amendment No. 3224.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading  of the amendment be dispensed with and for the opportunity to make a  few remarks about my amendment.    Thank you.   Mr. President, I am joined in this amendment with Senators Cruz and  Lee. I thank Senator Roberts and Senator Stabenow for their work on  this bill.   The farm bill is a must-pass bill. It is important. I realize that.  America was born on the farm. Seventy percent of the cost of this bill  has to do with food stamps, and I am pleased to have the opportunity  for us to discuss a way to improve our food stamp program.   As I said yesterday, I don't want to take away food stamps from  people in need. I do want fewer people to need food stamps. In our  country, I am very proud of the fact that if you are hungry, we feed  you. If you are homeless, we house you. If you are too poor to be sick,  we pay for your doctor. But the best way to continue the food stamp  program and our other social programs is to make sure that they are  efficient and that we save as much money as we can from those who would  abuse the program in order to really help those in need.   This amendment will make responsible changes to the SNAP program by  updating photo identification requirements related to electronic  benefits transfer systems in the Food and Nutrition Act, and it will  also take the very important step of having work requirements for able- bodied adult individuals without dependents. We are not talking about  someone with kids or taking Grandpa out of the nursing home. And it  would require State agencies to operate work activation programs for  eligible SNAP participants.
