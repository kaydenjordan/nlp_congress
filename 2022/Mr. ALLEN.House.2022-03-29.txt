 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2954, which includes  the text of the Education and Labor Committee's bipartisan Retirement  Improvement and Savings Enhancement Act, the RISE Act, H.R. 5891, a  bill that I was proud to cosponsor with the distinguished chairman of  the Education and Labor Committee and Ranking Member Foxx.   This bipartisan legislation is a much-needed push toward  modernization that our country's retirement system needs. Our economy  has evolved and so have the ways Americans plan for retirement.   Neither employers nor employee benefit plans fit into the same  cookie-cutter policies they did when the Employee Retirement Income  Security Act of 1974 was first enacted. The RISE Act and H.R. 2954  include reforms that will benefit America's workforce and job creators.   Worker access to employer-sponsored retirement plans has improved  over the last three decades, and participation has grown. Today, more  workers are saving and saving more in employer-sponsored plans.   However, there remains room for improvement, as too many Americans  still lack access to these benefits. This legislation is a major step  toward providing reasonable solutions to solve the problems hindering  Americans from being able to save for a secure future.   Building on the SECURE Act of 2019, the RISE Act and H.R. 2954 expand  multiple and pooled employer plans, giving charities, educational  institutions, and nonprofit organizations the opportunity to offer  affordable retirement plans. Expanding pooled employer plans give small  businesses access to more affordable plans by allowing them to band  together, decreasing the costs and burdens associated with sponsoring a  plan and providing more Americans with an opportunity to save.    Allowing small businesses and nonprofits the opportunity to offer  competitive retirement plans so they can attract workers is extremely  important, as the labor shortage has hit them the hardest.   Additionally, the RISE Act and H.R. 2954 will allow employers to  offer small financial incentives to employees for participating in a  retirement plan. This will help encourage employees to start preparing  for retirement earlier in their careers, which is vital for employee  contributions to earn years of compounding benefits for their  retirement accounts.   Finally, this bill expands access to retirement savings for part-time  workers who otherwise would be limited from participating in the  employer plan. Removing barriers to saving ensures more Americans have  a secure and self-sufficient retirement. Red tape and unnecessary  barriers must not keep employees from building a strong retirement.   The RISE Act and H.R. 2954 also ease the burden of administering  retirement accounts by removing unnecessary disclosure requirements.  The legislation directs the Department of Labor, Department of the  Treasury, and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to simplify  reporting and disclosure regulations, streamline the collection of  contributions to pooled employer plans, and update benchmarking  guidelines to accommodate a broader selection of plan investments.   Importantly, retirement professionals themselves are in support of  the RISE Act. Organizations like the American Benefits Council, the  Insured Retirement Institute, the American Retirement Association, and  the SPARK Institute are supportive of this legislation.   Workers and plan sponsors alike can see that the RISE Act will make  commonsense reforms and improve the lives and futures of the American  worker. The RISE Act offers creative and practical solutions to the  problems in our retirement system.   As legislators, we must take action to tackle issues that affect the  daily lives of our constituents. As a businessman, I know firsthand the  issues that are affecting American workers that can be improved upon.   This legislation will improve the retirement security for millions of  Americans. I urge my colleagues to join in support, and I look forward  to its passage in the House and for these reforms to be ultimately  signed into law.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Walberg), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Keller), another good friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  North Carolina (Ms. Foxx), our great Republican leader.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, the goal of every American is to retire with security  and dignity. The RISE Act and H.R. 2954 will help workers do just that.  This bill will expand the availability of private retirement programs  to more Americans.   Neither small businesses, nor non-profits and educational  institutions should be prohibited from accessing the benefits offered  to larger retirement plans.   Building on the success of the SECURE Act of 2019, this legislation  cuts red tape, streamlines reporting and disclosure requirements, and  provides American workers retirement.    I thank the chairman and our Republican leader for their commitment  to bipartisanship and for defending the committee's important  jurisdiction over retirement issues in this bill.   I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 2954, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, I rise to highlight a bill I recently  introduced with my good friend, Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina.   The Employee Rights Act of 2022 updates our labor policies to protect  and empower the modern worker.   Democrats continue to push their out-of-touch, Big Labor wish list in  the PRO Act, which tilts the scale toward nonelected union leaders,  tramples employee rights, and preempts State right-to-work laws.  Meanwhile, Republicans are focused on the worker of today and the  future.   The Employee Rights Act guarantees that employees will have secret  ballot union elections, ensures control over the disclosure of their  personal information, keeps members' dues from being used for political  purposes without their permission, and gives employees more flexibility  to withdraw from a union if a majority of the employees agree.   This bill also codifies the common law definition of ``employee'' to  protect gig economy workers and other independent contractors and once  and for all clarifies the definition of ``joint employer'' so that  franchisees, entrepreneurs, and anyone seeking flexible work options  are not hamstrung into not running their own business.   As a businessman, I have experienced firsthand the consequences of  Big Government overregulation, and I am thankful for the support of  dozens of proworker and probusiness groups that support the Employee  Rights Act of 2022.                            ____________________
