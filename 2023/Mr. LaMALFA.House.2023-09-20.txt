 Mr. Speaker, the Holman rule is a rule in the House of  Representatives that allows amendments to appropriations bills that  reduce the salary of Federal employees. It is a great mechanism for  punishing Federal employees and public servants who fail the American  people.   I can think of no greater failure than this administration allowing  millions of illegal immigrants to pour over our southern and even  northern borders. This mass illegal immigration, sometimes aided and  abetted by the Biden administration, is an insult and a farce. From the  language some of its proponents use, it seems as though it is being  done out of pure spite.   It is supposed to be the job of the Department of Homeland Security  to prevent illegal immigration in this country and deport those who  violate this Nation's sovereignty. Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has  utterly failed his duty and stubbornly insists to Congress and Senate  Republicans he has done nothing wrong.   I disagree. Secretary Mayorkas has done much wrong. What is worse is  that, in fact, he could argue the border situation would be better if  he had simply done nothing. When you see welded-open gates, when you  see even the city of New York saying, Please make it stop, and they  start shoving people into the border States, you know you have got a  giant problem.   Maybe Secretary Mayorkas' salary would be better off under the Holman  rule adjusted down to $1 per year because that is even too much.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Louisiana (Mr.  Johnson), for yielding.   So here we are, after nearly 9 months of investigations into the  Biden family's influence-peddling schemes, this body has uncovered  mounting credible evidence of corruption, evidence that  [[Page H4432]]  has come to light through numerous committee meetings, whistleblower  testimony and interviews, document discovery, and rigorous  Congressional oversight.   Despite the false claims of leftwing media outlets such as CNN and  MSNBC, there is, in fact, evidence of peddling and corruption. Under  the IRS whistleblower testimony, two IRS agents testified under oath  that Joe Biden was present at at least one meeting with Hunter Biden's  foreign clients.   Agent Joseph Zeigler, formerly known as ``Whistleblower X,''  testified that he was handcuffed and hamstrung throughout the IRS's 5- year investigation of Hunter Biden and was ultimately stopped from  moving forward in the manner that he believed to be appropriate for the  offenses committed.   Over $17 million were sent to Hunter Biden from companies operating  in authoritarian, oppressive nations.   The Internal Revenue Service whistleblowers also alleged that the DOJ  would not let them pursue Joe Biden or any connections that would lead  to him. They allege a campaign of delay, divulge, deny surrounded their  requests to pursue leads that led to Joe Biden.   This allegation has been confirmed by a former FBI SSA. The Special  Counsel was appointed to obstruct Congressional investigations and  inquiries behind the curtain of an ongoing investigation.   The testimony of these IRS whistleblowers have been corroborated by  the testimony of the FBI SSA and two additional colleagues that claimed  that they were fired from the investigation by order of Attorney Weiss.   Devon Archer's testimony to the Oversight Committee is that Joe Biden  is a brand. Archer alleges members of the Biden family used Joe Biden's  position as Vice President to sell power and access to interested  parties. VP Biden would protect oligarchs from competent legal probes  and investigations into foreign countries, such as Ukraine.   Hunter or another family member would be paid money, and then Joe  would meet with the interested party in Washington, D.C.   A quick summary: An oligarch pays money to Hunter Biden's company or  associate, which then is paid to Hunter, and a portion of that goes to  the big guy, his father.   The Shokin investigation: In 2015, Hunter was pressured by Burisma to  call D.C. to get help in removing a Ukrainian prosecutor, Viktor  Shokin.   Shokin was indeed later fired, and video evidence has surfaced of Joe  Biden bragging about getting him fired in order for foreign aid dollars  to flow to the Government of Ukraine, right on tape.   Joe Biden's family received $17 million from contacts from foreign  nations, according to IRS documents.   What was being done in exchange for this money? The National Archives  have confirmed that Joe Biden used pseudonyms when communicating with  Hunter and his business associates from official government emails,  including the Office of the Vice President.   So you have DOJ misconduct, confirmed by the FBI SSA and leadership,  that DOJ--specifically, Merrick Garland--prevented investigators from  doing their jobs as best as he could.   The FBI D.C. office tipped off the Secret Service of an interview  with Hunter Biden that was being planned. The FBI headquarters also  tipped them off of a planned search of Hunter's residence which gave  time and forewarning for any incriminating evidence to be removed.   No ordinary American would ever expect to receive such preferential  treatment if they were accused of the crimes that Hunter and Joe have  been. What they can normally expect is a 4 a.m. knock on the door with  a battering ram for even lesser crimes.    Investigators are not allowed to ask about the big guy. The bank  records show over 170 Suspicious Activity Reports filed by banks on the  Biden family financial transactions. This means banks believe that over  170 separate financial transactions in Biden's family bank accounts  were linked to bribery, money laundering, or other serious financial  crimes.   An FBI informant documented conversations that indicated to them that  Joe pressured foreign companies to send millions to the family  business. The claims from Democrats and their media allies that the  impeachment inquiry was opened without evidence are not only false but  also illogical.   Inquiries exist for the purpose of uncovering evidence. An  impeachment inquiry is an investigation into whether an impeachable  offense has been committed. It is not the whole scope of impeachment.  It gives the ability to do further investigation.   Where there is smoke, you will probably find fire.   There is evidence from whistleblowers and former associates that Joe  Biden was intimately involved in Hunter's corrupt business dealings.   This is an impeachable offense. The allegations that since this  conduct allegedly only happened when Joe was VP and not while President  thus means that an impeachment is not possible, that is false.   Impeachable conduct includes high crimes, bribery, or other  misdemeanors that occurred while the accused was in a previous Federal  office.   Joe Biden has lied about his connection to his son's corrupt business  dealings for years.   Now, we are not supposed to take impeachment lightly around here.  Indeed, it has been abused the last few years a couple of times, but  House Republicans are going to go through a process, due process, and  find real evidence.   The conclusion is that despite the disparate claims of the partisan  media and their Democrat allies, there is indeed mounting evidence that  President Joe Biden was involved in his family's influence-selling  scheme and intimately involved in Hunter Biden's corruption.   An impeachment inquiry will help House Republicans get to the bottom  of this, and I hope Democrats will be interested as well, and then  determine whether or not there is proof of these crimes. If there  indeed is, then President Biden has committed impeachable offenses.   Again, impeachment is not to be taken lightly, not to be just thrown  around for political purpose but utilized. This impeachment inquiry is  a very important ability for Congress to answer the questions that  many, many American people are asking about the obvious corruption that  is coming forward, thanks to whistleblowers, and others, that are  bringing this evidence to the front.   With that, let's proceed, and let's do this properly.
