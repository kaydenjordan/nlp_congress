 Mr. President, I ask my fellow colleagues to join  me in celebrating Ms. Holly Gatling's dedicated service as the  executive director of South Carolina Citizens for Life.   Holly earned a bachelor's degree in journalism from the University of  South Carolina in 1972. While at the University of South Carolina, she  served as a copy editor for ``The State'' newspaper. She went on to  work for several newspapers across South Carolina, including as a  feature writer from 1976 to 1990 for ``The State.''   As a stalwart champion for the unborn, Holly has effectively lobbied  the South Carolina General Assembly in support of pro-life laws. Some  of these laws included Woman's Right to Know, Partial Birth Abortion  Ban, and Safe Haven for Abandoned Newborns. She was also instrumental  in ushering Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection to Governor Nikki  Haley's desk for signature in 2016.   I am proud to have worked closely with her on many pro-life issues,  including the Pain Capable legislation in the U.S. Senate. I know that  one day we too will pass this important legislation into law.   I am extremely proud of her work for the unborn and know she has made  a difference in the lives of thousands of South Carolinians. She is a  model for public servants, and I am honored to congratulate my friend  Holly Gatling on her 25 years of service to others in South Carolina,  across the United States of America, and around the world.
