 Mr. Speaker, I would like to talk about how  children feel about masks.   You see, while they are watching television, seeing Super Bowl games  where adults are filling stadiums without masks and enjoying  themselves, and while they see concerts happen, they see people go to  work, they see adults going many places all over this country without  masks, they are forced to wear a mask every single day at school, and  it is wrong. Actually, it is child abuse.   Now, I know that sounds like strong words, but it really is because  children are not at risk of COVID-19. As a matter of fact, children are  at the lowest risk.   Do you know what is harmful to children? Having their faces covered  all day long at school, not being able to see each other's faces; not  being able to see their teachers' faces; and not being able to learn  properly speech, emotions, having that connection, seeing each other's  faces, and learning from adults seeing each other's faces.   Now, while Democrats are going on with the mask for thee and not for  me, kids have had enough. And they are going to be future voters. They  are sick and tired of being forced to wear a mask. It needs to end.  Masking children is child abuse.                            ____________________
