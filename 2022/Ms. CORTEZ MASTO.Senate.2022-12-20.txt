 Madam President, I know Arizonans feel the same  way. As I have talked with you, I have talked to some of my colleagues.  Nevadans are frustrated. Time and again, over the last two decades,  they have seen Congress work toward much needed legislation on  immigration only for reasonable bipartisan agreements to fall apart  because someone is playing politics.   We saw this happen in the Senate just last week, when, with some of  my colleagues--the Presiding Officer, because of you, and Senator  Tillis--we saw a framework of a bipartisan bill to give Dreamers a  pathway to citizenship that also provided additional resources to  increase our border security. There was a balance there to address what  we are hearing. I heard from my colleagues today, and we are seeing on  the news what is happening on the southern border right now. But just  as we seemed to be closing in on a deal, it unfortunately fell through  once more.    Now, I know the hope is that we will continue to work on this in the  new Congress, and I hope we do. I hope we are able to bring more of our  colleagues together because, if we don't, the alternative is just  unacceptable.   There is broad bipartisan consensus in my State and, I know, across  this country, and I have heard it from some of my colleagues, that  Congress must create a path to citizenship for Dreamers across the  country.   Now, we are just talking about Dreamers. I heard Senator Blunt  earlier say that the solution for Dreamers exists and that should be  the easy thing to pass.   Why? You know, it has really been over two decades since legislation  was first introduced to protect people who were brought to this country  as children and who love the only home they have ever known. That is  our Dreamers.   It has been over a decade since the creation of the DACA Program,  which protects some, but not all, of our Dreamers. What is more, the  program continues to face legal challenges. That has left not just  Nevadan Dreamers but so many Dreamers across this country in a  terrifying limbo. Without legal protections, Dreamers can't reach their  full potential, even though many of them have had incredible successes,  thanks, in part, to DACA.   There are 12,000 DACA recipients in Nevada alone and many thousands  more Dreamers that we know in Nevada and across this country. And I  have heard my colleagues say it. They are teachers. They are business  owners. They are healthcare professionals. They are servicemembers.  They go to work and school every day. They pay taxes. They care for  their families, and they contribute to our communities.   All over this country, Dreamers enrich our Nation. Not only do they  want a path to citizenship; they deserve it. They were on the  frontlines during our pandemic. They were the essential workers.   You know, I heard my colleagues talk about Dreamers--and I know the  Presiding Officer knows this--but I think oftentimes we need to bring  to Washington the faces of the very people we are talking about because  sometimes it gets lost. We talk about numbers. We have graphs that say  we should do this, that we should do that. But we don't actually have  the very people whom we are talking about in front of us right now so  that we could show our colleagues who may not be familiar with a  Dreamer what we are talking about.   So this is a stack of letters that I received from Dreamers in Nevada  and from across the country. I want to bring attention to some of these  Dreamers whom I know who have sent me letters, because this is truly  why we should be working on, at the very least, legislation that  focuses on moving the ball forward when it comes to our Dreamers.   This is from a Dreamer in Nevada. His name is Ricardo. He says:         I am an undocumented student at the College of Southern       Nevada. I will be graduating in the spring of 2023 with a 4.0       GPA and I am going to be majoring in real estate. Prior to       studying at the College of Southern Nevada, I graduated from       the Northwest Career and Technical Academy with a high honor       diploma and a GPA of 3.65. This track record in school has       allowed me to be eligible for many opportunities that       unfortunately I haven't been able to take advantage of due to       my status.        Even though I have done many things to be a stellar student       and get opportunities, I have only been able to go so far       with my academics because of my status. Many times throughout       my life, both in school and outside, I have been told that I       can do anything I wanted in life as long as I worked hard for       it. So far, I have worked twice as hard to get half as much       success as many of my friends.    I will tell you, that it is true for all of the Dreamers that I talk  to. They work hard. They love this country. It is the only country they  know. They do everything they can to excel, whether it is in school or  at work. They want to be a part of our workforce. They are committed to  doing so. And that is  [[Page S7812]]  why, as Senator Blunt said, this should be an easy solution.   I will tell you, by the way, these are not just Dreamers in Nevada  whom I talk about all the time--and I am proud to. I got letters from  Dreamers in Kentucky. I got letters from Dreamers in Texas. They are  all over this country, and they are similar. They are similar to the  ones that I just talked about.   So, yes, I think Dreamers deserve a pathway to citizenship, but not  sometime in the future, not in some future Congress, but now. People on  both sides of the aisle know this. That is why we have been close to  compromise so frequently and so frustratingly. But I know it is  possible to come together on a compromise that supports Dreamers and,  yes, increases border security. We can do both. They are not mutually  exclusive. We can work to secure our borders and still work to pass  legislation to put Dreamers on a pathway. We can do both. It is common  sense.   We need these reforms. We need to focus on moving forward and not  just pointing fingers at the problem.   We just heard Senator Leahy earlier today give his farewell speech.  In it he talked about the importance of us not only working together to  come to compromise, but he talked about that we have to stop finger- pointing. We have got to stop finger-pointing to the problem for  political advantage and start pointing the way to a solution. That is  what this needs now. This is the moment for all of us to come together  to really find a solution here at the end of the day, to get in a room  and have commonsense legislation that moves this issue forward, because  the truth is that there is no need for us to face one crisis after  another on our southern border.    Congress's role--and, believe me, this is Congress's role--is to  solve this problem by working together, but partisan finger-pointing  and blame games keep it from getting it done.   I know. I just came off of an election cycle. I know. I can tell you  that my opponent, instead of coming up with a solution, all he wanted  to do was point to the border. But, I will tell you, I wasn't sent to  Congress--I wasn't sent here--to just point blame, identify the  problem, and do nothing about it. We are sent here to solve problems.   These aren't easy issues. That is why it requires us to work  together.   I have to thank the Presiding Officer because of your willingness to  reach across the aisle, and you recognize the importance of working  together to solve problems. That is why I have hope that we can still  get this done.   Hearing from some of my colleagues today, I agree with them. There is  a problem at the border. We have got to fix it. I know it. I was  attorney general for 8 years in my State. Do you know one of the issues  I worked on even though I wasn't in a border state? The border and the  southern border, because we had drug trafficking issues. We had human  trafficking issues, money laundering, and weapons trafficking that bled  into my State because of what was happening at the border.   So my focus has always been: Yes, putting those resources at the  border to address those issues, including the fentanyl that is coming  across the border now. And we can do that and still address an issue  for so many Dreamers who are already here, living in our communities,  who want to be an essential part of our workforce.   Why is that important? Because right now we have seen such an  incredible change in America and across the world since the outbreak of  the COVID-19 pandemic. During that time, workers retired, immigration  slowed, and labor markets tightened as a result. This country needs  workers in industries from the tech sector to agriculture, to home  healthcare and childcare, and we need them badly.   And here is what I know, and we all know this: that, according to the  Department of Labor, the United States has a labor shortfall of roughly  3.5 million people.   This is our workforce. If we were to pass this pathway for  citizenship for so many, this is a part of our essential workforce.  They are already here.   We are feeling this workforce shortfall in Nevada, and I hear it  across the country from my colleagues when we talk. Every week I hear  from business owners in Nevada who tell me about their struggle to find  employees. Comprehensive immigration reforms would let us welcome  workers in a way that benefits our society and our economy and treats  those who want to come to America with dignity.   Yet we are not enacting them. The last time Congress passed  comprehensive immigration reform was when Ronald Reagan was President.   Madam President, Nevada sent me back to the Senate because they  believe. They believe not only that I can reach across the aisle to  make change but that I will do it. They have seen me do it before. They  know I will work with anyone who is willing to come to the table. But  we need serious action, and I hope my colleagues, whether they are in  my party or nonpartisan or they are Republicans, are willing to come to  the table to find a solution.   We need that willingness to work together and to act on issues like  Dreamers, like border security. I know my colleague from Texas who is  here is going to talk about that. I agree with him. But we can do both.  We can do both and do right by so many and move this country forward.   As long as I am in the Senate, I am going to be a voice for Dreamers  because they are a part of the fabric of this country. I will work with  anyone to fix our broken immigration system and ensure we keep our  borders secure.   I yield the floor.
