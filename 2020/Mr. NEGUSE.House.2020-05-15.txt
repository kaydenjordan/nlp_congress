 Mr. Speaker, from Eagle County to Gilpin County and every  community in between, our communities are looking to us to help them  weather this crisis.   These aren't red counties; they are not blue counties. They are  American counties.   This bill is about helping all of America, and in particular, the  American heroes who are standing up for us every day, the firefighters,  the nurses, the first responders, the teachers, and so many more.   They continue to stand up for us. Let's stand up for them.   Please, let's pass this bill.
