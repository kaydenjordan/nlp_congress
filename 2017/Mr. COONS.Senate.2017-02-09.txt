 Mr. President, I rise to agree, briefly, with the remarks  of my friend, the senior Senator from Illinois, and to comment that the  nomination of Congressman Tom Price of Georgia to be Secretary of  Health and Human Services is concerning, even alarming, to all of us  who have reviewed his record--his record, his public statements, his  work--that threatens to privatize Social Security, that threatens to  restructure and fundamentally change the promise of Medicare, and that  offers the promise of repealing the Affordable Care Act without any  plan to replace.   I could not agree more with the words of the Senator from Illinois  that we should all be cautious about being promised access without any  pathway toward the ability to actually afford quality health care.   Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my postcloture debate time to  Senator Wyden.
