 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend, Mr. Rogers, for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, my amendment No. 84 would require a report on the  feasibility of establishing a Customs and Border Protection  preclearance facility in Taiwan.   Last year, Taipei International Airport applied to offer customs  preclearance with strong support and calls for approval of their  application on both sides of the Pacific.   Taiwan would be the first country in East Asia to offer preclearance,  an excellent choice given our close economic ties with the island, our  shared values, and our ever-more critical security partnership.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to  enhance travel between the United States and Taiwan.   Secondarily, I rise in support of my amendment which would require  the Secretary to conduct an anonymous survey to determine the effects  of the COVID-19 vaccine mandate on both reenlistment and recruitment to  the Armed Forces.   I am not anti-vaccine, but I am 100 percent anti-mandate. Individuals  should be able to choose what is best for them and their families in  consultation with their doctors. They should not be forced to take a  vaccine by government at any level.   I believe my colleagues who are pro-vaccine mandates should support  this amendment to determine what effects the mandate at DOD will have  on both reenlistment and recruitment. We need to know what, if any,  effect this policy will have on our national security and our  readiness.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
