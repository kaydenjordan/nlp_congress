 Mr. President, today I wish to honor Lois Bouton,  a WWII veteran who honorably served her country and has inspired  generations of members of the U.S. Coast Guard with her letters. I am  pleased to recognize this remarkable Arkansan as she celebrates her  100th birthday.   Lois has spent her life serving among and connecting with members of  the Coast Guard--first, as a member of the SPARs, the Woman's Reserve  of the U.S. Coast Guard, and then as a visitor to patients--especially  members of the Coast Guard at Naval Station Great Lakes Hospital--and  now through the letters she diligently writes to USCG members across  the country which earned her the nickname the Coast Guard Lady.   ``I like to write letters,'' Lois said during an interview my staff  conducted with her for the Veterans History Project. In the decades  since she started outreach to coasties through the mail, she has  written nearly 50,000 letters.   In the early 1970s, the Boutons retired to northwest Arkansas. That  is when her outreach to coasties began to take off. She started writing  to Coast Guard units in Alaska, and soon, she had the directory with  addresses of units across the country.   While far from the coast, her Rogers, AR, home is a museum of Coast  Guard memorabilia. Her collection includes the Meritorious Public  Service Award she received from the Commandant of the Coast Guard, the  second highest civilian award issued by the Coast Guard. In 2013, she  was named an honorary chief petty officer.   Her love and appreciation for the Coast Guard is unmatched as  demonstrated by her decades-long practice of correspondence to show her  support for the men and women who wear the Coast Guard uniform. She is  well-known among members of the Coast Guard and receives hundreds of  letters and cards from them in return. She continues to serve as an  inspiration for others and is widely admired for her service to our  country, the men and women of the Coast Guard, and veterans across the  Nation.   I want to thank the Coast Guard Lady, Lois Bouton, for her service  and continued support of the U.S. Coast Guard and wish her a very happy  100th birthday.                            ____________________
