 Madam Speaker, this week, during National Police Week,  House Republicans are again exploiting law enforcement for political  gain rather than helping law enforcement with real policy.   House Republicans are using messaging bills to nowhere to trick the  public into thinking they support law enforcement while turning around  and stripping communities of the funds necessary to support local law  enforcement agencies across the country.   It was only 2 weeks ago that House Republicans voted to slash funding  for law enforcement by 22 percent. That would decimate local law  enforcement agencies nationwide while leaving our streets unsafe and  our communities vulnerable.   I call on my colleagues to reject the empty rhetoric, and instead,  work with House Democrats to provide the resources necessary to  actually support our law enforcement officers and their mission to  protect and serve our families and our communities.                            ____________________
