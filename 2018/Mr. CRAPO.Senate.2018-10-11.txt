 Mr. President, today I wish to honor a dedicated and  treasured member of my staff, Margaret Ballard, and thank her for her  more than 21 years of congressional service.   Margaret joined my congressional staff as an intern in 1997 when I  served in the U.S. House of Representatives and as she was studying for  her master's degree at Boise State University. She quickly proved  herself to be bright, adept, and dependable, traits that have made her  an integral member of my staff. She currently serves as administrative  director and has served in this position since late 2001, but she has  carried out many different tasks and filled in for various State  positions as we developed as an organization. Her experience,  knowledge, and skill from working in so many areas enable her to  understand the roles of fellow staff and effectively connect office  functions.   Margaret is the glue that holds my office together. As administrative  director, she oversees the day-to-day administrative work that is so  critical to office functions and responsiveness to the people of Idaho.  Margaret keeps track of the intricate details and requirements of  operating a Senate office, including the Senate rules. Margaret also  recognizes staff achievements and finds opportunities to provide levity  and boost morale. She has carried out meticulous work to enhance office  operations and coordinate the efforts of the staff. Her long-term  dedication to this effort has been vital to ensuring office efficiency.  Every organization needs Margaret's kind of continuity and know-how.   To put the many changes Margaret has been a part of over the past 20  years into perspective, she recalls that, when she started back in  1997, all State offices had to share a dial-up internet connection and  she had to coordinate when each office could call in and connect for  internet service. With the technological advances since, those  connection phases are a dim memory. Margaret has handled each new phase  with tact and proficiency as she helped build our office  administratively.   Prior to joining my staff, Margaret was the State emergency response  commission chief of staff for 9 and a half years. Before that position,  she was an administrative assistant for the mayor and city council of  Glendale, CO, for 2 and a half years. She has worked in all three  levels of government, local, State, and Federal Service. On a personal  note, Margaret and her husband Troy Gugel have a son and daughter. They  are grandparents to a grandson and have a granddaughter on the way.   Margaret, thank you for your steady, committed, and skilled work all  these years. The adjectives I could list to describe you could go on  and on: well-organized, resourceful, professional. Above all, I know  that I have always been able to count on you to get the job done well  for the people of Idaho. This is the core of what it means to be an  outstanding member of the staff and, more importantly, a friend.  Congratulations on the work milestone you have surpassed, and thank for  lending your talents to working on behalf of Idahoans all these years.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to honor Paul J.  Schneider, who is retiring from NewsTalk 670 KBOI, of Boise, ID, after  more than 51 years in radio and television.   Paul J. Schneider, known as Paul J, started working for the station  in 1967 and has been a mainstay of thoughtful reporting since. He  called Boise State University football and basketball games for decades  as ``Voice of the Broncos.'' Idahoans and many others have no doubt  taken solace during their morning commutes with Paul J's interesting  and cheerful discussions. He has been a treasured voice underscoring  significant local and world events.   Over the years, he has no doubt observed and taken part in many  innovations in broadcasting and significant local and national  happenings. When announcing Paul J's retirement, the station noted,  ``His storied radio career has seen plenty of benchmark moments,  including but not limited to: the first radio interview with President  Richard Nixon in 1972 after Watergate; covering the prison riots at the  Idaho Penitentiary in 1971 and 1973; and calling Boise State Football's  first trip to the Fiesta Bowl in 2007.''   Descriptions of him are peppered with words such as greatly  respected, trusted, professional, iconic, wise, and humorous. His  experience and affection for the community he has chosen to make his  home all these years comes through in his commentary. He has received  numerous honors throughout his career that include being inducted into  the Boise State Athletic Hall of Fame in 2018, more than 50 Idaho State  Broadcasting Association awards, and Boise's Key to the City in 2017.  The press box at Albertsons Stadium and the Cumulus broadcast building  have been named in his honor.   I understand he is looking forward to sleeping in during his  retirement, and I hope he gets some well-deserved rest for all the  years he has devoted to keeping Idahoans informed. It is also good to  hear that he will still be using his talents to produce, blog, and  cover sports. Knowing that Idahoans will still get to benefit from his  humor, skill, and engaging commentary is heartening, as I wish him well  in his retirement.   Paul J, congratulations on your extraordinary career and leaving a  lasting mark in Idaho radio and the lives of countless Idahoans. I wish  you all the best.                            ____________________
