 Mr. Speaker, and still I rise, a proud American,  and I am especially proud today because I rise to acknowledge that we  have filed a resolution, H. Res. 464, that is styled the Original LGBTQ  Pride Month Resolution of 2019.   I am proud to be a sponsor of the Pride resolution, but I am not  doing it alone. There are 78 Members of Congress who are original  cosponsors of this resolution. ``Original'' meaning their names will be  right there on the resolution when it is filed.   I am so proud to be a sponsor of the Pride resolution, and I am proud  to read just a couple of passages from this resolution and to address  them rather briefly. It was my hope to have some 30 minutes to an hour  of time to speak on the resolution, but circumstances in Congress will  not permit such to take place.   This resolution acknowledges the 50 years since the uprising at  Stonewall, which will be commemorated on June 28 and will last for some  6 days because that is the length of time that the Stonewall uprising,  or as some would call it, the Stonewall riots or Stonewall rebellion,  but 50 years since Stonewall.   I would like to read the whereas as it relates to Stonewall. It  reads: ``Whereas, those who took a stand for human rights and dignity  at the Stonewall Inn in New York City on June 28, 1969, were pioneers  of the LGBTQ movement, including two transgender women of color, Sylvia  Rivera and Marsha P. Johnson, who were brave visible leaders in the  uprising at Stonewall Inn.''   Mr. Speaker, it is said that a great person will always rise to the  occasion, but the truth is, it takes a greater person to make the  occasion. These two trans persons were the greater people who made the  occasion that we will commemorate on June 28 and the 6 days that ensue,  two persons who took a stand among many.   There were others, but there were two among the many who took a stand  that literally has helped to shape the course of history. Sometimes, it  really does take just a few to get the job done of starting a movement  that can change society.   Mr. Speaker, notwithstanding all the change that has manifested  itself since the Stonewall uprising, there are still things that must  be done. There is still great work to be done because being an LGBTQ  person, that alone can get you fired. Coming to work and saying you  have just married someone of the same sex as you can get you fired.   LGBTQ persons do not have the same rights that we have, those of us  who are allies of the community. They don't have the same rights. They  have them, but they are not being identified and recognized. These  rights don't come from people. They really are something we are born  with. Human dignity is something that is accorded every person by  birthright.   Unfortunately, in our society, we still allow this level of  discrimination against LGBTQ persons.   I want to acknowledge that while there is still great work to be  done, we still must commemorate and celebrate the great work that has  been done. As a Member of Congress, I pledge to do all that I can to  make sure that I pay a debt that I owe to the LGBTQ community.   Finally, I would say this: A person who helped to organize the march  on  [[Page H5172]]  Washington was named Bayard Rustin. In 1963, he was one of the persons  who made the occasion. He was Black. He was Quaker. He was also LGBTQ.   I owe a debt, and I am here today to repay some portion of that debt  with this resolution.                            ____________________
