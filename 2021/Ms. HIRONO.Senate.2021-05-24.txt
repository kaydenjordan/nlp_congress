 I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise today in support of the  nomination of Kristen Clarke to be Assistant Attorney General for the  Justice Department's Civil Rights Division.   In the 4\1/2\ months since she was nominated, my Republican  colleagues and their rightwing allies have engaged in a coordinated  smear campaign to distort Kristen Clarke's record. It is past time to  set things straight.   Kristen Clarke is a supremely capable and qualified nominee to lead  the Civil Rights Division. I would argue that she is among the most  well-credentialed and qualified nominees ever to serve in this role.   During her career, she has served as a trial attorney in the  Division's voting section; a prosecutor in the Division's criminal  section; an assistant counsel at the NAACP Legal Defense and Education  Fund and later as the codirector of its Political Participation Group;  as the civil rights chief of the New York State Attorney General's  Civil Rights Bureau; and as president and executive director of the  Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, one of the Nation's  preeminent civil rights organizations. Kristen Clarke's credentials for  this job are unimpeachable.   Unable to undermine her nomination on the merits, Senate Republicans  have engaged in a vicious smear campaign against Kristen Clarke because  they are afraid she will actually do her job. They are afraid she will  enforce our civil rights statutes, challenge discriminatory voting  laws, combat systemic racism in policing, and protect the LGBTQ  community.   This work is urgently needed after the Civil Rights Division endured  4 years of intentional neglect and outright hostility during the Trump  administration. During its 4 years in office, the Trump administration  brought only a single case--one--under the Voting Rights Act, even as  States like Georgia, Ohio, and Wisconsin worked to suppress the vote by  targeting people of color.   The previous administration also effectively ended the use of consent  decrees to bring police departments into compliance with the  Constitution. It abandoned this critical tool at the worst possible  moment, as the Nation watched Black Americans like George Floyd and  Breonna Taylor killed by officers sworn to protect and serve.   President Biden nominated Kristen Clarke to lead the Civil Rights  Division because she is precisely the leader we need at this critical  moment. But for 4\1/2\ months, my Republican colleagues have tried to  tear down this highly qualified woman of color with unfounded smears  and outright lies. They feign outrage over a satirical letter Ms.  Clarke wrote as an undergrad at Harvard in 1994, over 25 years ago.   I don't recall any comparable Republican outrage when Michael  Truncale, then a practicing attorney for decades, disparaged President  Obama as an ``un-American imposter [who] bows to Arab Sheikhs and other  world leaders.'' Instead, they confirmed him to a lifetime appointment  as a judge in the Eastern District of Texas.   Senate Republicans have also tried to paint Ms. Clarke as some sort  of anti-Semite--again, reaching back 25 years to criticize a speaker  Ms. Clarke invited to campus as an undergrad. They conveniently ignore  that Ms. Clarke has addressed their concerns head-on and demonstrated a  long track record of defending religious rights throughout her career.   Her work in this area has earned her the support of the National  Council of Jewish Women and the Anti-Defamation League, among other  organizations. And if we needed any more evidence to rebut this  outrageous claim, we should all look to the words of Attorney General  Merrick Garland, who forcefully said: ``I'm a pretty good judge of what  an anti-Semite is, and I do not believe she is an anti-Semite.''   Republicans are also trying to derail Kristen Clarke's nomination by  pushing the lie that she supports defunding the police. It doesn't  matter how many times they repeat the lie, it will never be true. Ms.  Clarke has clearly expressed her support for shifting resources to  social workers and mental health professionals so that police officers  are no longer called upon to address every problem in society. This is  not defunding the police, no matter what twisted definition is used.   As the Senate Judiciary Committee prepared to vote on Ms. Clarke's  nomination, several Republicans took this baseless criticism to a  pathetic, ridiculous new low. The junior Senator from Texas claimed  that voting for Ms. Clarke--and, previously, voting to confirm Vanita  Gupta as Associate Attorney General--put ``every single Democratic  Member of the United States Senate. . . . on record supporting  abolishing''--abolishing--``the police.'' ``Abolishing the police''-- that is what he said--not defunding, not reforming, abolishing. What a  crock.   Unfortunately, we have come to expect these laughable exaggerations  from our colleague from Texas. He would rather smear a nominee with  baseless charges than engage with the facts, because neither Kristen  Clarke nor Vanita Gupta has ever supported abolishing the police.  Neither of them has said anything remotely close to this. If they had,  I am sure it would come as news to the Fraternal Order of Police, the  Major County Sheriffs of America, and the International Association of  Chiefs of Police, all of whom endorsed Vanita Gupta's nomination. You  might also want to ask the Major  [[Page S3321]]  Cities Chiefs Association and the National Organization of Black Law  Enforcement Executives why they endorsed Kristen Clarke if she is  looking to put their members out of work. The fact is, she is not. This  smear is only one example of the baseless, personal attacks Kristen  Clarke has endured by those seeking to derail her nomination.   This week, the Senate can and should repudiate the vicious rightwing  smear campaign against Ms. Clarke and confirm her as the next leader of  the Civil Rights Division.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I have a request for one committee to meet  during today's session of the Senate. It has the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.   Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committee is authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:                        Committee on Foreign Relations    The Committee on Foreign Relations is authorized to meet during the  session of the Senate on Monday, May 24, 2021, at 6 p.m., to conduct a  closed hearing.                            ____________________
