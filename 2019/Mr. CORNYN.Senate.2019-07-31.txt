 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, over the past several months, we have  heard a lot of talk about Medicare for All. Its Democratic supporters  claim this is the panacea that will solve all of America's healthcare  woes. They say it will guarantee every person's access to healthcare  and simplify our healthcare system, but it doesn't take much effort to  see the flaws in their proposal and in their argument--something we are  obligated to do, to examine these proposals to see whether they will  work or not.   Our Democratic friends proudly own the fact that Medicare for All  would completely end employer-based health insurance as we know it. We  heard that a lot last night during the debates of the Democratic  candidates running for President. It would literally force every  American into one government-run plan modeled after our current  Medicare system.   Part of the problem is, seniors have paid into the Medicare system  for many years, and we know it is on a path to insolvency unless  Congress does something. Medicare for All would only make that worse,  expanding it to every eligible American.   According to a Kaiser poll released yesterday, more than three- quarters of Americans favor employer-sponsored health insurance, and 86  percent of people with employer coverage rate their insurance  positively. That would include, again, as we heard last night, many  union members who have been part of the collective bargaining agreement  with their employers, with management, to negotiate outstanding,  quality private health insurance. That would go away under Medicare for  All.   We know that about 83-percent of the people polled support our  current Medicare system for our seniors, and a whopping 95 percent of  people with Medicare coverage are happy with it, but if Medicare for  All becomes the law of the land, those numbers would plummet because  Medicare would be unrecognizable to the seniors who paid into the fund  and who have earned that coverage.   Families would lose all freedom when it comes to making their own  healthcare choices. You see a government-selected doctor at a  government-selected facility. We know what that looks like in the  United Kingdom and in Canada, where people have to wait in long lines  just to get seen by their doctor, much less elective surgery. You get  the coverage the government says you deserve at the time, when the  government says you can have it. It would completely hollow out the  existing Medicare Program and inject unfathomable instability into  America's healthcare system.   If you get past all of that, which is hard to do, you certainly will  not be able to stomach the price. Medicare for All, it is estimated,  would cost taxpayers $32 trillion over the first 10 years alone. Now,  credit Bernie Sanders, our colleague from Vermont. He is honest enough  to acknowledge that he is going to have to raise taxes on the middle  class to pay for that, but $32 trillion is a lot of money, especially  when our current debt exceeds $20 trillion already and is growing. When  it comes to how they would pay for it, the only answer we hear from  everybody other than Bernie Sanders is, ``Let's just tax the rich.''   This is part of their usual talking points and part of the Democratic  Party's incredible sprint to the left and their shocking embrace of a  socialist agenda.   We saw the start of their move toward socialized medicine in 2009  with ObamaCare. We famously recall President Obama trying to reassure  people that if you like your healthcare plan, you can keep it, and if  you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor--none of which proved to  be true.   Now Democrats want to make these extravagant promises about Medicare  for All, which we know they cannot keep. It is clear ObamaCare was just  the beginning. Medicare for All, or the public option, so to speak,  which some people try to tout as an alternative, is nothing but a  government competition for private health insurance, and you can't beat  the Federal Government, especially when it is paid for by Federal tax  dollars. That is a march toward the elimination of private health  insurance, including that provided through your employer, which now  benefits about 180 million Americans.   Last night, we saw candidates defend these radical policies during  the Democratic debate. Two of our Senate colleagues who are running for  President sparred over what another candidate called ``fairytale''  promises. They fought to defend their plan to remove all choice from  Americans' healthcare. They tried to convince their fellow Democrats  and the American people that they are writing a check that, if elected,  they can cash.   We know that is not true. The American people are not going to be  fooled. They don't want socialized medicine; they don't want to run up  government  [[Page S5216]]  spending; they certainly don't want to have to pay $32 trillion in  additional taxes to pay for it; and they certainly don't want  Washington bureaucrats dictating their families' healthcare choices.   In a speech last week, the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare  and Medicaid Services, Seema Verma, spoke about these radical  healthcare ideas. She said: ``These proposals are the largest threats  to the American healthcare system.''   Let me say that again. Seema Verma, head of CMS, the Centers for  Medicare and Medicaid Services, called these proposals ``the largest  threats'' to America's healthcare system. So you better believe we will  keep fighting to resist this socialist agenda and this evermore liberal  wish list.                        Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019    Mr. President, on another matter, we will soon be able to vote on a  bipartisan, 2-year budget agreement to provide some certainty and  stability to the Federal Government and Federal spending. The President  and Speaker Pelosi have reached this deal in order to avoid the  possibility of another government shutdown and instead leave time and  space for a wide-ranging debate on our government spending habits.   I know the Presiding Officer believes as I do; that it is past time  to have a genuine, far-ranging debate about government spending habits  that is not just focused on discretionary spending, which is what this  budget caps deal does, but on all the money the Federal Government  spends, which includes the 70 percent of spending which is on  autopilot, which this deal does not discuss or deal with.   I will be the first to admit this budget agreement isn't perfect. It  never is. Anything negotiated means both sides have to give up a little  bit in order to find common ground. As I indicated, I certainly wish it  were more aggressive. I wish it did something to deal with our  entitlement programs as we continue to face growing deficits, but I am  glad to see that the agreement offsets roughly a 1-year increase for  nondefense discretionary spending above current law and allows our  government to be funded on time and on budget.   It also avoids 30 poison pill policy riders on everything from  taxpayer funding for abortion to immigration law, keeping them from  reaching the President's desk.   Above all, this agreement delivers on our most fundamental  responsibility, which is to provide for our common defense. When our  friend, the senior Senator from Oklahoma, first came here, he said: I  am a conservative, which means there are really two things that take  priority when it comes to the Federal Government. One is national  defense, and the other is infrastructure. He said everything else comes  below that on the priority list. I found a lot of wisdom in those  words. Providing for the common defense is the most important thing  Congress does, along with the administration.   We know under the previous administration, the Pentagon and our  national defense were underfunded dramatically. It operated without any  kind of stability or predictability, and this took a serious toll on  our military readiness.   After nearly a decade of neglect, President Trump and Senate  Republicans are working to rebuild our military and rebuild that  readiness and modernize our force.   Let's look at the Army Future Vertical Lift--or FVL--as an example of  why this investment is so very important. FVL is a cross-functional  team within Army Futures Command headquarters in Austin, TX, that aims  to develop two new helicopters for the Army in the 2020s. These next- generation aircraft will replace aging military helicopters and provide  our servicemembers with the capabilities they need today and tomorrow.   But right now, these programs are progressing without timely funding.  It is hard to make plans when you don't know how the money is going to  flow. Without a budget deal and on-time appropriations, the Army has no  choice but to significantly delay these programs for years to come,  meaning that the Army will continue to operate helicopters built in the  seventies and eighties.   The same goes with our artillery. Those years of underfunding have  allowed Russia and China to surpass our capabilities in a number of  areas, including long-range precision fire. In this and other areas,  the military must develop longer range weapons to provide an advantage  over our adversaries and maintain our qualitative edge.   As a newer program, the Army would not be able to continue research,  development, and testing under a continuing resolution or without a  budget deal, putting us another year behind in modernizing our force in  an era of great power competition. That means China and Russia continue  apace while we are slow to try to catch up.   That is why this deal is so important. It provides stable and  reliable funding so that our military leaders can plan for the future  and provide for the common defense.   Our newly confirmed Defense Secretary, Mark Esper, talked about this  at length when testifying before the Armed Services Committee a couple  of weeks ago. He talked about the Department of Defense receiving  funding on time last year and said that it really allowed us to  accelerate the readiness gains we have made to advance our  modernization efforts and to do all of the things the national defense  strategy tells us we need to do.   You would think there would be broad bipartisan support for providing  America's military with the necessary resources to keep the American  people safe. Somehow, though, some of our Members believe that this  critical national security mission is optional.   Unfortunately, there are some in our midst who look to reduce  military funding at every possible turn. Fortunately, we have a  President who shares our commitment to national security. Thanks to the  Trump administration's tough negotiating, this deal provides the  stability the Pentagon needs, including critical investments in  military readiness. Compared to current law, it provides a larger  increase in discretionary funding for defense than nondefense  discretionary programs and would allow us to regain the ground lost  under the Obama administration.   I appreciate the President's work, along with that of the House and  the Senate, to deliver a budget deal that supports America's military,  and I look forward to supporting this agreement later today and  certainly later this week.                            ____________________     Mr. President, notwithstanding rule XXII, I ask unanimous  consent that the Senate proceed to legislative session and be in a  period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak therein  for up to 10 minutes.
