 Madam Speaker, I rise to congratulate Corey Bulman, an  English and literature teacher at Mound Westonka High School, on being  named Minnesota's Teacher of the Year. This is an extraordinary  achievement and a tribute to his enthusiasm both inside and outside of  the classroom.   Mr. Bulman began teaching at Mound Westonka 17 years ago, where he  devoted his entire tenure as an educator to enriching students in the  classroom through his creative, imaginative, and insightful  curriculums. What sets him apart is the meaningful and empowering  connections he develops with his students.   As one of his former students said: ``Corey was an adult, who showed  me he believed I was smart, and cared about my ideas. He was honest,  funny, and made me believe in myself.''   Madam Speaker, there is no doubt that Mr. Bulman has touched so many  of his students' lives. He understands how forming these bonds can  inspire students for future success.   Madam Speaker, I want to congratulate Corey and thank him for  dedicating himself on educating, inspiring, and empowering our young  students.                            ____________________
