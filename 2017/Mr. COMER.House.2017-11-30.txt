 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 4182.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Shimkus). Is there objection to the  request of the gentleman from Kentucky?   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 635 and rule  XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House  on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 4182.   The Chair appoints the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. Simpson) to preside  over the Committee of the Whole.                                time  1518                        In the Committee of the Whole    Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the  Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill  (H.R. 4182) to amend title 5, United States Code, to modify  probationary periods with respect to positions within the competitive  service and the Senior Executive Service, and for other purposes, with  Mr. Simpson in the chair.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the  first time.   General debate shall not exceed 1 hour equally divided and controlled  by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Oversight  and Government Reform.   The gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Comer) and the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Connolly) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, highly skilled Federal employees are essential to a  government that serves its citizens. Skilled Federal workers ensure  that functions of government, from delivering mail to protecting the  homeland, are carried out successfully.   Federal jobs and the skills required to perform them vary  significantly across government. Some employees review patents, some  work in human resources, and others work in law enforcement.   While the jobs, skills, and training required may be different from  job to job, the expectation that the Federal Government hires qualified  candidates is universal.   One tool agencies and managers have to ensure a qualified workforce  is the probationary period--a period of time used to evaluate whether a  new hire  [[Page H9548]]  can effectively perform the duties of the position.   Under current law, most new hires are required to complete a  probationary period of 1 year before receiving full employment status.  Most new employees complete the probationary period and are hired as  permanent employees.   New employees who fail to demonstrate that they are a good fit for  the position, however, are transitioned out of government during the  probationary period, but the current 1-year trial period is not  sufficient for complex Federal occupations. Potential employees deserve  ample time to learn about the job and demonstrate they are able to  perform all critical aspects of a Federal position, and supervisors  deserve ample time to evaluate new hires.   What is a manager supposed to do in this case? Does the supervisor  take a gamble and offer permanent status to an untested employee or  risk missing out on a potentially skilled employee? This is a real  dilemma. Supervisors throughout the Federal workforce have described  this exact scenario in their advocacy for this bill.   According to the Government Managers Coalition, managers tend to err  on the side of releasing borderline employees in cases like this, and  it can be a very frustrating decision for them to make. They have  already devoted a significant amount of time and resources into  training the new hire.   However, managers would rather not risk hiring an employee who is on  the fence at the end of a probationary period. This is because a  manager is pretty much stuck with an employee after the probationary  period. It is difficult to remove a permanent employee for poor  performance or misconduct.   According to the Government Accountability Office, the procedural  hurdles to removing a permanent employee can take from 6 months to 1  year. The evidence is clear, the probationary period needs to be  extended.   In 2015, the GAO reported that chief human capital officers  throughout the Federal Government would benefit from an extension of  the probationary period, especially in occupations which are complex or  difficult to assess. Federal manager groups have been asking for a  longer probationary period for years.   In congressional testimony earlier this year, the national president  of the Federal Managers Association, Renee Johnson said: ``FMA  advocates extending the probationary period. This would benefit both  the government and employees by allowing supervisors to make decisions  based on the employees' performance as fully trained employees--not  just guessing at how they will perform after the training is  completed.''   The Government Managers Coalition, a group of five organizations that  represent the interests of over 200,000 supervisors, managers, and  executives serving throughout the Federal Government, supports an  extension of the probationary period.   I include in the Record a letter of support from the Government  Managers Coalition signed by the heads of the FAA Managers Association,  Federal Managers Association, Professional Managers Association,  National Council of Social Security Management Associations, and Senior  Executives Association; and a letter from the Professional Managers  Association.                                  Government Managers Coalition,                                                  November 29, 2017.      United States Congress,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: We write on behalf of the Government       Managers Coalition (GMC), which is comprised of five major       federal sector professional associations collectively       representing the interests of over 200,000 supervisors,       managers, and executives serving throughout the federal       government.        Our coalition is supportive of H.R. 4182, the Ensuring a       Qualified Civil Service Act of 2017 (the EQUALS Act),       introduced by Representative James Comer. We appreciate Rep.       Comer's efforts to take the lead on this important       legislation and the consideration earlier this month by the       House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. The GMC has       advocated for an extended probationary period for over a       decade. We encourage you to support the measure when it comes       to the floor later this week.        The EQUALS Act would grant agencies the authority to extend       the probationary period for competitive service appointments       and supervisors. In addition, this legislation would align       appointments under competitive and senior executive service       with the two-year trial period served under excepted service       appointments, bringing consistency to hiring throughout       government.        Extension of the probationary period is supported by a 2015       Government Accountability Office (GAO) report, GAO-15-191.       Chief Human Capital Officers (CHCO) commented to GAO that       often supervisors within federal departments and agencies are       not given sufficient time to accurately review performance       before the probationary period is complete. The CHCO       recommended an extension of the probationary period to the       GAO in order to accurately assess an employee's abilities in       the federal workforce. In addition, Congress has already       approved a two-year probationary period for employees at the       Department of Defense, as part of the Fiscal Year 2016       National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), P.L. 114-92.        The GMC's mission is to promote good government initiatives       that foster effectiveness and efficiency throughout the       federal government. We believe that this legislation will       allow employees sufficient time on the job to demonstrate       their abilities as well as allow for proper assessment. The       measure will also ensure that supervisors have the       opportunity and authority to fulfill their performance       management responsibilities that may not be feasible under       the current one-year probationary period.        The current one-year probationary period is often       insufficient to assess an employee's performance in more       technical and complex jobs, of which there are many in the       federal government, and may in fact place an employee at risk       of termination before having had the opportunity to       effectively demonstrate their abilities. The reality is that       many technical jobs require agency classroom training,       mentoring and on-the-job training for employees to become       proficient. Often, the supervisor does not see the employee       during those times, and is unable to observe the employee's       performance. In front-line public service roles, such as with       the Social Security Administration (SSA) or the Internal       Revenue Service (IRS), employees must not only learn       material, but also need to be able to effectively interact       with citizens. The EQUALS Act would ensure that employees are       provided with the opportunity to not only receive training,       but also to effectively demonstrate their abilities.       Extending the probationary period will in no way penalize an       employee who is performing well and progressing in their       training and responsibilities.        The GMC would appreciate your support of this legislation.       In light of ongoing agency reorganization efforts, it is now       more important than ever to ensure federal managers making       personnel decisions have a comprehensive toolset available       that represents both flexibility for agencies and fairness       for affected federal employees. We look forward to passage of       this legislation, as well as other commonsense federal       workforce reform bills resulting in an improved federal       government that can better serve the American public. Should       you require additional information or want to discuss this       issue further, please contact Rachel A. Emmons with the       National Council of Social Security Management Associations       (NCSSMA).            Sincerely,      Andy Taylor,        President, FAA Managers Association.       Renee M. Johnson,        President, Federal Managers Association.      Thomas R. Burger,        Executive Director, Professional Managers Association.      Christopher Detzler,        President, National Council of Social Security, Management       Association.      Bill Valdez,        President, Senior Executives Association.                                   ____                                Professional Managers Association,                                  Washington, DC, November 29, 2017.        Dear Representative: The Professional Managers Association       (PMA) represents the interests of professional managers,       management officials, and non-bargaining unit employees in       the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other federal       agencies. On behalf of PMA's members, I write in support of       H.R. 4182, the Ensuring a Qualified Civil Service Act of 2017       (the EQUALS Act), introduced by Representative James Comer,       and to offer a specific example--Revenue Agents at the IRS--      for an example of a federal job that would benefit from an       extended probationary period. PMA also signed onto a letter       with our colleagues with the Government Managers Coalition       (GMC) expressing our collective support for the EQUALS Act.        Following their hiring, IRS Revenue Agents go through an       extensive training process that includes classes in tax law       and procedures. They begin by learning the basics and the       laws that deal with individuals, starting with several weeks       of classroom training before moving on to work on actual       cases in taxpayer service. After that, they move onto       Schedule Cs and Partnerships, following the same process, but       with less time spent in the classroom. They then return to       the field or office for on-the job training with those types       of cases. Once they have completed this portion of training,       they are assigned to an office where they receive an       inventory of cases to work on. At this time, they are       evaluated on each case they close.  [[Page H9549]]         All of this is just within the first year of training. In       year two--if they are lucky--the agent will be sent to       classes for small and then large corporations. Once the       classroom training is completed, they are assigned more       training cases. Again, each case closed is rated and       evaluated based on all aspects: tax law interpretation, case       write up, meet and deal qualities, etc.        There should also be managerial mentoring completed during       this training process. The manager is meant to go on visits       to observe how the agent deals with the taxpayer and how they       are doing with regards to case write-ups. Yet, while managers       are intended to be involved throughout the training process,       many are spread extremely thin and may be forced to make a       decision not in the best interest of the government or the       agent. A longer probationary period would give managers more       time to make an accurate decision on whether or not an       individual is able to perform the necessary duties of an       efficient, effective agent.        Two years of training is a very costly process, but it is       costlier to make a hasty decision and keep an employee that       would not be an asset to the organization or would be unable       to best serve the public. I urge Members to support the       EQUALS Act.            Sincerely,                                                  Thomas R. Burger,                                                Executive Director.     In the letter, the coalition members write that they have  ``advocated for an extended probationary period for over a decade,''  and that this legislation will allow employees sufficient time on the  job to demonstrate their abilities as well as allow for proper  assessment.   The individuals they represent see the difficulties associated with  the current system in their day-to-day lives. They understand the  problems associated with the arbitrary nature of the current 1-year  probationary period.   The EQUALS Act addresses these problems and moves toward a system  better suited for the modern workforce. The bill will extend the  probationary period for new hires in the competitive service and  initial appointments for managers to 2 years after the completion of  formal training or licensure.   The concept of a 2-year probationary period is not new. Congress  extended the probationary period for new hires at the Department of  Defense to 2 years in 2015. This bill brings the rest of the government  in line with the Department of Defense standards. The EQUALS Act also  recognizes the variety of positions and training requirements  throughout the Federal Government. The EQUALS Act requires the 2-year  period to begin upon the conclusion of the formal training or licensure  process.   This is important, because under current law, time spent in training  counts against the probationary period. This means that a Federal job  with long training, by the time a probationary employee completes the  training, the supervisor often has little or no time to evaluate the  employee's performance.   For example, training for new hires at the Internal Revenue Service  takes 1 year. By the time a new IRS employee completes training, the  manager has to make a decision whether to keep the employee without  having seen the employee do the job.   As Ms. Johnson testified before Congress: ``New employees must often  master broad and complex policies and procedures to meet their  agencies' missions, necessitating several months of formal training  followed by long periods of on-the-job instruction. In occupations  where training takes substantial time, supervisors may only have a few  months of work to judge employees' performance.''   According to data from the Office of Personnel Management, most  formal training programs last less than 1 month. For those positions,  the inclusion of formal training in the probationary period does not do  any harm.   However, for those positions that have long training periods, the  EQUALS Act will make a big difference. The EQUALS Act also helps ensure  managers are doing their jobs. Under the bill, agencies must notify  supervisors prior to the completion of a probationary period so that  the supervisor is reminded to make a decision about a probationary  employee.   The bill also requires agencies to certify that an employee has  successfully completed a probationary period and to provide  justification for that decision.   Mr. Chairman, in closing, I want to make sure we are clear about what  the EQUALS Act does and does not do. The EQUALS Act does not remove or  change any due process rights for probationary period employees.  Probationary employees will still have due process protections.  Probationary employees have access to the Equal Employment Opportunity  Commission, the Merit Systems Protection Board, and the Office of  Special Counsel. Each of those offices are empowered to hear appeals  from probationary employees, and that will not change when H.R. 4182  becomes law.   This bill is a much-needed fix to the Federal hiring process. It will  allow the Federal Government to select the best and brightest civil  servants to serve the American people.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I think it is important to define what the probationary  period is and what it is not.   According to the MSPB, the probationary period is the final step in  the employee screening process when an individual must demonstrate  ``why it is  [[Page H9553]]  in the public interest for the government to finalize an appointment to  the civil service.''   This is not a punitive measure. It is an opportunity for a  prospective employee to prove they are qualified to serve the American  people through a position in the civil service. These are critically  important jobs and we need the best and brightest to fill them. A  longer probationary period gives all new hires time to complete their  training, learn on the job, and demonstrate that they can perform the  role they were hired to do. This is good for our government, good for  Federal employees, and good for the American people.   Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Kentucky is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, this amendment does not create an exception for alumni  of the Peace Corps, AmeriCorps, and other national service programs. It  puts them at a disadvantage.   They would have less time than other new hires to prove themselves  before managers make a decision whether to keep them or let them go.  This could mean fewer Peace Corps, AmeriCorps, and other national  service alumni are retained at the end of the probationary period.   Under the current 1-year system, supervisors often do not have enough  time to determine whether a potential employee is a good fit for the  job. Managers tend to err on the side of releasing an employee who is  on the fence at the end of a probationary period.   New hires to the Federal Government deserve ample time to demonstrate  they are able to perform all critical aspects of the job. H.R. 4182  gives them more time.   This amendment would actually put certain groups at a disadvantage in  comparison to the rest of the Federal workforce. Alumni of the Peace  Corps, AmeriCorps, and other programs would have 1 year to demonstrate  the skills and core competencies required for the  [[Page H9555]]  Federal job they are seeking. Their colleagues would have 2 years.   The spirit of this amendment is admirable, but the unintended  consequence of adopting it will be that the very people the amendment  is meant to benefit would be at a disadvantage.   The probationary period is not a punishment. It is an extension of  the hiring process and a tool to help ensure a qualified civil service.  This amendment would create additional classes of Federal employees and  unnecessarily add complexity to an already complex system.   Mr. Chairman, I urge Members to oppose this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida will  be postponed.   The Acting CHAIR. The Chair understands that amendment No. 2 will not  be offered.                     Amendment No. 3 Offered by Gianforte    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3  printed in House Report 115-430.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  gentleman's amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Kentucky is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, extending the probationary period is not a  new idea. Federal manager groups have advocated for an extended  probationary period for more than a decade.   The Government Accountability Office completed a study on the  probationary period in February of 2015. In that study, chief human  capital officers told GAO a longer probationary period could help  supervisors make a performance assessment for those occupations that  are particularly complex or difficult to assess. GAO also recommended  considering, ``extending the supervisory probationary period beyond 1  year to include at least 1 full employee appraisal cycle.''   As far back as 2005, the Merit Systems Protection Board completed a  study and recommended longer probationary periods when an agency deems  it necessary to fully evaluate a probationer. It is not necessary to  wait for more studies on this issue.   This amendment strikes the entire bill, meaning the current  probationary period would remain the same and the problems that GAO and  others have identified would persist. This amendment undermines the  entire purpose of the bill, which is to allow managers' employees more  time to conduct a fair and complete assessment of probationary Federal  employees.   Mr. Chairman, I urge Members to oppose this amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I urge Members to vote ``no'' on this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.
