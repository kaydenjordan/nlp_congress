 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution  509, I call up the bill (H.R. 397) to amend the Internal Revenue Code  of 1986 to create a Pension Rehabilitation Trust Fund, to establish a  Pension Rehabilitation Administration within the Department of the  Treasury to make loans to multiemployer defined benefit plans, and for  other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and insert extraneous material on H.R. 397, the  Rehabilitation for Multiemployer Pensions Act.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 2\1/2\ minutes.   Madam Speaker, over the last few decades, construction workers, truck  drivers, industrial bakers, coal miners, and other hardworking  Americans, some of whom are here today, did everything they could to  prepare themselves and their families for a secure retirement. Year  after year, these workers negotiated with their employers to defer  wages in return for a promise of a pension that would allow them to  retire with dignity.   Now, through no fault of their own, the pensions they earned over  their lifetimes and the retirement security they were promised are in  jeopardy. Today, approximately 130 multiemployer pension plans,  covering about 1 million participants, are in severe financial  distress. Several plans are facing insolvency in the next few years,  while many others are projected to fail over the next 20 years.   Making matters worse, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, which  insures these pension plans, is projected to run out of money by 2025  as large plans face insolvency. If multiemployer pension plans go broke  and the PBGC's multiemployer program collapses, there will be  catastrophic consequences to retirees, workers, businesses, and  taxpayers.   The Rehabilitation for Multiemployer Pensions Act, commonly known as  the Butch Lewis Act, is a bipartisan solution to avert this financial  disaster, and it will actually end up saving taxpayers billions of  dollars.   According to one estimate, a multiemployer pension system collapse  would cost the Federal Government at least $170 billion over 10 years,  and possibly $400 billion over 30 years, due to lost tax revenue and  increased reliance on social programs.   According to the CBO, to solve the problem, this bill is estimated to  cost not $400 billion over 30 years, but $55 billion, total, over those  30 years. This bill will solve the problem. And that is just the cost  to the Federal budget, ignoring the pain and suffering of people losing  their pensions and businesses going out of business.   That is the choice we have today. We can support a bipartisan bill  that saves retirees' hard-earned pensions, protect businesses from  going bankrupt, and costs far less than doing nothing, or we can oppose  it and end up costing the taxpayers far more in the long run.   Madam Speaker, I anticipate that my Republican colleagues will talk  about structural reforms that are needed to prevent multiemployer plans  from facing bankruptcy in the future. I agree.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself an additional 1  minute.   Madam Speaker, reforms are needed, and I am committed to working on a  bipartisan basis to enact prospective reforms. But when the house is on  fire, you don't debate on how the fire started or pontificate over how  to prevent fires in the future; you put out the fire.   So today we are putting out the fire and protecting retirement  security for more than 1 million Americans across the country and  saving the taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds to  remind the ranking member that CBO estimates that the 30-year cost of  this bill is about $55 billion of money that will not be paid back, or  we can pay up to $400 billion over 30 years. We have a choice. I would  pick the $55 billion.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Wilson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Norcross).    Mr. Speaker, could you advise as to how much  time is still available on each side.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Wild).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the following five letters in  support: AARP, AFL-CIO, International Association of Machinists and  Aerospace Workers, Service Employees International Union, and the  United Steelworkers.                                                            AARP,                                      Washington, DC, July 22, 2019.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Republican Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Leader McCarthy: On behalf of our       nearly 38 million members nationwide and all Americans age 50       and older, AARP is pleased to urge House passage of H.R. 397,       the Rehabilitation for Multiemployer Pensions Act. This       bipartisan legislation would help enable eligible       multiemployer pension plans to continue to pay earned       pensions to retirees and fund their long-term pension       commitments.        Over ten million workers, retirees, and their families are       counting on these earned retirement benefits for their       retirement security. As part of the FY 2015 Omnibus       Appropriations Act, with almost no debate, Congress permitted       underfunded multiemployer pension plans to cut the earned       pensions of current retirees. Congress' action broke forty       years of settled pension law and put hundreds of thousands of       retirees at risk of having their retirement benefits and       financial security undermined. Instead of cutting earned       pensions, Congress should instead enact reasonable solutions       to help enable multiemployer pension plans to pay earned       benefits and fully fund their pension plans over time.        We commend the bipartisan group of sponsors on their bill's       proposed creation of a Pension Rehabilitation Administration,       within the Treasury Department, to provide low-cost loans to       qualified underfunded multiemployer pension plans. Plans       would have up to thirty years to pay earned retiree benefits,       prudently invest the loan proceeds, and re-pay the loan.       During the loan period, employers may not reduce       contributions and the plan may not increase promised       benefits. The plan must also demonstrate that receipt of the       loan will enable the plan to avoid insolvency, pay benefits       and loan interest, and accumulate sufficient funds to repay       the loan principal when due.        AARP urges passage of the Rehabilitation of Multiemployer       Pensions Act to protect the hardearned pensions of retirees.       We look forward to working with Congress to enact this       important bill, as well as additional legislation to       adequately fund all earned multiemployer retiree pensions and       the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. If you have any       questions, please feel free to contact me.            Sincerely,                                               Nancy A. LeaMond,                                        Executive Vice President and      Chief Advocacy and Engagement Officer.                                   ____                                                          AFL-CIO,                                      Washington, DC, July 22, 2019.        Dear Representative: The AFL-CIO is pleased that the       ``Rehabilitation for Multiemployer Pensions Act'' (H.R. 397)       will be on the House floor this week. We urge you to support       this bill, as it is the first step towards enactment of       legislation to address our nation's looming pension crisis.        Absent federal action, the retirement income security of       over one million American workers, retirees, and their       spouses across the country will be in jeopardy because of the       impending failure of their multiemployer pension plans. By       establishing a federal loan program for troubled plans       meeting certain criteria, H.R. 397 reflects the fact that       allowing these plans to fail will have a devastating impact       not only on individual retirees and their families, but also       on their communities and their employers.        The working men and women whose retirement income security       is at risk have not forgotten the 2008 record-setting federal       rescue of Wall Street. Multiemployer pension plan       participants and retirees are no less worthy than the       financial services firms who were the beneficiaries of the       $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program. Moreover, unlike       the Wall Street banks, they played no part in either the       industry deregulation or financial crisis that weakened many       multiemployer pension plans.        Congress has the ability to avert the impending retirement       security crisis if it acts expeditiously. The       ``Rehabilitation for Multiemployer Pensions Act'' is an       important bill because it is the only legislation that, thus       far, offers a solution to that crisis. On behalf of the AFL-      CIO, I urge you to support it.            Sincerely,                                                    William Samuel,      Director, Government Affairs Department.                                   ____           International Association of Machinists and Aerospace             Workers,                                                     July 22, 2019.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the International       Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), I       strongly urge you to vote ``Yes'' on H.R. 397, The       Rehabilitation for Multiemployer Pensions Act of 2019.       Commonly referred to as the ``Butch Lewis Act'', this highly       important and innovative legislation would help save those       multiemployer pension plans which are financially-troubled       while protecting the earned and vested benefits of current       and future retirees.        The multiemployer pension system is on the brink of a real       and disastrous crisis. While the majority of multi employer       pension plans are financially sound, the PBGC estimates that       over 100 multiemployer pension plans, covering more than a       million participants, are in ``critical and declining       status'' and will become insolvent within the next twenty       years. Currently, the only Federal assistance offered to       these troubled plans comes from the PBGC and only after the       plan has already failed. Given the number of plans on the       brink of failure, the PBGC' s multiemployer insurance program       is projected to become insolvent by 2025.        The Rehabilitation for Multiemployer Pensions Act of 2019       offers a real, proactive solution which rehabilitates failing       plans, bolsters the PBGC, and protects the earned benefits of       millions of retirees, workers, and their families. This       innovative legislation would allow the Treasury to provide       low-cost loans to qualified underfunded multiemployer pension       plans. Under the legislation, the troubled plans would have       up to thirty years to prudently invest the loaned funds and       would use the investment earnings to pay retiree benefits,       improve the plan's financial position, and pay interest on       the loan to the Treasury. At the end of the thirty year       period, the plan would pay back the loan in full. In order to       be eligible for the loan, the plan would have to demonstrate       that the loan would enable the plan to remain solvent, pay       all retiree benefits and loan interest, and repay the loan       principle when due. During the loan period, contributing       employers would have to maintain their contribution levels       and the plan would not be allowed to make any increases to       retiree benefits.        In the wake of the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of       2014, a brutal scheme to steal the pension promises made to       retirees, the Rehabilitation for Multiemployer Pensions Act       provides a much needed correction and remedy. This       legislation will work to lift troubled multiemployer plans       out of their financial hole, while maintaining the financial       integrity of the PBGC. Most importantly, the Rehabilitation       for Multiemployer Pensions Act provides a pathway to       accomplishing these venerable goals without stealing from       retirees, workers, and their families.        The Rehabilitation for Multiemployer Pensions Act is the       only solution put forth to date which appropriately and       adequately addresses the multiemployer pension crisis by       providing a lifeline to plans in critical financial status       while maintaining the integrity of healthy multiemployer       plans and the PBGC without cutting the earned benefit       promises made to our nation's retirees and working families.        For these reasons, I urge you to support this vitally       important legislation and vote ``Yes'' on H.R. 397, The       Rehabilitation for Multiemployer Pensions Act of 2019.            Thank you,                                              Robert Martinez, Jr.,      International President.                                   ____                                                             SEIU,                                      Washington, DC, July 24, 2019.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the two million members       of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), I write       to urge you to support H.R. 397, the Rehabilitation for       Multiemployer Pensions Act. Improving the solvency of       troubled multiemployer pension plans and the Pension Benefit       Guaranty Corporation (``PBGC'') are the two critical issues       that need to be addressed, and this legislation will       accomplish that without jeopardizing plans that are already       solvent.        SEIU and its Locals sponsor 19 multiemployer pension plans       covering over 800,000 retired and active participants and       their beneficiaries. The health of the multiemployer       retirement community is very important to our union, our       members, and the employers from the health and service       industries which participate in these funds. We support a       resilient multiemployer pension system that provides       continued retirement security to millions of American workers       and their families.        Fortunately, none of SEIU's plans are classified as       ``critical and declining.'' Nevertheless we have followed       closely developments in plans that are facing possible       insolvency as we believe that such a development would cause       serious harm to thousands of workers and retirees, to       employers, to the economy and to the multiemployer pension       system as a whole.  [[Page H7328]]         The loan program which the Rehabilitation for Multiemployer       Pensions Act would establish should maximize the chances that       troubled plans avoid insolvency. Thousands of workers and       retirees in these plans will be able to avoid devastating       benefit cuts. Also, the legislation would dramatically reduce       the expected liabilities of the PBGC and can save the PBGC's       insurance program for all multiemployer plans.        We thank you for your support for workers and their       retirement security.            Sincerely,                                                    Mary Kay Henry,      International President.                                   ____                                              United Steelworkers,                                      Pittsburgh, PA, July 24, 2019.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.2 million active       and retired members of the United Steelworkers, I urge you to       pass H.R. 397, the Rehabilitation for Multiemployer Pensions       Act. Otherwise known to most as the ``Butch-Lewis Act''       scheduled for the floor this week. The legislation will       reassert our nation's commitment to millions of retirees in       the multi-employer pension system, and ensure that they       receive the benefits they have earned without needless cuts       to pensioner incomes.        Pensions are one of the most secure forms of long-term       retirement if government, industry and workers operate in a       cooperative manner to ensure long-term sustainability.       Unfortunately, small subsets of plans, battered by federal       deregulation, changing industries, and unfair trade, have       fallen into decline. After a decade of effort by these       pension plans to recover since the Great Recession, the       damage done by inadequate federal policy could cause almost       1.5 million to lose their retirement and impact all of the 10       million participants who are enrolled in multi-employer       pension plans.        Representative Neal's bipartisan legislation is the       guidepost to ensuring millions of retired Americans receive       the benefits they are promised. The legislation will create a       Pension Rehabilitation Administration under the Department of       Treasury and permit the sale of bonds to finance long-term,       low-interest loans to troubled pension plans. By shoring up       critical and declining status pension plans, millions of       retirees will be assured of a continued secure retirement       without forcing cuts to retiree benefits.        During the loan period, employers may not reduce       contributions and the plan may not increase promised       benefits. The plan must demonstrate that receipt of the loan       will enable the plan to avoid insolvency, pay benefits and       loan interest, and accumulate sufficient funds to repay the       loan principal when due. Providing federal oversight and       access to capital, multi-employer pension funds will be able       to manage the long-term commitments to retirees which in turn       will reduce long-term government risk of default at the       Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC).        For these reasons, I urge you to pass H.R. 397, the       Rehabilitation for Multiemployer Pensions Act.            Sincerely,                                                  Thomas M. Conway,                                           International President.     Mr. Speaker, when it comes to the  multiemployer crisis, the most expensive and harmful thing the Congress  can do is nothing. Over the course of 4 years and multiple hearings,  including five hearings of a joint select committee, we have repeatedly  heard the need to address this issue.   We have also heard about process. Let me tell you about the process.  We had 1 year of a select committee--no plan from the Republicans. This  bill was introduced in January--no plan. We had a hearing in March--no  plan. We had a markup in June--no plan or amendment until shortly  before the markup occurred. Then, instead of seriously considering  those amendments, they required us to read the whole bill.   Mr. Speaker, we have a choice to make. Members of Congress can  continue to wring our hands and listen to complaints while the  catastrophe continues to unfold and unnecessarily adds hundreds of  billions of dollars in costs to the Federal budget, or we can act on  this bipartisan solution.   The only bipartisan solution pending in Congress today is the Butch  Lewis Act. This bill addresses the immediate crisis, protects hard- earned pensions, protects many businesses from bankruptcy, avoids  misery, and saves the taxpayers money.   In fact, according to the CBO, this bill, over 30 years, will cost  less than $60 billion. Doing nothing over 30 years will cost $300  billion to over $400 billion.   Mr. Speaker, I am voting for the solution. I urge my colleagues to do  the same to ensure that all workers can retire with stability and  dignity.   Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Neal), and I ask unanimous consent that he may  control that time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.  [[Page H7335]]     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), the distinguished Speaker of  the House of Representatives.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The intent of  this bill is to keep loan interest rates as low as possible for two  reasons, to get financially distressed plans back on their feet and to  maximize the chance of full repayment of the loan.   CBO estimates that, under the provisions of the bill, the cost of the  loans, after some defaults, will cost less than $60 billion over 30  years, much less than the hundreds of billions of dollars if we do  nothing.   This bill specifies an interest rate to be around the 30-year U.S.  Treasury securities rate with a 20 basis-point increase to cover costs  of administration. For those plans that elect to repay the loan  principal on an accelerated schedule, there is an incentive of a 50  basis-point reduction in the interest rate.   The bottom line here is that this is not a program from which the  Federal Government intends to make a profit.   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Business Roundtable, and many employer  organizations have not endorsed the bill. However, they did send a  letter last year that said: ``The financial and demographic  circumstances of certain plans will not allow them to survive without  responsible financial assistance. Consequently, we recommend long-term,  low-interest loans that will protect taxpayers from financial  liability.''   These business groups recognize that doing nothing is more expensive  to taxpayers than the provisions of this bill and a low-interest loan.                                time  1830    The amendment before us mandates the interest rate to be 5 percent  for the first 5 years and 9 percent thereafter. This is not a low- interest loan in today's environment where a 30-year Treasury security  rate is 2.6 percent.   Raising the interest rates to the levels prescribed by my friend from  Tennessee would entirely subvert the loan program. Nobody would apply,  and those who did apply would have to represent an earnings rate that  would not be realistic.   This amendment would increase loan defaults, and its effect, whether  intended or not, would doom the loan program before it starts.  Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I would recommend that we reject the amendment.   Before I yield back, I want to say that the gentleman from Tennessee  and I disagree on this amendment and the underlying bill, but I  appreciate his leadership and expertise. We served on the Joint Select  Committee last year, and we agree that something needs to be done  because we have a crisis. So I look forward to working with him and his  colleague from Tennessee, the Chair of the Senate Health, Education,  Labor, and Pensions Committee, Mr. Alexander, as this process moves  forward.   Now, I want to remind everybody, if we do nothing, over a million  hardworking Americans will lose their pensions, businesses will go  bankrupt, and the Federal Government will unnecessarily spend hundreds  of billions of dollars.   This amendment will not help. It will actually make matters worse,  and, therefore, we should defeat the amendment and then pass the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.
