 Mr. Chair, if the Congress of the United States were to  direct the Department of Defense to study and examine and scrutinize  your religion to list leaders in that religion and teachers, to decide  what was orthodox and unorthodox, you would be among--I don't know--the  Christian community, the Jewish community, Buddhists, Hindus, and  Muslims.   But only Islam is selected out in the Franks amendment, only one  religion is done so. Mr. Chair, if you select out one religion for  particular scrutiny, to scrutinize their doctrine, to declare to the  government what is orthodox and unorthodox, and to identify teachers of  it, you have simply abridged the free exercise of that religion. That  is unconstitutional.   Nobody is saying you can't study terrorism. You can study what  motivates people to commit acts of terrorism; and we should, but we  don't, not equally. The fact is that this amendment singled out and  stigmatizes one religious group. It is wrong, and it should be voted  down.
