 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, first, let me thank my friend and  colleague from Nebraska for her indulgence.                    Explosion in Saint Petersburg, Russia    Before I begin, Mr. President, I want to express our concern here in  the United States for our friends in Saint Petersburg, Russia, in the  wake of an explosion on their subway system this morning. Russia has  been in the news a lot recently, typically in adversarial terms. Today  is a time to remember that, whatever our differences, we wish no ill to  the people of any nation. Our thoughts and prayers are with the  families of the Russians who were killed this morning. We wish a swift  recovery to the injured and hope the perpetrators are soon brought to  justice.                          Nomination of Neil Gorsuch    Mr. President, I rise this afternoon on the nomination of Judge Neil  Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, which was just advanced by the Judiciary  Committee.   This afternoon, it has become clear that Judge Gorsuch does not have  the 60 votes that are necessary to end debate on his nomination. So now  the focus is shifting away from the issue of whether Judge Gorsuch will  get 60 votes on the cloture motion and toward the fundamental question  before us: Will the majority leader break the rules of the Senate in  order to get Judge Gorsuch on the bench?   My friend, the majority leader, has said several times that Judge  Gorsuch will be confirmed by the end of this week one way or another.  What he really means when he says that is, if Judge Gorsuch does not  earn 60 votes in the Senate, which is now the likely outcome, the  Republicans must--underline ``must''--exercise the nuclear option to  pass Judge Gorsuch on a simple majority vote.   I think the majority leader reasons that if he says it enough times,  folks  [[Page S2161]]  will start believing it--that he has no choice--but they should not. It  is a premise no one should swallow. The majority leader is setting up a  false choice of supporting Judge Gorsuch or he will have no choice but  to break the rules. Maybe, to the majority leader, the nuclear option  is the only option, but there are many alternatives. The majority  leader makes up his mind independent of what Democrats do on issue  after issue, but on this one, he says he has no choice. Maybe he has no  choice because the rightwing of the Republican Party--organizations  like the Heritage Foundation--will go after him if he does not, but he  certainly has a choice to do the right and courageous thing.   Instead, Republicans are playing the game of ``they started it.''  They say Democrats started this process by changing the rules for lower  court nominees in 2013. They fail to mention the history that led to  that change. The reason that Majority Leader Reid changed the rules was  that Republicans had ramped up the use of the filibuster to historic  proportions.   They filibustered 79 nominees in the first 4 years of President  Obama's Presidency. To put that in perspective, prior to President  Obama, there were 68 filibusters on nominations under all other  Presidents--from George Washington to George Bush. Under President  Obama, exclusively, in the first 4 years of his administration,  Republicans filibustered 79 nominees. They deliberately kept open the  DC Court of Appeals because it has such influence over decisions that  are made by the government.   We all know the hard-right Federalist Society and the hard-right  Heritage Foundation want to limit what government can do. The deal we  made in 2005--a group of Senators, the so-called Gang of 14--allowed  several of the most conservative jurists in the land to become judges  and be confirmed to that circuit court. Yet, when President Obama came  in, our Republican colleagues insisted on holding three seats of that  court open. They, literally, said that they would not allow the seats  to be filled at all by President Obama.   Sound familiar? Merrick Garland knows it is.   At the time, I pleaded several times with Senator Alexander, my dear  friend from Tennessee, to let us vote on some of the judges for the DC  Circuit. I asked him to go to Senator McConnell and say that the  pressure on our side to change the rules after all of these filibusters  was going to be large. Let's avoid it, I said. But Senator McConnell  said no.   Republicans had refused all of our overtures to break the deadlock  that they had imposed. So if the majority leader wants to conduct this  partisan ``they started it'' exercise, I am sure we could trace it all  the way back to the Burr-Hamilton duel.   The fact is that the Republicans blocked Merrick Garland by using the  most unprecedented maneuvers. Now we are likely to block Judge Gorsuch,  and that means neither party has gotten its party's choice in the last  2 years.   We can go back and forth and blame each other, but in the recent  history of the vacancy caused by Justice Scalia's death, we have both  lost. We lost Merrick Garland because of the majority leader's  unprecedented blockade, and Republicans will lose on Judge Gorsuch  because we are doing something we think is reasonable in asking that he  be able to earn 60 votes as so many others have. We think the two are  not equivalent, but in either case, we have both lost.   We are back to square one, and Republicans have total freedom of  choice in this situation. No one is forcing them to break the rules.  They don't have to treat the nuclear option as if it were their first  and only option. It is a false choice.   To my friends on the other side, the answer isn't to change the  rules; the answer is to change the nominee. Presidents of both parties  have done so in the past when Supreme Court picks failed to merit  confirmation. Again, the answer isn't to change the rules; the answer  is to change the nominee.   The majority leader should have the vision and courage to see past  this impasse, and I believe he should seriously consider a different  option. The President, Senate Republicans, and Democrats should sit  down together to come up with a mainstream nominee who can earn  bipartisan support. We are willing to meet with them anywhere, anytime  to discuss a consensus nominee.   Now, I know my colleagues on the other side will say Judge Gorsuch  was a mainstream nominee and Democrats would never support any judge  nominated by President Trump. We disagree. We probably can't support  any nominee whose sole vetting is by the Heritage Foundation and the  Federalist Society. They were the sole gatekeepers for the Scalia  vacancy, and each is well known to be a rightwing, wealthy special  interest group dedicated to moving the bench way to the right. Their  selection of Judge Gorsuch shows it. Both the New York Times and the  Washington Post did analyses done by experts that showed that Judge  Gorsuch would be a very, very conservative--many would say rightwing-- Justice on the bench. The New York Times said he would be the second  most conservative Justice on the bench--second only to Justice Thomas-- and more conservative than the late Justice Scalia. The Washington Post  actually said he would be the most conservative Justice on the bench,  based on his record--even more conservative than the very, very  conservative Justice Thomas.   In fact, we Democrats have never let special interest groups be the  gatekeeper. We have never said to any special interest group, as  President Trump did: Give us a list, and we will choose from that list.  That is what Republicans did. We have never done it.   In the past, Presidents have done just what we are suggesting for  selecting Supreme Court Justices. President Bill Clinton sought and  took the advice of Republican Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch  in nominating Justices Ginsburg and Breyer instead of Bruce Babbitt.  President Obama took the advice of Republican Senators when he picked  Merrick Garland--a consensus, mainstream nominee.   President Trump, on the other hand, ignored the Senate and only  sought the advice and consent of rightwing special interest groups when  making Supreme Court picks. He was running. He had to shore up his  support on the hard right. So he said: I am outsourcing the entire  selection process to two groups--which, again, are not consensus  groups. They would admit that themselves--the Heritage Foundation and  the Federalist Society. Lo and behold, the process didn't produce a  nominee who could earn 60 votes. By contrast, Justice Ginsburg earned  93 votes and Justice Breyer earned 87.   So we are offering President Trump and our friends on the other side  a way forward. They don't have to break the rules to get a Justice on  the bench. They don't have to break the Senate confirmation process,  fundamentally weakening the constitutional principle of advice and  consent, to get a Justice on the bench. President Trump could simply  consult with Members of both parties to try and come up with a  consensus nominee who could get approved and meet a 60-vote threshold.   The answer, again, isn't to change the rules. It is to change the  nominee.   We Democrats are not going to oppose every Republican nominee. Of  course, we realize a nominee selected this way would not completely  agree with our views, but Judge Gorsuch is so far out of the mainstream  that he isn't able to earn votes to pass the Senate. Even Justices  Roberts and Alito--two very conservative judges--earned a bunch of  Democratic votes, and each got more than 60--one, in his nomination,  and the other, 72 votes in the cloture process.   So the Republicans are free actors. They can choose to go nuclear or  they can sit down with Democrats and find a way forward that preserves  the grand traditions of this body.   The majority leader himself has said the one thing the two leaders  have always agreed upon is to protect the integrity of this  institution. He continued, and this is a direct quote: ``I think we can  stipulate . . . that in the Senate, it takes 60 votes on controversial  matters.''   Mitch McConnell: In the Senate, it takes 60 votes on controversial  matters. He has long stood for that proposition for the many years I  have been here.   A Supreme Court seat, I believe, meets the majority leader's standard  [[Page S2162]]  for 60 votes. I hope that instead of crippling the Senate in a partisan  way--removing that 60-vote threshold for controversial matters like the  Supreme Court--my Republican friends consider the option of working  together to find a solution we can both accept. It may seem like a  novel concept around here, but that option is always on the table.   I yield the floor.
