 Madam Speaker, I rise today to demand fairness and  transparency from this outrageous impeachment inquiry.   Democrats have been grasping at straws and looking for any excuse to  impeach President Trump. We haven't even held a vote to open an  impeachment inquiry, but Speaker Pelosi and  [[Page H8379]]  Adam Schiff are charging ahead with a secretive kangaroo court behind  closed doors. This is an illegitimate, unfair hearing with no due  process and no charges made.   Adam Schiff has refused to release to the public any of the  transcripts and even refuses to let Members of Congress into the  hearings to hear them.   Their goal has been impeachment since the 2016 election, and they  will use any means to get there. This is the only thing the House is  doing, instead of focusing on the issues that are important to  hardworking Americans across this Nation.   I hope the American people will see this evil abuse of power for what  it is--the Democrats' decision to choose partisan hatred of President  Trump over the welfare of this great Nation.                            ____________________
