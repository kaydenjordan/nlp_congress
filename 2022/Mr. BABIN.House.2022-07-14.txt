 Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 345.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Kelly) for this Special Order.   The Supreme Court's monumental overturn of Roe v. Wade is a milestone  we have been working on for nearly half a century. However, our work  has only just begun.   Since the Court's ruling, pro-abortion extremists have attacked,  vandalized, and even firebombed pregnancy centers and churches across  this country.   Since 2016, pregnancy help centers have saved more than 800,000 lives  by providing critical resources for women and their children. They  should never be forced to operate under the threat of violence from  anarchists who do not value life or our laws.   I have introduced H. Res. 1183, which condemns these attacks and the  domestic terrorists behind them.   We must keep fighting to protect the unborn from those who wish to  extinguish them at all costs.   I am a proud supporter of such an effort, the Heartbeat Protection  Act, which prohibits abortions from the moment a child's heartbeat is  detected. All babies deserve a chance at life, and we must defend that  chance and that life.   My colleagues across the aisle have disturbingly embraced an anti- life agenda so radical that it sadistically enables the murder of  millions.   This week, our colleagues across the aisle are pushing the abortion  on demand until birth act, a bill that legalizes abortion on demand for  any reason and at any time. They don't care that their pro-abortion  agenda fails to align with the views of the majority of Americans--71  percent, to be exact--who support some limitations on abortion.   We cannot and must not remain silent while the lives of the most  innocent among us are threatened to be terminated.   Mr. Speaker, I will always stand for our unborn and firmly stand  against any efforts to promote abortion.
