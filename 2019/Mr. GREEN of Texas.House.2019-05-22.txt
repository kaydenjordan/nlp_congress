 Mr. Speaker, and still I rise, a proud American,  and I rise because I love my country.   Mr. Speaker, as I stand here today, I would call to the attention of  those who are within the view of what we are doing the fact that we are  now some 35 days since the Mueller report has been made public. It was  released before that, but it has been made public some 35 days.   This means that, for 35 days now, this administration has been above  the law if we allow the genesis of the start to be the date that the  report was issued to the public, made public.   The Mueller report is clear: The President was not exonerated when it  comes to obstruction of justice. The Mueller report, in essence, has  given this Congress the opportunity to fulfill its constitutional  responsibility. That responsibility is to take up the cause of justice.   The Framers of the Constitution intended for the Congress of the  United States of America to be the place where the balance of power is  maintained. We are the check on the President, such that we can  maintain the balance of power. It was never intended that there be a  concentration of power within the executive branch to the extent that  it is being concentrated by virtue of the actions of this President.   Allow me to explain.   This President has refused to honor subpoenas.   He has encouraged witnesses not to appear.   He has encouraged persons to avoid the responsibility that they have  as holders of public trust, the Secretary of the Treasury to produce  documents.   He is engaging and is encouraging others to engage in a coverup. This  is a coverup. We, the Members of this august body, have a duty and a  responsibility not to allow this coverup to continue.   When we took our oath of office, we said, by and through that oath,  that we would defend this Constitution. Article II, Section 4 of the  Constitution accords us the power to check the President so as to  maintain the balance of power. When we refuse to do so or if we decline  to do so or if we just don't, for  [[Page H4070]]  whatever reasons, do so, we are not living up to our responsibilities.   Article II, Section 4 deals with impeachment. It is time for this  Congress to start the impeachment process. I have been very adamant  about this. I stand where I have stood now for more than 2 years. I  have been said to be the voice of impeachment in the Congress. I am not  the voice. The Members of this body will be the voice of impeachment  when and if we take it up, and I assure you we will. If nobody else  does, I will.    But the point is, this is our moment. This is what we have been  mandated to do, to bring impeachment before the House of  Representatives, especially given that we said we would wait until the  Mueller report was finished, and then we would act.   Well, time has lapsed, and this is the time for us to act. We are the  Members who can make the difference. This is the Congress of the United  States of America.   Let me add this. I know these are difficult times for a good many  persons and there are those who question whether we should do this  given what the Senate may do. Well, we do a lot of things knowing that  the Senate will not act as we would have them act. We send bills to the  Senate quite routinely knowing that the Senate will reject these bills.   But it is our responsibility to act, and we then allow the Senate to  do its job. If the Senate chooses not to, that is on the Senate. The  House will have performed its responsibility.   So let us not be guided by political expediency, the question of  whether the Senate is going to act. Let us stand on the moral  imperative that we have to act.   Some have said that the soul of the country is at risk. Well, the  truth is this, before the soul of the country is lost, the soul of the  House of Representatives will be lost if we do not act on this moral  imperative.   This is what we must do to maintain the House of Representatives'  integrity and its prowess as a coequal branch of the government, which  some say has a little bit more authority than the executive by virtue  of its having a check on the executive.   Mr. Speaker, each day that I come, I will show the amount of time  that has lapsed during which this administration is engaged in a  coverup and is above the law.    Madam Chair, I thank the chair of the full  committee. I am honored to have this opportunity to speak in support of  this bill.   This bill addresses a concern that many of us on the Financial  Services Committee have had to deal with for some time now, and it is  the question of whether the committee is going to allow the CFPB to  protect consumers from unscrupulous behavior or to protect Big  Business. I am a person who believes that we should protect the  consumer.   This legislation will allow the persons who receive student loans to  avoid being placed into costly repayment plans that will cause them to  pay more money and possibly default. It will cause consumers looking to  open a new checking account to have the opportunity to do so with a  bank that has the least amount of overdraft fees. It will allow persons  who are seeking credit cards to have the right to seek relief through  the courts, not through some boilerplate language that they might find  in a contract that will not benefit them.   This is the opportunity that we must take advantage of to protect  consumers. It is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, not the  financial institutions protection bureau.   So with this said, I wholeheartedly endorse what the chairperson has  brought to the attention of this Congress. These are remedies that are  absolutely necessary, and I plan to vote and encourage my colleagues to  vote in support of this legislation.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I am honored to present amendment  No. 17, which deals with consumer choice. It deals with whether  consumers will be forced into arbitration or whether they will have the  choice of having arbitration or litigation.   With litigation, the consumer can have the choice of having the case  presented as one person or as part of a group.   This amendment is one that the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act  called to our attention by way of a study that was required.   After performing the study, the CFPB issued a final rule to regulate  the use of mandatory arbitration clauses. In so doing, it was something  that we believed would have been beneficial to consumers. Yet, before  the rule could take effect, it was rescinded by Congress in November  2017.   My amendment offers a direct, straightforward solution. It simply  reinstates the CFPB final rule, a rule that was the product of a  careful study. It was analyzed properly. It was done by way of  stakeholder consensus.   My belief is that this rule will reinstate a law that will give  consumers choice as opposed to forced administration.   Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Cartwright).    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Doggett)  [[Page H4104]]         Madam Chair, how much time do I have remaining?    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, who has the right to close?    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Chair, this is a consumer's dream come true because it gives  the consumer choice.   It does not deny the business owner, the credit card company, or the  bank the opportunity to have arbitration. What it does is it allows the  consumer to have the choice to either elect to have arbitration or to  go to litigation, and when litigating, the consumer can litigate as an  individual.                                time  1545    When I was a judge of a small claims court, I had many persons who  were litigating their cases before me. I also understand that there are  times when people believe that they should have lawyers to represent  them. It is not unusual for businesses to have lawyers to represent  them. In fact, businesses have lawyers on call to represent them 24  hours a day.   Why can consumers not have the same opportunity to litigate that  businesses have to litigate? That is what this is all about. My  colleague, on the other side, would simply have consumers have no  choice, go to arbitration only, and then, possibly, gain some  emolument.   My belief is that consumers ought to have choice. That is what this  amendment is about.   Madam Chair, this is part of the reason why consumers are so angry  with this Congress. We deny them their constitutional rights, the right  to a trial and the right to make a determination for themselves as to  whether or not they will engage in arbitration or litigation.   Consumers should have choices. Businesses have choices. Consumers  should have no less than what businesses have.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
