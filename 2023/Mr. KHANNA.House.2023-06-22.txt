 Mr. Speaker, there are 45 million Americans waiting on  the Supreme Court decision to see if their student loans will be  forgiven.   Let me be clear: We cannot continue the resolution of student loan  payments until we make good on our promise to forgive them. If students  are having to pay student loans in September, they will then have less  money to spend, and it will hurt us and possibly drive us into a  recession.   Under the Higher Education Act, the President has the authority, and  he should exercise that authority to make sure students aren't repaying  their loans come this September, regardless of what the Supreme Court  does.                            ____________________
