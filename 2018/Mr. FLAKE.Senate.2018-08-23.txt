 Mr. President, have you heard the one about the three  robots that walk into a bar? No, you haven't. It is not a joke but  rather a project that has been paid for, in part, by the Department of  Defense.   These robots, called beer bots--and you will see a depiction here-- are programmed to serve cold beers to graduate students. Researchers  say programming methods used for beer bots can be applied to other  multi-robot systems in restaurants and bars. As you can see, the  private sector has already developed robot bartenders, or robartenders.  They have been mixing drinks at bars--and even on cruise ships--for  years now.   With our national debt now exceeding $21 trillion, taxpayers should  not have to pick up the Pentagon's tab for beer bots and for many other  unnecessary spending items which are in the bill that we are  considering right now. This minibus bill provides over $800 billion in  funding to the Departments of Defense, Labor, Health and Human  Services, and Education. Yet, over the past 3 days, we have considered  just four amendments to the bill, and not a single one has offered a  reduction in spending--not a single one.   I have introduced a handful of commonsense amendments that if  adopted, would reduce Federal spending by nearly $500 million. One  would limit funding for the Littoral Combat Ship Program, which has  been plagued by cost growth, construction issues, and underperformance  on mission effectiveness. Even though the Navy has only requested  funding for the procurement of one of these ships, this bill has  needlessly provided funding for two ships.   My amendment would simply reduce the Department of Defense's budget  by $475 million to align with the Navy's request.   I understand that Senators are trying to protect jobs in their States  by forcing the Navy to procure more of these unwanted ships. Sailors  are going on longer and longer deployments because the ships that are  actually needed to rotate them on are not ready to sail. It is  important to remember that the priority of this bill is not the  parochial interests of Members of Congress but, rather, the needs of  the Armed Forces.   I am proposing an amendment under this bill to also keep the costs of  the military parade that the President would like to put on next year  at a reasonable amount. Recent reports have indicated that local DC  officials claim the parade would cost up to $92 million, which is  significantly higher than the $10 to $30 million originally estimated  by the White House Office of Management and Budget Director, Mick  Mulvaney.   I should point out that the last military parade was held in 1991 to  celebrate the end of the gulf war. That cost about $8 million. The  Federal Government paid $3 million, and the remainder was paid by  private donations.   My amendment would cap the amount of money DOD would have to allocate  for the parade to $15 million. That is a significant growth--far more  than inflation--over the past parade that was held in 1991, and I think  this is reasonable, and I think most of us would.   Another amendment I filed would prohibit the Department of Health and  Human Services from subsidizing the construction of fast food  franchises. You might wonder, what in the world is Health and Human  Services doing subsidizing this? And you would be right to question it.   A Healthy Lifestyles Initiative, funded with more than $1.1 million  in grants from HHS, is subsidizing fast food franchises in a Kansas  county that year after year ranks as one of the State's most unhealthy.  This is Health and Human Services, by the way. Grants are supporting  the construction of two buildings--a combination Wendy's and Pizza Hut  and a stand-alone Dunkin' Donuts.   This project contradicts the mission of HHS, which is ``to enhance  and protect the health and well-being of all Americans.'' Federal  nutrition guidelines recommend the consumption of about 2,500 calories  per day for males and 2,000 calories for females. Just one Dunkin's  doughnut contains 290 or more calories. Wendy's Dave's triple burger  contains 1,090 calories. A side of french fries adds another 400. A  medium-sized soda is another 300 calories. A single slice of pepperoni  pizza from Pizza Hut contains 370 calories.   Despite the source of funding, the executive director of the  organization overseeing the project admits that ``this is not a health  initiative,'' arguing that it is about ``economic health, not physical  health.'' Why in the world is the Department of Health and Human  Services spending money--taxpayer money--on these types of initiatives?  It is really just corporate welfare for 3 of the top 10 most profitable  fast food franchises in the United States, each of which earns billions  of dollars a year in profits. Why is the Federal Government subsidizing  it?   I am disappointed that I am unable to call up any of my amendments  and debate the merits of these items and the importance of addressing  our out-of-control debt. We need to get serious about how we are  spending taxpayer money. We need to open up the amendment process and  allow real debate on our national priorities.   I do appreciate the Appropriations Committee's willingness to  consider including my amendment to prohibit further Pentagon funding of  robot bartenders in the managers' package. I hope it stays in the  package. At the very least, this may be the last call for the beerbots.   I yield back.    Mr. President, I want to rise briefly to address something  that happened overnight that the President tweeted with regard to South  Africa. I serve as chairman of the Africa Subcommittee on the Foreign  Relations Committee. The President tweeted the following:         I have asked Secretary of State @SecPompeo to closely study       the South Africa land and farm seizures and expropriations       and large scale killing of farmers. ``South African       Government is now seizing land from white farmers.''    I think it is important for the President, if he is going to conduct  foreign policy by tweet, to be more careful and to not base something  on one news report. These things matter.   South Africa is, in fact, the ruling party and has proposed land  reform measures in South Africa's Parliament. I hope they think long  and hard about some of the proposals that are coming forward and not  mimic what happened in Zimbabwe 15 years ago that Zimbabwe is still  recovering from. In my view, this would not be a good road to take, to  expropriate land without compensation. Having said that, it is simply a  proposal. It has not been implemented.   On the second part of that, ``There is a large scale killing of  farmers,'' there is no evidence to suggest there is a large-scale  killing of farmers. Of course, the death of one farmer is too many, but  it is wrong to suggest there is somehow a large-scale killing going on,  when the evidence suggests that the number of farmers who have been  killed over the past year is about one-third the level that was reached  in the 1990s.   I would encourage the President to be more careful when he tweets, to  not conduct foreign policy by tweet, and to certainly say to our South  African friends--a new government we are working with on a number of  issues, with which we have a good relationship and want to remain close  to--that we in the Congress believe we are their friends, and we want  to move forward in ways that will bring the best to South Africans and  a good partnership with our country.   I yield back.
