 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about  evapotranspiration.   Perhaps you are not used to getting a mini Earth science lesson on  the floor of the House, but hear me out for a minute.   Nevada boasts 300 sunny days a year. It is great for hiking and  biking, not so great when it comes to precipitation and our growing  severe drought. But we can't just rely on precipitation data in  understanding our drought because we are losing water with all of our  sunny days.   Evapotranspiration, or ET, is the combination of water lost through  evaporation from the land and transpiration from plants. It is a  critical measurement that we need to plan for the future of western  water.   Until recently, and frankly, to my surprise, water managers could not  access this data. But a group of scientists, academics, advocacy  organizations, and even corporations are working to change that.   OpenET is filling the biggest data gap in water management by giving  everyone access to ET data, and I mean everyone. You can Google it and  pull it right up on your computer.   From water managers, to utility providers, to farmers and ranchers,  to conservationists, this data will help folks across the West make  better water decisions to protect our most vital resource for decades  to come.   That is exactly why I have introduced the bipartisan, bicameral Open  Access Evapotranspiration Act with Senator Cortez Masto to fill these  critical data gaps and inform drought solutions across the West.   I am all in when it comes to finding solutions for Nevada's drought.  We must explore every option and make these investments before it is  too late.                     The Time Is Now to Lower Drug Prices     Mr. Speaker, I rise today as we continue to  negotiate the Build Back Better Act.   When I ran for Congress, I promised my constituents that I would do  everything to fight for lower drug prices.   Over and over again in townhalls, I hear from my constituents that  they are so extremely worried about how they are going to pay for  prescription drugs. In fact, one in five seniors reports not taking  their medicines as prescribed because of the cost. I have even heard  from constituents who say they skip meals so they can afford the  prescriptions they need to stay healthy.   This is outrageous. I urge my colleagues to address this problem with  the urgency it deserves.   With the Build Back Better agenda, we have a once-in-a-generation  opportunity to change the status quo and make good on our promise that  no one should have to choose between affording their prescription  drugs, or putting food on the table, or paying rent.   We must enact legislation to lower the cost of prescription drugs.  The time is now. Our constituents all over this country are counting on  us.                            ____________________
