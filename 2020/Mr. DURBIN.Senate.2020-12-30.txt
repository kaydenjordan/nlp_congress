 Mr. President, I listened carefully and watched three  occasions on the floor this afternoon where Senators Schumer, Sanders,  and Markey have tried to create an opportunity where the Senate would  actually come together and vote, where the Senate might make a decision  based on the merits of this issue, rather than to keep talking around  the issue.   What is at stake is a substantial sum of money for families who are  in the midst of the struggle of their lives--$2,000--characterized a  few moments ago by my friend from Texas as ``Speaker Pelosi's idea.''  Well, I might remind him that it is also Donald Trump's idea and still  is. The President has told us this morning that we should move on this  as quickly as possible, and although I don't often come to the floor to  agree with the President, he is right. In this instance he is clearly  right.   What are we doing now? We are calling Senators back to Washington  from the far reaches across the United States. This morning, I received  some email and text messages from some of my colleagues hopping on  airplanes at 6 a.m. on the west coast to face a vote. What is this vote  all about? Well, first, it is to override the veto of the President  when it comes to the Defense authorization bill. This was certainly  something that was occasioned by one Senator, the junior Senator from  Kentucky, who forced us into a position where that vote needed to be  taken here. It could have been handled much more efficiently and to the  benefit of all Members if it was scheduled for the weekend when we were  assuming a new session of Congress. But he insisted, and we are  returning and, frankly, putting in peril again, in the midst of a  pandemic, Members of the Senate who are traveling from all the far  reaches of this country to be part of this action in Washington   But it isn't just the junior Senator from Kentucky who is having us  sit here in Washington and wait for things that could be taken care of  with dispatch. It is the senior Senator from Kentucky as well. He has  decided that we will not get a vote on the House measure to increase  the payments to $2,000. Make no mistake, there is only one way to bring  this relief to the families of America. It is to pass the bill already  enacted by the House of Representatives--a bill which received 44  Republican votes in addition to a substantial number of Democrats, with  only 2 voting no. Forty-four Republican votes joined with the Democrats  to call for this measure which many have been decrying on the floor  here as a class struggle or whatever their argument might be. There is  no other measure, including Senator McConnell's alternative, which has  any ghost of a chance to help the families in this country with this  $2,000 benefit. The only thing that will do it--the only one thing that  will do it--is this bill that has already passed the House of  Representatives.   The House has recessed. When they are going to return is uncertain.  They certainly don't have the time to work through the regular order of  business to consider any new legislation even if we could send it in  time, which I believe is very doubtful. So it is up to Senator  McConnell to decide right here and now, are we going to come together  as a Senate this afternoon at 5 o'clock, when we are supposed to be  back and voting, and get this matter done?   Bring it to the Senate for a vote. Let's have this vote up or down,  and let the Democrats and Republicans express their will on behalf of  the families in this country.   I couldn't agree more with the Senator from Massachusetts and his  characterization of what families face across this country and,  certainly, in my home State of Illinois.   I just wonder if any of the Republican Senators who are downplaying  this economic crisis facing these families have really looked into the  issue. This morning, in the Senator's home State of Texas, they showed  an early morning television show and the cars that were lining up for  food banks--long lines of people waiting for food banks. They  interviewed some of them in Texas who told heartbreaking stories of how  they once were volunteers at this same food bank and are now dependent  for a helping hand if they were going to be able to feed their  families.   These are people who are not lazy at all. Misfortune has come their  way, and the question is, Will we help? This is our opportunity--today.  It is a measure that has passed the House of Representatives, not some  theory of some legislation that might be considered tomorrow--today.  Let's have this vote today, this evening. When the Senators have  returned, let's determine whether or not this House-passed measure of  $2,000 is going to be enacted into law, since the President is clearly  anxious to sign it.   That to me is the reasonable thing to do. In fact, it might even  sound like the U.S. Senate is taking a vote on a timely issue after a  debate. We do it so seldom around here that I think we have lost our  muscle memory when it comes to this activity in the Senate. It is time  to return to it.   I thank the Senator from Vermont, the Senator from Massachusetts,  and, of course, the Democratic leader for bringing this issue before us  this afternoon. But it shouldn't end with our great speeches. It ought  to end with an important vote for the people of this country.    I am happy to yield.    I would say in response to my colleague, I know his  passionate defense of the notion for immunity from liability for  corporations in America. He has introduced a lengthy bill on the  subject. I don't believe that is consistent with keeping this Nation  safe during a pandemic, and it certainly is not responsive to any  onslaught of lawsuits.   The Senator might be interested to know that the number of medical  malpractice cases filed in the name of COVID-19 since the onset of this  current pandemic is slightly higher than the total number of lawsuits  filed by Donald Trump in protesting the results of the November 3  election. This is not a tsunami of lawsuits.   I believe we can take reasonable measures to support and defend those  corporations and companies that are making a good-faith effort to  comply with public health standards and protect their employees and  customers. His bill, I am afraid, goes way too far    Mr. President, I yield for a question through the Chair.   I have listened to the figures used on the floor about families who  would qualify for the $2,000. It is my understanding that an individual  with an income of $75,000 or less could qualify for the $2,000 payment,  and for a joint return--husband and wife--$2,000 could be given to them  if their income is under $150,000. Is that your understanding?    I announce that the Senator from Alabama (Mr. Jones) is  necessarily absent.    Mr. President, as we work to combat the COVID-19  pandemic, we must not forget our Nation's epidemic of gun violence that  kills over 100 Americans every day.   Even during the holiday season, the deadly toll of shootings has  continued.   On the day after Christmas, a gunman opened fire at a bowling alley  restaurant in Rockford, IL, killing three and wounding three more.  Mayor Tom McNamara has shown real leadership in this crisis. I ask  unanimous consent that his statement be printed in the Record following  my remarks.   Thomas Furseth, Dennis Steinhoff, and Jerome Woodfork were murdered  in that shooting. Among the wounded victims were a 14-year-old boy and  a 16-year-old girl.   We mourn the lives we lost and pray for all the victims and their  families.   We also give thanks to the first responders who so often rush toward  the sound of gunfire so they can save as many lives as they can.   In this case, officers from the Rockford Police Department arrived at  the scene within 1 minute of the 911 calls and took the shooter into  custody. Their conduct may sound routine to some, but make no mistake,  their lives were at risk, and their courage was exceptional. We should  never take the valor of so many in law enforcement for granted.   In the city of Chicago, at least 30 people were shot, 8 fatally,  during the Christmas weekend.   The victims included a 57-year-old man who was killed while driving  in his car, a young man killed while standing in a park at 9 in the  morning, and a 24-year-old woman killed while sitting in a parked car.   We mourn these victims and pray for their families and for the  wounded. But we must also dedicate ourselves to reducing these deadly  shootings and to making our streets, our schools, and our neighborhoods  safer.   This is a national problem. According to the Gun Violence Archive, on  Christmas Day and the day after, there were six mass shootings across  the country, defined as an incident where at least four people were  shot. There have been 23 such shootings so far in December. Has this  wanton, deadly violence become so routine that we are numb to it until  it touches our homes and our families?   We must do better. Have we become so indifferent to gun violence in  America that Senators in the highest legislative body in our land  refuse to try to make our Nation safer? We must work for reforms like  universal background checks and cracking down on illicit gun  trafficking. And we must work to support children and families who have  faced violent trauma and to address disparities in healthcare and  economic opportunity that contribute to increased violence.   Too many funerals, too many tears, too many lives lost to the scourge  of gun violence.   We must do better.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record. as follows:         Email From Rockford Mayor Tom McNamara Re Dec. 26 Shooting         Dear Friend,        As we all know, it has been such a difficult year and now a       tragic week for our city. Last Saturday, three people lost       their lives in a horrific and random act of violence at Don       Carter Lanes, a long-time anchor of our community. Three       others sustained serious injuries in the attack, with two of       them still fighting for their lives. As we move to the       conclusion of what has already been an arduous year, we find       ourselves coming together to support the families who lost       their loved ones, the survivors and their families, and the       employees and owners of Don Carter Lanes.        Don Carter Lanes is a staple in Rockford and has been for       decades. It's a family-owned business that hosts tournaments,       charity fundraisers, birthday parties and also is a long-time       supporter of our business community. This is a difficult time       for owner Brad Sommer, the employees, and the entire bowling       family. I know we will come together as a community to       support them during this time.        Rockford is at its best when times are tough and already       we've seen examples of this in the wake of Saturday night's       incident. The Rockford Police officers who responded within       one minute of the first 911 call are heroes who ran toward       the danger. They entered the building quickly and without       hesitation to protect lives and apprehend the suspect. We       should all be grateful for their actions.                             GoFundMe Fundraiser         While working through the trauma of this incident, the       owners of Don Carter Lanes set up a GoFundMe fundraiser to       benefit the shooting victims and families. You can donate by       visiting: https://gofund.me/62caa4df.                       Illinois Bank & Trust Care Fund         And, Miracle Mile Rockford, a business association serving       owners, neighborhood groups and residents in the area around       Don Carter Lanes, has set up a care fund in partnership with       Illinois Bank & Trust to accept donations to benefit the       families impacted by the shootings. IBT has begun the fund       with a generous $5,000 donation and community donations can       be made at any IBT location or via online or mobile banking.

Thank you for your continued support of my work as your mayor       and for your support of our great city.        Tom                            ____________________
