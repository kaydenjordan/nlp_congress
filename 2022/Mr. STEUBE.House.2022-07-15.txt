 Madam Speaker, let me address the complete  misrepresentations of fact that we have been hearing from Democrats  since Roe has been overturned.   There has never been a constitutional right to end the life of an  innocent, unborn child--never. It doesn't exist in the Constitution,  and Congress has never passed a law allowing for the murder of the  unborn. In fact, the opposite exists.   In the Fifth and 14th Amendments to the Constitution, there is a  constitutional right for any person to not be deprived of life,  liberty, or property.   Certainly, an unborn child is a person. What else could it be?  Therefore, that person shall not be deprived of life pursuant to the  Constitution, period.   Finally, the U.S. Supreme Court got it right and made it clear that  ``the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion.''   Over 63 million children have been murdered since Roe was decided.  That is not freedom. That is genocide.
