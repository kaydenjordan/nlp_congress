 Mr. President, during the Obama years, many of the  hard-working men and women of America's middle class felt completely  forgotten. Paychecks often did not keep pace with rising costs.  Opportunities for work could often seem bleak. For those men and women,  the promise of a hard-earned retirement seemed to drift further and  further away. For so many middle-class Americans, the last decade meant  a weak economy and a decline of opportunities. People of this Nation  deserve better. They deserve larger paychecks, more jobs, and better  opportunities to get ahead.   This Congress is committed to helping the economy live up to its full  potential once again, which is exactly why we are committed to passing  tax reform. This is our once-in-a-generation opportunity to overhaul a  broken tax code that holds us back and replace it with something that  actually works for the hard-working people of our country. It  represents the single most important thing we can do today to get our  economy back on the right track.   Working together, President Trump, his team, and the tax-writing  committees in Congress have developed the framework that will help us  get there. Here is what it envisions:   For American workers, we want to make your taxes lower, simpler, and  fairer. We want to take more money out of Washington's pockets and put  more in yours.   Helping individuals and families succeed is the first aim of tax  reform. Helping businesses succeed is the second aim, so we can help  create more jobs and keep them right here in America.   American businesses, both large and small, face an increasingly  competitive global economy. We want to put American businesses and  workers on a level playing field because when they are, they can win.   We want to help bring jobs and profits back home, and once they are  here, we want to give businesses the right incentives to keep them  right here in America.   We want to unleash the potential of the American economy--helping you  keep more of the money in your paycheck, helping businesses grow and  workers succeed, helping move the economy into high gear so we can  sustain real prosperity into the future for America's middle class.   These are the kinds of ideas that should be shared by everyone,  Republicans and Democrats alike. Our friends across the aisle supported  the need for tax reform for many years. They used to advocate it  loudly. But the tone seems to be different now. What changed? The  President, or so it would seem.   We know that our Democratic friends are under immense pressure from  the hard left to oppose everything this President touches, but I hope  they can resist that pressure and do what they know is right. After  all, shouldn't we all support cutting middle-class taxes, helping small  businesses, and bringing jobs and investments back to our country?   I was always under the impression that Democrats wanted to end  corporate offshoring, eliminate loopholes for the wealthy, and cut  middle-class taxes. Well, these are all aspects of the current tax  reform framework. So there is no need for our friends to invent reasons  to justify opposing tax reform. There is no reason to launch attacks on  the tax reform framework based on made-up details that aren't actually  in it. Tax reform has been a bipartisan effort in the past. It can be,  and it should be, again now.   It is up to our Democratic friends to decide if they would like to  engage in a serious way. I personally hope they will join us in  advancing this important initiative for our country. I think we owe at  least that much to the millions of Americans who felt forgotten over  the last decade.   Tax reform can help move our economy into high gear. It can help  deliver more jobs, higher wages, and increased opportunities for the  American people. The men and women of this country deserve it, which is  why I am committed  [[Page S6328]]  to keeping up the work to get tax reform accomplished.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following  leader remarks on Tuesday, October 17, the Senate proceed to the  consideration of Calendar No. 191, the nomination of David Trachtenberg  to be Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense.
