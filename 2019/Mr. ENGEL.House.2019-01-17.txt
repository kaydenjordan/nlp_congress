 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  joint resolution (H.J. Res. 30) disapproving the President's proposal  to take an action relating to the application of certain sanctions with  respect to the Russian Federation.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.   The text of the joint resolution is as follows:                                H.J. Res. 30         Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the       United States of America in Congress assembled, Congress       disapproves of the action relating to the application of       sanctions imposed with respect to the Russian Federation       proposed by the President in the report submitted to Congress       under section 216(a)(1) of the Russia Sanctions Review Act of       2017 on December 19, 2018, relating to terminating sanctions       imposed on En+ Group plc (``En+''), UC Rusal plc (``Rusal''),       and JSC EuroSibEnergo (``ESE'').     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5  [[Page H693]]  legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.J. Res. 30, disapproving the  President's proposal on certain sanctions on the Russian Federation,  under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, it is regrettable that we are in this situation. It is  the result of the Trump administration, again, trying to make an end  run around Congress on an issue as important as Russia sanctions.   On December 19 of last year, the Treasury Department notified  Congress of its intention to relax sanctions against three corporations  tied to Oleg Deripaska, a Russian oligarch and close associate of  Vladimir Putin. The Trump administration may have a perfectly  legitimate reason for easing those sanctions. But the reason we are on  the floor today is that we just don't know. And, under the law, we have  very little time left to get the answers we need.   The sanctions we are dealing with today were imposed under CAATSA-- the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act--the bill we  passed 1\1/2\ years ago to, among other things, slap sanctions on  Vladimir Putin's cronies.   The law is written so that Congress would be able to step in if we  thought any administration could be making a mistake in waiving or  easing sanctions. The Republican majority at the time wrote strict and  complex provisions for exercising that oversight, allowing only 30 days  to pass a measure that could reverse such a decision.   Again: the Trump administration announced its plans to ease these  sanctions on December 19, 30 days ago, in the middle of the holidays,  just before the President shut the government down, at the end of the  last Congress, and before committees in this Congress have had a chance  to organize and look into this very serious issue. This timing leads me  to believe that the administration was trying to jam this decision  through so Congress would not be able to act.   We ask the administration to explain this decision. Their answers  were, frankly, inadequate. We asked the administration to pump the  brakes on easing these sanctions so we could review the decision  further. They simply wouldn't.   So, with that 30-day window closing, we are now forced to bring this  measure to the floor to try to block the decision. It is too bad,  really. I would rather the administration respected Congress enough to  allow us the time to address our concerns. And, again, the rules for  this were put into effect by the Republican majority in the last  Congress, and they are good rules. I would rather they hadn't dropped  this announcement when they did--that is the White House--so that our  committees could hold hearings and do our work the way we want to.   But with the threat that Russia poses to the United States, to our  friends and allies, to democracy around the world, Congress cannot just  look the other way when the administration rushes a decision like this.  There are too many open questions about whether Deripaska will still  control the companies that these sanctions address.   So, we need to move this resolution of disapproval before the clock  runs out, and I ask all Members on both sides of the aisle to support  it today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Connolly), who is a valued member of the Foreign Affairs  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Virginia.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Neal), the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee  and my classmate in Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Schiff), the chairman of the important Intelligence  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from California.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Waters) the chair of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Doggett).                                time  1145     Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Doggett) an additional 15 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Connecticut (Mr. Himes).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), who is our majority leader and the author of this  joint resolution.    Mr. Speaker, might I inquire of the gentleman from Texas  if he is prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, let me first say to Mr. McCaul that I am very happy to  hear those words come out of his mouth. As you know, we have had a  tradition of bipartisanship on the Foreign Affairs Committee with  Chairman Royce and myself, and now with me as chairman and Mr. McCaul.  So I want to thank the gentleman from Texas for speaking out forcefully  and saying the right thing.   That is why Congress overwhelmingly passed sanctions on Russia in  2017, because Members of both parties understand the threat that Russia  and Putin pose. From the illegal annexation of Crimea to the war in  eastern Ukraine to the support to Bashar al Assad to the attack on our  own democracy in 2016, Russia is clearly a major adversary that needs  to be dealt with strongly.   So when we see the administration--and I would say this about any  administration, Democrat or Republican--when the administration appears  to go easy on one of Putin's closest pals, we understandably have  serious questions. We need to see the whole picture, and right now we  are not.   Congress cannot be left out of decisions this important. That is  something I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle understand,  and I hope we can send the administration a strong bipartisan message  to that effect. This resolution represents Congress doing our job,  exercising oversight and using checks and balances provided in the  Constitution.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support it, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
