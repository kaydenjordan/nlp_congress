 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Dr. Abraham Lieberman, who  just recently announced his retirement. Dr. Lieberman has been a  practicing neurologist for over 50 years, working at the Barrow  Neurological Institute in Phoenix, Arizona, for much of his career.   Dr. Lieberman dedicated his life to the treatment and eradication of  Parkinson's disease, treating over 40,000 patients, including Muhammad  Ali. He wrote six books on Parkinson's, including ``100 Questions &  Answers About Parkinson's Disease,'' the best-selling book on that  disease.   His work has done an immeasurable amount of good in furthering the  treatment of Parkinson's and to help create a much greater quality of  life for those who have the dreaded disease.   I am pleased that the Barrow Institute has created a way that people  can honor Dr. Lieberman by setting up the Lieberman Legacy Fund so  individuals can donate money towards Parkinson's research and  treatment.   I wish Dr. Lieberman a long and happy retirement with his wife of 50  years, Ina, his 4 children, and 10 grandchildren.   Dr. Lieberman's pursuit to conquer Parkinson's has endeared him to  his patients, with his personalized touch to each and every one of  them. He has become an iconic pillar of excellence in medicine.   Your patients are so grateful. Thank you, Dr. Lieberman.  [[Page H9749]]                                ____________________
