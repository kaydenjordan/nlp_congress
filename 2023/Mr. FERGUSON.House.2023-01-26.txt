 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my friend, Chief Lou  Dekmar, from LaGrange, Georgia, on his well-deserved retirement.   For 50 years, Chief Dekmar has protected and defended our communities  as a law enforcement officer. He has long been a hero in the community,  protecting the lives of citizens as well as fellow officers.   Serving nearly 30 years as police chief in LaGrange, Georgia, Chief  Dekmar's unwavering dedication to ensuring that the folks of Troup  County stayed safe and secure was second to none.   Chief Dekmar embodies the true heart of a leader and his work to heal  the community and establish racial reconciliation in the city were just  a few of the many accomplishments he had throughout his decorated  career.   Mr. Speaker, I thank him for his unbelievable devotion to serving the  people of Georgia and congratulate him on a well-earned retirement.                            ____________________
