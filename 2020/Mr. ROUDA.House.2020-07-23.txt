 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment to H.R.  7608, which highlights the contributions of Vietnamese, Laotian, and  Cambodian immigrants and discourages attempts to increase repatriations  to those countries.   In 2008, the United States reached a formal agreement with Vietnam  which contains specific restrictions on the repatriation of certain  individuals to Vietnam. Under this agreement, any Vietnamese national  who arrived in the United States before our two nations established  formal diplomatic relations on July 12, 1995 is barred from being  repatriated to Vietnam. This provision benefits our communities by  keeping families together and allowing people who have lived here for  decades to continue making a positive impact on their communities.  Under this Administration, there has been a renewed push to increase  deportations to Southeast Asian countries, including the weaponization  of visa sanctions to unilaterally push for broadened repatriation  agreements.   I am proud to represent a community where we honor the thousands of  men, women, and children who arrived in the United States after the  Vietnam War in search of a better life, and I call upon this  Administration to cease attempts to renegotiate repatriation agreements  to allow for greater numbers of repatriations to these countries.   I would like to thank Chairwoman Lowey and the House Committee on  Appropriations for including report language we requested to prevent  the use of funds to negotiate or enter into an agreement with the  Governments of Laos or Vietnam for the repatriation of these  individuals. I also would like to thank my colleagues, Representatives  Alan Lowenthal, Lou Correa, and Zoe Lofgren, for their support of this  amendment and their continued hard work on behalf of Vietnamese and  Southeast Asian American communities.
