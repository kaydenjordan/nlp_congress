 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.   As we speak, communities in southern Illinois are contending with  rising flood waters.   While we may not be able to prevent the water rising, there is a lot  that we can do to help our communities rebuild following a disaster.  Unfortunately, too many rural areas find that the help that they need  is not there for them because of arbitrary Federal rules.   In my district, rural communities suffered significant damage from  the 2015 holiday floods, but did not qualify for assistance because of  these rigid rules. This legislation addresses these problems and ends  the unfair treatment of rural areas.   It is better to ensure that FEMA gives greater weight to localized  disasters when determining assistance.   I support the legislation authorized by my friend and Illinois  colleague, Rodney Davis, and cosponsored by Cheri Bustos, because the  victims shouldn't be punished for living in a small town in a rural  area.
