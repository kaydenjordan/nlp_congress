 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the topic of  this Special Order.    Madam Speaker, I have a lot to say. My  colleague, Mr. Hice, has a lot to do. I am going to yield to Mr. Hice  so that he can speak briefly and go back to his committee.    Madam Speaker, today, my colleagues and  I rise to honor the legislative legacy and the life of my good friend  and colleague and fellow Georgia Bulldog, U.S. Senator Johnny Isakson.   For more than 20 years, Senator Isakson has served the people of  Georgia in the United States Congress, tirelessly fighting for the  people of Georgia.   During his tenure, Senator Isakson has been a bellwether for many in  our delegation, both as a Member of this body and as a United States  Senator. If I have heard it once, I have heard it a thousand times:  Where's Johnny on this? What does Johnny think about this? Have you  spoken to Johnny on this?   He has offered counsel that has been learned through his 40 years of  public service that is invaluable to me and many of us in the Georgia  delegation and throughout this Nation.   I have many personal stories about Johnny, some of them appropriate  for the floor, some of them not. But my first recollection of Senator  Isakson was a call that I made as a young teenager when we had a mutual  friend and I needed a little help getting him through the ballot  process at the fraternity house. Senator Isakson picked up the phone  and called and, a few minutes later, the president of the fraternity  walked in and said: I am not quite sure who spoke to Senator Isakson,  but this is the way the next vote's going to go.   And that was all it took.   I can't tell you, over the last 20, or, I am sorry, I should say 30- plus years, how much you have meant to me and my family. And when I am  back home, I constantly tell the people the respect our delegation and  all the Members of the House and the Senate have for you. You have  brought forward a sense of bipartisanship in working across the aisle  for the good of all Georgians.   He has played a key role in building and maintaining his reputation,  and I look forward to that special tradition continuing in the coming  legislative sessions.   Public service is much more than just the service of the Member; it  is also the service of the family.   Senator Isakson, your children, your wonderful wife, Dianne, we  extend our thanks for their commitment to serve Georgia and their  support of our delegation and fellow delegation members. Their impact  cannot be understated, and we look forward to you enjoying more time  with Dianne and your entire family as you enter your next chapter.   For decades, Senator Isakson and his family have faithfully served  our State. His character, godliness, and  [[Page H9044]]  statesmanship will be greatly missed in Washington, D.C.   His faithful service to the great State of Georgia is second only to  our beloved mascot, Uga. He is a giant among men and dogs, dedicated  and deliberate, and it has been an honor to work alongside him fighting  for the good people of Georgia and the veterans of the United States of  America.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis).    Madam Speaker, I wish all of America  could be here to see that, two icons from Georgia embracing. What a  wonderful sight that I think is representative of the days of the past  and the days to come and how we should work together. Thank you both so  much, not just for what you did, but for who you are.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Graves).    I yield to the gentleman from Georgia  (Mr. Bishop), my friend and colleague.    Madam Speaker, I want to thank Senator  Isakson, as well, for his service to our Nation's veterans and his role  as chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs. He served our  military veterans faithfully for many, many years.   I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins), my friend and  colleague, one of the men who serves us in multiple capacities, both in  the Air Force and as a Member of Congress.    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Collins for  his comments.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. McBath),  my colleague.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman  for her remarks.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Woodall),  my friend and colleague.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Carter), my good friend and colleague.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to how  much time I have remaining.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk), my friend and colleague.    Madam Speaker, I would remind my friend  and colleague that Senator Isakson is a Dawg; he is a Georgia Bulldog.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Ferguson), my colleague, a fellow Bulldog and Georgia  Beta alumni.    Madam Speaker, in the last few minutes,  I want to thank all of my colleagues who joined us this afternoon,  especially   John Lewis, another icon from Georgia.   Certainly, America and the world are better off because of both of  these men. I think the strong bipartisan presence here lends to the  extraordinary impact that Senator Isakson has had on our delegation and  the great respect that we have for his service to our State and our  Nation.   Senator Isakson, I have been told that I can't call you Johnny on the  floor, but if I could, I would say: Johnny, we love you. Thank you for  your service to the great State of Georgia. America and the world are  better places because of the service that you have provided to our  Nation and your fellow man.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
