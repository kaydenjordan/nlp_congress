 Madam Speaker, I rise today with my colleagues to honor  my friend and colleague, Congresswoman Louise Slaughter.   It is inconceivable to me that it has been 1 year since the passing  of this force of nature. I am consoled by knowing that her legacy lives  on in this Chamber.   The brilliant former chair of the powerful Rules Committee was sharp- tongued, sharp-witted, and sharp-eyed.   Everyone who knew her was made better by her presence.   Anyone who came up against her in an argument knew they were facing a  steel backbone, but her disarming sense of humor and southern drawl  were irresistible.   She even taught me how to speak Southern. ``Bless your sweet heart''  doesn't mean bless your sweet heart.   Congresswoman Slaughter knew fake when she saw it and was not afraid  to call it out. She knew truth when she saw it and stood strong in its  defense.   It is in her honor that we must continue to fight for this democracy  that she never gave up on, and I hope that we will consider naming the  Rules Committee room in her honor.   There are many people I like in our Chamber; few, I truly love. I  loved Louise Slaughter.                            ____________________
