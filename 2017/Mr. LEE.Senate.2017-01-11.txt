 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Madam President, I rise today to give voice to some of my  fellow Utahns, including a few of my fellow Utahns who are suffering  because of the health care law passed by this body nearly 7 years ago.  These are not stories from wealthy Utahns who have simply had to pay  higher taxes, nor are these stories from low-income Utahns who already  have insurance through Medicaid.  [[Page S246]]    These are letters are from the too often invisible victims of  ObamaCare--those middle-class families who used to be able to afford  health care when they needed it but are now forced to pay for it and to  pay for what amounts to, in some cases, one of their largest payments  or even their largest payment they make each month for a so-called  insurance plan that never seems to pay out because of high deductibles.   Jenica from Davis County, UT, writes as follows:         I am an ordinary mother raising my kids and striving to       live within my means. For the first time, my family is facing       a year with no health insurance. Our gross income falls a few       hundred dollars per month too high for us to receive help       through CHIP or UPP programs, but we cannot afford to       purchase health insurance through my husband's work or       through the Marketplace. After this year's premium increases,       the most inexpensive plan offered to us on the Marketplace is       a full quarter of our gross income per month (before taxes),       and if we put that into our budget we will not be able to       save any money to pay deductibles as healthcare needs arise.        We face the same problem with my husband's work insurance;       it would be even more expensive, and we cannot wisely budget       a quarter or more of our income toward health insurance       premiums.        I know this problem is not limited to my family, and I want       you to be aware of those of us who are falling in the gap       this year. We earn barely too much to receive any assistance,       but not enough to actually pay for insurance premiums. It       seems the wisest course for us is to withdraw from insurance       and save our money to pay for medical expenses in cash, as       well as saving to pay the fine on our taxes next year.        It is a decision I do not make lightly, as I know that the       insurance companies need more people, not less, to       participate to make the system work. However, my family       cannot afford to participate this year.        I know you will represent us well and take our needs into       consideration as you work with the other members of Congress       to make our country's healthcare system work for all of us.       Thank you for serving our state and our country. May God       bless you in your efforts.    May God bless you, Jenica. May God bless you for having the courage  to write these things down and to share them with your fellow Utahns  and your fellow Americans.   I promised Jenica that I will do everything I can, everything within  my power, to make sure that you and families like yours are not  forgotten when we repeal this law and replace it.   Trevor from St. George, UT, had a similar story. He writes:         I recently got a new job and I'm trying to get healthcare.       None of the 3 plans my employer offers are affordable to me,       even though the government claims they are. Even if I were to       buy the cheapest plan, I would never be able to use it       because of the high deductibles.        I do not qualify for Medicaid, and earn $1,000 per year too       much to qualify for subsidies.        In a nutshell, I can't afford to buy insurance from       anywhere, and by not buying it, I can't afford the penalty       levied by the federal government. What is someone in my       position supposed to do?        The ACA is not helping the very people it was designed to       help and is in fact throwing a terrible burden upon me and my       family. We need a new healthcare system. This one is not       working. Please share my story so that others will be aware       that people in my position (and there are many of us) are       struggling.    I will share your story, Trevor, and soon we will be one step closer  to a new type of system, a system that will put patients and doctors  back in charge of health care decisions rather than having those  decisions made by government bureaucrats in Washington.   The last letter I would like to share today comes from Washington  County, UT. Ron from Washington County writes as follows:         Today I received a letter from my health insurance carrier       indicating that the premium for me and my two kids--yes, only       three people--is increasing from $1,020 per month to $1,706       per month, an increase of slightly over $8,200 per year. My       annual income for 2017 will not be increasing, let alone to       cover eight grand.        Later this afternoon, I am contacting my travel agency (a       local small business) and asking Judy to cease her research       into my family vacation for the summer of 2017. Why would I       cancel my vacation and also take away revenue from a local       small business? The answer is ``67.26%.'' That is the       percentage increase for my health care insurance.        I need you to see that this is real. It greatly and       negatively impacts my family and it subsequently impacts       local businesses as more of my money is drained from the       economy. I make roughly $60,000 per year. My medical premium       is now one third of my gross income! Plus, I still have to       pay out deductibles and copays.        Even the bronze programs, which are worthless, are designed       to bankrupt a family and end up costing more in the long-run,       have exceeded the cost of the mortgage I took out on my St.       George home in 2014. More than my mortgage! Repeat more than       my mortgage. That should send shivers down anyone's spine.        One of the most important aspects of America's middle class       is the ability for a family to purchase a home. Now that       insurance premiums have exceeded the mortgage payment of a       median priced home in the US, I suspect that the dream is now       slipping out of the hands of many Americans.    Ron, you are absolutely right. Thanks to ObamaCare, the American  dream is now slipping out of reach for far too many families throughout  the State of Utah and throughout the entire country. These are not just  the stories of a few isolated Utahns. These are not just stories from a  few statistical outliers. There are fewer affordable options for Utahns  throughout the State.   In 20 out of Utah's 29 counties, Utahns can only choose a health plan  from one insurance company. They have just one company to choose from,  and the options available are not always as robust as they should be.  Within those options that they have, the costs have risen far too much  each year. For 2017 plans, insurance rates across Utah increased at  least 30 percent, on average. This is after multiple years of  substantial premium increases in the other years leading up to this.   Fortunately, help is on the way. Thanks to President-Elect Donald  Trump's victory this November--and thanks to the outcome of House and  Senate races throughout the country--we now have the opportunity to  uproot this ill-conceived health care law, root and branch.   The old system, to be clear, is far from perfect. After we repeal  ObamaCare, we still have much work to do unbundling health care from  employer-provided health insurance so doctors, nurses, patients, and  innovators can do the work of bringing down prices and increasing  quality. That is what happens when we allow the free market to operate.  We get competition. When people compete, two things happen that are  important for consumers: Prices go down and quality goes up.   That is what the American people have come to expect and basically  every other sector of our economy. Sadly, we have seen the opposite  become true with respect to our health care system under ObamaCare  because we have restricted free market forces, and we have impeded  competition. As a result, prices have gone up and quality, in some  cases, has gone tragically down.   Step one involves repealing this health care law. Trevor, Jenica, and  Ron, I want you to know that I hear you. I hear you and I hear all  Utahns who have contacted me to share their experiences with this  health care law. My colleagues in the Senate have heard you too. We  will repeal this health care law and we will bring reform and  competition to our Nation's currently broken health care system.   Madam President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
