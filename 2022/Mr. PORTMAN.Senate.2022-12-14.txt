 Madam President, I am here on the floor to congratulate  my friend from North Carolina, the Tar Heel State.   We go back a few years. He is from Winston-Salem, where my wife is  from. Our spouses actually waitressed together back in Winston-Salem  during high school, and they are still buddies. Brooke and Richard are  dear friends.   More importantly for today, Richard has been a terrific  representative of the State of North Carolina--first, in the House of  Representatives, where I served with him when I was a Member there from  Ohio; and then he snuck over to the Senate, a little bit ahead of me,  and kind of laid the groundwork.   We have had the opportunity to work on so much together, Richard.   I think of every major bipartisan achievement in this place, and you  will see Richard's fingerprints on it.   So to his staff who are here, I know those are your fingerprints as  much as his; so congratulations.   They haven't always been easy issues. Sometimes they have put Richard  in a difficult political position, but he did what he thought was right  for his beloved State of North Carolina and for the country.   Today, I have heard a lot about healthcare. I like healthcare. That  is great to talk about it, but I want to talk about something else. But  first, on healthcare, I must say, on Operation Warp Speed, it was  remarkably successful. I think everyone has to acknowledge that now. No  one in this Chamber was more responsible for laying the groundwork for  that than Richard Burr. I am not sure people understand that. But on  all the discussion about Richard's innovation and your work on  healthcare, I think that is one that perhaps needs to be emphasized.   You have also done a good job in other areas, as we talked about  today, and the Intelligence Committee, in particular. I will tell you  that Richard and I have traveled the world a little bit together. We  will go to some hot spot, and I will be dutifully going to the  meetings, you know, with the political leadership of the country, and  Richard will disappear, and he will show up a few days--no, a few  hours--later. We will have a good conversation about things he is not  allowed to tell me about. So he doesn't tell me everything. But the  bottom line is, he is in touch with intelligence people not just here  in Washington but around the world and expressing our support for them  and our encouragement for them for the difficult jobs that they do on  behalf of our country and, really, you know, keeping the world a less  dangerous and less volatile place.   Richard, I have seen you in action on that, but I want to talk about  something else, which is his love of the outdoors and his work on  conservation.   We are cochairs of what is called the International Conservation  Caucus. This is a group of Members, two Democrats and two Republicans-- Senator Whitehouse and Senator Coons for the Democrats, Senator Burr  and I for the Republicans--who talk about international conservation  issues around the world. These are issues that are directly related to  economic development, directly related to security, to terrorism.   When you think about it, the wildlife trafficking that goes on in  places like Africa, where people are trafficking in ivory or rhino  horns and so on, so much of that is related to providing funding for  terrorist groups over there and causing a lot of insecurity in those  areas.   It is the same thing in terms of economic development. Many of these  natural areas, once destroyed, don't provide the ability for clean  water, for food, for ecotourism, which brings in money for these  countries. So it is all related.   But, ultimately, I think Richard got involved because of his love of  nature and the outdoors. And the biodiversity that he has helped to  maintain around the world, not just here in this country, has been one  of the beneficiaries.   There is a piece of this that I think also hasn't gotten enough  notice today--that is my job to sort of clean up here--and that is not  just his work on what is called the Great American Outdoors Act, and  there were a number of provisions in there. One of mine was on the  national parks, which Richard helped me with, restoring our national  parks. But there is one piece in there that I believe would not have  been successful without Richard's advocacy over many years.   He really wanted to make sure that we put our money where our mouth  [[Page S7170]]  was in terms of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, or LWCF. If you  don't know what that is, then ask any of your county commissioners or  Governors or others who take advantage of it, township trustees,  community leaders, and, certainly, conservation groups, because this is  funding that helps with matching funding--typically, local, State,  sometimes other Federal funding--to ensure that areas are protected,  that parks can be built, and so on.   Congress is very good about saying: We are all for that. We are going  to--what we call around here--authorize the legislation to do that, but  then we didn't provide the money.   What Richard said over the years was: Well, if this is such a good  idea, why don't we fund it like we are supposed to?   That was actually falling on deaf ears for quite a while, I think it  is fair to say, but Richard was persistent.   I recall being at the White House signing ceremony for that larger  legislation, the Great American Outdoors Act, knowing that one of the  most significant elements of that was full funding of the Land and  Water Conservation Fund. That was because of one Senator, and that is  Richard Burr.   So, Richard, it has been a pleasure to serve alongside of you. I wish  you and Brooke, William, and Tyler the very best going forward.   I suspect if you want to see Richard, you are going to have to go to  his beloved North Carolina shore, particularly, the Outer Banks, where  you might see him fishing for tuna or doing something else very  productive.   So Godspeed, my friend.    Mr. President, I come to the floor for the 28th  consecutive week since the Senate has been in session to once again  discuss the war in Ukraine and why it is so important that all of us-- the United States and our allies--stand up for Ukraine at this point  and provide them the military, economic, and humanitarian aid they  need.   Over the weekend, I spoke at the annual holiday lunch of the  Cleveland area's Nationalities Movement. As my colleague from Ohio  knows, this was started during the Cold War to advocate for freedom for  the former Soviet states. The group, today, includes people whose  families have come from all over Eastern and Central Europe: Poland,  Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Slovakia, of course Ukraine, and many other  countries. All strongly support Ukrainian freedom and the right of  Ukraine to chart its own course.   At the luncheon, I talked to some of my friends who were there, many  of whom have family or friends in Ukraine. We talked about some of the  hardships that their relatives and their friends in Ukraine are facing  today and how, as we approach the holiday season here in America, we  are thinking about Christmas shopping and putting up decorations and  spending time with our families and friends over the holidays. They are  thinking about something else. They are thinking about how they can  survive. They are thinking about how to stay warm, whether they are  going to have running water or electricity. They are living with fear  and uncertainty in not knowing when the next Russian missile might  strike.   The brutal, unprovoked, and illegal invasion of Ukraine has now  turned into an outright attack on civilians and noncombatants.   This photo is something that we are seeing in communities all over  Ukraine. This is some civilian infrastructure. You can see the power  grid here and the power lines. This was the result of a Russian missile  strike. All over, this is happening: drones, missiles, attacking  infrastructure--killing civilians, by the way--and forcing people to  live in the dark and in the cold as Ukraine's severe winter weather  approaches.   Although these merciless Russian attacks are meant to weaken the  resolve of the Ukrainians, it is not having that effect, actually. I  have seen this from my recent trips to Ukraine. It is actually  hardening people's resolve. The Ukrainians know that these are  desperate missile attacks to the interior of the country. Why? Because  Russia is losing on the actual battlefield.   As this map shows, the Ukrainians have shown courage and  effectiveness in actually pushing out Russia from all of these red  areas of Ukraine. This is where Russia was after February 24. Fifty  percent or more of the country has now been liberated by Ukrainian  troops. We forget about that. About 55 percent of Ukraine has now been  liberated--again, thanks to the resolve and the courage and the  military skill of the Ukrainians. Ukrainian soldiers continue to  advance more slowly, but they continue to advance, giving the Russians  no time to relax or to recover.  [[Page S7182]]    Here is where we are today. Remember, before, there was red all over  the country of Ukraine. This is where the Russians are now. This  striped red line is the part that Russia invaded back in 2014. The red  part here is where they invaded on February 24 and are still occupying  parts of Ukraine.   In the east, near Bakhmut, which is right here, Russian forces and  Wagner Group mercenaries, who are fighting on behalf of Russia, are  fighting a war of attrition. It is a grinding war of attrition with  marginal gains to show for their massive losses in terms of manpower  and equipment.   In its attempt to capture this town of Bakhmut, Russia has turned  what used to be a quaint, tree-lined city that I visited back in 2018  into a bloodbath. This is what Bakhmut looks like today. It looks like  something you would see out of a World War I film.   Ukrainian officials say Moscow is now losing 50 soldiers a day to  maintain this slow, bruising advance to reach the city's eastern  gates--all of this death and destruction over a city that has marginal  strategic advantage for Russia. It appears to observers that Russia is  willing to put their soldiers and mercenaries in harm's way in Bakhmut  because it is the only place that Russian forces are genuinely  advancing at all, and Vladimir Putin is eager--even desperate--to claim  some sort of victory to try to salvage this failed military campaign  that they are on.   I did go to Bakhmut back in 2018. It was then called the line of  contact. I met with Ukrainian troops who were there holding the line,  including the 54th Mechanized Brigade, which is still fighting there in  that region. I saw men who were willing to die for their country, for  their freedom, for their families. So I was not surprised by the  bravery and resolve that the Ukrainian troops had shown since February  24. I was expecting it based on what I had seen in Bakhmut.    Those soldiers I met gave me this plaque when I was there. It is  signed by a number of the soldiers whom I met.   It says at the bottom here:         Glory to Ukraine. Glory to the heroes.    ``Slava Ukraini.'' ``Heroyam Slava.''   That is the rallying cry.   Of these troops who signed this flag to me, I am told, many of them  are likely to be dead or injured now because the fighting in Bakhmut  has been so intense.   So Godspeed to those troops who are holding the line against this  Russian assault tonight as we talk on the floor of the U.S. Senate.   The Ukrainians are making progress elsewhere. You see here in  Kherson--this was the city that the Russians took on February 24. It  was the only provincial capital that they took, the biggest city they  took early on. They have now abandoned Kherson, and Ukrainian troops  have taken Kherson and liberated it. The liberation has been  extraordinary. You see people coming out of their homes and hugging the  troops, and you see the war crimes that the Russians were committing.  The withdrawal from Kherson that went through the west side of the  river here has been a great victory for the Ukrainian troops. The  relentless counteroffensive is actually working.   With this situation on the battlefield, the military outlook here for  Russia looks bleak. It is precisely because they are not winning on the  battlefield, though, that they are instead attacking civilian targets,  these cowardly attacks we have seen all over Ukraine--electricity,  natural gas, water--knocking out everything they can in order to try to  break the will and the resolve of the people of Ukraine.   This past weekend, 1.5 million people were left without power after  Russian airstrikes damaged the local energy infrastructure in Odessa.  So 1.5 million people here were without electricity. Most of those  people now have electricity again because the Ukrainians are moving  quickly to try to restore it, but then it is bombed again and again.   Across the country, according to Ukrainian Prime Minister Shmyhal,  after eight waves of missile attacks on the country, all thermal and  hydroelectric powerplants in Ukraine have been damaged. In other words,  every single powerplant--coal, natural gas, hydroelectric--has been  bombed. Again, many have now been repaired again and again and again,  but the bombings continue.   Last Friday, according to the deputy head of President Zelenskyy's  office, 68 strikes in the Kherson region occurred--68 strikes across  the line here in Ukrainian territory. This included a strike on a  hospital in Kherson that damaged the children's ward. It included an  attack on a morgue in this area.   In the northeastern part of Ukraine, up here near Kharkiv, there has  also been great progress recently as you see where the Ukrainians have  pushed the Russians toward the east. These Russian cross-border attacks  on the city of Vovchansk, in that area, left thousands of people  without heat in the midst of winter earlier this week.   I saw the effects of these missile attacks firsthand the last time I  was in Ukraine. I visited Kyiv about a month ago with my colleague  Senator Chris Coons from Delaware. We saw the destruction that these  missiles were causing. In this case, it was at the headquarters of  Ukraine's utility company.   We then, after that, actually had a dinner meeting with the  Parliamentarians from Ukraine at a restaurant where the power had been  taken out through these attacks. We had to conduct business with  flashlights. It was incredible, later that night, to look at the city  of Kyiv from an office building--a modern, 21st-century city completely  dark.   Thanks to the dated air defense systems that they do have, the  Ukrainians have been able to intercept and destroy a lot of these  Russian missiles. They are intercepting, actually, most of them-- somewhere between 60 and 70 percent, probably, based on the information  I have--but enough of them get through to cause this incredible damage  to Ukraine's civilian infrastructure and to kill Ukrainians on the  ground as these temperatures drop. The temperature in Kyiv tonight, as  we talk here, is about 23 degrees Fahrenheit.   Ukraine isn't just trying to shoot down Russian-made missiles and  Iranian-made drones--we know there are Iranian-made drones and these  Russian missiles coming into Ukraine--but they also have to shoot down  Ukrainian-made missiles. Why do I say that? Because according to  Ukraine's Deputy Intelligence Chief, some of these missiles that Russia  has fired recently have actually been missiles that Ukraine voluntarily  gave to Russia as part of the 1994 Budapest agreement, the so-called  Budapest Memorandum.   Recall that the Budapest Memorandum was a document that was signed by  the United States, the UK, and Russia with Ukraine. This was after the  fall of the Soviet Union. In the agreement, all parties, including  Russia, promised to respect the independence and sovereignty and  territorial integrity of Ukraine in exchange for Ukraine's giving up  its nuclear weapons but also providing missiles and strategic bombers  to Russia. So now these very same missiles and very same bombers are  being used by Russia in its ruthless campaign against innocent  civilians in Ukraine.   There can be no clearer display of Russia's contempt for its  international obligations and its total disregard for the Budapest  Memorandum. Ukraine gave up its weapons in exchange for peace, and  instead they have war.   There can be no more urgent or important request from Ukraine today,  of course, than that of a better air defense system. That is what they  need more than anything else. Every day, vital infrastructure is being  destroyed, and civilians are being killed.   The news from the Biden administration yesterday that they now may be  thinking seriously about sending Patriot missile systems to Ukraine,  which is our most advanced anti-missile air defense weapon, is very  encouraging to me.   Here is the patriot missile system.   This one is actually in Poland. We have provided this to the Polish  Government. We now need to provide it to the Ukrainian Government. I  have called for this for months, as have others, and I hope this comes  to fruition.   We need to get these weapons into the hands of the Ukrainians quickly  before there are more civilian deaths recorded, before there is more  destruction of key infrastructure.   If the administration does not do this, I fear that as winter sets  in, more and more Ukrainians will be forced to leave their communities,  compounding  [[Page S7183]]  the humanitarian crisis that is already there. As you know, there are  6\1/2\ million people displaced internally in Ukraine already and over  7 million people--probably close to 8 million--who are outside of  Ukraine as displaced individuals in places like Poland, throughout the  EU, and even the United States.   I continue to urge the Biden administration to take a more assertive  approach on military assistance in general. There are about 50  countries helping Ukraine on the military side. All the free world is  stepping up to help, but America leads, and we need to provide Ukraine  with more of the weapons that Ukraine says they actually need, like the  Patriot missiles. But, also, they have asked for fourth-generation  fighter jets, like the F-16 or similar European models. They are in  Europe already. We have provided them to European countries, but we  have to sign off for the European countries or other countries to  provide them to Ukraine. They want modern main battle tanks, like the  Abrams tank that is made in my home State of Ohio. They want more long- range missiles, like the ATACMS missiles that can be fired through  these what are called HIMARS launchers and would give Russian soldiers  few places to hide in the illegally occupied territory.   When I visited the region in March and again in May and August and in  November, I got to meet a lot of these displaced people in Ukraine and  hear their harrowing stories.   We were at a World Food U.N. site in Kyiv on our last trip, and there  were a lot of refugees there, displaced people, internally displaced  people from Ukraine who were getting the basics just to be able to  survive. Many of them sat down with us and talked.   Two women told me one of these harrowing stories. It was about a  young man who was tortured by his Russian occupiers--this was near the  city of Kharkiv--and taken to the main square and tied up on the main  square. Then, when he wouldn't answer whatever questions they were  asking him, he was taken down below into a dungeon, basically, a  basement. They found these basement chambers all over Ukraine where  there was occupied territory.   The young man actually survived, miraculously, but he was in terrible  shape when he came out. But his mother didn't survive. The angst and  the anxiety and the despair that she felt about her son resulted in her  death.   These women were telling this with tears streaming down their cheeks,  and, of course, we were crying, too. But that is happening all over  Ukraine.   These war crimes behind enemy lines in occupied territories are  revealed every time there is a liberation. It is positive there is a  liberation, but then you get this negative, which is, this is what  happened to these people. So we really don't know the extent of the  atrocities and the war crimes because there is still so much territory  that is occupied by Russia.   Anyway, these people have seen death and destruction that no person  should have to experience.   Some of my constituents in Ohio have been very helpful. They know  some of these refugees. They have personal connections--again, family  or friends--and so they have helped. From Northeast Ohio, where we have  a big Ukrainian community, Marta Licsynesky of the United Ukrainian  Organizations of Ohio and Andy Futey of the Ukrainian Congress  Committee of America--they are presidents of those organizations--they  have both jumped in with both feet and helped. MedWish, which is a  great organization up in Cleveland, provided a lot of medical  equipment. They have provided everything--clothes, medicine, any kind  of help for these refugees. They have provided armored vests from law  enforcement all over Ohio, as an example, to the Territorial Defense  Forces. So God bless them. They are doing what they can to help.   But unless we intervene with better ways to defend the air, there  will be more and more of these displaced people and more and more  humanitarian needs.   On that front, in addition to the possible news about the Patriot  missile system from yesterday, I was also pleased to hear President  Biden and President Zelenskyy speak over the weekend about the need for  increased support for Ukraine. On Friday, the administration announced  another $275 million in military assistance, including more ammunition  for those HIMARS missile launchers we talked about and other systems  that will counter Russian and Iranian drones. There are dozens of  allies who have provided military assistance--we are not doing this  alone--but U.S. leadership has been key.    By the way, the 20 HIMARS--high mobility artillery rocket systems-- that are in Ukraine have all survived. Not a single one has been taken  out by the Russians. It is amazing. The Ukrainians have been quite  resourceful to make that happen, and thank God we still have those  weapons. Germany and the UK have also provided some of these weapons,  and they are making a huge difference on the battlefield.   The long range and high precision of these weapons have enabled the  Ukrainians to strike deep within the occupied territories to be able to  disrupt Russian logistics and command and control centers. That has  made the big difference. That is how Kherson was taken, was they cut  off the supply chain to Kherson to the point that these Russian  soldiers could not continue to hold the city and continue with their  atrocities.   It is no wonder, by the way, that HIMARS are popular in Ukraine. In  fact, when I was there, the Embassy staff sent out for some takeout  food. The food came back in a bag--it was hamburgers--and on the bag  was scrawled ``Thank you for the HIMARS'' from a restaurant worker. I  am also told that ``HIMARS'' is now a popular name for Ukrainian  newborns. They are naming their children after the weapons provided by  this body because they are making a huge difference in saving lives.   In addition to Patriot missiles, we have got to continue to provide  Ukrainians with other air defense systems, like the midrange NASAMS  system that we are starting to provide, but also cost-effective  electronic warfare systems that would enable Ukraine to defend its  skies over the long term. Those can be very effective against drones,  as you can imagine.   We have seen this before. In 1940, the people of Great Britain  suffered under a relentless bombardment from Nazi aircraft. Remember,  they tried to bomb London into the stone age. At the time, many  thought, Well, this is going to be the end of Great Britain. You can't  push back against these Nazis.   But the Brits were resolute. They were defiant. Eventually, the Royal  Air Force defeated Hitler's onslaught against innocent civilians in  what is called the Battle of Britain and ensured that the country would  survive the war. And, of course, the United States got engaged, and we  went on to win that conflict.   Today, just as then, there is another indiscriminate bombing campaign  going on, this time in Ukraine against civilians and civilian  infrastructure. Ukraine is now fighting its own Battle of Britain. We  have got to be sure we are there with them to provide them what they  need to survive their battle.   I was also pleased to learn this week that the European Union  proposed a new round of sanctions. If it is agreed to by the member  states--and I hope it will be--this package of sanctions would ban  exports of drone engines to Russia and also include other prohibitions  that would hopefully stifle Russia's ability to supply its military.   This is very important. In my view, it should have happened a long  time ago, but let's do it now. Let's cut off the ability for Russia to  be able to repair and recreate the drones that are getting destroyed by  the Ukrainians. Let's be sure that we are not giving the Russians what  they need to continue their war machine.   Russia's assault, by the way, is not just limited to bombs and  missiles, but I am hearing more and more about mines. According to  reports, Russian forces have now endangered up to 65,000 square miles  of Ukrainian territory with land mines. The United States is partnering  with our Ukrainian allies to demine that area. This aid has come in the  form of training and equipment, as well as U.S.-funded contractors and  demining teams. So in areas where the mines are on the Ukrainian side  of the line, we are actively trying to help. This is an important step,  in my view. It is kind of the first step toward Ukrainian  reconstruction.  [[Page S7184]]    When Russia resorts to these cowardly missile attacks on civilian  targets, Ukraine has responded in kind with precise strikes on Russian  military targets. So Russia is attacking civilian targets, and  Ukrainians are responding with targeted attacks on Russian military  targets.   For example, explosions have occurred here. This is Ukraine. This is  the occupied area. Explosions have occurred deep in Russian territory  here.   What are those areas? Well, these are Russian air bases deep inside  Russian territory, but they are home to the bombers who have been  targeting civilian infrastructure and killing Ukrainian civilians with  cruise missiles over the past couple of months.   As the UK Ministry of Defense reported last week, these may be ``some  of the most strategically significant failures of force protection  since [Russia's] invasion of Ukraine.''   Over the weekend, Ukraine launched a series of HIMARS strikes on the  Russian occupied city of Melitopol, which is here, including a strike  on Russian military barracks that reportedly killed a lot of the Wagner  mercenaries. This is in this area here.   America has been blessed with big, wide oceans on our east and to our  west and friendly neighbors to our north and our south. It is hard for  us to grasp what they are going through. It is hard for us to grasp  what it is like to have a war ravage your homeland and force you to  leave your home.   Russia's atrocities and clear human rights violations against  civilians are one compelling reason why supporting Ukraine is the right  thing to do, and I hope this week in this Chamber we will once again  provide support for Ukraine.   But another reason is that the death and destruction are not likely  to end in Ukraine. Vladimir Putin is on record as saying, ``The borders  of Russia have no end.'' He and his senior officials have also talked  about recreating the old Soviet empire. They have said that Ukraine is  just the first step.    I will tell you, other countries in Eastern Europe get that, and they  are understandably quite nervous. That is why they stepped up big time  to help Ukraine. That is why they have increased their own military  spending. That is why they have expanded their military cooperation  with the United States. Think of Poland, Slovakia, Romania, Hungary,  Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia--they are all doing that. Finland and Sweden  certainly understand how dangerous Russia has become, which is why they  have now decided they are going to join NATO after years of  neutrality--Finland, Sweden.   In my view, the only way to get Vladimir Putin to back off and to  negotiate an end to this ruthless and senseless war is to continue to  demonstrate unity among free nations, to tighten the sanctions on the  Russian economy, and to continue to help Ukraine win on the  battlefield. That is how this thing ends--through success. U.S.  leadership and assistance is key to that strategy.   I am not advocating a blank check, by the way. I hope nobody is. I  believe there needs to be accountability for the assistance that we  provide, and there is. There is accountability on the state aid, there  is accountability on the humanitarian aid, and there is accountability  on the military aid.   I have seen it in action in meeting with the 101st Airborne in  Poland, how they have end-use monitoring of the equipment we are  sending. The Ukrainians themselves want to have transparency. They  understand how important that is. That is why they have Deloitte  Cincinnati, an American accounting firm, involved in monitoring and  providing reports. That is why we are running our assistance through  the World Bank, where they are auditing and reporting back to us. That  is important to do.   But the alternative to helping Ukraine, to me, is unthinkable. What  would have happened if the United States had said ``We are not going to  help here'' and the rest of the world had said ``Well, if the Americans  aren't going to step forward and provide some leadership, we are not  going to either''?   First of all, it is clear to all of us that this country would be  occupied by Russia today. And even if Russia didn't go ahead and move  into all these other countries they say they are going to move into-- that Ukraine is just the first step and they want to recreate the  empire or the Soviet Union--even if it is just Ukraine and they stopped  at the Ukrainian borders, suddenly you would have three NATO countries  that have a border with Russia that do not now and really a fourth  because all Poland has is a very small outpost of Russia here.   So you would suddenly have NATO country the United States, under  article V, is committed to protecting with an aggressive Russia on its  border. We would be mobilizing thousands of troops. We would have  massive amounts of weapons at the borders of these NATO allies at a  tremendous cost to the U.S. taxpayer. Is that a better alternative than  helping give Ukraine the tools they need to be able to do their own  fighting, which has been successful up to now--more successful than  anyone could have imagined?   Finally, I would say that allowing an authoritarian regime to take  over an ally and a democracy with impunity--that sends exactly the  wrong message to the rest the world at a time we can least afford to  have that happen.   Think about China. China is eyeing a potential military assault on  Taiwan. Think about our ally Israel as they continue to face threats  from Iran and others in the Middle East.    Both our adversaries and our allies are watching to see if the United  States and our allies will help maintain that post-World War II world  order or whether it is each country for itself. And if it is each  country for itself because we aren't helping Ukraine, the  militarization around the world increases dramatically, as do the  nuclear weapons.   Ukraine just wants to live in peace with its neighbors, including  Russia. But when attacked by Russian missiles and drones, Ukraine has  fought to ensure that the flame of freedom here is not going to go out.  From visits, I can say with certainty that they will never give up. And  we must not give up on them.   The Ukrainian people tasted freedom when they embarked on their own  Revolution of Dignity, as they call it, back in 2014. They threw off a  Russian-backed corrupt government and, instead, embraced the West, the  European Union, the United States of America, freedom, democracy, free  markets. Ukraine chose to stand with us, with Europe, the United  States, and other free nations. This is not the time for the United  States and its allies to stand down.   So for my current colleagues and the Senators just elected, I urge  you: Let's continue our support for Ukraine in this worthy cause of  protecting freedom.   I yield the floor.
