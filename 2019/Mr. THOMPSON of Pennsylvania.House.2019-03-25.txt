 Mr. Speaker, today is National Medal of  Honor Day, when this Nation recalls the sacrifice and heroics of all  Medal of Honor recipients.   Over 150 years ago, on March 25, 1863, the first Medals of Honor were  presented. In 1990, Congress designated March 25 as National Medal of  Honor Day. The Medal of Honor is the highest military honor our Nation  can bestow.   In 2016, I was able to recognize one of Pennsylvania's very own Medal  of  [[Page H2785]]  Honor recipients, the late Army Specialist Ross McGinnis. The post  office in Knox, Clarion County, is named for Specialist McGinnis, who  died in December 2006 in Iraq.   While on patrol in eastern Baghdad on December 4, 2006, an  unidentified insurgent positioned on a nearby rooftop threw a grenade  into a Humvee carrying McGinnis and other troops. Specialist McGinnis  threw his body on top of the grenade, saving the lives of his fellow  soldiers.   He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor by President George W.  Bush in 2008.   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of a grateful Nation, I salute all our Medal  of Honor recipients.                            ____________________
