 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I got here just a little before I was going to speak,  and I heard the gentlewoman from Illinois speak. She talked about  flexible work hours. I thought to myself: Who decides what is flexible?   Historically, of course, working men and women were told: You will do  this for that much at this time under these conditions.   That was the reality--sweatshops, health-endangering shops, and long  hours with little pay. Then the labor unions came along. They got some  strength, they got some support, and lo and behold, the middle class  started to grow and started to make good wages, have safe working  conditions, and, yes, flexible hours.   Mr. Speaker, as we work to create jobs and build our economy back  better, we need to make sure that the jobs that are available to  Americans help them get by and get ahead. That is what the minimum wage  battle is about. That is what this is about--average working people  wanting to get by, wanting to have a decent salary, and wanting to have  decent working conditions.   Very frankly, that just didn't happen, Mr. Speaker. Some died to make  that a reality. Others were beaten and battered in order to have that  be a reality. Child labor, abuse of gender, women abused in the  workplace working in terrible, odious conditions--that is why Democrats  passed the PRO Act last year, and that is why we will do so again  today.   One of the most important tools for workers to secure better pay and  benefits is the right to organize and bargain collectively. Those of  you who have been employers know that you want to maximize profits and  you want to try and manage and see whether you can hire people for X  amount of dollars rather than X plus Y. That right was secured over the  course of generations by workers who fought to have that right  recognized and secured. Collective bargaining made possible the  prosperity and upward mobility that was a hallmark of America in the  20th century.   Strong unions lead to better pay, higher quality and more affordable  healthcare, more secure retirement benefits, and workplaces that are  safer, not just for union members but for all workers.   Unfortunately, in the 21st century, Mr. Speaker, the right to  organize has been eroded and weakened. As a result, many workers are  stuck with no recourse to demand the better pay and benefits they  deserve, and they need, and their families need, and we need as a  middle class society that knows that we are a consumer economy. Henry  Ford knew if you didn't pay them, then they couldn't buy your cars--a  pretty simple equation.   The PRO Act would change that, empowering workers, once again,  through their right to organize. It prevents management from  misclassifying workers.   I urge Members to think whether or not that happens.   Mr. Speaker, this gig economy sounds great until you get to be 65 or  67 and you look around and there is nobody behind you. There is nobody  to lift you up. There is nobody to say: Thank you for that 30 years, 40  years, or 50 years of service to our company or to our economy. It  prevents management from misclassifying workers in order to avoid  negotiating the fair pay and safe working conditions they deserve.                                time  1300    No, they are just contract employees. They don't have any real  attachment or relationship with our company. They are just contract,  and we can use them one day and throw them away the next.   Moreover, the PRO Act levels the playing field for labor unions in  contract negotiations. Maybe you don't believe in that, Mr. Speaker,  not you personally, but maybe there are people who don't believe that  they ought to be equal. After all, I started the business, and I  invested money.   I agree with that; I want to see them make money. I am a  procapitalist Democrat, a procapitalist American. I have been around  the world, and I have seen noncapitalist societies. They don't work  very well. But the capitalist society works better if everybody is  lifted, not just some.   I thank Chairman Scott of the Education and Labor Committee for his  hard work on this bill, as well as the members of his committee.   I am proud that we Democrats strongly support this bill, which is so  central to our effort to make opportunities more accessible and more  broadly available to American workers as we look to rebuild our economy  stronger after COVID-19.   The leader of the party on the other side of the aisle said in his  speech that he gave at the beginning of the session: We are the  workers' party.   We will see, Mr. Speaker, when we vote on this bill, whether that  statement was accurate.   The workers are not against this bill. As I said last year, when we  passed this bill, the PRO Act is the workers' rights legislation that  working people in our country need and for which they have been waiting  for far too long. That is why we need to pass this bill today and send  it to the Senate.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote for our workers, for our families,  for our children, and for our effort to build back better and stronger  from the challenges we now face.
