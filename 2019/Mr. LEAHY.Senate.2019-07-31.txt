 Mr. President, on Sunday, May 19, 2019, I was honored to  attend the 218th commencement ceremony at the University of Vermont,  where my wife Marcelle was presented with an honorary doctorate degree  and recognized for her many years of public service. The commencement  speaker, Darren Walker, made this wonderful day even better when he  delivered a truly moving address. By recounting his personal story,  examining the challenges our Nation faces, and celebrating the  achievements of the recent graduates, Darren implored us to view our  differences as a strength and our division as a liability to our  collective futures. It is with great appreciation that I recognize  Darren for his commitment to social justice and thank him for sharing  such an eloquent and unifying message with us on that day.   As the president of the Ford Foundation, Darren oversees a $13  billion endowment and $600 million in annual grant making for  international social justice philanthropy projects. He has served as  the vice president of the Rockefeller Foundation, as the chief  operating officer of the Abyssinian Development Corporation, and has  spent more than a decade working in the fields of international law and  finance. Prior to all of this success, however, Darren was raised in  the humblest of conditions by a single mother in rural Texas, where he  attended public schools, and battled racism and homophobia, to set  himself on a path toward what he says is the great honor of serving as  president of the Ford Foundation.   I ask unanimous consent to have Darren Walker's Address to the  University of Vermont Class of 2019 printed in the Record. I encourage  all Senators to read these moving remarks, with the hope that we can  transcend our differences and focus on the shared values and  aspirations that unite us.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:     Darren Walker Address to the Class of 2019, University of Vermont   218th University Commencement Ceremony Burlington, Vermont--Sunday, May                                  19, 2019         To President Sullivan; Provost Prelock; Senator Leahy and       Governor Scott; distinguished vice presidents and deans;       faculty and staff; and--most importantly--to the University       of Vermont Class of 2019: Congratulations!        Graduates: I know how hard you've worked to earn the       achievement we honor today. I also know your success required       a lot of love, devotion, and commitment from the people in       your life, who helped you achieve this major milestone. So,       Class of 2019: Please join me in thanking your parents--and       all of the family, friends and teachers who have helped you       on your journey. This day is about you--but it's also about       honoring them.        Today is special for many reasons. It's a celebration of       excellence--and of the promise your future holds. It's the       end of one chapter--and the beginning of another.        But today is also special for an additional reason.        You came to his magical community called Burlington,       Vermont, from different places. Different towns, and states       and countries around the world. You came to your degree by       different paths. Took different courses in different majors.       Even when you were on the same campus, you spent time with       different people, engaged in different activities. And after       today, you will go off in your different directions. To       different jobs, different cities and towns, entirely       different lives.        And yet, here we are. Together. And the fact that we are       together--at this time, in this place--is remarkable.        It's remarkable because this is a unique, wonderful moment       in your lives. But it's also remarkable because, in this new       digital world, we are too often led to believe that our       differences are reasons for division, rather than unity.        Class of 2019, this is a defining characteristic of our       digital era: Whether it's algorithms that segment and select       the information we see based on our previous clicks and       likes; or media outlets incentivized to confirm our beliefs,       rather than deliver facts that help educate us and make us       better citizens; or political leaders who rally the extremes,       rather than serve a common good.        As a result of all this, we jump to judgement--and       disagreement too often turns to dehumanization. We miss       opportunities to turn difficult and challenging moments into       teachable ones, from which we can learn and grow. We lose       touch with the shared values, and shared experiences, and       shared aspirations that bind us together in this country and       make us who we are.        My message to you today is this: It doesn't need to be this       way--and it hasn't always been. And I know this to be true,       from my own journey.        You see, many aspects of who I am as a person, as an       American, might be labeled as ``different.'' I am black. I am       gay. I live in Manhattan, that tiny island moored off the       coast, and a little unmoored from reality. And I spend much       of my time traveling across the country and around the world,       meeting visionary, courageous, resilient people fighting       poverty, inequality, and injustice. All of these things--the       things that make me different--define who I am.        And there are parts of my story, that equally define me,       that are harder to see, which also make me different.        I was born to a single mother in a charity hospital. We       lived in a shotgun shack in a small, rural community in East       Texas.        I attended public schools and colleges. I was in the first       class of Head Start in 1965,  [[Page S5232]]       received Pell Grants, and private scholarships.        As an African American growing up in the south, I certainly       encountered bitter racism. But I also benefited from enormous       generosity--from people who provided me with support, and       encouragement, and who believed in my potential.        You see, in spite of the differences I presented, and the       challenges I encountered, I always felt that my country, that       America, had my back. I had good people of good will cheering       me on and pushing me forward.        Indeed, my story is an American story. It's a story of what       is possible, of what can happen, when ``we the people,'' live       up to our highest ideals. And when we do fulfill these       ideals, the fact of our differences does not hold us back, in       the very same way that the fact of our differences is not       really what divides us.        Class of 2019: The differences among us and the divisions       between us: These are separate things. One does not       inevitably lead to the other.        We are different, yes. But our differences are our       strength.        Our division, on the other hand, is a liability--a       liability that has been exacerbated and exploited, I believe,       because of the corrosive, inequality that today is widening       in American society.        More than what we look like, or where we come from, or how       we worship, inequality is what is tearing our communities and       country asunder.        Economic inequality asphyxiates the very American idea of       economic and social mobility. It creates unprecedented wealth       gaps, sorting us into circles where we only engage with       people of similar means and perspectives.        Persistent racial and gender inequality cause the sins of       our history to infect the present and imperil the future.        Inequality helps explain the gaps between the experience of       rural Americans and urban Americans--and entrenches the       polarization in our political institutions.        And inequality doesn't just cause our challenges. It also       prevents us from joining together to solve our common       problems.        It undermines our hope for the future and erodes our faith       in one another. Because of it, we are less willing to trust       one another. Less willing to extend the benefit of the doubt.       Too often, we rush to judgement, assuming the worst       intentions of others.        Now, I'm not naive. There are people for whom hate, and       harm is the intention. From Charlottesville to Pittsburgh, we       have witnessed the painful, pernicious impact of hate. And       while there certainly are racists, anti-Semites, homophobes       and prejudice in America today, this is not the character of       who we are as a nation. Most Americans believe in ideals of       equality and justice for all--and in order for these ideas to       be realized we must stand up to emboldened bigotry.        And so, graduates: I ask you, I implore you, not to build       walls, but to build bridges and to build relationships,       because when I reflect on my own story, I know I did not get       here alone.        None of us have.        It was not the simple fact of my presence, or superficial       measures of diversity or inclusion, that led me to the great       honor of serving as president of the Ford Foundation, or to       the great honor of addressing you today. It was often people       who were very different from me extending their humanity, and       generosity, and their privilege to help me--leaving their       comfort zones behind; spanning a divide.        It was people I didn't know--or came to know only later--      who had faith in me, who invested in me, who sustained me on       my American journey.        My story is proof of what can happen when people choose to       transcend their differences, and build bridges, and build       relationships. You, too, are proof. And, on its best days, so       is this country I love.        America always has been the product of people choosing to       bind themselves together. Actively choosing. We are ``We the       people.'' We are e pluribus unum--out of many, one.        Because of our differences, we can ascend from cooperation,       to collaboration, to innovation. Out of our differences,       there is hope. Out of difference, there can be unity. Out of       difference, equality and justice.        And it's bigger than the United States. This issue       transcends boundary and geography. Out of many countries, we       are one planet--with one future.        Which brings me back to where I started: The celebration of       difference--and all of the possibility that difference       unleashes.        Out of many paths--out of many graduates--you are one       class. And while you have many careers and choices in front       of you, I hope you keep one objective in mind: To make this a       more just--a fairer world.        So, I ask you: What bridges will you build? What new       relationships will you initiate? What justice will you serve?       What will you make possible for someone else?        Many of the bridges you cross will not be physical       structures of concrete or steel. They will be relationships       you forge, through hard work and attention, respect and care,       listening and love. And the best relationships are those in       which you can be yourself and better yourself.        If my experience is any indication, this is especially true       of relationships with graduates of this great university. My       partner in life of 26 years, David Beitzel was a proud member       of UVM's class of 1980. He passed away suddenly in January.        David taught me so much about life, and our common       humanity. We were very different. We hailed from very       different places and backgrounds. But we found each other       despite those differences--and enriched each other's lives       because of them.        Relationships with other people--friendships and family,       professional, romantic, incidental and intentional--all are       essential, no matter how different we may seem to be. They       strengthen our empathy, our compassion, our humanity, and       widen our perspectives.        If we build bridges and bonds of connection, then when       injustice affects one of us, we know--deeply, personally--      that it affects all of us. When we bind ourselves to others--      when we recognize that our fates are bound together--we can       put the small things aside. We can make a world where stories       like mine are more probable, more likely, more common. We can       shrink the gaps of inequality and grow justice in its place.        It will not be easy, class of 2019. Justice takes time. It       takes work. It takes love. And it takes risk.        But I hope you find ways to build these bridges. I hope you       find ways to listen and be curious--to be present and       proximate. I hope you embrace difference--and reject       division.        Class of 2019: I know you will answer the call--and I know       the future will be much better for it. It's yours for the       taking and the making, as of right now.        Congratulations. Good luck. And Godspeed.                            ____________________
