 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Continued State  Flexibility To Assist Older Foster Youth Act.    Last month, I hosted a townhall with the National Foster Youth  Institute for current and former foster youth across the country. Their  stories of hardship broke my heart. I was not surprised, though,  because these young people are among the most vulnerable in our  society, often lacking the same social safety net that you or I could  rely on in a crisis.   Surveys throughout the pandemic have shown foster youth face elevated  financial, housing, and food insecurity; decreased educational and  workforce participation; and increased isolation. This bill before us  today extends crucial flexibilities for the Chafee Foster Care Program  that we put in place last December, allowing States to better meet the  needs of current and former foster youth.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill and help young  people access this much-needed assistance.
