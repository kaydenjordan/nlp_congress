 Mr. Speaker, America's youth are in crisis. According  to a recently released report by the CDC, more than one in five LGBTQ  teenagers have attempted suicide in 2021, and one in three teenage  girls seriously considered suicide in that year.   It should be no surprise that students are struggling in a country  where certain politicians refuse to regulate the guns that kill their  classmates and fight to ban books that tell their stories. There is a  mental health crisis throughout our country that we need to address  now.   President Biden and Democrats in Congress enacted the Restoring Hope  for Mental Health and Well-Being Act to save lives by expanding access  to mental health and substance abuse disorder treatment. Now, my  Republican friends are calling to cut Federal funding to FY22 levels,  slashing funding for vital youth mental health programs when the  assistance they provide is so desperately needed.   For too long, Americans struggling with mental illness and substance  abuse have suffered in silence, intimidated by stigma and unable to  access treatment. We must change this. I invite my Republican friends  to join us as we fight to change this in our country for young people.                            ____________________
