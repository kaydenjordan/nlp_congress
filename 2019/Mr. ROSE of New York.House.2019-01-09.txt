 Madam Speaker, I rise today to announce my  introduction of a bill authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to  grant an easement of Federal lands for the construction of a seawall on  the east shore of Staten Island.   This is the first bill I am introducing, because, since Hurricane  Sandy, which absolutely devastated my district, New York City, and the  region as a whole, residents in my district have lived in fear of  devastating flooding. They live in fear of another superstorm. They  live in fear of heavy flooding. And they live in fear of the rising  cost of flood insurance.   That fear is real for my constituents. But the question isn't whether  the storm will hit again; it is when.  [[Page H297]]    That is why the Army Corps of Engineers, along with Federal, State,  and local agencies, have worked to develop a plan to protect the lives  and livelihoods of Staten Islanders by building a seawall.   Federal, State, and local funding for this project already have been  secured. All that remains is for Congress to pass my bill to allow for  this critical construction to begin. I made a promise when I was sworn  in that if something matters to the folks who live in my district--my  constituents--well, then it matters to me. That is why I am here today,  and that is why I will fight to pass this bill.   I commend my predecessor, Congressman Dan Donovan, who introduced  similar legislation in the previous Congress, which passed the House on  a bipartisan basis, demonstrating that, when we want to, we can unite  in order to enact legislation that saves American lives.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues in Congress to act swiftly on  this legislation so that we can allow construction to begin as soon as  possible and bring some peace of mind to families worrying about that  next storm, worrying that they are going to lose their homes.   In this time when government is shut down, it is damn time that we  show the people of Staten Island, of South Brooklyn, of New York City,  New York State, and the American people as a whole that government can  do something positive.                            ____________________
