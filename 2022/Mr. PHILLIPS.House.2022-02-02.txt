 Mr. Speaker, it has been 2 years, image that, since the  beginning of the pandemic. Two years marked by hardship that none of us  had ever known and hope we never know again. As the world continues to  adapt to the challenge, it is my belief that there is light at the end  of the tunnel. Yet, as we continue to push toward that optimism, we are  reminded every single day that the pandemic is not over. It is not over  for us; it is not over for the nurses and doctors who tend to our sick;  it is not over for our frontline workers, for teachers, for police, for  families, for anyone.   I am here today to speak for a group of Americans who are too often  ignored in our pandemic discourse, our Nation's entrepreneurs and small  business owners, the bedrock of our economy, particularly those who  work in public-facing enterprises, like restaurant owners, gym owners,  hospitality owners in the live-events industry. Those whose livelihoods  depend on public gathering in person, whether it is to break bread, to  work up a sweat, or to enjoy booths that you might see in the Minnesota  State Fair, as my friend and colleague, Angie Craig, would agree is  America's finest.   In 2020 and early last year, both parties worked together to pass  pandemic aid to help keep the lights on at those businesses. It was an  aid that was effective in saving countless jobs, and while not perfect,  of course, it did save our country from economic disaster.  Unfortunately, for those public-facing industries, that aid has not  been enough, not with the rise of the delta variant and then omicron,  and potentially future variants that we might face in the future.   Last week, I held a roundtable in Minnesota to hear from  entrepreneurs representing those industries in my district. Some had a  quarter million dollars in debt, others had lost a quarter million  dollars in revenue. Some had taken out government-subsidized emergency  loans from the programs  [[Page H339]]  that we in Congress created, but others were left out entirely. They  told me that between the pandemic and the supply chain and inflation  costs that the pandemic has wrought, that those old relief programs are  simply not enough. They need help, and they need it now. It is our job  and it is not done yet.   The cost of congressional inaction is real. Small business owners  across America are dipping into their personal savings and taking on  significant debt. In Minnesota alone, almost 60 percent of restaurants  have taken on debt during the pandemic, with an average of over half a  million dollars per restaurant. Even in the best of times it is a tough  industry, but particularly difficult right now.   We all know what will happen if we don't pass relief soon: many of  those restaurants will close and many of their staff will be  unemployed. Too many small business owners are simply running out of  hope.   That is where we come in. I am encouraged by comments made by the  President and lawmakers in both parties that there is an appetite to  solve the problem and provide relief. In fact, I secured a commitment  from Speaker Pelosi not long ago that a targeted relief package would  get a vote on the House floor, which is an important step. We are not  at the finish line, my friends, and I implore that we, together, work  on such a package.   Small businesses like restaurants, hospitality, gyms, and live events  companies, they make up the social, cultural, and the economic fabric  of our communities and our entire country. We must fight to ensure that  they can keep their doors open.   Mr. Speaker, we must meet the challenge of the moment with urgency  and refill the RRF and include hard-hit industries in a future relief  package. We must get the job done so that others can keep theirs.                            ____________________
