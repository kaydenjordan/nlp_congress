 Madam Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart  to remember and honor Gordon Saussy Varnedoe, who passed away on April  24 at the age of 82.   Gordon was born in Savannah, Georgia, and was a proud graduate of the  University of Georgia. Returning to Savannah, he became the director of  the Waterfront Association; and a fundraiser for Armstrong State  College, the Alzheimer's Association, and the Savannah Jazz  Association.   Gordon's accomplishments as an athlete and contributor to Savannah's  sports community earned him an induction to the Greater Savannah  Athletic Hall of Fame as the first recipient of the M.A. Spellman  Special Award.   Gordon's remarkable athletic accomplishments and contributions span  multiple sports and decades. He walked on to the University of  Georgia's football team as a fullback, founded the Savannah College of  Art and Design rugby team, and the Savannah Scottish games.   Madam Speaker, two months before he died, I got a postcard from  ``Batman.'' It said: ``You have been getting some heat recently. Just  so you know, I love you and always will.''   I love you, too, Batman. We are going to miss you.                            ____________________
