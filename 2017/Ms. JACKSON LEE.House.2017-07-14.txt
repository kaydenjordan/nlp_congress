 Mr. Speaker, we are not Republicans and we are not  Democrats. We are Americans, and we draw together around the protecting  of America's security.   With that in mind, you can imagine my shock as a member of the  Judiciary Committee to find out that a KGB agent was in a meeting with  Jared Kushner, who now has a security clearance, and Donald Trump, Jr.,  among others.   I was shocked to find out that the lawyer who was present in that  meeting had a $200 million lawsuit to stop being sued on the money  laundering, and that that lawsuit was settled by the Trump Justice  Department for $6 million--$200 million down to $6 million. To the  American people, that means that the $200 million that was owed to this  government turned out to be $6 million.   That is why I will have a resolution to ask the President to step  down. And, as well, to introduce a resolution--a constitutional  resolution--to begin a constitutional investigation into whether or not  we are protected here in this Nation.   Our security is our greatest priority.   I would also suggest that the sanctions bill that was voted on in the  Senate must be voted on in the House now. We cannot still continue to  hide the ball. Sanction the KGB, sanction Mr. Putin, sanction Russia.  They are, in fact, here to demolish the democracy of this Nation.                            ____________________
