 Mr. Speaker, I guess we need to remind the Biden  administration that there is a gigantic problem in the Middle East,  most of it caused by Iran, the major sponsor of terror in the world, in  Yemen, threatening our Saudi friends and, of course, all around Israel.   What is the remedy? A few weeks ago, it was to unfreeze $6 billion  worth of Iranian assets in order to help them fund whatever activity,  which is probably going to be terror.   What is the Biden administration considering now? Another $10 billion  in unfrozen assets to allow them to continue this battle. You have to  ask the question: Whose side are they on?   It makes absolutely no sense to give them more materiel, more assets,  more ability for them to make war against our ally at a time when we  are contemplating sending significant resources, as we should, to our  ally, Israel. Yet, we can't get out of our tracks around here enough to  do so.   Mr. Speaker, they need to think much harder about what they do with  Iran and allowing them to be a sponsor of terror.                            ____________________
