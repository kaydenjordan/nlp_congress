 Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Coach Sean  McDonnell, who recently announced his retirement after leading the  University of New Hampshire football team for the past 23 years. I am  deeply grateful for his leadership on and off the field and the impact  that he has made on countless students.   Coach McDonnell has been a staple of UNH football for decades. After  playing defensive back for the Wildcats from 1975 to 1978, he later  returned to serve as an assistant coach, before taking over as head  coach in 1999.   Under his leadership, the Wildcats saw much success. The team made 14  consecutive appearances in the NCAA's Football Championship  Subdivision--FCS--playoffs and reached the semifinals in 2013 and 2014.  As a result of his hard work, Coach McDonnell was named a two-time  national coach of the year in the FCS.   But his reach goes far beyond the scoreboard. Known as Coach Mac, he  served as a mentor and role model for countless young people. Above  all, he was deeply proud of how those students and players represented  the University of New Hampshire and our entire State.   Coach Sean McDonnell has left a lasting legacy in the Granite State.  I thank him for all of his hard work and wish him the best in his well- deserved retirement.                            ____________________
