 Mr. President, 8 short months from now, the greatest  athletes in the world will gather together and compete in the 24th  Olympic Winter Games.   Usually, Americans await this awe-inspiring event with enthusiasm and  excitement. This year, though, we await it with apprehension and,  frankly, disgust. That is because next year's games will be held in the  People's Republic of China--a Communist nation that enslaves workers,  puts women and children in concentration camps, sterilizes women, and  unleashed a global pandemic that killed millions and upended the global  economy.   The 2022 Games will be located in Beijing--a 5-hour train ride away  from the Wuhan lab where the coronavirus pandemic likely originated and  a day away from Xinjiang Province, where the Communist Party is  committing genocide against ethnic and religious minorities and has  herded more than 1 million innocent souls into concentration camps.   The Chinese Communist Party may believe that extravagant pageantry  will distract us from the reality of what they have done, but no amount  of rushed urban cleaning can wipe away the moral stain that permeates  the capital city of China. No golden torch can redeem the moral  bankruptcy of communism. No fireworks display can make us forget that  Beijing is the epicenter of evil in the world. It is no exaggeration to  state that the Chinese Communist Party is the purist, most powerful,  and most pervasive force for evil in the world.   Locating the Games in Beijing will enrich and embolden the Chinese  Communist Party and strengthen their hold on their captive people. That  is why the International Olympic Committee should immediately-- immediately--rebid the 2022 Games and award it to a free democratic  nation. I will note that this is entirely feasible.   If the Tokyo Summer Games can be postponed a year due to an event  that was no fault of Japan's Government, we can certainly rebid the  Winter Games on short notice if China is perpetrating crimes against  humanity.   I would observe that the Winter Games are far smaller and easier to  move than the Summer Games. The Winter Games include fewer than half  the number of sports, nearly 4,700 fewer medals, only one-quarter the  number of events, and less than half the competing country.   There are many, many Western democracies that could easily, easily  accommodate a relocation of the Games on short notice. Some of our  European partners, like France, Switzerland, Sweden, and Italy have  more than enough winter sporting venues and hotel capacity and  transportation capacity to host these Games with 8 months' notice. Many  of them have hosted modern Games before. Many of them host national and  international winter sporting competitions.   If the IOC fails to rebid the games, however, the United States  should fully embrace an economic and diplomatic boycott. No U.S.  official, company, or spectator should participate in and legitimize  China's despotic and totalitarian actions. American companies should  not profit off of genocide and oppression or help line the pockets of  the Communist Party officials perpetrating these crimes against  humanity, these grotesque atrocities.   If--and it is a big if--we can keep our athletes safe, they should  compete in the spirit of the great Jesse Owens. They should stare  tyranny in its eye and defeat China in every field of competition. But  the only Americans--and I mean the only Americans--who should step foot  on Chinese soil are the athletes, their coaches, their essential  support staff, and the necessary personnel to ensure their safety.   If the games remain in China, it will pose unique challenges to the  safety, security, and privacy of those limited number of Americans who  do attend, though. The U.S. Government must be fully prepared for the  dangers to which these athletes and supporting personnel would be  exposed.   First, the Chinese Government operates the most extensive,  sophisticated, and invasive police state anywhere on Earth. Members of  the American delegation should expect the Chinese authorities to bug  their hotel rooms, their vehicles, and to hack all of their electronic  devices.   Second, China has an ignominious history of arbitrarily detaining  American citizens and other Western visitors to gain political and  economic concessions, placing exit bans on foreign nationals. Members  of the American delegation could be detained during their visit.   Former Assistant Secretary of State David Stilwell apparently shares  these concerns, stating that ``spectators have good reason to beware Xi  Jinping's Beijing Winter Olympics.''   And I would add especially those, like, say, the Houston Rockets'  general manager, Daryl Morey, who have spoken out against the Chinese  Communist Party's abuses in Hong Kong, Tibet, Xinjiang, and many other  places.   Third, the Chinese Communist Party's infringement of privacy knows no  limits, and our Nation's representatives should prepare our athletes  and their staff accordingly.   China even considers DNA collection as a vital intelligence-gathering  objective, wants to use DNA data to catapult Chinese biotech companies  to global market dominance, and has reportedly conducted research on  biologically enhancing its soldiers.   During the Olympics, of course, the DNA of thousands of world-class  athletes could prove an irresistible target to Communists in Beijing,  whose evil sometimes seems to verge on science fiction. So whether  through the ruse of COVID testing or testing for performance-enhancing  drugs, China will have the opportunity to steal the very DNA of our  elite athletes--young men and women, in many cases young boys and  girls, who deserve our protection.   For all of these reasons, and many more, President Biden should  forcefully call on the International Olympic Committee to rebid the  2022 Winter Games.   We must be ready if they fail to do so. That is why I have sent the  President a letter urging him to prepare for the various challenges  that our athletes will confront if they compete in  [[Page S4533]]  Beijing and asking if the Communist authorities are cooperating with  U.S. efforts to protect our athletes.   If the safety, security, and privacy of our athletes cannot be  guaranteed, the United States should, and indeed must, adopt a total  and complete boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics.   No American should be put in harm's way for the sake of a sporting  event. President Biden ought to make these terms absolutely clear to  Communists in Beijing, and we should not compromise on them.   The athletes we send to the Olympics are not Democrats or  Republicans. They do not wear donkeys or elephants on their uniform.  They have no party insignia. They are Americans, wearing the Stars and  Stripes, bearing the standard of our great Nation. It is the  responsibility of our government to protect these champions, and I hope  this is an area in which our divided government can unite.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the Democrats want to call their voting  bill the For the People Act, but I would suggest you not be fooled by  the marketing. This bill has nothing to offer the people of our  country. The so-called For the People Act is, in fact, a partisan  takeover of our elections that seeks a government of the Democrats, by  the Democrats, and for the Democrats. So it is no wonder that it is  their very top priority and it is literally the first bill filed in  both the House and the Senate this year.   If this bill passes, it will shatter our Nation's faith in the  fairness of our democracy, weaken the security of our elections, and  attempt to entrench Democratic rule in the swamp, unchallenged, for  decades to come.   S. 1 is a Federal takeover of our elections that would usurp the  constitutional prerogative of the States in determining what the  Constitution calls the ``Times, Places, and Manners of holding  elections.'' While our Constitution has always given Congress the power  to determine certain aspects of how elections are conducted, the  Founders envisioned that this power would be exercised, in the words of  Alexander Hamilton, only under ``extraordinary circumstances'' and only  as ``the last resort.'' For example, Congress could intervene if States  were simply refusing to hold Federal elections in an attempt to deprive  Congress of the Members needed to operate under the quorum rules of the  Constitution. Of course, we face no such extraordinary circumstances  today.   No matter the outrageous claims of hysterical journalists and  politicians, almost every story you hear and every Democratic claim you  hear about State election law reforms misrepresents those reforms or  doesn't put them in proper context.   The Democratic Party--the very head of the Democratic Party,  President Joe Biden, referred to Georgia's election reform, for  instance, as a ``new Jim Crow,'' even though it has far, far more  access to the ballot than Democratic-run States like New York and, yes,  Joe Biden's own Delaware.   I might also note that Kentucky passed a fairly sweeping election  reform bill earlier this year. It still doesn't go as far as Georgia's  bill did in providing early access to the ballot. Yet there is no  condemnation of Kentucky's bill. I wonder why. Could it be because  Kentucky has a Democratic Governor?   The Democrats want to use these kinds of misrepresentations to pass  S. 1, which would give all power over our Nation's elections to  Democrats in Congress, who think anyone should be able to vote, at any  time, at any place, and in any manner, with remarkably little concern  even for the basics of election integrity, such as establishing the  identity and the legality of individuals who are casting the ballots.   The bill before the Senate would invalidate voter identification laws  in States across the country--laws that simply require individuals to  present valid photo identification in order to vote. Now, Democrats  like to pretend that voter ID laws are racist, just as they like to  pretend that anyone who opposes them is also racist. That would be a  surprise to most of the American people, though. According to recent  polling, three-quarters of Americans support photo ID requirements,  including 70 percent of Black voters, who support photo ID  requirements. That is a pretty big claim of false consciousness by the  Democrats.   After all, it is no great burden to present a driver's license or  photo identification at the polling place in order to vote. It is not  some devious tactic to suppress any group of voters. If it was, maybe  we would need to ask some of these politically correct airlines, like  Delta, why they require passengers to present photo identification  before boarding flights. Are they engaged in some nefarious, racist  practice of traveler suppression? I don't think so.   I think voter ID laws are a basic means of securing the vote, just  like three-quarters of all Americans think. Yet S. 1 would still  eliminate them all, allowing anyone to register to vote, under any  identity, without presenting proof that they are who they claim to be.   The Democrats' bill would also make permanent many of the vote-by- mail expansions that were rushed through as ill-considered emergency  measures during the pandemic last year. The free-for-all of ballot  harvesting and mail-in voting during the 2020 elections caused many  Americans to doubt the integrity of that vote.   Removing guardrails against fraud will only convince more voters that  the electoral process is rigged. Responsible elected officials should  be trying to assuage voters' fears by implementing adequate safeguards  on our elections. After all, many of these practices were unheard of  before the 2020 election.   Now, the Democrats like to say that they have to pass S. 1 in a  response to these State election reforms, but I would point out that  this bill was introduced in the House 2 years ago, before the States  passed any of the election reforms. Oftentimes these State election  reforms are being passed by legislatures that were appalled by their  Governor's sweeping power grabs. So no matter what the conditions, the  Democrats think it is always time to nationalize our elections.   Another provision of the Democrats' election bill would repeal donor  privacy laws that keep the IRS from harassing nonprofit organizations  about the identities and addresses of their donors. Democrats claim  that this change is about dark-money mega donors, but it would apply to  any middle-class family who donates a few hundred dollars a year to a  cause they care about, like a church or a charity. Yet, if the  Democrats have their way, bureaucrats at the IRS would be able to force  nonprofits to name their donors or risk losing their tax-exempt status.  This should alarm anyone familiar with the IRS's track record of  unfairly targeting conservative groups. After all, just last week, we  saw a conveniently timed leak of legally protected tax returns that  came out right before the Senate Finance Committee had a meeting to  justify higher taxes. What a coincidence.   Now, these are just a few of the proposals in the Democrats' election  bill. I haven't even talked about the public funding of campaigns. I  haven't mentioned transforming the Federal Election Commission into a  partisan weapon to be used by the President's party against the  opposition. All of these provisions and many more encourage fraud,  harassment, and corruption in our campaigns and elections. Not  coincidentally, they all seem to work to the advantage of the Democrats  or at least to the Democrats' perceived self-advantage. It is little  surprise, then, that this partisan bill is supported only by  Democrats--not even all Democrats, for that matter, not all the  Democrats here in the Senate and not all the Democrats in the House,  which passed it earlier this year by the thinnest of margins.   So I am proud to be a part of the bipartisan majority in the Senate  that is opposing the Democratic Party's attempted takeover of our  States' election processes. Political office in America is not a  birthright of any party or any politician, so the Democrats should try  winning their elections fair and square instead of taking them over in  a centralizing power play.   I yield the floor.
