 Madam Speaker, I appreciate Mr. Johnson's leadership here  during this Special Order hour.   Madam Speaker, since President Biden took office, his administration  has purposely and without remorse started a war on fossil fuels and  American energy independence. This is destroying our economy, and it is  creating a tremendous burden on the American people.   Biden's failed energy policies have led him to beg, of all places,  Saudi Arabia to increase their global energy supply instead of  unleashing our domestic oil and gas production.   This is insanity.   Let me tell you, when I am in my district, nobody asks me about  climate change. But let me tell you, when I am filling up my car with  gas, people come over to me who know me, and they say: ``What are you  going to do about this?'' That is when I remind them that when  Republicans held the majority, we unleashed the American economy and  the power of the American energy and energy independence, and we did  this for the first time since 1957.   And what happened? Gas was under $3 a gallon, and we actually  exceeded the Paris Climate Agreement targets for reducing emissions  without even being subject to that agreement.   America wasn't just energy independent; we were energy dominant. We  did it once; we can do it again. We don't need to beg other countries  to produce more oil. We should be doing it right here in the United  States where we produce energy more cleanly and efficiently than any  place else in the world.  [[Page H7242]]    American oil and gas emits 30 percent fewer greenhouse gas emissions  than other countries, especially Russia. Here is the bottom line: Oil  and natural gas remain essential in delivering the baseload power  necessary to sustain American homes, businesses, and livelihoods.    Madam Speaker, if we are serious about bringing energy prices down  and delivering real relief to the American people, we must invest in  American energy and reclaim our energy independence.
