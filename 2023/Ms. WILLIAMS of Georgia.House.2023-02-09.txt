 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my  constituent, Mr. Tommy Dortch, one of our country's greatest  contributors to closing the racial wealth gap. I could spend hours  highlighting his contributions to the Black community, but I want to  focus on his investment into our great HBCUs.   A proud product of both Fort Valley State University and Clark  Atlanta University, Mr. Dortch founded the National Black College  Alumni Hall of Fame Foundation in 1985. Mr. Dortch has led the  Foundation to award over $1 million in grants and scholarships to  students, and exposed more than 500,000 students to college  opportunities.   As a third-generation HBCU grad, I know firsthand their critical role  in fostering Black excellence. Mr. Dortch's lifetime of giving back to  the HBCU community has laid the groundwork for economic mobility for  generations to come.   Mr. Speaker, today, I proudly join with members of the Georgia  delegation to introduce legislation to award Mr. Tommy Dortch the  Congressional Gold Medal for his leadership and contributions to our  country. I am eternally grateful for the work he continues to do to  advance equity and opportunity for all.                            ____________________
