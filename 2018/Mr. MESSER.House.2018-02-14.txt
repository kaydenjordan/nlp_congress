 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a tremendous  Hoosier public servant, leader of the Indiana State Senate, David Long,  who recently announced his retirement from office.   David has served in the Indiana Senate for 22 years and as president  pro tempore for the last 12. He is a remarkable leader who has been  central to every major policy achievement in Indiana at a State level  over the past decade.   He led the charge on cutting taxes, passing right to work, enacting  Major Moves, creating one of the biggest and best school choice  programs, and permanently capping property taxes.   On a personal note, David Long is my mentor. We are both graduates of  Wabash College, and we both overachieved in marriage. I will always be  grateful for his friendship, advice, and counsel.   I thank David for his years of service.                            ____________________
