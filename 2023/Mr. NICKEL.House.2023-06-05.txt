 Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate Pride Month.   From trailblazing activists and leaders who fought tirelessly for  equality to artists and entertainers who shattered barriers and  inspired generations, the impact of the LGBTQ community is felt in  every aspect of our culture.   While we commemorate the progress we have made, we must acknowledge  that attacks against the LGBTQ community from State legislatures have  reached an all-time high.   It worries me that these attacks most directly impact LGBTQ youth, so  we must continue to uplift young people and reaffirm our commitment to  equality in America. In North Carolina, y'all means all.   I will continue to work to build a world in which everyone can live  safely and openly as themselves and where everyone is treated equally,  no matter who they are or who they love.                            ____________________
