 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Connecticut for  yielding.   It is great to be joining him here on the House floor to share with  our colleagues the important work that lies ahead for the Select  Committee on Economic Disparity and Fairness in Growth. Simply put, we  will be exploring, questioning, and hearing potential ways to address  economic challenges we are seeing across this country. We are, in fact,  on a fact-finding mission as we search for policy solutions that create  opportunity for every American.   Leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic, Americans saw progress. In 2019,  the median household income grew by 6.8 percent, the largest increase  ever recorded. Minority communities saw even greater growth: Blacks  Hispanics, Asians, and women.   But coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic, something has changed, which  is why the work of this Select Committee is so timely. Labor force  participation, both those seeking work and currently employed, are lows  not seen since the Carter administration.   Across this country there is a growing disconnect between available  jobs and workers ready to work. The government should be supporting and  encouraging work and the dignity that comes with it.   Families across the country, from Kenosha to New York, San Francisco  [[Page H5865]]  to Orlando, are being hurt by rising prices. They feel it when they  fill up their car's tank. They feel it at the grocery store. And they  are scared they are going to feel it when they go Christmas shopping  for their kids in a few weeks.   Inflation is a tax on every American, but it is devastating to low- income Americans.   Chairman Himes, I look forward to working with you to explore what we  can do to empower workers to prosper and to expand opportunities for  all families to succeed.                                time  2110     Madam Speaker, I think there is great opportunity as it  relates to education and, in particular, workforce development. I think  not lost on many of us, as we look out at the disconnect between  workers and jobs available, there are over 10 million jobs available  across America, yet we continue to have a disconnect between getting  workers who are looking for work and the jobs that are available.   We saw in Lorain, like we see in southeast Wisconsin, signs looking  for workers. As we walked into the hearing, I remarked that there were  ``Help Wanted'' signs across the street, yet there were many people who  were still unemployed.   Hopefully, we can look at the workforce development aspects of  education in the United States to make sure that we are connecting  workers with the jobs that are available.    Absolutely. We see this time and again in southeast  Wisconsin. We see businesses that are shrinking hours to try to deal  with and navigate through this challenging work environment.   I know we will be having a hearing coming up on automation, and I  don't think it can be lost on us that many businesses are looking and  the struggle to get workers back to work and the impact that may have  on automation and future job growth in the United States.
