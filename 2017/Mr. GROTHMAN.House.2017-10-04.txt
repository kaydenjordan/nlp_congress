 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for giving me an  opportunity to address the Progressive Caucus, their budget. I think  the budget is unacceptable. It is something the American people ought  to pay attention to because the day may come in which a budget similar  to the Progressive Budget passes this floor.   The first thing to look at is we are increasing maybe by an average  of about a little under--well, around $1 trillion increase in taxes  over the next 10 years. So you are taking a lot more money away from  Americans. And despite this huge increase in taxes, you are looking at  about a $70 billion cut in defense.   I suggest that the public and the people who are supporting the  Progressive Caucus take some time talking to their people in the  current military, talk about the planes that can't fly, talk about the  shortage of parts, and ask: How is it possible you could take this much  more money from the American people and still feel we have to have  significant cuts in our military budget?   But then you look at what we have to spend more on: a 4 percent raise  for Federal workers. Look, we wish everybody had a raise, but, really,  at a time when we are approaching $20 trillion in debt, is it a  priority to give Federal workers a raise?   We put more and more people dependent on government; a large  expansion of the program providing free college to people. At a time  when, quite frankly, many people who already have college degrees can't  get jobs, we are expanding that program. And, of course, by making it  free, people will respect it less. And not only will they respect it  less, but by making it free, many people will go to college who perhaps  otherwise don't feel it is for them.   They won't make adjustments to the food stamp program, which is a  problem.   We greatly extend the time that you are on unemployment, and this is  kind of bizarre because it is a time when our employment is near  historic lows. But despite the fact that until now we haven't had such  unemployment for a long period of time, we want to extend unemployment,  thereby encouraging more people to stay on unemployment.                                time  1830    I would like to thank my friends from the Congressional Progressive  Caucus for allowing students to refinance their student loans, which  shows something or another that there is a heart there, a little bit  anyway. I wish I could get my own Conference to put that in. But in any  event, I urge rejection of the Progressive budget.
