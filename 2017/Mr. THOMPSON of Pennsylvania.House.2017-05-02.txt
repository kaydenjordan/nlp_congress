 Mr. Speaker, roughly 2 million children  experience maltreatment each year in the United States. Children who  experience maltreatment face the possibility of a lifetime struggle  with mental, emotional, behavioral, and physical health difficulties.   Thankfully, the National Institutes of Health recognizes the need for  critical research on the topic and solicited a competitive process to  fund an academic institution to study this for the first time ever.   Proudly, it chose Penn State University. Penn State was selected  based on scientific merit to establish the Center for Healthy Children.  It will receive a grant of $7.7 million over 5 years, and Penn State  has committed $3.4 million in funding, bringing the total to more than  $11 million.   Mr. Speaker, this is the first national center for child maltreatment  studies. The award announcement came in April during National Child  Abuse Prevention Month. The research generated will impact lives  nationwide and throughout the world.   Penn State president, Eric Barron, noted that they recruited the best  and the brightest researchers to work on this issue. The faculty will  conduct cutting-edge research focused on the detection, treatment, and  prevention of child abuse, and for training the next generation of  scientists and child advocates.   Leading the research project is Jennie Noll, professor of human  development and family studies at Penn State College of Health and  Human Development and director of the Child Maltreatment Solutions  Network. A team of distinguished researchers will work with Noll on the  project.   Noll said:   ``It is an incredible honor to be selected by the NIH as an  organization that has the capacity to make a tangible impact on the  lives of children. I'm inspired to be working with this incredibly  talented group of world-renowned researchers as we forge this vital  path ahead.''   Mr. Speaker, more than 1,500 U.S. children die annually from child  abuse. That number is similar to the mortality rate from all forms of  pediatric cancer combined. Roughly 40 percent of child maltreatment  deaths result from abusive head trauma. That is heartbreaking, and it  is wrong.   So I congratulate Penn State University for leading the effort  nationally to fully research this critical issue. Together, we can help  all children see a better future.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today during Small  Business Week to acknowledge the important role small businesses play  in our communities nationwide. I am proud to be the product of a small- business family.   Small businesses are responsible for creating 63 percent of new jobs,  and they employ more than 47 percent of the employees in the private  sector.   The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is also marking the week with events  hosted by the Small Business Development Center. From workshops to  webinars, there is information for those looking to start a small  business and those looking to grow their businesses. Even long-time  small-business owners can get advice on how to continue to thrive or  find a renewed sense of direction.   Pennsylvania Small Business Week recognizes the significant  contributions of our small businesses and highlights the resources  available to support their growth in the Keystone State.   The Nation has celebrated Small Business Week each year since 1963. I  would like to congratulate all the small-business owners for the role  they play in employing our neighbors, serving our communities, and  creating two out of every three new jobs in the United States.                            ____________________
