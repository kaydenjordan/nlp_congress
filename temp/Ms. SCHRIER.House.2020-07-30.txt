 Mr. Speaker, I am delighted that this amendment  addressing antibiotic resistance has been included in this package.   While today we are laser focused on COVID-19, our next pandemic could  be a ``super bug.''  [[Page H4149]]    The antibiotics we have relied on for years are no match for the  drug-resistant bacteria that infect more than 2.8 million people each  year.   As a pediatrician, I want to make sure that in 10 years I will still  be able to treat my patients' bacterial infections like pneumonia, C.  diff, meningitis, and abscesses.   In order to do that we need to curtail the current overuse of  antibiotics and make investments in developing new ones now.   That is why Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria, or CARB-X, is so  important. By funding early phases of research for promising new  antibiotics, this public-private partnership minimizes the risk that  discourages investment in new treatments.                                time  1400     Madam Speaker, researchers across the globe are working  on vaccines to protect us from COVID-19, and once rigorous studies are  complete, we will be able to roll this out to the public and provide  protection from this dreadful disease.   But we need to be doing work now to build public trust and vaccine  safety and understand concerns within specific communities. In order to  do that, we need data on vaccine confidence and access broken down by  race, ethnicity, geography, and age.   Just this week, we have seen a prominent example of bad actors who  willfully undermine science, peddle conspiracy theories, and  intentionally spread misinformation.   This won't be the last time. It is going to be hard to counter  sophisticated efforts to sow doubt in vaccine evidence, efficacy, and  safety, and we must reckon with this country's legacy of unconscionable  treatment of people of color.   My amendment ensures that we will get reliable information to the  American people because a safe and effective vaccine is only helpful if  people are confident in it and willing to take it.
