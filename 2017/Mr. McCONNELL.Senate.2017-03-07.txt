 Mr. President, last night, the committees of  jurisdiction in the House released a proposal to repeal ObamaCare and  begin the process of replacing it with commonsense reforms to preserve  access and lower costs. The plan builds upon the 2015 repeal bill,  which was vetoed by President Obama. I am happy to hear the committees  will begin consideration this week. I encourage every Member to review  it because I hope to call it up when we receive it from the House.   It is clear to just about everyone that ObamaCare is failing. Costs  are soaring. Choices are diminishing. Insurance markets are teetering.   It would be easy to sit back and watch this partisan law collapse  under its own weight. Pass the buck to the next guy. That seems to be  the Democrats' strategy.   Republicans think the middle class actually deserves better. In  election after election, Americans have called for relief. In election  after election, Americans have called for an end to this partisan law.  We promised to do both things. We are.   The legislation the House introduced last night represents the next  step along that path. It is the result of a long conversation with many  voices, and it is supported by the one person who can actually sign a  bill into law--the President of the United States.   I want to recognize everyone for their contributions and hard work.  Given last night's announcement, I especially want to commend our  colleagues in the House. The policy conversation that led to what we  saw last night continues. The policy process moves forward today.   We have come a long way. We have a lot further to go, but we are  making significant progress. Working arm in arm with the House and the  new administration, we are going to keep our promise to the American  people because ObamaCare is a direct attack on the middle class. We all  know it. We all get letters and phone calls. We hear the heartbreak and  the frustration nearly every day.   Consider this letter from one of my constituents in Goshen, who wrote  about the ObamaCare plan available to his family:         I am extremely displeased with the limited choices       available. While 16 plans are listed for me at the       Healthcare.gov website, they are all inferior to my 2016       plan. Neither our primary care physician nor my       rheumatologist is in network of any offered 2017 plan.        The cost is another problem. The 2017 plan that I will       probably choose will have a 20% higher premium than my 2016       plan with a lower level of benefits.    Pay more; pay more for less. That is ObamaCare for you right there.  Look, in so many different ways, we have seen the evidence for years  that ObamaCare simply isn't working. This isn't a law that can be  fixed. This isn't a law that can be saved. It has to be repealed and  replaced. We promised the American people we would do that. We are  going to keep our promise.

For too long, the previous administration pursued an agenda that put  Washington's interests above the peoples' interests and regulations  that too often followed ideology rather than facts. In fact, as we  recently saw cited in a national paper, one study ``estimates that the  costs of complying with federal rules and regulations totaled nearly  $1.9 trillion in 2015.''   Let me say that again. The costs of complying with regulations in  America totaled nearly $1.9 trillion in 2015, equal to about half the  Federal budget.   Yet another study ``estimates that regulation has shaved 0.8 percent  off the U.S. annual growth rate''--a growth rate that was already too  low to begin with.   You can see the effect that heavy-handed regulations can have on our  Nation's economy. There is no question that some regulations are  necessary and even beneficial to our country, but Washington should  assess the real impact regulations will have before implementing them.   Undoing the damage of the past several years is going to take some  time, but fortunately there are meaningful steps we have already begun  taking to bring relief. Just last night we took another step by  blocking a sweeping labor regulation that would have threatened  American businesses, workers, and taxpayers at large.   Today we will keep working to dial back even more harmful  regulations, like the one before us now--the so-called BLM planning 2.0  rule. Don't let the name fool you. This regulation has little to do  with improving current policy. Instead, it really represents another  power grab pushed through by the Obama administration on its way out  the door.   Like several other regulations we are working to address, this one  adopts a top-down, one-size-fits-all approach. It shifts power away  from State and local governments toward Washington bureaucrats, and it  targets Western States specifically, jeopardizing their ability to  manage the lands and resources that their local economies count on.   As Senator Murkowski, chair of the Energy Committee, has pointed out,  this regulation could negatively impact a range of activities like  grazing, timber, energy, and mineral development and other important  uses of public land that States like hers rely on. And, perhaps even  more troubling, it would also limit input from local stakeholders who  are the most familiar with these issues. That is why Senator Murkowski  has been fighting the BLM 2.0 regulation from the start and has  introduced legislation under the Congressional Review Act to overturn  it.   Later today, we will have the opportunity to vote on a similar  resolution, which has already passed the House. It is another important  step in our efforts to return power to the States and knock down  barriers that keep our economy from growing.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.
