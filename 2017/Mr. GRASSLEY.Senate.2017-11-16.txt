 Mr. President, earlier this week, I spoke about the  history of the blue-slip courtesy. I hope my colleagues will read that  history as well. I explained in that speech earlier this week that in  my nearly four decades in the Senate, I have regularly returned my blue  slip even when I would have preferred that the President had nominated  someone else.   Today, I am announcing that the Judiciary Committee will hold a  hearing for two circuit court nominees, each of whom has one home State  Senator who has not returned a blue slip containing a positive  endorsement.   The hearing for Justice David Stras, nominee to the Eighth Circuit,  and Kyle Duncan, nominee to the Fifth Circuit, will take place on  November 29. Both of these nominees appear to be very well qualified,  and they deserve the Judiciary Committee's further consideration. I  would therefore like to offer an explanation as to why I am choosing to  proceed on these nominations and allow the hearing despite the lack of  two positive blue slips.   As I explained earlier this week, the blue-slip courtesy is just  that--a courtesy. For 100 years, the Judiciary Committee chairmen have  asked for the views of home State Senators on judicial nominees via the  blue-slip process. The blue slip is meant to solicit insights into  nominees and ensure that the White House is adequately consulting with  home State Senators as the advice part of the advice and consent would  apply.   Let me be very clear. I will maintain the blue-slip courtesy, but  some of my Democratic colleagues and leftwing outside groups mistakenly  assert that the blue slip affords a home State Senator veto power over  a nominee. That is not true. Only 2 out of the 18 previous chairmen of  this committee in the last 100 years allowed a single Senator to wield  veto power over a nominee.   Senator Joe Biden, when he was the Judiciary Committee chairman,  articulated what I consider to be a sensible policy with regard to the  blue slip. He said that a negative blue slip will be a ``significant  factor'' for the committee to weigh, but ``it will not preclude  consideration of a nominee'' unless the administration were to fail to  consult with the Senator. I intend to follow this practice for negative  and unreturned blue slips. This practice is consistent with the vast  majority of the blue slip's history.   I will add that I am less likely to proceed on a district court  nominee who does not have two positive blue slips from home State  Senators, but circuit courts, as we know, cover multiple States. There  is less reason to defer to the views of a single State's Senator for  such nominees when that nominee is going to serve several States in a  circuit.   It is important to remember that the judicial confirmation process  has changed over the last several years. Previously, when home State  Senators did not return a positive blue slip, their colleagues often  defeated that very same nomination on the floor but not in committee.   When President Bush nominated Carolyn Kuhl to the Ninth Circuit, her  home State Senators did not return positive blue slips. Chairman Hatch,  nevertheless, held a hearing and a vote for that nominee. Her home  State Senators, however, convinced their colleagues to filibuster the  nominee on the Senate floor. Carolyn Kuhl was never confirmed.   A few years ago, as we know--I think it was in 2013--Democrats  abolished the filibuster for nominees to the lower courts. They argued  that a minority of Senators should not be allowed to block nominees who  had majority support.   Our colleague, the Senator from Oregon, said: `` `Advice and consent'  was never envisioned as a check that involved a minority of the Senate  being able to block a Presidential [nomination].'' Well, now that  Senator is withholding his blue slip for a nominee to the Ninth  Circuit. If he did not believe that 41 Senators should be able to block  a nominee, he surely wouldn't believe that a single Senator would have  that right.   I think the Democrats now seriously regret that they abolished the  filibuster, as I warned them about at that particular time when they  were trying to add a lot of people who were not needed on the DC  Circuit Court of Appeals, as an example--packing the court, in other  words. They cannot veto it because there is not a filibuster, so they  want to use the blue slip for that purpose. It is very clear from the  history of the blue slip that that is not what the blue slip was meant  for.   On the other hand, some have argued that the blue-slip courtesy has  no place in modern judicial confirmations. The LA Times recently  suggested getting rid of the blue slip, as did the New York Times  several years ago. Even our committee's ranking member, Senator  Feinstein, once advocated for abolishing the blue slip.   I disagree that we should abolish the blue slip. The blue slip serves  the important purpose of encouraging consultation between the White  House and the Senate. Otherwise, the constitutional provision of advice  and consent is just consent. But there is opportunity to advise ahead  of time. That is what the blue slips help to do. The blue slip serves  the important purpose of encouraging consultation between the White  House and the Senate. The White House has an obligation to engage in  good-faith consultation with home State Senators for the purpose of  advice.   I will not allow the White House to just steamroll home State  Senators, but, as I have said all along, I will not allow the blue-slip  process to be abused. Ever since last November, when the press had  asked me about the blue slip, I have said that we are going to honor  the blue-slip process but that there are always exceptions. I am not  going to allow Senators to prevent a committee hearing for political or  ideological reasons. Those are the least reasons not to have a hearing.  Using the blue slip for these purposes is not consistent with  historical practice.   This brings me to one of the two nominations we are having on  November 29, that of Justice David Stras of Minnesota.   Justice Stras appears to be exceptionally well qualified. He  graduated first in his class from the University of Kansas Law School.  He clerked for both the Ninth Circuit and the Fourth Circuit and then  for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. After several years in  private practice in Minnesota, Justice Stras joined the faculty of the  University of Minnesota Law School. He remained there until his  appointment to the Minnesota Supreme Court in 2010. In 2012, he was  [[Page S7286]]  elected to a full 6-year term on the court by 56 percent of Minnesota  voters. Think about one's not returning a blue slip when somebody gets  56 percent of the vote to be returned to the court.   Justice Stras was raised by a single mother in Kansas. He is the  grandson of Holocaust survivors. He carries the lessons passed down by  his grandparents with him each day.    I want to refer to a writing he just submitted to a leading  newspaper. Writing recently about their survival in Auschwitz and then  immigrating to the United States, he recalled that his grandfather had  ``the uncommon gift of being able to see the light of human generosity  in the midst of near-total darkness.''   He wrote that his grandparents embraced ``a message of optimism,  intended to ensure that their children and grandchildren were able to  lead a life free from the atrocities that they had witnessed.''   Justice Stras has an impeccable reputation in the Minnesota legal  community.   His former colleagues at the University of Minnesota Law School  describe him as a person who ``engaged in debate respectfully,  listening to opposing ideas while backing up his own views with facts  and arguments'' and who ``wanted our students to be exposed to a wide  range of beliefs.''   Another group of colleagues of Justice Stras from his days in private  practice describe this justice as the type of attorney who ``never  talked down to people'' and ``there was never any hint that he felt  himself superior to anyone.'' Instead, Justice Stras ``listened to  others' views, and worked to find an approach to legal problems that  was both effective and acceptable to everyone on the team.'' They also  note in that letter his dedication to mentoring young lawyers.   Despite these accomplishments and accolades, one Senator has withheld  his blue slip. Evidently, my colleague from Minnesota believes that  Justice Stras has not even earned a hearing before the Senate Judiciary  Committee. But the reasons given for withholding the blue slip are not  consistent with the blue slip's purposes and history.   Justice Stras was nominated to the Eighth Circuit on May 8, more than  6 months ago. After many months, my colleague formally announced that  he would not return a blue slip. He cited Justice Stras's ``deeply  conservative judicial philosophy,'' as well as his admiration for  Justice Thomas and Justice Scalia. To me, this amounts to an  ideological litmus test: Admirers of Justice Thomas and Justice Scalia  need not ever apply for being on a circuit court.   The Minnesota StarTribune's editorial board summed it up. They said  the Senator from Minnesota ``rejected Stras for one reason: the  justice's conservative views.''   The editorial board of the largest newspaper in Minnesota echoed the  retired justice, Paul Anderson:         While Stras is more conservative than I would like, that is       not the point. The question is whether Stras is qualified to       serve on the Eighth Circuit. And he is.    My colleague later claimed that he was not adequately consulted by  the White House, which would be a legitimate reason for withholding a  blue slip, as I hope I have implied several times during my remarks  today and before. So I looked into this by reviewing the records of  consultation--and thank God the White House keeps pretty good records.  It is clear the White House earnestly and repeatedly attempted to work  with both home State Senators. The White House reached out to my  colleague from Minnesota several times between January and May of this  year to discuss the Eighth Circuit vacancy that Minnesota supplies a  member for.   It wasn't until May 2 that my colleague suggested alternatives to  Justice Stras. That was more than 3 months after initial contact by the  White House. Nevertheless, the White House did what they should under  the Constitution by listening to Senators. They considered my  colleague's two suggested nominees. I am satisfied that the White House  adequately tried to consult with both home State Senators as the  Constitution requires under advice and consent. Therefore, I am not  going to deny Justice Stras a hearing.   I would like to say a brief word about Justice Stras's supposedly  rigid conservative views. The Judiciary Committee has received numerous  letters attesting to Justice Stras's intellectual honesty and, probably  more importantly, open-mindedness. It is clear that he has great  respect for the rule of law, and his tenure on the Minnesota Supreme  Court demonstrates that, like any good judge, he is able to put aside  his personal views and apply the law faithfully.   One letter, written by a bipartisan group of attorneys from Justice  Stras's former firm, noted that they ``never doubted for a minute that  he reached his decisions based on his well-considered view of the law,  and not personal, political, or ideological considerations.''   They went on to note:         The lawyers whose names appear at the bottom of this letter       span the political spectrum, from Democrat to Republican,       liberal to conservative. We differ in our political views,       but we are united in our support of Justice Stras's       nomination to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.    There are all kinds of people writing that letter--Democrats and  Republicans, liberals and conservatives. Why is a Senator concerned  about the justice's ideological views when people who know him well  seem to think that is not a consideration because he is going to make a  good judge?   A group of former colleagues at the University of Minnesota agree.  They wrote a letter to the committee stating:         We are Minnesota law professors with diverse political       views ranging from very conservative to very progressive.       Some of us have appeared before Justice Stras as advocates,       and all of us are familiar with his academic and judicial       track records.    Now as I continue the quote, I want to say to everybody, get this:         He is no extremist, and he has approached his academic and       judicial work without bias or favoritism.    This support is echoed by his colleagues in my State of Iowa. The  committee has received several letters of support from the faculty at  the University of Iowa College of Law where Justice Stras teaches as an  adjunct professor. Among his supporters are the dean of the law school,  Gail Agrawal, and Professor Sheldon Kurtz, a self-described ``life-long  liberal.''   Justice Stras is a widely respected jurist, and he should have a  hearing. Ideological differences should not prevent the committee from  moving forward.   I would also like to address my decision to hold a hearing for Kyle  Duncan, a nominee for the Fifth Circuit. He also has not had two  positive blue slips returned. He is a widely respected appellate lawyer  who has litigated over 30 cases in Federal and State appellate courts,  including the U.S. Supreme Court.   My friend and colleague, Senator Kennedy of Louisiana, has declined  to return a positive blue slip. However, Senator Kennedy expressed that  while he is undecided on Mr. Duncan's nomination, he does not oppose a  hearing for Mr. Duncan. This seems to me to be a very sensible  approach. It is the correct distinction that a Senator should make when  deciding whether to return a blue slip. The blue slip is not meant to  signify the Senator's ultimate support or opposition to the nominee. It  only expresses a Senator's view about whether the nominee should have a  hearing.   Senator Feinstein made this precise distinction in 2003 for Carolyn  Kuhl's nomination. I referred to that nomination earlier in my remarks.  Senator Feinstein returned a blue slip which noted that she ``reserved  judgment'' on Carolyn Kuhl. She also supported holding a hearing for  Judge Kuhl. Ultimately, after Judge Kuhl's hearing, Senator Feinstein  decided to oppose confirmation.   Evidently, the hearing served a useful purpose, and Senator Feinstein  was able to distinguish between allowing a hearing and supporting a  nominee. Senator Kennedy has shown that he understands this distinction  as well.   I look forward to hearing from Justice Stras and Mr. Duncan at the  Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on November 29.   I think that all 100 Senators ought to look at the advice and consent  clause. We have an opportunity to give advice to a President. We have  an opportunity then, if that nominee comes up here, to vote for that  nominee.  [[Page S7287]]    Do we want to preserve the ``advice'' part of advice and consent? If  we do, I would suggest that we look at the blue slip as a useful tool  for accomplishing a very important part of the process. If it is  abused--at least while I am chairman, you don't have to worry about it  going away. But if it is abused, someday it will go away, and then all  we are going to have, when it is all said and done, is consent.   I yield the floor.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I listened carefully to the excellent  remarks of the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, outlining the  history of the blue slip. I am going to say to the chairman that he has  outlined a sensible use of the blue slip, which involves consultation  but does not lead to a one-Senator veto of a nominee.   I thank the chairman for the history lesson. It is a history lesson  that the Senate needed to hear.   I also thank the chairman for the spectacular job that he has done  all year long with this new administration in processing and bringing  forward highly qualified nominees. For generations to come, Americans  who follow the third branch will be indebted to the chairman for the  way he has handled these nominations, processed them, moved them out on  to the floor, and given the Senate the opportunity to express its will.   I wish every Member of the Senate had been able to hear the  chairman's remarks, but I am certainly going to call these remarks to  the attention of our Members every opportunity I get, and I thank the  Senator from Iowa.    I thank the leader.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Abby  Hollenstein and Laura Nowell, law clerks at the Judiciary Committee, be  granted floor privileges for the remainder of the day.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered                            ____________________
