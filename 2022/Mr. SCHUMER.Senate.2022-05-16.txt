 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, 2 days ago, barbarism descended upon  the city of Buffalo. At about 2:30 p.m. on Saturday, in a predominantly  Black neighborhood on Buffalo's east side, a lone gunman, driving from  200 miles away, equipped with an assault rifle, body armor, and a video  camera in his helmet, carried out a targeted attack against unarmed  civilians inside a Tops Friendly supermarket. His goal? To kill as many  Black Americans as possible. In a matter of minutes, 10 people were  killed, including a former Buffalo Police officer who worked as a  security guard. At least three more were wounded. It was the deadliest  shooting in the history of Buffalo and the worst mass shooting in  America this year.    Today, we hold in our hearts every single New Yorker whose life was  tragically cut short during Saturday's violence. We weep, knowing  nothing--nothing--will ever be able to bring them back. We mourn with  their families and with their friends, and with the entire community  still shellshocked by this shooting.   Tomorrow, I will join with President Biden, the First Lady, and  others to travel to Buffalo in order to pay my respects to those who  died, as well as to visit with the families and to visit with the local  officials still investigating the attack. We also, of course, thank our  brave first responders who were at the scene moments after the  shooting. Without them, more undoubtedly would have been killed.   We stand--we stand strongly and proudly with the community of  Buffalo, known as the ``city of neighbors.'' Buffalonians during times  of crisis have always pulled together, and that is happening today.   The East Side community, where the shooting occurred, is strong in  faith. And I know it, along with the entire city and region, will  overcome this tragedy. I say that because I know this community. Years  ago, I worked hard to bring that grocery store to the east side of  Buffalo because the community deserved a full-fledged supermarket. It  was a much-needed oasis in what was then a total food desert.   I know many in the community shop at that grocery store, whether to  buy food on their way home from church or before the Bills games. It is  where people see friends and relatives and catch up on things in  between errands. It has become a community center. Buffalo is the  ``City of Good Neighbors,'' and nowhere is that truer than on the East  Side.   Now, I don't know what could possess someone to bring violence to a  place  [[Page S2508]]  like that. What I do know is that this weekend's shooting is part of an  ugly pattern--one that dates to the earliest days of this Nation.  Racism has always been--and, unfortunately, still is--a poison--the  poison of America. The original sin of slavery and the decades of  racial terror, discrimination, separate but equal, White supremacy, and  bigotry that followed, unfortunately, continue to exert poisonous  influence on our society--an influence so poisonous that even today,  after America elected a Black President, after America marched for  racial justice, after the Senate confirmed a Black Supreme Court  Justice--a Black woman Supreme Court Justice for the first time ever-- we must still reckon with unspeakable acts of racial violence like what  happened Saturday on Jefferson Avenue.   As I said, the community is strong in faith, and I know they will  overcome this tragedy. I know that because I know Buffalo.   Madam President, over the next few days, I will continue my  conversations with local officials and Federal investigators to get to  the bottom of this harrowing massacre. But while there is much that we  don't know yet about Saturday's shooting, there are a few things that  are already clear and which demand action.   First, the victims on Saturday were not targeted at random, nor was  this particular grocery store in this particular neighborhood of  Buffalo a haphazard selection. It was not. No, this was a racially  motivated attack. The shooter made his choice by seeking the most  predominantly Black neighborhood in the region. Online, the shooter  proudly professed himself as a neofascist, White supremacist, anti- Semite. His views, shared extensively online, embraced a dangerous  ideology known as ``the Great Replacement,'' which asserts that a  conspiracy exists to replace White Americans with immigrants and people  of color.   Racially motivated shootings are, sadly, not new in our country. The  last decade alone holds too many examples of too many lives that have  been extinguished at the hands of shooters harboring White racist,  White supremacist views. It is the same hatred that motivated the  shooting at a Walmart in El Paso; the same poison that possessed the  shooter at a synagogue in Pittsburgh; the same bigotry that murdered  eight people in Atlanta last year; and the same evil that took the  lives of nine worshippers at a church in Charleston. It was the same  evil at play this Saturday in the beloved City of Buffalo, NY.   Not long ago, views like replacement theory were only found in the  darkest places in deranged minds. Then they came to be found in hardly  viewed trenches of the internet and in chat rooms that most Americans  never visit. To most Americans, these ideas are transparently repugnant  and an affront to our core values. They directly contravene the message  of welcome and opportunity symbolized by the Statue of Liberty. But,  unfortunately, with each passing year, it seems harder and harder to  ignore that the echoes of replacement theory and other racially  motivated views are increasingly coming out into the open and given  purported legitimacy by some MAGA Republicans and cable news pundits.   The message is not always explicit, but we have all seen the pattern.  Every time MAGA Republicans or pundits wrongly vilify immigrants and  call them invaders, every time they falsely claim that millions of  undocumented people cast ballots in our elections, every time loud,  bigoted voices bemoan the disintegration of an imagined ``classic''  America, the subtext is clear. These hard-right MAGA Republicans argue  that people of color in minority communities are somehow posing a  threat--a threat--to the American way of life. This is replacement  theory in a nutshell. It is dangerous and a deeply anti-American world  view. It is poisoning minds--people's minds--who spend hours wandering  the darkest wastelands of the internet.   And let's be clear. It is a message that has also found a special  home in several right-wing outlets and on one cable news channel in  particular--FOX News. In a craven quest for viewers and ratings,  organizations like FOX News have spent years perfecting the craft of  stoking cultural grievance and political resentment that eerily mirrors  these messages found in replacement theory.   According to one measure by the New York Times, FOX's top political  pundit--most widely watched--Tucker Carlson has spewed rhetoric that  echoes replacement theory at least 400 times on his show since 2016.   Let me repeat that. According to one measure by the New York Times,  FOX's top political pundit, Tucker Carlson, has spewed rhetoric that  echoes replacement theory at least 400--400--times on his show since  2016. Four hundred times. This is a poison that is being spread by one  of the largest news organizations in our country.   Now, to its credit, this morning the Wall Street Journal Editorial  Board--which is run by the same elites who run FOX News, owned by the  same people--the Wall Street Journal Editorial Board wrote:         Politicians and media figures have an obligation to condemn       such conspiratorial notions as ``white replacement theory.''    Those are the words of the Wall Street Journal editorial page. They  are right. Condemning racist ideologies and violence is necessary, but  it is hardly sufficient. It is not enough for outlets like FOX News to  simply condemn Saturday's violence and condemn the shooter's racist  views and then return to their regularly scheduled program. To have an  impact in the fight against domestic violence and extremism, FOX News  and their hosts need to actually stop spreading dangerous ideas like  replacement theory on their shows.   Let me say that again. If organizations like FOX News truly want to  condemn this weekend's violence, they need to stop spreading ideas like  replacement theory on their shows. We see, sadly, unfortunately, and on  several all too many occasions what happens when these views are given  a platform.   Every single media pundit, every single elected politician, and,  indeed, every single voice of influence in this country should band  together to stomp views like replacement theory out of existence. These  views should have no place in American society and certainly no place  in the segments of our most-watched news channels. What we need to do  instead is to respond to tragedies like this one, like the one that  occurred this weekend, with the resolve to root out hatred in our  country; and we must leave no stone unturned in pursuing solutions that  make these attacks less likely--these tragic, awful, horrible attacks.  Just look at the pictures of the people who died.   To be clear, denouncing and rooting out racist conspiracy theories  spread by the hard-right is only one step we must take and certainly  not a substitute for passing other meaningful legislation to address  the gun violence epidemic.   But as we mourn those lives that were taken away this weekend, as we  grieve with the survivors, we must also make a commitment as Americans  to oppose the old poisons of racism and White supremacy that have been  with us far too long that inspire these violent attacks to begin with.   If we don't do that--if we don't do that--I fear these attacks will  continue and even multiply, and true justice in a Nation that aspires  to E Pluribus Unum will continue to evade our great Nation.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 847.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I move to proceed to legislative session.    I move to proceed to executive session to consider  Calendar No. 687.    Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory  quorum calls for the cloture motions filed today, May 16, be waived.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, on one more matter that I would like to  address briefly--and I appreciate the indulgence of my friend, the  Senator from Illinois, who has waited.   On one other subject, I want to begin this week by wishing our  colleague and dear friend Senator Van Hollen a smooth and speedy  recovery after his announcement yesterday that he suffered a mild  stroke. Every single one of us is relieved--relieved--to hear he is  doing well; that his incident was minor; and that there are no long- term effects. We wish our friend recovery and look forward to seeing  him here in the Senate later this week.                                  H.R. 7691    Madam President, on the floor today, the Senate is going to hold an  important vote to move forward desperately needed aid for the people of  Ukraine as they continue fighting against Russian aggression. We have a  moral obligation--a moral obligation--to pass this assistance as soon  as we can in the Senate.   The vast majority of us in this Chamber is united in getting this aid  done as quickly as possible, including myself and the Republican  leader, but last Thursday, the junior Senator from Kentucky prevented  the Senate from getting Ukraine funding out the door and onto the  President's desk.   The arguments he made on the floor last week made clear that he  outright opposes giving aid to the people of Ukraine as they fight  Russian authoritarianism. Senator Paul's obstruction of Ukraine funding  is totally unacceptable and only serves to strengthen Putin's hand in  the long run. I urge him to drop his opposition so we can reach an  agreement to get this package passed through the Senate as soon as we  can.   But, to be clear, his obstruction will not--will not--prevent Ukraine  aid from ultimately passing the Senate. One way or another, we are  going to get this done and send a clear message to Ukraine and to the  world that America stands on the side of democracy and against Putin's  deeply immoral campaign of violence.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs be discharged from  further consideration of S.1596, and the Senate proceed to its  immediate consideration.    I ask unanimous consent that the Rounds-Shaheen  substitute amendment which is at the desk be considered and agreed to;  that the bill, as amended, be considered read a third time and passed  and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 351, H.R. 4426.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read  a third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  now proceed to the en bloc consideration of the following Senate  resolutions: S. Res. 633, S. Res. 634, and S. Res. 635.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolutions be agreed  to, the preambles be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table all en bloc.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  President of the Senate be authorized to appoint a committee on the  part of the Senate to join with a like committee on the part of the  House of Representatives to escort His Excellency Kyriakos Mitsotakis,  Prime Minister of the Hellenic Republic, into the House Chamber for the  joint meeting on Tuesday, May 17, 2022.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the notice  of issuance of Final Regulations Pursuant to the Congressional  Accountability Act from the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights be  printed in the Record.    Mr. President, finally, I ask unanimous consent that  when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 2:30  p.m. on Tuesday, May 17; that following the prayer and the pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings being  approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their  use later in the day and morning business be closed; that upon  conclusion of morning business, the Senate resume consideration of the  motion to proceed to Calendar No. 368, H.R. 7619, a bill to provide aid  to Ukraine, postcloture; further, that all postcloture debate time  expire at 4 p.m., and that if the motion to proceed is agreed to, it be  in order to file cloture on the bill during Tuesday's session; further,  that following the disposition of the motion to proceed, the Senate  vote on the motions to invoke cloture on the Rochon, Thompson, and  Sykes nominations; and that if cloture is invoked on any of the  nominations, all postcloture time be expired and confirmation votes be  at a time to be determined by the majority leader or his designee in  consultation with the Republican leader; finally, that following the  cloture vote on the Sykes nomination, the Senate resume legislative  session and proceed to Calendar No. 368, H.R. 7691.    For the information of Senators, the Senate will begin  gathering in the Senate Chamber at 10:20 a.m. and depart at 10:35 to  proceed as a body to the Hall of the House for the joint meeting.   Senators should also expect four rollcall votes beginning at 4 p.m.                            ____________________     Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:24 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, May 17, 2022, at 2:30 p.m.
