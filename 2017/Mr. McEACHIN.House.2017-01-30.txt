 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I  thank the gentleman as well as the gentlewoman for leading tonight's  conversation about so many issues that are important to the American  people.   Mr. Speaker, the President's baseless executive order on immigration  has hurt this country. It has hurt this country to the extent that it  has made us less safe, and it has hurt this country to the extent that  it goes against our values as a nation. Our Constitution says that we  will not favor any religion over another, yet the President has  instituted a religious test for entry in this country just 1 week after  his inauguration.   Mr. Speaker, this is a travesty. This rule has inconvenienced travel  back to America over the weekend for any number of permanent residents  and those of all backgrounds who serve our country. I know this because  it has actually impacted citizens of the Fourth Congressional District.                                time  1945    Mr. Speaker, I have a constituent who has been a permanent resident  for 20 years. He had visited his family in Cairo and was on his way  back to Virginia when he was turned around. He was actually sent to  Qatar, Mr. Speaker, where he has no connections, where he has no  business. He was just sent there because he was denied entry back home.   Mr. Speaker, my congressional staff worked around the clock, along  with his employer, to get him back home and, thanks be to God, he is,  indeed, home. But, Mr. Speaker, this is unacceptable, and it cannot go  on.   I can't help but think of Leviticus chapter 19, verse 34, where we  are reminded, Mr. Speaker, to treat the foreigner in our midst as if he  was one of our own.   Mr. Speaker, the President's order does not do this. It is an offense  to all Americans. It is an offense to the Judeo-Christian ethic. Mr.  Speaker, it cannot be allowed to stand, and I will work every day,  along with my colleagues in the CBC and other like-minded individuals  in this Congress, to reverse this order.
