 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Last week, we paused to honor the men and women who  paid the ultimate sacrifice in service to our Nation and in defense of  our freedoms.   For families all across America, the long holiday weekend also kicked  off the excitement of summer traditions, but, unfortunately, a year- and-a-half into the failed policies of this all-Democratic government,  even modest family celebrations came with pricetags that were literally  sky high.   Today, the average price of gas in America reached a new record high.  There is now just one State in our whole country where average prices  haven't passed $4.30. From trips across town to visits with relatives,  driving is becoming an even more painful proposition for working  families.   In Boyd County, one Kentuckian said it now cost him about $73 to fill  up the tank.         I just hope those prices will go down.    Another in Lexington said:         I'm traveling up north to take care of my mother up in       Michigan. It's a long haul, and yeah, it's hard when it is       this expensive.    And sky-high fuel prices aren't just hurting drivers. April saw the  biggest 1-month spike in airfare on record with tickets up nearly 20  percent. The cost of backyard cookouts and all other home-cooked meals  are continuing to rise. Prices on everything from ground beef to eggs  have clocked the fastest annual increase since 1979.   What about big household purchases? Many families wait for Memorial  Day weekend sales to fill a need around the house. Well, tools and  hardware are 11 percent more expensive than they were a year ago. Major  appliances cost 12 percent more. And furniture is up almost 15 percent.   These record-setting prices have got working families literally  surrounded, and the American people know exactly where these hardships  are coming from. They know this pain is a direct--a direct--result of  the failed policies that Washington Democrats pursued even as everybody  warned that their reckless spending would cause inflation.   A little more than a year ago, Democrats dumped $2 trillion of  liberal waste onto our economy. Their own experts--their own experts-- told them not to do it. President Obama's top economist warned then it  was ``definitely too big for the moment.''   President Clinton's Treasury Secretary said it could ``set off  inflationary pressures of a kind we have not seen in a generation.''  And both of them said it at the time.   It was reported a few days ago that even Secretary Yellen, the  President's own Treasury Secretary, knew the spending spree was  reckless and wished it were smaller.   But our colleague, the Democratic leader, brushed aside expert  concerns, saying that ``I do not think inflationary dangers, at least  in the near term, are very real.''   Well, now his party is presiding over out-of-control inflation, the  worst in four decades, a year-on-year inflation rate of--listen to  this--8.3 percent. And even that terrible number may be an  understatement.   In the early 1980s, right after the last bout of inflation this bad,  the Bureau of Labor Statistics changed how they measure inflation.  Larry Summers has coauthored a new research paper that tries to create  an apples-to-apples comparison between the inflation figures today  versus 40 years ago.   So here is what they found:   The current inflation regime is closer to that of the late 1970s than  it may at first appear.   In other words, Democrats have brought inflation much closer to the  bad old days of the late seventies than the official numbers even make  it look.   Of course, no matter which way economists measure it, the American  people know historic inflation when they feel it. It is impossible to  ignore, from the gas pump to the supermarket, to the big-box store.   On Democrats' watch, working families' hard-earned dollars are buying  them less and less.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
