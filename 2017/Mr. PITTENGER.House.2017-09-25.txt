 Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of The Moser  Group and Wingate University for their extraordinary organizational and  grassroots efforts to help victims of Hurricanes Irma in Florida and  Harvey in Texas. This week, these two organizations will load two 18- wheeler trucks to deliver supplies directly to the affected areas.   Commitment to charity and compassion for victims of national  disasters is truly what makes America great.   In North Carolina, we know all too well about the consequences of  hurricanes: 98,000 homes and 19,000 businesses were destroyed by  Hurricane Matthew, from which we are still recovering.   Organizations like The Moser Group and Wingate University are key to  recovery efforts across the country. They are to be commended. Madam  Speaker, God bless them as they continue to help people in need.                            ____________________
