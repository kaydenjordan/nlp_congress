 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the  resolution. This latest stunt reeks of partisan politics and does  nothing but advance an extremist agenda. Worst of all, this resolution  attacks a great defender of democracy, a Member who is among our best.   There is a legitimate role for censure in this institution, but the  majority has debased it and rendered it meaningless in a cheap partisan  slap. Shameful.
