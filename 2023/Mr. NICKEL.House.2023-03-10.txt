 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 212, a  resolution I was proud to introduce earlier this week with Congressman  Sorensen and Congresswoman Pettersen.   My resolution is simple and opposes the 30 percent national sales tax  plan proposed by several of my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle.   A 30 percent sales tax would be a disaster for working families in my  district who are already dealing with high prices of gas, exorbitant  housing costs, and rising costs of living. It would hit seniors living  on a fixed income especially hard.   Mr. Speaker, the American people deserve more than mere messaging and  performative politics over the next 2 years, and this plan is just  that.   I came to Congress to get things done, and I will work with anyone-- Democrats, Republicans, and Independents--to lower costs, simplify the  Tax Code for the middle class, and tackle the most pressing kitchen  table issues facing North Carolina families.                            ____________________
