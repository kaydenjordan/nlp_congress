 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about the  important need for an investigation into China's role in the origin of  COVID-19.   More than 600,000 Americans and 3.8 million people have died  worldwide from the virus, and now it is becoming more evident than ever  that the virus may have originated from a leak at the Wuhan Institute  of Virology.   It is also clear that China withheld critical information at the  beginning of the pandemic to cover up how deadly the virus could  become. We have demanded an investigation to find out what Chinese  Communist Party leaders knew and when they knew it. My colleagues from  across the aisle have blocked our attempts.   Millions have died and countless others have suffered from the  economic effects of the pandemic. The American people deserve answers  as to how the outbreak originated, and the Chinese Communist Party must  be held accountable if they are responsible for the outbreak and its  global spread.   The bottom line is this: China lied and people did die. We need an  investigation now.
