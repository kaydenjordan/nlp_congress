 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  and legacy of Mike Long, one of our State's greatest political leaders.   Mr. Long served as chairman of the New York State Conservative Party  for three decades.   An article in the New York Post that was recently written called Mike  a working-class champion, and that he was. From the beginning of his  career in politics, he believed Conservatives and Republicans must  focus on what matters for working-class Americans. Mike's beliefs were  as correct today as they were nearly 60 years ago when he began his  career in public service.   I remember speaking with Mike for the first time when I was going to  run for a special election for the New York State Senate several  decades ago now. At that time, we were talking about his family, and  Mike's son had just been in a near-fatal accident, run over by a New  York City bus while he was riding a bicycle. His son Matt broke  numerous bones and had countless surgeries as a result. But like his  father, he had incredible grit and determination, and he not only  recovered but continued to compete in triathlons and Ironman  competitions.   Mike lived out his conservative principles. He was married to his  wife, Eileen, for 59 years and had nine children, as was mentioned, and  countless numbers of grandchildren and great-grandchildren.   Our State and Nation are a better place due to Mike Long's service  and commitment to his principles.   May he rest in peace.
