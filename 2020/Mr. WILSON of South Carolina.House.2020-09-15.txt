 Mr. Speaker, all of America was  grateful on Friday, the 19th anniversary of the September 11 attacks,  to witness President Donald Trump present Sergeant Major Thomas Patrick  Payne the military's highest honor for valor, the Medal of Honor.  [[Page H4391]]    A native of South Carolina towns Batesburg-Leesville and Lugoff,  Payne and Master Sergeant Joshua L. Wheeler with fellow Army Rangers in  2015 helped rescue about 70 hostages set to be executed by the Islamic  State terrorists in Iraq. The terrorists had dug mass graves to prepare  for mass murder.   Sadly, Sergeant Wheeler lost his life, but Payne, with Kurdish  commandos, continued their multiple courageous assaults to cut the  locks, free the hostages, and helicopter the hostages to freedom.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
