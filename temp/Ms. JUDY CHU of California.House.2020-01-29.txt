 Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman  Tlaib for putting this Special Order hour together. I truly appreciate  it, especially during this very, very significant week.   Monday marked the third anniversary of the Muslim ban. We had a press  conference on that day. It was incredible to see the Senators and the  House Members and so many groups of great diverse backgrounds all  coming together to say that now is the time to pass H.R. 2214, the NO  BAN Act.   The failure of this ban was apparent the day it began. I will never  forget that day in January of 2017, just 3 years ago, when Donald Trump  announced his first Muslim ban, creating chaos and separating families  with no justification. I was on my way to a community event when I  received a frantic call about 50 Muslims who were being detained at LAX  for hours with no end in sight, despite the fact that they had green  cards and were legal.   At that point I decided to drop everything and help in any way I  could. I rushed over to LAX to advocate for these people, and once I  arrived I found out that indeed there were scores of people there with  a legal right to be here kept for hours with little food and blocked  from receiving legal advice from an attorney. It was outrageous.   When I pressed Customs and Border Protection for answers, they  resisted and blocked me. I even got them on the phone only to have them  hang up on me. I had never been more disrespected as a Member of  Congress, but disrespect and chaos is what this Muslim ban is all  about.   The pain and psychological trauma this travel ban has caused are long  lasting, spouses and fiances being separated, weddings, funerals and  graduations have been missed. People have not been able to come to take  care of sick ones. Over 5,000 adopted children of U.S. citizens cannot  join their families. None of these people are a threat to the U.S., and  we have every way of knowing that through our extensive vetting  process. But they have been made victims of this hateful ban  nonetheless.   It just doesn't have to be this way. When the Supreme Court upheld  the President's ability to issue these bans, the Court also required  the administration to grant waivers to ensure that the program had a  legitimate national security interest. But despite that requirement,  the State Department has approved only 10 percent of these applicants.  That means that the Trump administration believes that 90 percent of  all travelers from these countries are threats to our national  security, and it renders this waiver process virtually nonexistent.   That is outrageous. That is why we have to fight back, and that is  why last spring I introduced the NO BAN Act with Senator Chris Coons,  which is the best way to reclaim Congress' power and stop this ban.   First, it would repeal all three versions of President Trump's Muslim  ban, putting an immediate end to this family separation.   Second, it requires a report on the total number of waivers that were  granted and the total number that were denied, so we know the truth  about what has happened.   Third, our bill says that if a President does want to implement such  a ban in the future he would actually have to prove actual evidence of  a threat. This ensures in the future no individuals are denied entry  into the U.S. based solely on their religion.                                time  2030    With the President confirming that he now wants to expand this ban to  even more countries, now is the time to act.   The response to the NO BAN Act has been tremendous: 214 Members of  Congress have cosponsored the bill in the House, and over 480 groups  have endorsed it; 39 Members of the Senate are cosponsors.   In September of 2019, the House Judiciary and Foreign Affairs  Committees held a joint hearing that examined how few waivers have been  granted to individuals since the ban was issued, even though most  people applying for entry into the U.S. pose no threat to our country.   Just this week, Chairman Nadler announced that the bill will be  marked up in the Judiciary Committee in 2 weeks, and Speaker Pelosi  announced that the NO BAN Act will be brought to the floor for a vote.   This vote cannot happen soon enough for people like Ismail Alghazali,  who will be my guest at the State of the Union next week. Ismail is a  U.S. citizen who works at a small neighborhood market in New York, and,  in 2013, he married his wife, Hend, in Yemen. Hend applied for a visa  to join her husband in the U.S., but before her interview at the U.S.  Embassy in Djibouti, Trump's hateful Muslim ban went into effect.   Hend was 8 months pregnant, and her pregnancy has been difficult.  Doctors had discovered she had a heart condition. Ismail and Hend hoped  that that meant that they would be granted a waiver due to medical  reasons. But after an interview that lasted just 5 minutes, Hend was  denied a visa and left to give birth in Djibouti, while Ismail had to  return to the U.S. He was not able to witness the birth of his first  child.   Last year, in April, Hend gave birth to another daughter, and Ismail  has not been able to even meet his daughter for several months because  of the ban. Luckily, however, the family has now been reunited in the  United States.   But too many others are left waiting for no reason, other than the  President's prejudice.   We have every ability to vet people like Hend as we have done for  years.  [[Page H709]]  Leaving families divided by this ban is a choice. That is why we need  the NO BAN Act. It is essential that we take away the President's power  to put prejudice into policy before more countries and more families  are impacted by this hateful ban.   Madam Speaker, I thank all my colleagues who are here tonight for  their steadfast support of this bill, and I thank Congresswoman Tlaib.
