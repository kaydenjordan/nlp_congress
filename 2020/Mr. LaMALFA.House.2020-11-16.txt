 Mr. Speaker, many in the media or in opposition are  calling for President Trump to concede, but just as many are supporting  his pursuit of legitimate legal challenges.   A lack of transparency in the monitoring and vote counting process  has raised flags for many Americans, and if left unchecked, will  undermine the faith in our electoral process, an important integrity to  all Americans.   The President's team has hundreds of sworn affidavits from election  workers, postal employees, and election observers everywhere about  questionable activities in key States.   These workers do not have built-in safety guarantees like members of  the Washington swamp. They are regular Americans putting their  livelihoods on the line to speak up and protect our elections.   After 4 years of scare tactics, of fake impeachment, fraudulent  dossiers, and Russia witch hunts, the American people have a right to  know that every legal vote has been counted and all illegal votes  removed. Americans must have all questions surrounding the outcome of  this election answered before we can move forward so we do have  election integrity that we can count on.                            ____________________
