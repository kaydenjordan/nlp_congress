 Mr. President, we are on the eve of a new era of  space exploration. We are constructing the world's largest rocket and a  deep space capsule to send humans to Mars. Two new commercial crew  capsules are under construction to ferry astronauts to and from the  International Space Station starting later this year. Huge industrial  complexes to manufacture and process new rockets and satellites are  being built in record speed to further advance America's leadership in  space.   The successes of space exploration today are built upon the brave  efforts of NASA's past pioneers. I am saddened to note that, on January  5 of this year, we lost one of those national heroes, astronaut and  retired U.S. Navy CAPT John Young.   Captain Young has been called the astronaut's astronaut. Indeed, if  you ask around the astronaut corps who they most looked up to, my guess  is John Young's name would come up quite a bit.   Captain Young was among the second group of astronauts chosen for the  early space program. He flew to space six times, the only astronaut to  fly in the Gemini, Apollo, and space shuttle programs. In addition to  walking and driving a rover on the surface of the moon, Captain Young  commanded the very first space shuttle mission.   Taking off like a rocket and landing like an airplane, the space  shuttle could not be tested in space without a crew. It was perhaps the  riskiest flight, spaceflight ever endeavored; yet whether it was  landing on the Moon or rocketing off the pad in the space shuttle,  Captain Young was the essence of cool, his heart never topping 90 beats  per minute.   By the time John Young retired, he had spent over four decades at  NASA. First at the Navy and later at NASA, Young dedicated his entire  career to public service.   Throughout his career, Captain Young was a tireless advocate for  safety at the agency. He was a brilliant and intuitive engineer. He was  known for writing scathing memos regarding safety problems at the  agency, asking penetrating technical questions at reviews, and doing it  all with a simple ``tell it like it is'' country-boy mentality that he  never lost from his central Florida upbringing.   It may seem a contradiction that the man who commanded perhaps the  riskiest space mission in history was also one of the agency's most  outspoken advocates for safety, but it is not.   Captain Young strongly believed we must explore the unknown and push  further out into the cosmos, but he also believed the men and women who  bravely venture into space on all our behalves deserve the very best we  can do to bring them home safely.   We are seeing the fruits of nearly a decade of transformation and  renewal, while at the same time reverently marking the passing of the  first generation of space explorers. Just in the last few years, in  addition to John Young, we have lost John Glenn, Scott Carpenter, Gene  Cernan, Dick Gordon,  [[Page S346]]  Edgar Mitchell, and Neil Armstrong. We have also lost the great Sally  Ride. While we mourn the loss of these American heroes, we are forever  indebted to them for their extraordinary contributions to humanity.   I am so grateful NASA has had over the years the kinds of wisdom,  experience, and technical skills in its leadership that were so  embodied by heroes like Captain Young. We are extremely fortunate to  have, in NASA Acting Administrator Robert Lightfoot, a leader who is  universally acclaimed for his competence and professionalism. I have  the utmost confidence in Acting Administrator Lightfoot and am thankful  to have his steady hand on the tiller. I will continue to fight to see  that NASA has leadership that carries on the tradition of having true  space professionals at the helm of such an important agency.                            ____________________     Mr. President, many of us have participated over the last  few hours in several conversations trying to bring the parties  together, and, indeed, a lot of movement has occurred. There seems to  be one substantial issue remaining in which things could come together.  So I am going to ask that we delay the shutdown for at least 1 day.   Most of us on this floor do not want a shutdown. Since there were  discussions here in earnest in a bipartisan way, we ought to give those  discussions a chance to bear fruit.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the  immediate consideration of Calendar No. 36, H.R. 1301; that the  amendment at the desk that would provide for a continuing resolution to  fund the government through Saturday, January 20, 2018, be considered  and agreed to, the bill, as amended, be considered read a third time  and passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table with no intervening action or debate.
