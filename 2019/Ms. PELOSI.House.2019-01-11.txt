 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Cummings for bringing this  important legislation to the floor in very expeditious time. The Senate  passed it by unanimous consent yesterday, and here we are today, on the  first day that some of our Federal employees will miss their paycheck,  and Congress is saying and guaranteeing that workers will be paid, not  only for this shutdown but, God forbid, if we have any future ones,  that their pay will be guaranteed.                                time  1100    I support the bill. I am glad that it has strong bipartisan support  as it did in the Senate and that the President has given the impression  that he will sign the bill.   It ensures that 800,000 Federal employees who are going without pay  because of the senseless shutdown will ultimately get the backpay they  deserve. But it is scarce consolation for these workers who are  desperate to make ends meet right now. Their paychecks are going to be  late, but they must pay their bills on time and in full.   The impact of a missed paycheck is catastrophic in the lives of these  Americans when they can't pay their mortgage, their rent, their  utilities, bills, their car payments, children's tuition on time, and  the list goes on. It affects their credit rating, and it affects the  credit rating of the United States of America.   I am particularly concerned about the impact that it has on our  veterans. A large percentage of the Federal workforce are veterans.  They have taken their commitment to public service in the military to  public service on the civilian side. We don't do any favors for our  friends, our veterans and military families, if we affect their credit  rating.   So, today, the press reported that workers are desperately taking to  the internet to sell some of their household items and other things,  sometimes at a very reduced price, for just a couple of dollars just to  pay their bills. This is just not right. It is just not right that we  would subject people who work, and we say two things to them: come to  work and don't get paid, or shut them out so they can't come to work.  And while they are not getting paid, again, thousands of these men and  women are expected to show up for work.   Sending these workers their paycheck late is wrong. We keep saying  that. It is wrong. But since there is a guarantee that they will be  getting paid, I would hope that the commercial banks, the banks in our  country, would follow the lead of some of the credit unions by giving  interest-free loans right now to these families so that they can pay  their bills on time and they can be respected for the work they do or  are anticipated to do.   This shutdown, by the way, is soon to become the longest in history,  and it is creating chaos in our communities. It fails to have us, the  government, meet the needs of the American people. We are endangering  the safety of our food supply and the security of our airlines. The  eviction of vulnerable families is affected, as is the support of our  farmers, and for their support systems, as well as food stamps for the  hungry and tax refunds to the American people, and the ability of the  IRS to supply information to taxpayers who want to pay their taxes but  need guidance. It is a needless crisis that is inflicting pain on the  American people.   Democrats support effective border security. We honor our oath of  office to protect and defend, to protect and defend our borders, our  country, our people, and our Constitution.   We need to look at the facts.   According to the DEA--when the President says, ``Oh, we have got to  stop the drugs coming into the country,'' well, let's look at the  facts. The DEA says that almost all--90 percent--of illicit drugs  coming into the country come in through legal ports of entry. If that  is the President's concern, and it is a legitimate concern that we all  share, we need to build the infrastructure, increase the size of  infrastructure of the legitimate ports of entry--those are ports of  entry for immigration, for trade--and to stop the unwelcome in terms of  drugs, contraband, and weapons coming into our country. So more  infrastructure, improve the roads there to facilitate.   We also need--the technology exists--and we have all committed that  we would pay whatever it is, $400 million or more, for the technology  to scan the cars, scan the cars for the drugs and the other contraband.  So, again, technology is our friend in this, and it is a very  effective, proven way to protect us from those intrusions.   We can hire more personnel, which we must do. There are thousands of  unfilled positions with the Border Patrol. We must have more people to  do the job there.   Much of what I am saying here is what the administration--well, the  Department of Homeland Security--asked for; and we said yes in the  appropriations bills, and here we are having that fight later.   We can have more investment in innovation to detect unauthorized  crossings. We don't need, like the President first described, a  concrete wall, 30 feet high, paid for by Mexico. Cross out all of the  above. It is not that.   But the fact is, spending money on whatever that is that the  President is describing it now as is an opportunity cost for doing what  we know will work to secure our border--all of our borders--all of our  borders.   There is a humanitarian challenge for us at the border that we have  to deal with in a way that is consistent with our values but also  protects our border. What the President is proposing--in fact, he has  exacerbated the problem with his cruel policies of taking children out  of the arms of their parents, separating families. The list goes on.   But to the point of securing the border in a strong, cost-effective,  values-based way, Democrats have made their proposal. The proposals  have bipartisan support.  [[Page H500]]    And let me just say, just before this bill came up on the floor, we  had the legislation to pass a bill--passed by the Senate--to open up  the Department of the Interior and related agencies there. We have said  to the Republicans and to the President that we will accept ideas, good  ideas, wherever they come from, and these ideas came from the United  States Senate, controlled by the Republicans up until this new  Congress. Just within the last month, they controlled that--well, they  still do control the Senate.   They put forth legislation on the floor of the Senate in a minibus  that passed, 92-6. We said: Let's take your language; let's embrace  your language; let's pass it on the House. And you, once again, pass  your own language. They won't take yes for an answer.    That might be part of a legitimate debate, but why do you have to  shut down government?   I say to the President: ``Don't you have confidence in your own ideas  that you have to shut down government to increase your leverage and  then threaten to take extraordinary measures when the answer is very  simple?''   Let's open up government. Let's have a civilized debate, and let's do  so in a way that honors our values as we protect our borders and meet  the needs of the American people.   I urge a ``yes,'' and I am glad that we are going to come out with a  bipartisan vote.   And, again, I thank Mr. Cummings for his extraordinary leadership in  so many ways, most recently, on this legislation.
