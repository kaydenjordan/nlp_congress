 Mr. President, for the Committee on Armed Services I report  favorably the following nomination lists which were printed in the  Records on the dates indicated, and ask unanimous consent, to save the  expense of reprinting on the Executive Calendar that these nominations  lie at the Secretary's desk for the information of Senators.    Madam President, I am reintroducing the Stop Subsidizing  Multimillion Dollar Corporate Bonuses Act with Senators Blumenthal,  Whitehouse, Merkley, Baldwin, Warren, Van Hollen, and Sanders. This  legislation would finally fully close a loophole that allows publicly  traded corporations to deduct the cost of multimillion-dollar bonuses  from their corporate tax bills. At a time when the gulf in pay between  CEOs and average workers is 272 to 1, it is infuriating that U.S.  taxpayers are being forced to subsidize lavish executive compensation  packages, but that is what is happening.   Under section 162(m) of the Tax Code, publicly traded corporations  cannot deduct more than $1 million in compensation paid to their top  executives. But section 162(m) does not cover compensation paid to all  public company employees, and corporations have long exploited this  loophole to claim tax deductions for executive compensation packages  that far exceed $1 million. Indeed, publicly traded corporations are  offering these lucrative compensation deals to ever increasing numbers  of executives--not just a few at the very top of the organization.   Both Republican and Democratic administrations have recognized the  need to close loopholes in section 162(m). Indeed, both President Trump  and President Biden signed laws based on earlier versions of my  legislation in order to curtail the abuse of this deduction. This  includes ensuring that performance-based compensation is actualjy  counted as compensation under section 162(m) and increasing the number  of highly paid executives who are subject to section 162(m). Partially  tightening the law in these ways has saved taxpayers well over $9.2  billion. But the full loophole has still not been closed and taxpayers  continue to subsidize billions of dollars in extravagant compensation.   The Stop Subsidizing Multimillion Dollar Corporate Bonuses Act would  address the remaining gaps by applying section 162(m) restrictions to  all employees of publicly traded corporations so that all compensation  is subject to a deductibility cap of $1 million per employee.   To be clear, under my bill, publicly traded corporations would still  be able to pay their executives as much as they desire, but individual  compensation packages above and beyond $1 million would no longer be  subsidized through our Tax Code. This is a matter of fairness. It  ensures that corporations and shareholders--not hard-working  taxpayers--are shouldering the cost of the multimillion-dollar  compensation packages they provide to their top earners.   I thank Public Citizen, Americans for Financial Reform, the AFL-CIO,  the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, MIT Professor Simon  Johnson, Take On Wall Street, and the Institute for Policy Studies,  Global Economy Project for their support. I urge our colleagues to join  us in cosponsoring this legislation and pressing for its passage.                            ____________________     Madam President, I am reintroducing the Stop Subsidizing  Multimillion Dollar Corporate Bonuses Act with Senators Blumenthal,  Whitehouse, Merkley, Baldwin, Warren, Van Hollen, and Sanders.
