 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.J.  Res. 2, proposing a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution of  the United States.   This proposal comes at a critical time for our country. Years of  unchecked spending have led to massive deficits. At the same time,  threats at home and abroad, crumbling infrastructure, and natural  disasters have forced the government to do more. These two parallel  situations require tough decisionmaking, but that is what the American  people expect us to do.   As I talk to constituents in my district, one of the issues they  continually ask about is the ballooning Federal debt that will be  passed on to their kids and grandkids.   Hardworking Kansans have to balance their checkbook every month. I  served as Kansas State Treasurer where we also had to balance our  budget for the State of Kansas. I don't think there is any reason that  the Federal Government should get a pass. That is why I am proud to  support this resolution, which requires the government to spend within  its means.   During the past year, we have accomplished a lot to help families  across America. Cutting regulations and passing the Tax Cuts and Jobs  Act have helped get government out of the way and our economy growing.  Workers are seeing bonuses and larger paychecks. Companies are  reinvesting in America. This growth has allowed us to make significant  investments in our military, disaster relief, agriculture, and other  areas important to Kansans.                                time  1445    However, to build on this progress, we need time to implement  policies that will protect future generations from crippling debt. This  proposal is a great start and long overdue.   Let me be clear: this is not a silver bullet. Balancing our budget  and reducing our debt will require reforming our entitlement programs  and prioritizing our spending. I also believe it will require recisions  to the budget, and today I call on the President and the Congress to  implement those spending cuts which would work towards our goal of  fiscal responsibility and stability. This amendment and recisions are a  needed start to that difficult, yet immensely important, task before  us. The future of our country depends on it, and I urge my colleagues  to support this resolution.
