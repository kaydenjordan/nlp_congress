 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life  of Mr. Craig Harney, who passed away on November 30 at the age of 65  after battling cancer.   Mr. Harney was a stalwart of Savannah journalism--unbelievably  dedicated to his craft at WTOC--and largely responsible for making WTOC  the Southeast news leader.   He began at the news station 40 years ago, while a student in  college, with a part-time job answering the phone. By the end of his  career, he had worked his way up to become WTOC's creative director  and, at different points, held nearly every position at the station.   His colleagues remember that he knew how to get to the heart of the  story and that he was interested in doing everything he could to help  shine a light on what made our community so special. It was this effort  and talent that he put into his stories, which made our area a better  place to live and exemplified Mr. Harney as a true Savannahian.   His vibrant personality, always meandering throughout our communities  in search of stories to highlight, is simply irreplaceable.   My thoughts and prayers will be with his family, friends, and all of  his colleagues at WTOC during this most difficult time.                            ____________________
