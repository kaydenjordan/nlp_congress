 Mr. Speaker, we finally had a vote to ensure that the  [[Page H623]]  military gets the money that they need and deserve. They deserve to be  paid even better, but they certainly do not deserve to have their  funding cut, not holding our military hostage in demand for people who  had come into the country illegally.   The American public made clear that they did not want the whole  country to suffer because they were being held hostage, while some  folks demanded legality for people who came in illegally. Let's keep  things separately. Let's keep our military going forward, and now let's  go about the business of the country.                            ____________________
