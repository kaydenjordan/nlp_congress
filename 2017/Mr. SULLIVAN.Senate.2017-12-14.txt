 Mr. President, once a week when we are in session, I  come to the floor to recognize a person or group of people in my great  State of Alaska who make it very special. We call them our Alaskan of  the Week.   Alaska is beautiful, it is big, and it is special. Right now, much of  the State is gearing up for the skiing season. Snow is out, and there  is nothing more beautiful and invigorating than taking to the slopes of  Alaska. It is also a great time to see the Northern Lights dancing in  the sky. So I urge everybody to come out to Alaska. Winter or summer,  it will be the trip of a lifetime.   Of course, it is much more than snow and beautiful dancing lights;  our people are what make us so special--rugged, independent, generous,  and giving to their families, their communities, our State, and our  country.   Alaska is a patriotic State--I would argue, the most patriotic State  in our great Nation. For one, we have the most veterans per capita of  any State in America. We have the very best military forces, and we  have a lot of them. Let me name just a few.   We have the Army's 1st Stryker Brigade, based at Fort Wainwright.  Chike Springer, one of my staffers helping me out here, served there in  the 1st Stryker Brigade's Aviation Task Force. We have the Northern  Warfare Training Center; the 59th Signal Battalion; the 17th Combat  Sustainment Support Battalion; the Air Force's Third Wing, 11th Air  Force; the 176th Wing; the 673rd Air Base Wing; the Air Force  reservists of the 477th Fighter Group; the 354th at Eielson; and the  213th Space Warning Squadron at Clear Air Force Station. You get the  picture--some of the best military forces. The 49th Missile Defense  Battalion, the cornerstone of America's missile defense, protecting the  entire Nation, is right there at Fort Greely. These are the thousands  of men and women in the Reserves and on Active Duty who are stationed  in our great State. We are proud of them, and we owe them and their  families a huge debt of gratitude for their service, especially now  that we are approaching the holiday season.   Today, I want to particularly recognize the men and women who make up  the 4th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division--the only airborne  brigade combat team in the Pacific theater and in the Arctic. As my  colleagues on the Armed Services Committee know, they are referred to  in Alaska and throughout the Army as the 4-25. This unit, over 3,000  men and women strong, is our Alaskans of the Week.   I want to talk a little bit about the 4-25. It has a very strong  lineage and heritage. Although it was created relatively recently--in  2004--and was the first new U.S. airborne unit created since the end of  World War II, its heritage springs from the 25th Infantry Division,  which was first activated in 1941 and played a seminal role in World  War II and all of our country's conflicts since.   Just like the 25th Infantry Division, the 4-25 has played a major  role in our country's conflicts since its inception. Members of the 4- 25 have deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, to  Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, and just last  September, a couple months ago, they were again deployed to Afghanistan  to train and advise Afghan security forces.   As part of a larger drawdown of our military and the Army--a  misguided drawdown by the previous administration, announced in 2015-- the 4-25 was part of 40,000 Active-Duty Army soldiers to be cut, just  gotten rid of. This would have been an enormous strategic mistake for  the Army and for America's national security, especially as it related  to the 4-25, the only mountain, cold weather, airborne BCT in the  entire Arctic and Asia Pacific. They are also a critical reserve force  for any contingency on the Korean Peninsula given how close we in  Alaska are to Korea.   So what happened? Alaskans circled the wagons. Rallies with hundreds,  if not thousands, of my fellow Alaskans came out in our great State,  urging the Department of Defense and the U.S. Army: Don't make this  mistake. Don't cut this unit. Keep it intact.   Here in Washington, we did our work. I had a heart-to-heart with a  number of senior Army and DOD officials with one simple goal in mind:  to get them to personally visit this unit, to come see them train, to  see how capable they were, and to understand their strategic value to  America's national security. And that happened. Many senior Army  officials--the Army Chief of Staff and the Secretary of the Army--went  to Alaska, went to JRTC, and watched the 4-25 in action.   I remember standing on the second floor of a building in a mock  Middle Eastern town watching members of the 4-25 jump into an LZ at  JRTC in the middle of the night for a nighttime airfield seizure  operation. There is something awe-inspiring about watching 1,000  airborne paratroopers silently fall out of the night sky to seize  terrain--something that probably sends chills up the spine of our  Nation's enemies.   Fast-forward to today. Of the 40,000 soldiers slated to be cut from  the U.S. Army, only one unit was spared--one--and it was the 4-25. Why  did this happen? It happened because they made it happen. This great  unit saved themselves. When the Army's top brass went to Alaska, went  to Fort Polk and watched them train at JRTC, they saw what a great unit  this was and realized they were making a big mistake. When General  Milley, Chief of Staff of the Army, made the final decision to reverse  the previous decision of the Army and retain the 4-25, he said it was  ``one of the most trained and ready units in the entire United States  Army.'' That was the Chief of Staff of the Army.   The 4-25 didn't rest. They are deployed, back in Afghanistan.  Unfortunately, while deployed, just a few days ago, on December 11,  Alaska lost a son and the 4-25 lost one of its own as part  [[Page S8038]]  of this mission. It is heartbreaking for the families and for the unit.  These brave young men and women are willing to sacrifice and have  already sacrificed, and our prayers are with them during these  holidays.   They are our Alaskans of the Week.   I plan on visiting them overseas during the holidays. My wife Julie  will also be attending an event this weekend in Anchorage for the  families of those who are deployed, showing our support and our respect  for the men and women in this unit and their families, because, as many  know, when a family is deployed, it is not just the young man and woman  in the unit who sacrifice, it is the entire family.   To the families, we say thank you, from the bottom of our hearts, for  your service and sacrifice. To the men and women who make up the 4-25,  we also say thank you for all you are doing for us--for serving us, for  keeping us safe, for protecting this country, when Americans are  enjoying the holidays.   I look forward to seeing you in theater. Please be assured that all  Members of this body--Senators, Democrats, Republicans--know your  record of service and wish all of you Godspeed this holiday season.  Thank you for being our Alaskans of the Week.   Army Strong. Arctic Tough. Sparta Lives.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to commend this body. My  colleagues, every single Senator, voted in unanimous consent to move  forward on the National Defense Authorization Act, which was signed  into law just this week by President Trump. In particular, I want to  thank the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, John McCain, who  did so much to shepherd this important piece of legislation through  this body and to the President's desk. I thank Senator McCain for all  his service and sacrifice to America for decades.   The NDAA, as we all know, is an important, critical piece of  legislation, boosting our national security, rebuilding our military  readiness, and protecting the men and women in uniform who serve our  Nation. It has been a piece of legislation that for 56 consecutive  years on a bipartisan basis has moved through the Senate and the House  to be signed by the President. Many times you hear there is not a lot  of bipartisanship that is going on in Washington. On issues like this,  there is. This bill, which authorizes almost $700 billion for our  troops who need it, passed the Senate unanimously.   Not all the members of the military had their bill, which authorized  spending and funding for what they are doing, moved through the  Congress. Unfortunately, our men and women in the U.S. Coast Guard--our  Nation's fifth branch of service--have been, once again, left behind.  The NDAA covers the Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marines.   The Coast Guard Authorization Act focuses on the heroic men and women  in the Coast Guard. This year, we worked hard on that bill, S. 1129,  the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2017. I sponsored this bill with  Chairman John Thune, the chairman of the Commerce Committee; Ranking  Member Bill Nelson; and Senator Lisa Murkowski. This bipartisan bill-- and it is very bipartisan--will give the Coast Guard the resources it  needs to protect our waterways and coastlines, block illegal  traffickers and smugglers of drugs, and more efficiently procure future  Coast Guard cutters, which our country, and my State, desperately need.  It is a very, very important bill.   In constructing this legislation, we worked in a bipartisan manner  for months. However, despite broad support from both Republicans and  Democrats, it appears the Coast Guard Authorization Act--a critical  bill for homeland security, for the safety of our mariners and  fishermen, and for showing support to the thousands of men and women  who serve in the Coast Guard--has become stuck.   As chairman of the committee responsible for the U.S. Coast Guard, I  must speak up for the men and women of this important service and the  critical services they provide. This bill should have been moving  months ago. Not only does this bill contain critical needs and  authorizations and funding authorizations for the Coast Guard, it also  contains provisions of vital importance to our maritime and fishing  communities. Included in this legislation is important language to  permanently fix an issue that has been around for years--one that  pertains to incidental discharges for those in our fishing fleets. It  is also known as the Vessel Incidental Discharge Act, or VIDA, as part  of the Coast Guard bill.   Currently, vessel owners and operators are forced to comply with a  patchwork of burdensome Federal and State regulations for vessel  ballast water and incidental discharges. This creates inefficiency,  adds costs, and inhibits economic prosperity for my State and for the  country, while not providing a uniform standard to protect the  environment, which is also critical. This fix that is in the Coast  Guard bill would provide the maritime industry, the fishing industry,  with a consistent, uniform regulatory structure, restoring cost- effective commerce while also ensuring environmental protection of our  Nation's ports, waterways, and fisheries. Notably, for a large number  of my constituents, this provision--the VIDA provision in the Coast  Guard bill--provides a permanent exemption on incidental vessel  discharge for all fishing vessels and small commercial boats.   It is very important because previous legislation required even small  fishing vessels to get a discharge permit from the EPA to simply hose  down their decks. These fishing vessels and small vessels are facing  potential noncompliance if we fail to pass the Coast Guard bill soon.  They should not be penalized for the refusal of some of my colleagues-- very few of my colleagues--who are opponents of this important fix to  allow for what we think is a bipartisan, negotiated solution to move  forward.   The fix in this bill on VIDA is supported by all segments of the  maritime industry, with U.S. and international vessel owners and  operators, fishing vessels--both large and small--passenger vessels,  charter boat operators, labor unions, the Navy League of the United  States, marine terminals, and port authorities throughout the country,  just to name a few, all in support.   There is broad bipartisan support and agreement by Democrats and  Republicans that this bill--with the VIDA provision in the Coast Guard  Authorization Act--should move forward. I was going to come here this  evening and ask unanimous consent that we pass the bill now. Out of  respect for some of my colleagues who are still working in good faith  on this issue, I have decided to refrain from that, but we are losing  patience.   There have been numerous suggested compromises to help get a few  Senators to yes on this. We have accepted almost every single one of  them. We are negotiating in good faith. We even held a big meeting this  afternoon with many staff on another suggestion, which the EPA said was  an unworkable idea.   I believe we are now down to one single issue on this important piece  of legislation. Out of respect for my colleagues--one of whom I just  got off the phone with, the Senator from Michigan, whom I have a very  close working relationship on the committee that oversees the Coast  Guard because he is my ranking member--we are going to try to work  through the weekend and resolve this. I hope that the remaining  Senators act in good faith. What we don't want to see, as we accept  every single compromise put forward, is the goalpost continuously being  moved.   The deadline is fast approaching for our fishermen and maritime  fleet. We must get this done. The deadline has long past to show that  we respect, care for, and want to do all we can to support the men and  women in the Coast Guard the way we support the other military  services, as we saw this week when President Trump passed a very  bipartisan NDAA.   I call on all of my colleagues to work through the weekend so that we  can get to yes on this very important bill--the Coast Guard bill--and  so that we can support them the way we are supporting the other men and  women in our military.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.
