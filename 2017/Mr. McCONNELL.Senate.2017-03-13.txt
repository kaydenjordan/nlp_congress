 Mr. President, last year, Bill Clinton called  ObamaCare ``the craziest thing in the world.'' Over the weekend, former  Obama Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said  President Clinton had a point.   Of course, ObamaCare is crazy. Premiums are spiking across the  country by 25 percent nationwide and as much as 47 percent in Kentucky  for individuals. Choices have fallen from coast to coast, with about  one-third of the counties nationwide and nearly half in Kentucky having  only a single insurer to choose from on the exchanges, and healthcare  markets are teetering closer to the edge of collapse. The ObamaCare  status quo is simply not an option.   We have an obligation to the American people to repeal and replace  ObamaCare. We have a three-pronged process to get there. The first is  the legislation. House committees are currently considering the  specialized piece of legislation that allows us to repeal ObamaCare and  implement some, but not all, of the important replacement reforms we  want to make.   Another is an additional replacement reform that goes even further in  making healthcare more affordable and accessible. The remaining prong  is Executive action. There is much the administration can do to help  bring calm out of chaos from Obama's broken promises. Health and Human  Services Secretary Tom Price has already taken steps to do just that,  and the nominee before us, Seema Verma, who has been nominated to head  the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, can take important  steps as well.   Ms. Verma is extremely qualified, with a health policy background and  a record of success. She is committed to protecting Medicare and  modernizing Medicaid so the programs deliver the best results for those  who need it. She also understands the challenges that ObamaCare has  created for families.   Remember, ObamaCare raided funds from Medicare. Remember, ObamaCare  dramatically enlarged Medicaid beyond its core focus without improving  health outcomes in States like mine. Now is the time for creative  thinking to increase access and to lower costs. Now is the time for a  CMS Administrator with the right experience as we repeal and replace  ObamaCare. I know this nominee will strengthen the vital programs she  has been tasked to lead because she has a history of doing just that. I  look forward to confirming Ms. Verma later today so that she can get to  work immediately developing solutions to the crisis of ObamaCare.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the endorsements for Supreme Court  nominee Judge Neil Gorsuch keep rolling in from across the political  spectrum. As I noted last Thursday, more than 150 former Columbia  University classmates joined that extensive list recently. Those  classmates represented a variety of backgrounds, home States, faiths,  and political views. But they all agreed on one thing--that Judge  Gorsuch is extremely well-qualified to be our next Supreme Court  Justice.   On Thursday, I also noted that we could expect more supporters with  sterling reviews of the judge in the near future. Sure enough, that  very evening the American Bar Association awarded Judge Gorsuch the  highest possible rating: unanimously ``well qualified,'' meaning no one  on the reviewing panel found him other than ``well qualified''-- unanimously ``well qualified.''   The Democratic leader and the former Democratic chairman of the  Judiciary Committee have called the ABA ``the gold standard by which  judicial candidates are judged.'' So on the gold standard, Neil Gorsuch  got a unanimous ``well qualified.'' There is no higher score. And  today, it is a group that believes Judge Gorsuch is ``well qualified''  to be a Supreme Court  [[Page S1754]]  Justice based on his integrity, professional competence, and judicial  temperament. That is high acclaim from an organization that our  colleagues on the left have long considered, as I said, the gold  standard. It is the type of acclaim we keep hearing from Democrats and  Republicans in the legal community.   Judge Gorsuch has an impressive resume and impressive credentials to  match. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Columbia in just 3 years and  got his law degree from Harvard, and he is an Oxford scholar to boot.  The Senate confirmed him to his current position on the circuit court  without a single vote in opposition. He is the right jurist for the  job.   As we move forward with his nomination later this month, we should  give him the fair consideration, debate, and up-or-down vote that he  deserves, just like we did with the four Supreme Court nominees of  Presidents Clinton and Obama after they were first elected.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  recess subject to the call of the Chair.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 2:09 p.m., recessed subject  to the call of the Chair and reassembled at 2:24 p.m. when called to  order by the Presiding Officer (Mr. Kennedy).                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I  move to table the motion to reconsider.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Mr. President, I move that the Senate proceed to  executive session to consider Calendar No. 23, Daniel Coats to be  Director of National Intelligence.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Mr. President, I move that the Senate proceed to  executive session to consider Calendar No. 19, Herbert R. McMaster,  Jr., to be Lieutenant General.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum calls be waived.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to H.J. Res. 42.    Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to a legend  in broadcasting. For decades, radio listeners in Kentucky and across  the eastern United States tuned in to hear Milton Metz. El Metzo, as he  was affectionately known, passed away in January of this year at the  age of 95.   Known for his show, ``Metz Here,'' Milton provided fair and well- informed news for thousands of listeners. In his time at WHAS radio in  Louisville, KY, Milton almost became part of listeners' families.  During his years on the air, he covered a wide variety of topics and  helped his listeners sort out the issues of the day.   Like so many other Kentuckians, I grew up tuning into Milton's shows.  When I first ran for Jefferson County judge/executive, I appeared on  his show. We talked about the issues in my campaign, and although he  asked tough questions, he was always fair. Milton welcomed differing  opinions and treated his guests and callers with civility. He became a  staple of political campaigns, and I appeared on his show multiple  times in my campaigns for the U.S. Senate.   Milton represented a different age of diplomatic and gracious  programming that listeners of all opinions and interests listened to  and trusted. He also made a name for himself covering the Kentucky  Derby. Frequently appearing in ``Millionaires Row,'' Milton interviewed  celebrities and guests who came to Louisville for the ``Fastest Two  Minutes in Sports.'' In 1989, he was inducted into the Kentucky  Journalism Hall of Fame, an honor he surely deserved.   I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the life and career of  Milton Metz, a true radio pioneer. He earned great acclaim in Kentucky  and across the Nation, and his legacy will not soon be forgotten.   The Courier-Journal published an article on Milton Metz's career. I  ask unanimous consent that a copy of the article be printed in the  Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                 [From the Courier-Journal, Jan. 12, 2017]                 Local Radio Legend Milton Metz Dead at 95                            (By Andrew Wolfson)         Milton Metz, a pioneer in broadcasting in Louisville and       the longtime host of the talk show ``Metz Here'' on WHAS       Radio, died Thursday, according to former colleagues Wayne       Perkey and Terry Meiners.        He was 95 and died at Magnolia Springs, a senior living       facility, Perkey said.        ``El Metzo,'' as he was affectionately known, began at the       station in 1946. ``Metz Here'' debuted July 30, 1959, with       the title ``Juniper 5-2385,'' after its phone number, and       ended on June 10, 1993.        ``Every time Milton Metz clicked on the mic, people across       middle America were guaranteed wit, wisdom, and balance,''       Meiners said.        ``On or off the air, Milton was first and foremost a       gentleman, bringing grace and intellect into a sometimes       inelegant media landscape,'' Meiners said. ``Rest easy,       brother. You blazed a beautiful trail and we shall follow.''        Perkey said Metz was a role model and father figure for a       younger generation of broadcasters that included Meiners,       Perkey and Jack Fox.        ``He was not afraid to ask difficult questions, but he       tried to be fair,'' Perkey said. ``He had a great wit and he       showed it. I loved him because he was Milton.''        Bob Johnson, a retired political reporter on WHAS Radio and       TV, said that unlike contemporary talk radio, his show never       featured ``talking heads shouting at each other.''        ``He had a sweet, gentle nature and his graciousness       carried over into his work on the air,'' said Johnson, later       a Courier-Journal reporter. ``I was very fond of him.''        Perry Metz said his father enjoyed ``a good joke, a long       conversation and listening to different points of view.        ``If civility is old-fashioned, you could say he was old-      fashioned,'' said the younger  [[Page S1773]]       Metz, who followed in his father's footsteps and now runs       public radio and TV stations at Indiana University in       Bloomington.        Metz could be serious on the air but at a roast held when       he retired he recalled how a publicity agent had called       plugging his client's appearance.        ``She's written `Why Diets Don't Work,' '' the agent said.       ``But if that doesn't appeal to you, we could talk about her       new book, `The One-Hour Orgasm.' ''        He also carefully guarded his age.        In an interview with Courier-Journal columnist Torn Dorsey       in 1993, he would only say, ``Let's just say I'm older than       Diane Sawyer and younger than Mike Wallace.'' Wallace was 75       at the time.        Sportscasting legend Cawood Ledford, who spent 22 years at       WHAS with Metz, once recalled that when Metz started his       program back in the 1950s the dial was full of talk shows.        Ledford joked that he would like to say that Metz's       popularity drove the other shows off the air, but the truth       was that Metz simply outlived them all.        He was born in Cleveland to a Russian-born father and       English-born mother and started his radio career in the 1930s       in Cleveland after graduating from Ohio State University.        After serving in the army in World War II, he joined the       staff at WHAS radio in 1946. The same year, Milton began       recording Talking Books at American Printing House for the       Blind.        ``Metz Here'' became the longest-running show in Louisville       and one of the longest-running in the country. On WHAS-TV, he       co-hosted and co-produced ``Omelet,'' a talk and interview       program for nine years and was the Channel 11 weatherman for       19 years.        He also interviewed countless celebrities on the first       Saturday in May during WHAS-TV's traditional marathon pre-      race show before the Kentucky Derby, where he was a fixture       on ``Millionaire's Row.''        Metz was inducted into the Kentucky Journalism Hall of Fame       in 1989.        Joe Elliott, who took over Metz' time slot after he Metz       retired, said that Metz was a legend, not only in Kentucky       but to listeners through the Midwest and up and down the East       Coast, who caught his show on WHAS's 50,000-watt clear       channel transmitter.        ``What I loved about Milton was that he was a master at       everything he did,'' Elliott said.        Elliott and Perkey said Metz would record shows in the       afternoon on WHAS-FM, then a classical station, then do a       daily business report on WHAS-AM, then the weather for TV,       then his talk show, then the 11 p.m. news on television.        ``He did everything and anything he needed to do,'' said       Elliott.        Perry Metz said his father was pained by the coarseness of       contemporary talk radio.        ``Anyone who listened to ``Metz Here'' knew it was a show       based on listeners, not him,'' Perry Metz said. ``You could       listen to him for years and not know his views.''        ``People would call him from across the country and across       the political spectrum because they knew they could speak       their piece and he wouldn't try to show them up or embarrass       them.''                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of a  devoted public servant, A. Duane Schwartz, who passed away earlier this  year.   Duane was widely admired for his strong fidelity to the law and his  dedication to justice. For 20 years, he served the Western District of  Kentucky as the head of the criminal division of the U.S. attorney's  office and, during that time, successfully prosecuted the Imperial  Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan in Louisville. He also helped end what was  then the largest methamphetamine lab in the Midwest. Duane fought for  justice and left his community better than he found it.   He also worked to keep government accountable to the people. As a  leader in Operation Boptrot, Duane led the undercover investigation  against and eventual conviction of many State legislators for taking  bribes.   Duane earned the praise of multiple U.S. attorneys under whom he  worked and was awarded the Justice Department's Special Achiever Award  by Attorney General Janet Reno in 1999.   I was proud to know Duane as a classmate in law school. Even back  then, he was known for his integrity, commitment, and warmth. I would  like to extend my deepest condolences to his wife, Ann, and I would ask  all of my colleagues here to join me in honoring this distinguished  servant of the law.   The Courier-Journal published an article on Duane's career. I ask  unanimous consent that a copy of the article be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the Courier-Journal, Jan 11, 2017]                 Veteran Prosecutor A. Duane Schwartz Dies                            (By Andrew Wolfson)         A. Duane Schwartz, who supervised the prosecution of public       corruption probe Operation Boptrot as the longtime head of       the criminal division of the U.S. Attorney's office in       Louisville, died Saturday at his home. He was 74.        Schwartz was diagnosed seven years ago with Alzheimer's       disease, according to his daughter, Jennifer Scutchfield, an       attorney and city council member in Lexington.        During two separate tenures in the office, Schwartz       successfully prosecuted the Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux       Klan in Louisville as well as defendants responsible for the       then-largest methamphetamine lab in the Midwest, according to       a citation from the Justice Department.        He led the prosecution of Boptrot, the undercover       investigation that resulted in conviction of more than a       dozen state legislators from 1992 to 1995 for taking bribes       and other inducements.        More recently, in 1999, he tried and convicted Brennan       Callan for partially sinking the Belle of Louisville, winning       a 30-month sentence and an order for $987,000 in restitution.        Former U.S. Attorney Joe Whittle in an interview Wednesday       called Schwartz ``an all-American guy'' and one of the best       prosecutors he ever worked with.        ``I valued his counsel on whether to prosecute or not,''       Whittle said. ``He was a moral man.''        John Kuhn, the current U.S. attorney, said in a statement       that Schwartz was ``universally recognized as an outstanding       prosecutor, a sage leader, and a warm, faithful, loving       friend. Duane elevated the quality of our work and       strengthened our commitment to justice.''        Schwartz ran track and played basketball, baseball and       football at Atherton High School, and despite a car accident       that he later said ruined his knees, he was recruited by       several universities before deciding on the University of       Kentucky, where his father wanted him to go so he could see       him play.        But coach Blanton Collier left after Schwartz's freshman       year and his successor, Charlie Bradshaw, ``turned football       into a nightmare,'' Schwartz said years later when he was       honored by Atherton. His experience is cited in author       Shannon Ragland's ``The Thin Thirty: The Untold Story of       Brutality, Scandal and Redemption Schwartz's for Charlie       Bradshaw's 1962 Kentucky Football Team.'' Schwartz switched       to baseball, won a scholarship and lettered in the sport for       three years.        After graduating from UK's law school in 1967, he returned       to Louisville, where he was general counsel for Tube Turns,       served from 1971 as a prosecutor in the U.S. attorney's       office, and then left to work for 10 years as regional       counsel for the U.S. Postal Service. He returned to the U.S.       attorney's office where he was chief of the criminal section       for 20 years until his retirement in 2004.        He was honored by Attorney General Janet Reno for superior       service in 1999 and also won the Justice Department's special       achiever award.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to Dr.  David Stevens, a tireless advocate for public health in Kentucky who  passed away at the age of 87. He dedicated his life to serving others,  and he leaves behind a legacy of vision and leadership.   For 16 years, David served in the Lexington-Fayette Urban County  Government. As a councilmember, he was a leading voice and advocate to  make his community a healthier place to live.   Before his service in local government, David was an orthopedic  surgeon. His career included two decades as the chief of staff of  Shriner's Hospital for Children, an international nonprofit that  provides healthcare to children, regardless of a family's ability to  pay.   In 1968, he helped found the Central Kentucky Blood Center to help  hospitals across Kentucky have reliable access to blood from donors.  The center has grown over the years, and it has become a local partner  in healthcare across the Commonwealth.   David served on numerous other boards and commissions, all of which  support the health, culture, and prosperity of the region. He also  passed his expertise on to the next generation by mentoring in  medicine, public service, and philanthropy.   In addition to his professional accomplishments, David was known as a  well-rounded gentleman with a dry wit. At the age of 83, he hiked a 60- mile journey through Philmont Scout Reservation in New Mexico with his  son and 15-year-old grandson.   The University of Kentucky honored him with the Honorary Alumnus  Award, and DePauw University awarded him the Old Gold Goblet for  professional achievement and service.  [[Page S1774]]    I am proud to say that I knew David. Over the years, I developed a  deep respect for his work on behalf of his community. A man who  dedicated his time, skill, and passion to those around him, I know that  countless Kentuckians will remember his good works. I know that I will.   I would like to extend my deepest condolences to his son, Dr. Scott  Stevens, and all of David's family and friends. As one of the countless  individuals impacted by David's life, I can say with great certainty  that he will be deeply missed.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of  Charles Anthony ``C.A.'' Williams, of London, KY, who passed away after  a long career of public service and great creativity.   During a lifetime of achievement, C.A. had many professions. He  served his community as a Laurel County clerk and his Nation in the  U.S. Army. He traveled the country driving a semi-truck, and he shared  his deep faith as a gospel music singer and songwriter.   In each of these endeavors, C.A showed his passion, his skill, and  his love. Through his music and his witness, C.A. fulfilled his  greatest desire in life. Mr. Kip Jervis, one of C. A.'s nephews,  remembered that his uncle ``had a made-up mind of where he was headed,  and he made it his mission to take everyone he could with him.'' This  drive led C.A. to share his story and his faith.   His passion continued throughout his battle with brain cancer. After  a 1989 diagnosis, C.A. faced every day with optimism, knowing that ``he  was a winner either way.'' After a long fight, C.A. recovered from  cancer and continued to write music.   Reverend Gene Greene, the pastor of Carmichael Pentecostal Church in  East Bernstadt, remembered C.A.'s immense talent. During his long  drives in his semi-truck, C.A. would write gospel songs, a practice  that became his greatest joy. He released some of these songs in an  album called ``Magnificent Jesus.'' For a man of so many talents, this  album was one of C.A.'s proudest accomplishments.   C.A. left behind three loving children, Brittany, Brooklyn, and  Israel, and his sister, Connie. I know that the memories of C.A.'s love  for them will help ease their pain. Elaine and I send our deepest  condolences to the entire Williams family, and I know that C.A. will be  remembered fondly by everyone he inspired with his faith, his  dedication, and his music. He was a good man, and I am proud to say he  was my friend.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 2 p.m., Tuesday,  March 14; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; finally, that following leader  remarks, the Senate resume consideration of H.J. Res. 42.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order, following the remarks of Senator Cruz.
