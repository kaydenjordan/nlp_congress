 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize SMSGT  Jeremy Mayo who has earned the Military Times 2021 Airman of the Year  award after a remarkable 19 years of military service.   Jeremy Mayo is a proud Arkansan who has dedicated his life to  protecting and defending his country. Mayo grew up hearing stories  about his grandfather's 20 years in the military and says it had a big  influence in his life and served as his inspiration to join the Armed  Forces.   In his 10 deployments, he has handled a variety of crucial operations  from dropping personnel to refilling helicopters, as well as resupply,  infiltration, and exfiltration missions. He was initially drawn to the  position for its unpredictability and the opportunity to work with some  of the top military groups from a variety of branches. Mayo has  demonstrated, time and time again, the grit and work ethic so crucial  to the success of members of our military. To Mayo, the most important  part of his job was simply to get the crew and the team he was  supporting in and out and to get them home safely.   Mayo praised the U.S. Air Force for instilling in him important  traits such as leadership, saying the roles he has taken on forced him  to really step up. As a Special Operations Command loadmaster, Mayo had  been trained to roll with the punches, so when the coronavirus pandemic  hit, he did just that.   Mayo recognized the significance of the chemical aircrew  survivability barrier, a tent-like, air-filtering structure for C-130  airframes. He then helped develop plans to utilize this tool during the  pandemic, making special operations crews increasingly self-sufficient  and mobile in dangerous medical evacuations.   His quick thinking and creativity in repurposing this chemical and  biological contamination tent to protect troops from the coronavirus  earned him this prestigious award and, more importantly, has helped  protect countless servicemembers.   While the pandemic presented a variety of challenges, Senior Master  Sergeant Mayo clearly demonstrated his perseverance in the face of  adversity. He deployed to three different regions of the world and  served as the senior enlisted leader in an exercise that trained French  special operations helicopter crews on refueling and seizure skills to  prepare for combat in Africa.   I applaud SMSGT Jeremy Mayo for his outstanding commitment and  dedication to our Nation. He richly deserves this recognition for his  ingenuity and determination, and we are proud of this Arkansan's  distinguished record of service on behalf of our country. I commend him  for all his efforts that have culminated in this honor and express my  gratitude for his leadership and example.                            ____________________
