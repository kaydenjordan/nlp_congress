 Mr. President, first of all, let me say that I totally  agree with my friend from Montana on the importance of, after a year of  deliberation--or maybe ``deliberation'' is too strong a word--more than  a year since all three countries agreed on an agreement, that we still  have not gotten a chance to vote on this agreement on the Senate floor;  we have to wait for the House to do that. I want to do everything that  I can to encourage the House to move forward with this. I think better  trade policy can turn a good economy into a great economy, and we need  to be working on that great economy.
