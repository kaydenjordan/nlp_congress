 Madam Speaker, I rise this afternoon to  use this hour to discuss ``Social Security 2100: A Sacred Trust,'' or,  as Martin Luther King would remind us, the fierce urgency of now and  Congress' need to act on Social Security.   Let me start with the fact that Social Security is the Nation's  number one insurance program, the number one insurance program that  some on the other side call an entitlement. There is nothing further  from the truth, and this is easily verifiable. All you have to do is  look at your pay stub. It says FICA. FICA stands for Federal Insurance  Contributions Act. Whose contribution? Every citizen in the United  States who pays into the program.   It is an earned benefit, and one that has never missed a payment. It  is a guarantee, and that is why it is so vitally important to every  American citizen.   Congress has been negligent. It has been 50 years since there has  been an enhancement to the program. It has been more than 38 years  since there was an attempt at solvency. Yet, 38 years ago, Congress  enacted a cut that will take place this January.   The time to act is now. No more procrastination. For all of our C- SPAN listeners, make sure that you contact your Member of Congress in  both Houses.   We are pleased that 200-plus people are original cosponsors of the  bill. You will hear from some of them today.   We have taken the liberty of pointing out to every Member of Congress  how many people in their district receive Social Security benefits and  what that brings into their district on a monthly basis. I assure you,  there is no more greater economic development plan for Members'  districts than what happens on a monthly basis to those who need it  most.   Let me reiterate again: Social Security is the number one antipoverty  program for the elderly and the number one antipoverty program for  children as well.   I have here, Madam Speaker, something we have done for every Member  of Congress. In this case, we are illustrating our great leader,  Representative  Jim Clyburn, who is a proud cosponsor of this bill.   In his district, in South Carolina's Sixth, there are 149,433 Social  Security recipients who receive $189 million in monthly benefits. That  is monthly benefits. There are 1.2 million Social Security recipients  in South Carolina who receive $1.7 billion in monthly benefits as well.   For about half of senior beneficiaries, Social Security provides a  majority of their income. Now imagine that, for half the seniors in the  country, Social Security provides a majority of their benefits, yet  there hasn't been an enhancement or an increase in over 50 years in a  COLA. That doesn't even come remotely close to what people need.   For more than a quarter of our seniors, it provides 90 percent or  more of their income, 90 percent for a quarter of our seniors. At a  time when the wealth disparity is the greatest it has ever been in our  country, the wealthiest nation in the world, there are 5 million of our  fellow Americans, mostly women, who receive a below-poverty level check  from their government.                                time  1630    Why? Because Congress hasn't acted. This isn't something the  President can do through executive order, nor is this something that  the Supreme Court is going to adjudicate. This is the responsibility of  the United States Congress.   I am proud that we had a hearing the other day in the Ways and Means  Committee that we are going to bring to a markup and ultimately to the  floor of this House: Social Security 2100. I am proud of the fact that  we have a President of the United States who refers to Social Security  as a sacred trust, a sacred trust between the government and their  people. And Social Security has never failed. It has never missed a  payment.   It used to be--and Mr. Cartwright from Pennsylvania knows this--that  we could go back to 1935 to explain why Roosevelt back then, in the  midst of the Great Depression, put forward Social Security because of  the devastation that had taken place in 1929 during the great crash.   But Members on this floor, Members in this Congress understand all  too well that we only have to go back to 2008, 2009 during the Great  Recession when people saw their 401(k) become a 101(k) where people  lost their benefits. And that coupled with the great pandemic, this  roller coaster of a pandemic that we are living through now has only  further underscored the need for us to enhance the Nation's number one  insurance program.   And during that same time, during that recession that they witnessed  their funds depleted and devastated or lost altogether or during  layoffs that have occurred through no fault of their own, Social  Security has never missed a payment. Not a pension payment, not a  spousal payment, not dependent coverage, nor disability.   Madam Speaker, it might surprise some of our viewers and listeners  that more veterans depend on Social Security disability than they do on  the VA. And it is because Social Security provides these benefits and  especially for our veterans. People in this Chamber and in the Senate  take great pride in talking about our veterans on Memorial Day and  Veterans Day, and rightfully so, and saluting them and saying what a  grateful Nation we are.   Well, if we are truly a grateful Nation, then it is time we end the  more than 50 years of neglect and make sure that our veterans are able  to get the benefits that they richly deserve without 5-month delays, in  making sure that they have disability that they know they can rely on,  that works for the times that we are living through currently.   Children continue to rely on Social Security, and it is the number  one antipoverty program for children. And you know what, 10,000 baby  boomers a day become eligible for Social Security, and millennials will  need the benefit more than baby boomers. Millennials have been put in  the position where they have less money to be able to afford private  pensions, where they have been burdened with college loan debt, where  they are unable to get the kind of mortgages their parents enjoyed,  and, in fact, have incomes that are below that level, and so, Social  Security becomes their salvation. But it can't be their salvation if  they are locked at the bottom, and we are not making the benefit  increases that will provide that opportunity for all generations to  enjoy.   Madam Speaker, we are pleased also that Social Security 2100 will not  only lift benefits across the board, but it will make sure that no one  can work all their lives, pay into a system and retire into poverty.  More than 5 million Americans get a below-poverty-level check from the  government after having paid in all their lives. That is unfair. That  is unjust. That is flat out wrong. We are a body that can pass out  trillions of dollars of tax cuts to the Nation's wealthiest 1 percent  and yet we can't take care of people who have paid into the system  because Congress has not fulfilled its obligation and responsibility.   Now is the time to act, and under Democratic leadership, that will  take place. People say to me often, ``Well, what is different?''   What is different is: we have a Democratic House, a Democratic  Senate, and most importantly, a President who believes that this is a  sacred trust. A President, as Matt Cartwright also  [[Page H7620]]  knows, who has said we are going to end WEP and GPO.   And for you listeners, for you viewers, that means for all you  schoolteachers, for you firefighters, for you police officers, for you  municipal employees that were penalized under a system who have worked  hard and played by the rules, the President has called for its repeal,  and that means benefits flowing to people who rightfully deserve them  and should rightfully get them.   I would add that that has had bipartisan support in the Congress, and  we do have bipartisan support for this bill across the Nation. No one  yet on the other side has signed up, but yet, all across the Nation in  large numbers more than 80 percent of Democrats, more than 68 percent  of Republicans and more than 74 percent of Independents all favor  increasing benefits because they know of the security and the promise  and the necessity of Social Security.   I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright) who is an  original cosponsor, Madam Speaker, of this Social Security 2100, as are  you, who understands how critical this is to Pennsylvanians and  everyone across the Nation.    During that time, our current Speaker led  the fight when George Bush said he was going to use his political  capital that they had just gained and were in control of the House, the  Senate, and the Presidency, they were going to privatize Social  Security. And it was Nancy Pelosi and people like Marcy Kaptur that led  the charge in the fight that prevented the privatization of Social  Security.   To your point, had that gone into effect, people's total savings and  everything that is a guarantee under Social Security would have been  lost in 2008.   We are beyond 2008 now, but we are still dealing with all of those  things that people can't necessarily prepare for, whether it is a  pandemic or whether it is the Great Recession or whether it is the  vicissitudes of the stock market, as Roosevelt would have said. These  are the things that people who work hard and play by the rules are  subject to, and that is why this is a sacred trust. Because in the  United States we will not let that happen to our citizens because  nobody deserves to work all their lives and retire into poverty.   I thank the gentleman for his leadership in this area.                                time  1645     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Pennsylvania for joining us this afternoon.   Madam Speaker, I would point out a couple of things, something the  gentleman knows--and we have been joined by the gentlewoman from  Illinois, who will address us shortly--but the number of groups that  are endorsing Social Security 2100:   The National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare,  Social Security Works, the Alliance for Retired Americans, the  Paralyzed Veterans of America, the NAACP, the National Organization for  Women, Latinos for Secure Retirement, the National Education  Association, AFGE, the American Federation of Teachers, The Arc of the  United States, National Retiree Legislative Network, the Gray Panthers,  American Family Voices, The Senior Citizens League. And the list goes  on and on and on, because everybody understands the importance and  significance of this.   Madam Speaker, I recognize the gentlewoman from Illinois, who has  worked tirelessly on behalf of seniors across this country, and has  headed a task force for more than a decade now that was instrumental in  providing us with all the detailed information with the over 17  proposals that are included in Social Security 2100, a sacred trust.   Madam Speaker, we make this point often, and I want to make it here  tonight, because you are well-aware of this as well. That in  legislative parlance, the bill is called H.R. 5723. But what I want our  viewers, our listeners, and most importantly, our colleagues on the  other side of the aisle to understand, this is about your parents. This  is about your brothers and sisters, your aunts and uncles. This is  about your next-door neighbor, your coworker, the people that you  worship with.   This is not legislative parlance, this is the reality that they are  living; and the disparity that exists today, the gap that exists, can  be closed if Congress does a job that it has neglected for more than 50  years in terms of enhancing a program that is a necessity for your  parents, for your brothers and sisters, for your aunts and uncles. All  you have to do is ask them. It confounds me that anyone can look their  constituents in the eye and say that we are doing enough for you, or  that you are okay.   We all know, and I have heard Jan say this many times--I know my  mother said it--she says, Oh, I just care that my children are okay,  and I just don't want to be a burden. Of course people feel that way.  It is their humility and their kind of generation and people that we  know. Nobody wants to be a burden. But I assured my mother she was no  burden. She was an inspiration. And for us to stand by in the midst of  this, the wealthiest Nation in the world, and not do our responsibility  as a Congress and vote.    The President can't do it by executive order, nor will the Supreme  Court adjudicate it. It is only Congress. And thanks to the efforts of  Jan Schakowsky, we are getting there.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms.  Schakowsky).    No.    Correct.    Madam Speaker, this has been bipartisan.  Chairman Neal, a Social Security recipient himself lost his father,  lost his mother, his grandmother was then raising him, and then he lost  his grandmother.     Tom Reed, the ranking member on the Social Security Subcommittee,  and   Tom Rice, they both lost parents and were raised on Social  Security as well.   Mr. Davis has put a bill in and has sponsored a bill for a number of  years to eliminate the windfall elimination provision.   Finally, President Biden said we are going to repeal this in its  entirety. It shows that there is an ability, a bridge to come together  in so many of these things, including caregiver opportunities, that are  bipartisanly-sponsored within this bill and included as part of the  bill.   We have yet to have anyone endorse and support the bill, but that is  a matter, I think, of voting and getting beyond what happens in this  Chamber and in discussions between here and the Senate is that there is  an awful lot of talk about helping veterans, but nobody actually votes  one way or the other. There is an awful lot of talk about understanding  what we have to do, but then nobody votes.   The time for reckoning, this is a point President Biden makes all the  time, and I know, Madam Speaker, you understand this as well. Our very  democracy and our Republic is at stake here because government, in an  entrepreneurial capitalistic system like ours, where there has to be,  by the nature of the system, risk that is taken. Well, that is  important and good, but by the same token, Roosevelt and subsequent  Presidents, including Eisenhower, including Nixon, and including  Reagan, recognized this. We need that safety net there for people who  work hard and play by the rules.   President Biden has said, yes, this is a sacred trust. Martin Luther  King came to Washington, D.C. in 1963 during the famous march, and gave  us the phrase, ``the fierce urgency of now.'' He was talking at the  time about segregation and about the need for voting rights.   But the fierce urgency of now applies to all of our citizens that  have been addressed in the remarks, who need this and who are suffering  and receiving below poverty level payments from their own government  after they have paid in. This is at a time when we gave the Nation's  wealthiest 1 percent an 83 percent tax cut. God bless them.   It hasn't trickled down to everybody else. That is why we have the  system that we do to take care of. It is the government's  responsibility. And if a democracy is going to work, if we are not  listening to what, as all the polls say, and we have accompanied more  than six different polls talking about where the America people are,  this is not partisan. This is totally bipartisan in terms of people's  understanding of what their needs, their belief in a system they know  that has never failed for them.   Dr. Martin Luther King said: Now is the time to make real the promise  of democracy. Now is the time to make good on the promise of the  Federal Government. That is what Joe Biden has said and what he so  eloquently has called a sacred trust. Now is the time for us.   This is beyond urgent, though it is the fierce urgency of now. It is  shameful that this body, the world looks in on this great Nation, this  great democracy that we have, it looks how we treat our people; how we  treat our veterans; how we treat our children. The statistics that you  rallied off about what is going on in this country and how they are  depending on it, and then realizing that Congress hasn't done a thing  in 50 years?   This is not anything that can be done--and I repeat this again--by  executive order or by adjudication from the Supreme Court. This is the  responsibility of every man and woman in this Chamber, of 535 of us  overall, but it is our responsibility and the time to vote is long  overdue.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois.    Madam Speaker, we can do this. I think  Martin Luther King coined a phrase as well, and I am paraphrasing here:  This is not the time for the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. This is  not the time in the face of so much inequality and inequity. That is  when problems happen in society, when the people see that their  government has not lived up to its responsibility.   As noted, they pay into the system weekly, biweekly, or monthly. Our  good colleague and friend, John Lewis, said: This is not only an  important issue in terms of our people, this is a civil rights issue.  He said and believed that with every fiber in his being because what he  saw is the people that were discriminated against were the low wage  earners.   Unfortunately, as you know and have spoken eloquently on, most of  them are women, and specifically, women of color. So whether you had a  job as a waitress or a seamstress or whether you were one of those  caregivers that everybody relies on, or whether you had to go home to  provide care for your family and you didn't pay into a system, or your  wage level, long before pay equity, was far lower than your male  counterpart, this is not a reason  [[Page H7623]]  you should live out your remaining days in poverty. This happens for 5  million Americans.   In a blink of an eye we can do a tax cut. In a blink of an eye we can  pass a defense bill. I support both. But I fervently support the fact  that we have to take care of our citizens. It is this body's  responsibility, Congress' responsibility. We cannot walk away.   Every citizen in this country ought to make sure that they are  holding their congressional delegations responsible for doing their  job. This is nothing that should be kicked down the road again or put  off to some gradual dealing with the subject matter, or yet, another  study that we are going to try to look into this on.   We don't need to study this. We know what the issue is here. We have  looked in the mirror, and the problem is the United States Congress, it  is the body that votes and changes the policy and the direction.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for joining us.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the subject of  our Special Order today, Social Security 2100, a Special Trust.    Madam Speaker, I want to thank as well  President Biden for having the temerity to not only on the campaign  trail, but to speak directly to the American people and let them, and  ensure them, that we understand that this is a sacred trust, a bond  that will not be broken. Not on our watch. That we will fulfill that  promise and make sure that they are receiving the kind of benefits that  they have paid into a system for and are, yes, entitled to receive  because there is no greater Nation in the world than the United States  of America.   When this body sets its mind to it, as witnessed how bipartisan the  public feels about this on the outside and a number of the great  inclusions that both Democrats and Republicans feel about, now is the  time for us to act on behalf of the citizens we are sworn to serve.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
