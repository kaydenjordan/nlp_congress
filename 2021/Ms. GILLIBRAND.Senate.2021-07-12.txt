 Mr. President, I rise today to once again call for  every Senator to have an opportunity to vote on a generational bill to  fix how the military deals with sexual assault and other serious  crimes.   It is the Military Justice Improvement and Increasing Prevention Act.  This bill will ensure that men and women who serve in our military have  the opportunity for basic justice, basic civil liberties, and basic  protection under the law.   I want to start by recognizing the monumental advance toward military  justice reform made during our Senate work week. The Independent Review  Commission on Sexual Assault in the Military released their  recommendations, which included removing the prosecution of sexual  assault and related crimes from the chain of command. It is a historic  sign of progress after decades of obstruction.    The Secretary of Defense has agreed with the Commission's findings  that the removal of sexual assault prosecutions from the chain of  command and the professionalization of the military justice system  would benefit survivors and in no way diminish good order and  discipline. It is also a historic sign of progress that President Biden  has endorsed all of these recommendations.   After years--years--of pushing for these types of reforms, this  change in thinking from our military and executive leadership is truly  momentous. Every crime that the IRC reviewed, they recommended removing  it from the chain of command. That is a clear recognition that the  current military justice system is not capable of addressing the  epidemic of sexual assault among our ranks and that it is not providing  justice for our servicemembers.   As President Biden said, ``This is the beginning, not the end of our  work.'' While I welcome the IRC's recommendations, I am deeply  heartened to see that Secretary Austin and President Biden both endorse  the recommendations and will happily work with us to make them a  reality. We also have to recognize that the IRC was provided a very  limited task--to review only sexual assault and harassment in the  military. No other crimes were under their purview. Unfortunately, they  were also not asked to look at other serious crimes that are related,  such as murder.   We as a Congress have been tasked with a larger job. It is our job to  ensure that the military writ large works for every servicemember. The  recent scandals at Fort Hood, the murder of Vanessa Guillen, and the  deep racial disparities in prosecutions have made it plain that the  need for reform in the military justice system goes far beyond sexual  assaults. Vanessa Guillen was murdered, and she was harassed. Serious  crimes such as murder deserve the consideration of military lawyers who  are trained with expertise, not commanders.   For those who worry about the impact that this reform would have on  command authority, I would point to the head of the IRC, the  chairwoman, Lynn Rosenthal, who said:         The IRC rejects the notion that, by removing legal       decisions about prosecution from the command structure, that       commanders have no role. It's simply not the case. Commanders       are responsible for the climates they create. They're       responsible for working to prevent sexual assault and sexual       harassment, and they're responsible for making sure that       victims are protected when they come forward to report. So,       the idea that they won't have an interest in solving this       problem if they are not making [a] technical, legal       [decision], we think, is simply false.    The same logic extends to all serious crimes. Commanders will still  be responsible for setting the culture that prevents them, for  protecting victims, and for maintaining an interest in solving these  problems even if they are not making these complex, technical decisions  about whether or not a case should go to trial. And in a great number  of these cases that do not go forward to trial, they come back to the  commander for the commander to use his discretion--nonjudicial  punishment, summary court-martial, or special court-martial--the many  tools he still has.   We must guarantee that we have a professional, unbiased system for  all servicemembers. It is our constitutional duty to provide oversight  and accountability over the Department of Defense. We are the authors  of the military justice code. We are the ones who put it in place. It  is Congress's duty to update it and to make sure it works. We can do  that by taking this momentum and building upon it and passing the  Military Justice Improvement and Increasing Prevention Act this year.  We have the votes to pass it in committee. We have the votes to pass it  on the floor. This is an issue we have been fighting for and talking  about and having hearings on for 8 years.   I began calling for a full vote on the floor on this bill on May 24.  Since then, an estimated 2,744 servicemembers will have been raped or  sexually assaulted. More will have been victims of other serious  crimes. All of them deserve justice, and it is our responsibility to  provide it.   Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  that, at a time to be determined by the majority leader, in  consultation with the Republican leader, the Senate Armed Services  Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. 1520 and the  Senate proceed to its consideration; that there be 2 hours for debate  equally divided in the usual form; and that upon the use or yielding  back of that time, the Senate vote on the bill with no intervening  action or debate.    Mr. President, I have a request for one committee to  meet during today's session of the Senate. It has the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.   Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committee is authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:                        COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN RELATIONS    The Committee on Foreign Relations is authorized to meet during the  session of the Senate on Monday, July 12, 2021, at 6 p.m., to conduct a  hearing.                            ____________________
