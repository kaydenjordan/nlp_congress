 Madam President, Senator Udall and I came here in the  same class 12 years ago. It is hard to believe that 12 years have  passed. How can that happen so quickly? We have seen the Senate in  various chapters as it sought to address the big challenges facing  America.   Colleagues have already noted Tom's intense advocacy for the  wildlands of the West and the poetry that he brought to it in his  speech today with Mr. Stegner's reflections on the majesty and  importance of the wildlands of the West and all of his efforts to  protect those lands.   Colleagues have mentioned how, when folks thought it couldn't be  done, he dived into this partnership with Senator Vitter to drive the  Lautenberg Toxic Substances Act and got it accomplished through months  and months of intense negotiations.   He cares about the function of this body and has shared with us idea  after idea on how we might make it work better--ideas that we should  still work to consider in the months and years ahead.   As he thought about protection of lands, he thought about protection  of the oceans and the role of plastics in the oceans. He spearheaded  efforts for us to reconsider how we produce so much plastic waste and  where it ends up and the damage that it does--a vision that others will  have to carry the baton on after his departure.   He has stood up fiercely for the constitutional vision of a nation  and a government of, by, and for the people, that money is not speech,  and that corporations are not people.   Tom, thank you. Thank you for fighting for the vision of our  Constitution, for a government that can and will take on the issues  facing us. We will miss you. I personally hope that you will have a  major role in continuing to advance the protection of those wildlands  in the West in the near future. All my best, and take care in your next  chapter.
