 Mr. Speaker, 25 years ago, I was  grateful to be with Governor Carroll Campbell, Senator John Russell,  and Senator Verne Smith when BMW held the groundbreaking for their  first American manufacturing facility in the upstate of South Carolina.   Today, with an investment of nearly $8 billion by BMW, South Carolina  is the leading exporter of cars of any State, and the Greer plant is  the largest BMW manufacturing facility in the world, with $9.5 billion  worth of autos exported from the Port of Charleston last year. This  fulfills the vision of the legendary industrialist, Roger Milliken.   BMW has excelled by being a leader of apprenticeship training  programs, creating over 30,000 jobs with ontime delivery of suppliers,  and a total of 120,000 jobs nationwide.   I was grateful to join Governor Henry McMaster; Senator Lindsey  Graham; president of BMW, Knudt Flor; and chairman of the board, Harald  Kruger, yesterday as BMW announced an additional expansion of $800  million and 1,000 more jobs.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.   Congratulations again yesterday on the swearing in of Congressman  Ralph Norman, who is only the second Republican elected in 125 years  from the Fifth District of South Carolina.                            ____________________
