 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute in morning business.    Madam President, President Trump was rightly criticized  for dodging a question about the peaceful transfer of power. Instead,  Trump criticized mail-in ballots and rejected the premise that he will  lose.   No, that doesn't mean that he is planning some sort of coup, but it  is important for any President to choose their words very carefully.   The same is true for partisans on the other side whipping up fear  that our democracy is in jeopardy or that the ballots will not be  counted. Even worse is the rhetoric setting the stage to delegitimize  any future Trump victory.   We now hear full-blown conspiracy theories. Let me mention a few. A  group of Biden supporters conducted a war game speculating that the  President will not leave office without a Biden landslide, questioning  what the military would do.   The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff stepped in with a simple  civics lesson. The U.S. military has no role in the elections, he said.   Democrats have doubled down on this debunked theory that the Postal  Service is plotting with Trump to disrupt the election mail. The Postal  Service does not answer to the President of the United States. It has  plenty of capacity to deliver election mail. Plus, the Federal  Government doesn't run elections; the 50 States run those elections.   A key goal of Russian ``active measures,'' dating back to the Cold  War, has been to get Americans to doubt their government, its leaders,  and democratic institutions. Let's not do Russia's dirty work for them.  No American should be questioning our free and fair elections.   Now to my State of Iowa. Our people who have requested absentee  ballots will have ballots mailed to them starting on October 5.  Remember to fill it out completely, including your driver's license or  voter PIN number, and mail them to your county auditor well before  election day but not later than the day before.   Your ballot can be tracked on the secretary of state's website. Check  out where your ballot is.   I have great faith in Iowa's election officials and our postal  workers. Iowans who vote in person or absentee can be assured that your  vote will count--the same as any election.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, America's founding principles, including  that all men are created equal and endowed by our Creator with  unalienable rights, are timeless and apply equally to all Americans.   Commitment to these founding principles is what ties us together as  Americans, so it is vital that all Americans feel connected to them.   That is why I have been working for years to establish a memorial on  the National Mall to those Black Revolutionary War patriots who fought  for our founding ideals.   I commend to all Americans the insights of the founder of the  organization working to build this memorial, who argues that these  patriots' service and sacrifice completed the Founders' vision.
