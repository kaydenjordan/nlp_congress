 Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate Commerce Committee,  on which you sit, came together on a bipartisan basis to advance the  Endless Frontier Act by a vote of 24 to 4--24 to 4.   We are now one step closer to passing a bill that will keep our  country one step ahead in science and technology for decades to come.  It is my intention for the Senate to take up the Endless Frontier Act  next week in a package with legislation to strengthen our alliances and  partnerships; invest in the American semiconductor industry; ensure  that China pays a price for its predatory actions; and boost advanced  manufacturing, innovation, and critical supply chains.   For decades, American prosperity has been anchored by our unmatched  capacity for innovation and invention in science and in technology.  American innovation propelled American industry, and an American  workforce brought those innovations to the global economy.   But, unfortunately, Federal underinvestment in sciences has seen our  country slip, exposing critical weak spots in our economy. If we don't  fix them, we will no longer be the No. 1 economic leader in the world  in the decade to come. So it is an imperative that we do this. This is  for our future--our future for jobs, our future for economic  leadership, and our future for world leadership.   It all boils down to science, something that was ignored,  unfortunately, by the last administration, but, fortunately, bipartisan  unity in this Senate is bringing us back on the page that we need to do  science.   The Endless Frontier Act would right the ship by making one of the  largest investments in American innovation in generations, allowing the  United States to outcompete countries like China, create more good- paying jobs, and harden our economic and our national security as well  because this bill is vital to national security as well as to economic  security.   I want to really applaud Chairwoman Cantwell, Ranking Member Wicker,  and my partner in the Endless Frontier Act Senator Young, all of whom  worked hard, long, diligently, and effectively, in a bipartisan  fashion, to move this legislation through regular order. The full  Senate will consider and, I believe, should finish this important  legislation before the end of the month with strong bipartisan support.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on judges and on nominees, over the past  several months, the Senate has moved quickly to confirm nominees to  serve in President Biden's Cabinet and throughout his administration.  The Senate also has a constitutional duty to provide advice and consent  on the President's judicial nominations, and the Senate will begin to  fill judicial vacancies very soon.   This morning, the Judiciary Committee is holding the first markup for  a slate of President Biden's judicial  [[Page S2500]]  nominations, including two circuit nominees and three district court  nominees, who will all receive a vote in the committee next week. The  Senate is now going to scale up our efforts to fill more than 80  vacancies in the Federal judiciary.   It is no secret that, lacking a robust legislative agenda, the  Republican majority, under President Trump, focused on judges,  confirming around 200. President Obama, in his 8 years, appointed 320.  So even though, on a 4-year-to-4-year basis, Trump did more, overall,  Obama had a greater effect on the judiciary than Trump.   Now, President Biden has the opportunity to fill more than 80  vacancies--likely more. Under this Democratic majority, the Senate will  swiftly and routinely take up President Biden's appointments to the  Federal bench. It will redress the imbalance that the Trump  administration caused by choosing so many judges who were so far hard  right, way out of the mainstream not just of the American people but  even of the Republican Party.   Under this Democratic majority, we are going to swiftly and routinely  take up President Biden's appointments to the Federal bench to restore  some balance. And, I must say, President Biden's judicial candidates  provide a stark contrast to the quality, to the caliber of President  Trump's nominations. President Biden's nominees are qualified,  mainstream, and actually reflect the diversity of the country. Many  have spent years as public defenders, an experience that is sorely  lacking on the Federal bench. They also include the first Native  American to be nominated to the Federal court, the second-ever Puerto  Rican, and the second Black woman to sit on the Second Circuit in my  home State of New York. I am very proud of that.   That is a far cry from what we got under President Trump and then- Majority Leader McConnell. For 4 years, the Republican leader turned  the Senate into a conveyor belt for inexperienced lawyers, many with  deeply radical views on women's choice, voting rights, criminal  justice, and civil rights. A few of them were so extreme on the issues  of race and voting that Republican Senators joined with Democrats to  reject those nominations.   With President Biden, we are going to bring balance back to the  Federal judiciary by confirming judges who are beholden to the law, not  some far-right agenda                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another issue in the Judiciary  Committee, this morning the Judiciary Committee will also vote on a  very important nominee to the Department of Justice, Kristen Clarke, to  serve as the Assistant AG for Civil Rights.   The daughter of Jamaican immigrants, Ms. Clarke is an extremely well  qualified and capable civil rights attorney who will be the first Black  woman to ever fill her position at the Justice Department.   But her obvious quality did not stop a few of our Republican  colleagues from trying to smear her record. The political right seems  to relish in trying to score political points by connecting every  Justice Department nominee, many of whom happen to be women of color,  to hot-button partisan issues, whether or not they have any relevance.   In Ms. Clarke's hearing, it reached the point of absurdity when she  was grilled on an obviously satirical piece she published for her  college newspaper. Just like Ms. Vanita Gupta, who I am proud to say is  now the Associate Attorney General, Ms. Clarke was treated by the  minority on the Judiciary Committee like some hair-raising radical,  despite her record, her qualifications, and her support from all sides.  And just like Ms. Gupta, Ms. Clarke has been endorsed by the Nation's  most powerful law enforcement organizations, including the  International Association of Chiefs of Police and the Major Cities  Chiefs Association.   Ms. Clarke is an outstanding, an outstanding nominee, and I urge all  of my colleagues on the Senate Judiciary to advance her nomination  today.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
