BLANKET LICENSE FOR DIGITAL USES AND MECHANICAL                     LICENSING COLLECTIVE.         (a) Amendment.--Section 115 of title 17, United States       Code, is amended--        (1) in subsection (a)--        (A) by inserting ``in General'' after ``Availability and       Scope of Compulsory License'';        (B) by striking paragraph (1) and inserting the following       new paragraph:        ``(1) Eligibility for compulsory license.--        ``(A) Conditions for compulsory license.--A person may by       complying with the provisions of this section obtain a       compulsory license to make and distribute phonorecords of a       nondramatic musical work, including by means of digital       phonorecord delivery. A person may obtain a compulsory       license only if the primary purpose in making phonorecords of       the musical work is to distribute them to the public for       private use, including by means of digital phonorecord       delivery, and--        ``(i) phonorecords of such musical work have previously       been distributed to the public in the United States under the       authority of the copyright owner of the work, including by       means of digital phonorecord delivery; or        ``(ii) in the case of a digital music provider seeking to       make and distribute digital phonorecord deliveries of a sound       recording embodying a musical work under a compulsory license       for which clause (i) does not apply--         ``(I) the first fixation of such sound recording was made       under the authority of the musical work copyright owner, and       sound recording copyright owner has the authority of the       musical work copyright owner to make and distribute digital       phonorecord deliveries embodying such work to the public in       the United States; and        ``(II) the sound recording copyright owner or its       authorized distributor has authorized the digital music       provider to make and distribute digital phonorecord       deliveries of the sound recording to the public in the United       States.         ``(B) Duplication of sound recording.--A person may not       obtain a compulsory license for the use of the work in the       making of phonorecords duplicating a sound recording fixed by       another, including by means of digital phonorecord delivery,       unless--        ``(i) such sound recording was fixed lawfully; and        ``(ii) the making of the phonorecords was authorized by the       owner of the copyright in the sound recording or, if the       sound recording was fixed before February 15, 1972, by any       person who fixed the sound recording pursuant to an express       license from the owner of the copyright in the musical work       or pursuant to a valid compulsory license for use of such       work in a sound recording.''; and        (C) in paragraph (2), by striking ``A compulsory license''       and inserting ``Musical arrangement.--A compulsory license'';        (2) by striking subsection (b) and inserting the following:        ``(b) Procedures To Obtain a Compulsory License.--        ``(1) Phonorecords other than digital phonorecord       deliveries.--A person who seeks to obtain a compulsory       license under subsection (a) to make and distribute       phonorecords of a musical work other than by means of digital       phonorecord delivery shall, before or within 30 calendar days       after making, and before distributing, any phonorecord of the       work, serve notice of intention to do so on the copyright       owner. If the registration or other public records of the       Copyright Office do not identify the copyright owner and       include an address at which notice can be served, it shall be       sufficient to file the notice of intention with the Copyright       Office. The notice shall comply, in form, content, and manner       of service, with requirements that the Register of Copyrights       shall prescribe by regulation.        ``(2) Digital phonorecord deliveries.--A person who seeks       to obtain a compulsory license under subsection (a) to make       and distribute phonorecords of a musical work by means of       digital phonorecord delivery--        ``(A) prior to the license availability date, shall, before       or within 30 calendar days after first making any such       digital phonorecord delivery, serve a notice of intention to       do so on the copyright owner (but may not file the notice       with the Copyright Office, even if the public records of the       Office do not identify the owner or the owner's address), and       such notice shall comply, in form, content, and manner of       service, with requirements that the Register of Copyrights       shall prescribe by regulation; or        ``(B) on or after the license availability date, shall,       before making any such digital phonorecord delivery, follow       the procedure described in subsection (d)(2), except as       provided in paragraph (3).        ``(3) Record company individual download licenses.--      Notwithstanding paragraph (2)(B), a record company may, on or       after the license availability date, obtain an individual       download license in accordance with the notice requirements       described in paragraph (2)(A) (except for the requirement       that notice occur prior to the license availability date). A       record company that obtains an individual download license as       permitted under this paragraph shall provide statements of       account and pay royalties as provided in subsection       (c)(2)(I).        ``(4) Failure to obtain license.--        ``(A) Phonorecords other than digital phonorecord       deliveries.--In the case of phonorecords made and distributed       other than by means of digital phonorecord delivery, the       failure to serve or file the notice of intention required by       paragraph (1) forecloses the possibility of a compulsory       license under paragraph (1). In the absence of a voluntary       license, the failure to obtain a compulsory license renders       the making and distribution of phonorecords actionable as       acts of infringement under section 501 and subject to the       remedies provided by sections 502 through 506.        ``(B) Digital phonorecord deliveries.--        ``(i) In the case of phonorecords made and distributed by       means of digital phonorecord delivery:         ``(I) The failure to serve the notice of intention required       by paragraph (2)(A) or paragraph (3), as applicable,       forecloses the possibility of a compulsory license under such       paragraph.        ``(II) The failure to comply with paragraph (2)(B)       forecloses the possibility of a blanket license for a period       of 3 years after the last calendar day on which the notice of       license was required to be submitted to the mechanical       licensing collective under such paragraph.         ``(ii) In either case described in clause (i), in the       absence of a voluntary license, the failure to obtain a       compulsory license renders the making and distribution of       phonorecords by means of digital phonorecord delivery       actionable as acts of infringement under section 501 and       subject to the remedies provided by sections 502 through       506.'';        (3) by amending subsection (c) to read as follows:        ``(c) General Conditions Applicable to Compulsory       License.--        ``(1) Royalty payable under compulsory license.--        ``(A) Identification requirement.--To be entitled to       receive royalties under a compulsory license obtained under       subsection (b)(1) the copyright owner must be identified in       the registration or other public records of the Copyright       Office. The owner is entitled to royalties for phonorecords       made and distributed after being so identified, but is not       entitled to recover for any phonorecords previously made and       distributed.        ``(B) Royalty for phonorecords other than digital       phonorecord deliveries.--Except as provided by subparagraph       (A), for every phonorecord made and distributed under a       compulsory license under subsection (a) other than by means       of digital phonorecord delivery, with respect to each work       embodied in the phonorecord, the royalty shall be the royalty       prescribed under subparagraphs (D) through (F) and paragraph       (2)(A) and chapter 8 of this title. For purposes of this       subparagraph, a phonorecord is considered `distributed' if       the person exercising the compulsory license has voluntarily       and permanently parted with its possession.        ``(C) Royalty for digital phonorecord deliveries.--For       every digital phonorecord delivery of a musical work made       under a  [[Page H3523]]       compulsory license under this section, the royalty payable       shall be the royalty prescribed under subparagraphs (D)       through (F) and paragraph (2)(A) and chapter 8 of this title.        ``(D) Authority to negotiate.--Notwithstanding any       provision of the antitrust laws, any copyright owners of       nondramatic musical works and any persons entitled to obtain       a compulsory license under subsection (a) may negotiate and       agree upon the terms and rates of royalty payments under this       section and the proportionate division of fees paid among       copyright owners, and may designate common agents on a       nonexclusive basis to negotiate, agree to, pay or receive       such royalty payments. Such authority to negotiate the terms       and rates of royalty payments includes, but is not limited       to, the authority to negotiate the year during which the       royalty rates prescribed under this subparagraph and       subparagraphs (E) and (F) and paragraph (2)(A) and chapter 8       of this title shall next be determined.        ``(E) Determination of reasonable rates and terms.--      Proceedings under chapter 8 shall determine reasonable rates       and terms of royalty payments for the activities specified by       this section during the period beginning with the effective       date of such rates and terms, but not earlier than January 1       of the second year following the year in which the petition       requesting the proceeding is filed, and ending on the       effective date of successor rates and terms, or such other       period as the parties may agree. Any copyright owners of       nondramatic musical works and any persons entitled to obtain       a compulsory license under subsection (a) may submit to the       Copyright Royalty Judges licenses covering such activities.       The parties to each proceeding shall bear their own costs.        ``(F) Schedule of reasonable rates.--The schedule of       reasonable rates and terms determined by the Copyright       Royalty Judges shall, subject to paragraph (2)(A), be binding       on all copyright owners of nondramatic musical works and       persons entitled to obtain a compulsory license under       subsection (a) during the period specified in subparagraph       (E), such other period as may be determined pursuant to       subparagraphs (D) and (E), or such other period as the       parties may agree. The Copyright Royalty Judges shall       establish rates and terms that most clearly represent the       rates and terms that would have been negotiated in the       marketplace between a willing buyer and a willing seller. In       determining such rates and terms for digital phonorecord       deliveries, the Copyright Royalty Judges shall base their       decision on economic, competitive, and programming       information presented by the parties, including--        ``(i) whether use of the compulsory licensee's service may       substitute for or may promote the sales of phonorecords or       otherwise may interfere with or may enhance the musical work       copyright owner's other streams of revenue from its musical       works; and        ``(ii) the relative roles of the copyright owner and the       compulsory licensee in the copyrighted work and the service       made available to the public with respect to the relative       creative contribution, technological contribution, capital       investment, cost, and risk.        ``(2) Additional terms and conditions.--        ``(A) Voluntary licenses and contractual royalty rates.--        ``(i) License agreements voluntarily negotiated at any time       between one or more copyright owners of nondramatic musical       works and one or more persons entitled to obtain a compulsory       license under subsection (a) shall be given effect in lieu of       any determination by the Copyright Royalty Judges. Subject to       clause (ii), the royalty rates determined pursuant to       subparagraphs (E) and (F) of paragraph (1) shall be given       effect as to digital phonorecord deliveries in lieu of any       contrary royalty rates specified in a contract pursuant to       which a recording artist who is the author of a nondramatic       musical work grants a license under that person's exclusive       rights in the musical work under paragraphs (1) and (3) of       section 106 or commits another person to grant a license in       that musical work under paragraphs (1) and (3) of section       106, to a person desiring to fix in a tangible medium of       expression a sound recording embodying the musical work.        ``(ii) The second sentence of clause (i) shall not apply       to--         ``(I) a contract entered into on or before June 22, 1995,       and not modified thereafter for the purpose of reducing the       royalty rates determined pursuant to subparagraphs (E) and       (F) of paragraph (1) or of increasing the number of musical       works within the scope of the contract covered by the reduced       rates, except if a contract entered into on or before June       22, 1995, is modified thereafter for the purpose of       increasing the number of musical works within the scope of       the contract, any contrary royalty rates specified in the       contract shall be given effect in lieu of royalty rates       determined pursuant to subparagraphs (E) and (F) of paragraph       (1) for the number of musical works within the scope of the       contract as of June 22, 1995;

(2) Definitions.--In this subsection:        (A) Transmission by a broadcaster.--A ``transmission by a       broadcaster'' means a nonsubscription digital transmission       made by a terrestrial broadcast station on its own behalf, or       on the behalf of a terrestrial broadcast station under common       ownership or control, that is not part of an interactive       service or a music-intensive service comprising the       transmission of sound recordings customized for or       customizable by recipients or service users.

(f) Decisions and Precedents Not Affected.--The repeal of       section 114(i) of title 17, United States Code, by subsection       (b) shall not have any effect upon the decisions, or the       precedents established or relied upon, in any proceeding to       set or adjust the rates and fees payable for the use of sound       recordings under section 112(e) or section 114(f) of such       title before the date of the enactment of this Act.

In this section, such       instructions shall be referred to as a `letter of direction'.        ``(B) Acceptance of letter.--To the extent that the       collective accepts a letter of direction under subparagraph       (A), the person entitled to payment pursuant to the letter of       direction shall, during the period in which the letter of       direction is in effect and carried out by the collective, be       treated for all purposes as the owner of the right to receive       such payment, and the artist payee providing the letter of       direction to the collective shall be treated as having no       interest in such payment.        ``(C) Authority of collective.--This paragraph shall not be       construed in such a manner so that the collective is not       authorized to accept or act upon payment instructions in       circumstances other than those to which this paragraph       applies.''.        (b) Additional Provisions for Recordings Fixed Before       November 1, 1995.--Section 114(g) of title 17, United States       Code, as amended by subsection (a), is further amended by       adding at the end the following new paragraph:        ``(6) Sound recordings fixed before november 1, 1995.--        ``(A) Payment absent letter of direction.--A nonprofit       collective designated by the Copyright Royalty Judges to       distribute receipts from the licensing of transmissions in       accordance with subsection (f) (in this paragraph referred to       as the `collective') shall adopt and reasonably implement a       policy that provides, in circumstances determined by the       collective to be appropriate, for the deduction of 2 percent       of all the receipts that are collected from the licensing of       transmissions of a sound recording fixed before November 1,       1995, but which is withdrawn from the amount otherwise       payable under paragraph (2)(D) to the recording artist or       artists featured on the sound recording (or the persons       conveying rights in the artists' performance in the sound       recording), and the distribution of such amount to one or       more persons described in subparagraph (B), after deduction       of costs described in paragraph (3) or (4), as applicable, if       each of the following requirements is met:        ``(i) Certification of attempt to obtain a letter of       direction.--The person described in subparagraph (B) who is       to receive the distribution has certified to the collective,       under penalty of perjury, that--         ``(I) for a period of at least 4 months, that person made       reasonable efforts to contact the artist payee for such sound       recording to request and obtain a letter of direction       instructing the collective to pay to that person a portion of       the royalties payable to the featured recording artist or       artists;

(c) Technical and Conforming Amendments.--Section 114(g) of       title 17, United States Code, as amended by subsections (a)       and (b), is further amended--        (1) in paragraph (2), by striking ``An agent designated''       and inserting ``Except as provided for in paragraph (6), a       nonprofit collective designated by the Copyright Royalty       Judges'';  [[Page H3536]]         (2) in paragraph (3)--        (A) by striking ``nonprofit agent designated'' and       inserting ``nonprofit collective designated by the Copyright       Royalty Judges'';        (B) by striking ``another designated agent'' and inserting       ``another designated nonprofit collective''; and        (C) by striking ``agent'' and inserting ``collective'' each       subsequent place it appears;        (3) in paragraph (4)--        (A) by striking ``designated agent'' and inserting       ``nonprofit collective''; and        (B) by striking ``agent'' and inserting ``collective'' each       subsequent place it appears; and        (4) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:        ``(7) Preemption of state property laws.--The holding and       distribution of receipts under section 112 and this section       by a nonprofit collective designated by the Copyright Royalty       Judges in accordance with this subsection and regulations       adopted by the Copyright Royalty Judges shall supersede and       preempt any State law (including common law) concerning       escheatment or abandoned property, or any analogous       provision, that might otherwise apply.''.       SEC. 303. EFFECTIVE DATE.         (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (b), this       title and the amendments made by this title shall take effect       on the date of the enactment of this Act.        (b) Delayed Effective Date.--The effective date for       paragraphs (5)(B) and (6)(E) of section 114(g) of title 17,       United States Code, as added by section 302, shall be January       1, 2020.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 5447, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, today, the House brings early 20th century music laws  for the analog era into the 21st century digital era. These changes are  a culmination of years of effort by interested parties as well as by  many members of the Judiciary Committee.   The problems and failures in our Nation's music laws have imposed  real financial costs upon artists and creators. Music is no longer  written on piano rolls and our laws shouldn't be based on that  technology any longer either.   Several years ago, the Judiciary Committee began a comprehensive  review of our Nation's copyright laws. We held dozens of hearings,  heard from over 100 witnesses, and traveled to multiple cities across  the country to hear directly from stakeholders who use these laws. This  review provided the foundation upon which several bills to reform our  copyright laws were constructed.   During the course of this review, we learned that our music licensing  laws were no longer working as intended for songwriters, artists, and  creators, or for the companies that deliver the music in innovative  ways for consumers.   Specifically, we have heard about several key problems, including a  dysfunctional mechanical licensing system that seems to generate more  paperwork and attorneys' fees than royalties; a need to provide  protection for pre-1972 performances; a lack of recognition in the law  for the creative input of producers, sound engineers, and mixers; and a  lack of a unified rate standard for music royalties.   The Judiciary Committee regularly hears from a variety of groups  interested in copyright law, and it will not surprise anyone to know  that, typically, not everyone agrees regarding what changes to title 17  are necessary. One person's problem may be another's benefit, and some  have preferred a broken system over an unknown change.   However, in a reflection of how bad our music statutes are, the  opposite is true with respect to the bill before us today. Every party  that has spoken about music recognizes the problems caused by our  current licensing framework and wants real solutions. The existing  music provisions of title 17 are simply that bad.   I tasked the industry to come together with a unified reform bill  and, to their credit, they delivered, albeit with an occasional bump  along the way. Today, the major players in the music industry are  unified in supporting comprehensive music licensing reform to bring the  state of our Nation's copyright laws into the digital age that the  industry itself has already transitioned to.   While no bill is perfect, by all accounts, this is a bill with  overwhelming consensus behind it. Groups that represent songwriters,  musical works copyright owners, digital music providers, individual  artists, sound recording copyright owners, artist guilds, and  performing rights organizations all support the bill.   The reasons for such widespread support are clear:   The Music Modernization Act boosts payments for copyright owners and  artists by shifting the reasonable costs of a new mechanical licensing  collective onto digital music services that, themselves, benefit from  reduced litigation costs as a result of other provisions in the bill.   Songwriters gain a seat at the table in seeing how their royalties  are collected and then allocated.   Pre-1972 artists who currently go unpaid will finally see royalties  for their creations, as will sound engineers, mixers, and producers.  The public benefits, too, by having immediate access to all music on  their favorite services. Furthermore, libraries and archives gain  educational and fair use access to pre-1972 works currently governed  under State law.   This bill is the work product of many stakeholders and many Members.  I want to highlight the work of several of my colleagues, including the  ranking member, who were leaders in working on the underlying  components of this bill.   I want to especially thank Mr. Collins and Mr. Jeffries for their  leadership on section 115 reform. I would like to thank Mr. Issa and  Mr. Nadler for their leadership on behalf of pre-1972 performers. I  would also like to thank Mr. Crowley and Mr. Rooney for their efforts  on behalf of producers, mixers, and sound engineers.   And last but not least, I would like to thank Ranking Member Nadler  for his leadership on these issues and for his willingness to partner  with me in putting these pieces together into a comprehensive and  consensus music licensing reform package.   Sometimes big pieces of legislation can come together only through  the efforts of a large number of people who invest their time in making  change happen, as so many Members and so many stakeholders in the music  and digital delivery communities have done. It also has to happen at  the right time.   I would note that only 1 week ago, GRAMMYs on the Hill brought  hundreds of artists to D.C. to explain to their own Members of Congress  how important an updated licensing system is to them. This bill  delivers that for them just 1 day before World Intellectual Property  Day, when we recognize the value of intellectual property and those who  create it. So I am on safe ground when I say that this bill fits right  into the perfect sweet spot on both timing and substance.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Collins), a member of the Judiciary Committee and a key  legislator in making sure that this legislation moves forward. He has  worked very, very hard on it.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Rutherford), a member of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to  the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn), who is from music- loving Tennessee and a great champion for the music industry and people  who love music around our country.    Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time I have left?    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Tennessee (Mr. Roe), another Member from music-loving Tennessee  and the chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Chabot), a member of the Judiciary Committee and chairman of  the Small Business Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, this is landmark legislation that has been decades in  coming. We have not had a significant review of our music licensing and  copyright laws in many, many, many years.   There are many people to be thanked, including the staff of the  Judiciary Committee on both sides of the aisle. I particularly want to  recognize Joe Keeley, who is the chief counsel of the Courts,  Intellectual Property, and the Internet Subcommittee.   I also want to thank the leadership of the committee who have worked  for many, many years on intellectual property issues: Shelley Husband,  the chief of staff and general counsel; and Branden Ritchie, the chief  counsel of the committee.   Time doesn't allow me to recognize everyone, but I especially want to  recognize the Courts, Intellectual Property, and the Internet  Subcommittee vice chairman, Doug Collins. He and his staff have put  literally hundreds and hundreds of hours into aspects of this  legislation, and I want to personally thank him for that work as well.   This legislation has very strong, bipartisan support. It is supported  by groups that look at intellectual property issues across the  ideological spectrum, and it is nearly universally supported by the  music industry, the technology companies, and others that provide the  platforms on which that music is performed.   It is going to more fairly treat so many sectors of the music  industry that it would be a shame not to see this legislation pass the  House with a very strong, bipartisan vote, go to the Senate, pass  there, and then on to the President's desk, where I have every  confidence it will be signed into law.   During the course of many years of review of our copyright laws, we  learned that our music licensing laws were no longer working as  intended for songwriters, artists, and creators, people behind the  scenes for the companies that deliver the music in innovative ways to  our consumers.   The Music Modernization Act, a product of the Judiciary Committee's  comprehensive copyright review, is a bipartisan bill. I urge my  colleagues to join together and pass it and send it to the Senate.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
