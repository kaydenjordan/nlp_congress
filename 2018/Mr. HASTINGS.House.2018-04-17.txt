 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mourn the passing of my  dear friend, Lottie Albert.   Lottie was born on December 25, 1915, to Eva and Louis Wernick in New  York City. Twenty-one years later, Lottie married Sol Albert. The two  enjoyed 55 years of marriage and have two lovely daughters, my friends,  Harriet and Doreen. Lottie was the loving grandmother to Eric, Glenn,  and Lowell, as well as the great-grandmother to Kyle, Samantha,  Heather, and Seth.   Lottie was a resident and community leader of Broward County for over  40 years. It has been my honor to see Lottie's commitment and passion  for serving her community. She was an amazing individual who dedicated  herself to helping so many throughout south Florida.   In 1988, she was inducted into the Area Agency on Aging's Dr. Nan S.  Hutchinson Broward Senior Hall of Fame. Additionally, Broward County  honored her by declaring November 12 as Lottie Albert Appreciation Day.   In 2012, Lottie was inducted into the Broward County Women's Hall of  Fame for her work with the Ann Storck Children's Center.   Mr. Speaker, Lottie was an extraordinary friend of mine. She helped  me at every stage of my career, never wavering, never faltering. On  good days and bad days, I knew Lottie would be there for me, as she was  for so many of us. Her advice, wisdom, humor, and vast knowledge of  life will be sorely missed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, it is kind of good to see a Floridian in  the pro tempore chair.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Alabama for yielding me the  customary 30 minutes for debate, and I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to debate this rule. Last night at the  Rules Committee, we had the opportunity to hear from Chairman Kevin  Brady of the Committee on Ways and Means, the chairman of the Oversight  Subcommittee, Lynn Jenkins, and the ranking member of the Oversight  Subcommittee,  John Lewis, about this legislation.   They discussed--hey, America, listen to this--the bipartisan nature  in which they worked on this issue to craft legislation that they hope  can achieve strong bipartisan support in this body.   It came out of committee 38-0.   H.R. 5192 protects young children and recent immigrants from  synthetic identity theft, a type of fraud that involves combining a  legitimate Social Security number with a fake name in order to create a  new synthetic identity. One in every 10 children have fallen victim to  this type of threat. Research has shown that children's identities are  stolen at a rate of 50 times more frequently than adults, resulting in  children and families shouldering unforeseeable debt and a flawed  credit history that is extremely difficult to clear.   Mr. Speaker, in a refreshing change of pace, this measure, as I  indicated, had a 38-0 vote coming out of the markup in committee and  included input from Democrats, the IRS, and consumer protection  advocates.    Unsurprisingly, as I have indicated, it came out of committee  overwhelmingly with all 16 Democrats voting in favor. The  bipartisanship reflected in this bill is certainly a rarity in this  body and, frankly, could have easily come before us under suspension of  the rules.   It is now painfully obvious what the Republican majority's playbook  is. My friends across the aisle can work in a bipartisan manner if they  want to, but when it comes to major issues facing our country, like  taking away healthcare from 23 million Americans or handing a $1.5  trillion tax giveaway to America's wealthiest citizens, they would  rather force through partisan legislation written in back rooms with  little to no expert analysis, similar to the farm bill that is about to  come out here sometime in the not-to-distant future.   While it is certainly refreshing that we are working in a bipartisan  manner for a change, protecting children and families from identity  theft is not the only bipartisan priority. These reforms are just as  pressing as protecting our children from gun violence, providing relief  for hard-working, young Dreamers, and debating the use of military  force overseas--or how about an infrastructure bill of consequence and  real immigration reform.                                time  1230    Sixty-eight percent of Americans say Congress must do more to reduce  gun violence. More than a million Americans took to the streets across  the country to march for our lives and to urge Congress to take action  to reduce gun violence. I had the honor of sitting on the stage on that  day, and I was never as proud as I was of the children from Broward  County, where I am privileged to serve, or from around this Nation, and  their friends and allies, parents, loved ones, and constituents who  came from all over the country here, as well as to events in a  significant number of locations around the country.   207 members of Congress, including 14 Republicans, are sponsoring  H.R. 4240, the Democratic Representative  Mike Thompson's bill that  would give States the resources to help them submit information to the  background check system. One hundred Members of Congress, including  seven Republicans, are cosponsoring the Gun Violence Restraining Order  Act, which will allow family members or law enforcement officials to  petition a judge to temporarily remove firearms from an individual in  crisis. We had that example in Florida after it passed its law.  Immediately, a family came to the sheriff's office to have weapons  taken from a person in crisis.   Has the Speaker brought these bipartisan measures to the floor for a  vote? No. The Republican majority has refused to take up even the most  basic commonsense legislation to help mitigate the epidemic of gun  violence facing this country. My friends across the aisle have even  refused to address the use of bump stocks, a reform whose need is  agreed upon by Democrats and Republicans, including the President.  Fortunately, in the State of Florida, it did pass in the last session  of the legislature.   Mr. Speaker, just last year, 34 House Republicans signed a letter to  Speaker Paul Ryan urging him to bring forward a permanent legislative  solution for the Dreamers, these young, hardworking individuals who are  stuck in legal limbo. But despite this bipartisan support, not to  mention the support of 90 percent of the American public, the  Republican majority continues to block the Dream Act, ignoring the  calls of the vast majority of Americans.   It is time for the Trump administration and Republican-controlled  Congress to stop playing politics with the lives of Dreamers and come  to terms with the fact that their long anti-immigrant wish list is not  going anywhere fast.   Mr. Speaker, the House of Representatives is a place where the issues  facing our Nation should be addressed and solved in a bipartisan  manner, similar to this legislation. It is a sad state of affairs for  the Nation that Congress has continued to sit idly by while the  executive branch further engages our military in conflicts overseas  without congressional authorization.   Republican leadership's refusal to allow a robust debate on the  efficacy of an authorization of the use of military force for our  presence in Syria is not only a dereliction of duty but does a great  disservice to the country and our Constitution. If the President, any  President, intends to further involve American troops in the Syrian  conflict, or any conflict, then Congress has not only the  responsibility but also the constitutional authority to lead that  conversation.   Despite across-the-aisle support for these pressing problems, we are  not here today debating the rule to address gun violence in America. We  are not here today debating the rule to protect Dreamers from being  removed from our  [[Page H3355]]  workforce or being deported to countries of which they have no  knowledge. We are not here today debating the rule for the use of  military force in Syria. We are not here today discussing immigration  reform. We are not here today discussing an infrastructure measure that  is desperately needed.   When I came to Congress in 1992, there were 14,000 bridges in this  country in need of repair. Today there are 54,000 bridges in this  country in need of repair. But we are not discussing that here today.  Instead, we are using floor time to discuss a bill that could have  easily been considered on the suspension calendar, and I predict that,  had it been on the suspension calendar, 435 Members, or as many as  assembled, would have voted unanimously in favor of the measure today  as they would if it were on the floor at this particular moment.   Are my friends across the aisle intent on running out the clock  before the midterm elections? Is that what the American people have to  look forward to over the next 7 months? The people who sent us here  deserve bipartisan solutions to the pressing problems confronting this  great Nation. Not next month. Not next week. Not tomorrow. But today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, through you, I would advise my friend that  I have no further speakers, and I am prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I listened very intently to my friend from Alabama, and  he indicated that the action that was just undertaken over the weekend  by this administration was ``something,'' and I maintain that it was  under an old Authorization for Use of Military Force.   Listen, one of the reasons Congress won't undertake to debate an  authorization for the use of military force, which I would urge my  friend would give us a strategy if we had that debate and at least the  administration would have Congress' input with reference to the use of  military force--we can't continue to have pin pricks at the whim of any  President. I argued the same thing during the Obama administration, and  I argued it during the Clinton administration.   What we have done is abdicate our responsibility in Congress when it  comes to war. And if you think it isn't war, then ask the 500,000  people who are dead as a result of this measure undertaken in Syria,  not just by the United States but with a variety of forces fighting  inside. If you think it isn't war when a bomb destroys a building, or  76 missiles destroy buildings, then I have news for you about what war  looks like. And we had no input.   My understanding is the administration met with the leadership of the  Republican Party. I don't recall hearing a single Democrat was invited  to have any discussion at all about this matter.   Mr. Speaker, I applaud this bipartisan legislation, as I have said,  that would limit synthetic identity fraud and help protect millions of  identities, including those of young children and recent immigrants,  from being stolen. In a refreshing change of pace, this measure  received input from Democrats, the IRS, and consumer protection  advocates.   My friend from Alabama said that there are measures that are coming  [[Page H3356]]  forward, and I applaud him that those measures are coming forward. But  I didn't hear him say that there were going to be measures having to do  with Dreamers. I didn't hear him say there was anything that would be  significantly involved in gun violence other than his words with  reference to bump stocks and some reference back to some other date in  time. I am talking about right now, not only bump stocks but the  necessary indicia for buying a weapon and the age for buying a weapon  and a variety of measures.   Twenty-six measures exist right here in the House of Representatives  on which we could be voting--any one of them--that are commonsense gun  reform. And we refuse to do so because the Speaker won't put them on  the floor.   I hope that we can continue working together across the aisle to  confront the pressing issues facing this great Nation. When the farm  bill comes here, I hope Democrats have some input. They haven't had any  at this point. And we can help people whom we have been elected to  serve.                                time  1245    However, it is time that we address gun violence in America; it is  time that we protect Dreamers; it is time we exert our constitutional  authority and debate a new Authorization for Use of Military Force; and  it is time for us to repair these broken-down bridges and raggedy roads  in the United States of America.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
