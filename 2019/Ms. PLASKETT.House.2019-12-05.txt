 Mr. Speaker, I want to spend my 5 minutes to tell a  story, a history story from the Virgin Islands.   This month and for the next 6 months in the Virgin Islands, we  commemorate a historic fight for freedom and autonomy. On the small,  20-square-mile island of St. John, one of the earliest and longest  lasting slave rebellions began on November 23, 1733. This rebellion was  preceded by uncomparable conditions that slaves were living in on the  island of St. John in the Virgin Islands.   Conditions were devastating. The life expectancy of slaves in the  Virgin Islands never went above the age of 30 years old, and this  rebellion was caused by a drought and a plague of insects that placed  1,000 enslaved people of St. John at risk of starvation.   This caused an unprecedented amount of slaves to run away, what we  call on the island ``marooning,'' living in the bush. This led to the  vicious and inhumane Slave Code of 1733. The new rules threatened  amputation, breaking on the wheel, burning alive, and other brutal  punishment for those who ran away.   This, then, led to 150 slaves, all of whom were part of the Akwamu  tribe from Ghana, to begin an uprising. The Akwamu hoped to turn St.  John into an Akwamu-controlled state.   On the evening of November 23, the slaves entered the fort on Coral  Bay with cane knives concealed in bundles of wood. They proceeded to  kill all of the soldiers at the fort. Others across the island, many  who were able to escape, escaped to the island of St. Thomas, where  they took word to the governor. The governor then, under pressure, sent  troops, sent soldiers to St. John, who were then also destroyed.   The next 10 weeks saw guerilla-style warfare between the troops and  the Akwamu rebels. Afraid that the rebellion would spread to the nearby  island of Tortola, the British sent reinforcements. They were quickly  dispatched and quickly rode back to Tortola.   Again, John Maddox, a privateer from the island of St. Kitts, made a  deal with the Danish officials to aid the quelling of St. John. He,  too, was not successful.   William Vessup, an owner of a plantation, who was in disrepute with  the Danes, attempted to lure slaves onto a ship, the organizers of the  rebellion, and told them that they would give them food and support if  they would come on the ship. They did not fall for the trickery, and he  also was dispatched.   It wasn't until the Spanish Armada and the French came that this  rebellion was able to be quelled in 1734, almost 6 months later; and  with it, many were jailed. Some were sent to St. Croix to work to  death, which was what they decided to give to them, and many also  decided not to go back into slavery and jumped off of a cliff on the  island to their death--but to freedom.   These 150 Akwamu on the island of St. John were some of the first  African people in the Americas to have a sense of freedom, as volatile  and short-lived as it might have been.   It is important to acknowledge, however, that, for the majority of  enslaved people on the islands of St. John, St. Thomas, and St. Croix,  neither outcome would lead to freedom. The enslaved people on the  island of St. John and the rest of the Danish West Indies would  ultimately wait another 114 years for the next rebellion for their  freedom to come.                            ____________________
