 Madam President, I rise today to discuss the growing  threats to American national security and to the security of our  friends and allies in the Middle East.   Under President Obama and Vice President Biden, the policies put in  place were a catastrophe for our allies in the Middle East and a boon  to our enemies. They boosted the Muslim Brotherhood and criticized Arab  governments that tried to crack down on religious extremists. They gave  Palestinian groups tied to terrorism a veto over peace between our  Israeli and Arab allies, and they elevated those groups.   They pushed the catastrophic Obama-Iran nuclear deal, which  dismantled pressure on Iran and put the Ayatollah on a path towards a  nuclear arsenal, while sending pallets of cash in the dead of night as  ransom for hostages.   Of course, the Obama-Biden administration didn't tell the American  people and didn't tell Congress what they were doing. Instead, they  deliberately hid that information. They lied as long as they could  about their policies, and they developed and built an echo chamber  designed to drown out their critics.   I rise today because history is repeating itself, because I am deeply  worried that President Biden and the Biden-Harris administration are  returning to the very worst policies and the very worst tactics of the  Obama years and that the consequences are going to be far worse.   Once again, the Biden-Harris administration is boosting the Muslim  Brotherhood and other religious extremist groups in the Middle East.  They are elevating the Palestinians at the expense of our Israeli and  Arab allies, and they are dismantling pressure on Iran.   And, once again, they are hiding those details from Congress. They do  not want Congress to know, and they do not want the American people to  know. And, in some cases, unfortunately, they are outright lying.   I know that President Biden and his administration are refusing to  answer, even lying about their Middle East policies, because I asked  them. I asked them as part of questioning Barbara Leaf, the President's  nominee to be the Assistant Secretary of State for Near East Affairs.   Over the next several minutes, I will discuss the answers I got back.   Ms. Leaf has been--and will continue to be--at the center of the  Biden-Harris administration's Middle East policy. She was responsible  for Middle East policy from the very beginning of this administration  as the senior director for Middle East and North African Affairs at the  National Security Council. In her new position to which she has been  nominated, she would be America's most senior diplomat for the Middle  East.   I asked Ms. Leaf written questions about Biden's administration's  policies in multiple areas of Middle East policy, as part of her  testimony in front of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Her  answers ranged from deliberately nonresponsive to simply false and,  throughout, thoroughly, deeply distressing.   For example, right now, today, the Biden-Harris administration is  withholding $130 million of assistance for security and  counterterrorism from our Egyptian allies, allegedly on human rights  concerns. What we don't know is exactly why they are doing it and  exactly what the Biden-Harris administration is asking for.   Under the Obama administration, the United States repeatedly,  inexplicably boosted the Muslim Brotherhood, which openly advocated  terrorism against the United States. Those extremists were boosted at  the expense of moderate Arab allies, and they consistently misled the  public about their goals.   Here, the only reason the American public found out in the first  place about this $130 million is because the Washington Post revealed  it. The Biden-Harris administration didn't explain to the American  people what they were doing. It was only the reporting of journalists  that revealed it, and we still don't know enough. We don't know the  details.   The Post reported that the administration is withholding the aid  until Egypt addresses certain human rights concerns. We don't know what  they are. They apparently include releasing 16 unnamed prisoners. We  don't know who they are.   So I asked Ms. Leaf about these details. I asked about the 16 people.  I asked for their names, their institutional affiliations, what they  were charged with. I also asked if they were American citizens. And if  they were not, I asked whether they were involved in organizations that  push Islamic extremism or anti-Semitism.   Ms. Leaf is obviously very familiar with the case. She wrote back  over 1,000 words of highly technical responses. Here is just a third of  her answer. That is the part we could fit on the poster board. Lots of  words, lots of numbers, but, as you can see, not a single detail that I  requested was provided.   Of the 16 people the Biden-Harris administration is demanding that  Egypt release, you will see not a single name--not a one. Congress  doesn't get to know who those 16 people are. The American people don't  get to know who those 16 people are. The answer from Ms. Leaf to the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee is, to not put too fine a point on  it, Go jump in a lake.  [[Page S7573]]    How many of those 16 are affiliated with terrorist organizations?   The answer from Ms. Leaf: Go jump in a lake.   How many of them are American citizens?   The answer from Ms. Leaf: Go jump in a lake.   Why is that? Why is that--that the Biden-Harris administration is  extorting Egypt to release 16 prisoners, and yet they are embarrassed  to say who those prisoners are?   Well, we do have some public hints about the sort of people that the  White House and the congressional Democrats maybe tried to coerce our  Egyptian allies into releasing. Buried inside a very recent Senate  appropriations report, there is an instruction that seems very much  like what we are seeing with these secret conditions. It came  presumably from Senate Democrats, although we don't know who. No Senate  Democrat has stood forward to own this language, but there is a Senate  Democrat who authored this language.   It says:         In making the certification required by subsection       (a)(3)(A), the Secretary of State shall consider the cases of       Ola Al-Qaradawi, Hosam Khalaf, Salah Soltan, Abdulrahman       Tarek, and Mohamed El-Baqer. The Committee urges that humane       treatment and fair trials be afforded these and other       prisoners in Egypt.    So, apparently, for some unnamed Democrat who is unwilling to put his  or her name to it, these names are people the United States should  champion, and it suggests the sorts of people the Biden-Harris  administration may be trying to extort Egypt into releasing.   Who are they?   Well, let's start with Salah Soltan. Who is Salah Soltan? He is a  Muslim Brotherhood propagandist. He is a hate preacher. He is someone  who goes on TV over and over again and preaches the most vicious sorts  of libel against Jews.   Why are Senate Democrats trying to release vicious anti-Semites? If  you go back to the appropriation language, why are they suggesting in  the appropriation language that the United States should be fighting to  release that anti-Semite and hate preacher?   We don't know because Senate Democrats aren't defending that  position, and the administration refuses to answer.   Who are some of the other people on that list?   Well, you have Mohamed El-Baqer. He was a Salafist youth activist. He  was part of the Revolutionary Youth who started the revolution, and he  has been implicated in security violations.   How about Ola al-Qaradawi? She is the daughter of Yosef al-Qaradawi,  who is one of the major voices for jihad inside the Muslim Brotherhood.  The paper trail on her is deliberately opaque from both sides.   How about Hosam Khalaf? He is Ola al-Qaradawi's husband, and he has  been allegedly connected to a Muslim Brotherhood offshoot.   How about Abdulrahman Tarek? Well, we don't know. His presence has  not been accounted for publicly.   And yet these names mysteriously appear in a Senate appropriations  report. When I asked Ms. Leaf about it, she provided 1,000 words and  not a single name.   And I will tell you that, actually, the names on that list are not  secrets from Congress. They have been provided to Congress in a  classified form. So the Presiding Officer and I can go into a secure  SCIF, and we can read it in the SCIF. We can read the names.   You know what we are not allowed to do?   Tell anyone what the names are.   Why is it that those names are classified?   They are classified because President Biden and Vice President Harris  don't want the American people to know who it is they are trying to  release.   There is no reasonable justification for those names to be  classified. They are extorting our friend and ally, Egypt, to get 16  people released from jail, and they refuse to tell us who.   The American people have a right to know if the Biden administration  is trying to pressure our allies to release Muslim Brotherhood  extremists; if the Biden administration is trying to get our allies to  release anti-Semites; and, if they are, to hear a justification for  why. But Ms. Leaf, instead, simply defies the Senate and refuses to  answer.   Let's turn now to Israel.   During the Trump administration, there was a decision to stand  shoulder to shoulder with Israel, which led to an historic flowering of  peace across the region. The name and framework for those peace  agreements was the Abraham Accords.   This was something that the Obama administration said would never  happen and something, unfortunately, tragically, that they were  actively hostile to. The Obama administration insisted that Israel  would have to make massive concessions to the Palestinians on their  sovereignty--on the security of Israel--before there could ever be  peace deals between the Israelis and their Arab neighbors.   When asked whether there could ever be peace like the Abraham Accords  without a prior deal with the Palestinians, then-Secretary of State  John Kerry said: ``There will be no separate peace between Israel and  the Arab world. . . . No, no, no, and no.''   No ambiguity to what they thought--they don't want peace without  massive concessions from Israel to the Palestinians.   Well, turned out President Obama and Secretary Kerry were tragically  wrong, as they were on so many issues, and President Trump demonstrated  that to the world. And, sadly, President Biden and Vice President  Harris have never forgiven our Israeli allies and our Arab allies for  that--for demonstrating that with strong, resolute clarity from the  United States' unequivocal support of Israel, that peace could be the  result. That was an outcome anathema to the foreign policy objectives  of the current administration. As a result, there are many in the Biden  administration that are enormously, deeply, seethingly hostile to the  Abraham Accords.   At the beginning of the Biden administration, the State Department  even issued internal guidance prohibiting the use of the phrase  ``Abraham Accords.'' Those words were verboten. You may not say those  words. The instructions were instead to call them the ``normalization  agreements.''   George Orwell is, no doubt, looking down from Heaven and smiling at  the power of language to be redefined. There are no Abraham Accords.  Now, they are normalization agreements.   Once again, the only reason that the public knows about this is  because journalists revealed it. This time, it was the ``Washington  Free Beacon,'' but the details have never been clarified.   After those public reports, the Biden administration was forced to at  least partially reverse that policy. They insisted they fully support  the accords that must never be named. But it is not clear how true or  how broad that reversal has been.   On September 13, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., Thomas-Greenfield, gave  a speech about the Abraham Accords in which she stubbornly refused to  utter the words ``Abraham Accords.'' Instead, following, apparently,  the State Department guidance, she simply used the bland term  ``normalization agreements.''   On October 13, Secretary Blinken met with Foreign Minister Lapid, and  the spokesperson issued a formal readout from that meeting. Once again,  the formal readout from the State Department carefully eschewed any  mention of the Abraham Accords and used the bland term ``regional  normalization efforts.''   This is conscious. This is deliberate. This is a pattern. It is a  classic example of where congressional oversight is called for.   Madam President, many Senate Democrats claim to support the Abraham  Accords. Now, I would note, I was at the White House for the signing of  the Abraham Accords. Not a single Senate Democrat showed up for that  historic peace agreement--none. Presumably because of partisan loathing  of President Trump. But, nonetheless, congressional Democrats say they  support the accords today. If that is true, we need to see  congressional oversight.   So I asked Ms. Leaf for the specific guidance that was issued to the  State Department. Give Congress--give the Senate--the written guidance  prohibiting reference to the Abraham Accords. We know about it from  public reports in the media. She and the State Department refused. They  refused to provide that guidance to Congress. They refused to show it  to the public. And, in doing it, it is not accidental.  [[Page S7574]]    She refuses to answer this question because they want to hide it from  the American people, just like the names of the 16 prisoners they are  demanding that Egypt release. Presumably, if the American people knew  those names, knew the affiliations, knew the backgrounds, they would be  outraged. Likewise, if the American people read the written guidance  issued by this State Department, prohibiting uttering of the words  ``Abraham Accords,'' then the charade so many Democrats try to play in  supporting those accords would be that much harder to maintain.   A third example, turning to Iran, perhaps more than anything else,  first and foremost, this administration wants to return to the  catastrophic Obama-Biden-Iran nuclear deal and to dismantle meaningful  sanctions against the theocratic regime in Iran. From the earliest  hours of the administration, the effort began to do exactly that.   As part of that push, the administration has quietly, and sometimes  secretly, reduced pressure on Iran and released frozen Iranian funds.  But the Ayatollah wants to see just how much he can get, and he may not  think that President Biden will ever do anything meaningful. If the  United States isn't going to impose pressure on Iran, there is no  reason for the Ayatollah to return to the deal at all. He doesn't need  to take ``yes'' for an answer for a deal because he is getting  everything anyway.   And so since very early in the administration, the Biden-Harris  officials have contemplated what has been called a ``less for less''  agreement in which they would reduce some pressure on Iran for  something less than full compliance. You will only nuke some of us.   Once again, we only know about the existence of these considerations  from public reports. In February and again over the summer, Reuters  reported on administration officials contemplating these deals, the so- called ``less for less'' deals. We here in Congress know a little more  but not much.   Congress and the public deserve to know what is being contemplated to  reduce pressure on the Iranian regime, the world's leading state  sponsor of terrorism and a regime that seeks--and, I believe, may well  be willing--to use nuclear weapons to murder millions of Americans and  millions of our allies.   I believe that if the Ayatollah had the ability to murder millions of  Americans or millions of Israelis in the blink of an eye, the odds are  far too high that this theocratic zealot, who glories in death and  suicide, would be willing to do so.   And so I asked Ms. Leaf for the details of such agreements. Here is  what she said in response:         There have been no such arrangements, deals, or agreements       contemplated to reduce pressure on Iran.    That statement is false. It is categorically, directly, unequivocally  false. It is false testimony in writing to the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee. Ms. Leaf knows it is false, and the State Department  handlers who transmitted her written answer to the Senate know that it  is false.   What is the Biden administration trying to hide? What deep details  don't they want us to know?   This isn't just about policy disagreements, although I disagree  vehemently with many of this administration's policies. I understand  some people, some Democrats, will disagree. But even more  fundamentally, this is about transparency and oversight. On that, there  should be no disagreement.   And these questions are ones that go to the very core of this  administration's Middle East foreign policy and of American national  security. What extremists are President Biden and Vice President Harris  trying to empower? Whom do they view as allies worth supporting in the  region? What deals are being contemplated with the Iranian regime?   I asked Ms. Leaf for these details. She has, after all, been working  right in the center of Middle East issues for this administration. She  and the Biden-Harris administration are refusing to answer. The public  has a right to know.   Let me also point out that President Biden, in recent days, said  publicly that if Iran enters into a new nuclear deal, the United States  would stay bound by it in perpetuity as long as Iran didn't renege on  that deal. I want to be absolutely clear on something: President Biden  has zero constitutional authority to make that commitment.   The Ayatollah in Iran could be forgiven for misunderstanding that.  The Ayatollah, after all, is a total dictator with the ability to line  up anyone who disagrees and execute them on the spot. But, thankfully,  the President of the United States does not enjoy such dictatorial  powers.   Under our Constitution, there are two ways, and two ways only, that a  President can make a binding commitment on the United States of  America. The first is through passing a law that passes the Senate,  passes the House, and is signed into law by the President. If President  Biden wishes to do so with any Iran deal, he is welcome to do so.   The second and the way, traditionally, that foreign policies  agreements are handled is through a treaty--a treaty that is submitted  to the Senate and ratified by two-thirds of the Senate. The chances  that the Biden-Harris whatever disastrous nuclear deal they work out  with Iran, the chances that that would be ratified by two-thirds of the  Senate I can quantify exactly. There is 0.00 percent.    President Biden knows that. He knows that because the Senate has been  unequivocal that this deal is disastrous and harmful for American  national security, harmful for Israel, and harmful for our allies. And  so, instead, President Biden makes an empty promise that he cannot  commit.   In that, he is following in the footsteps of President Obama.  President Obama made a similar promise, and President Obama knew it was  a lie when he said it, and President Biden knows it is a lie when he  says it.   History demonstrated that President Obama told a falsehood because  the next Republican President, Donald J. Trump, ripped the Obama-Iran  deal to shreds and withdrew from the deal, which was the right  decision. I urged President Trump to do that.   Our allies and our enemies should mark my words on this: Regardless  of whatever empty promises President Biden makes, he lacks  constitutional authority to bind a subsequent administration. And I  believe it is 100 percent certain that the next Republican President  who is sworn into office will once again rip to shreds any disastrous  deal negotiated with the Ayatollah and Iran.   So President Biden has 3 more years to try to give away the store, to  try to send billions of dollars, perhaps on pallets in the dead of  night like Barack Obama did, to fund theocratic terrorists who want to  murder Americans and murder Israelis. But the Ayatollah needs to know,  Europe needs to know, our friends need to know, our enemies need to  know that President Biden's promises are empty words that will expire  the instant his Presidency is over.   We don't have a dictator in this country. We have a constitutional  republic. If President Biden wants to bind subsequent administrations,  he can negotiate a treaty, submit a treaty to the Senate, and get it  ratified. But he doesn't have the votes, and so instead he makes empty  promises.   If President Biden and Vice President Harris were proud of the  policies they are pursuing in the Middle East, they would give the  American people the list of the 16 prisoners they are trying to force  Egypt to release.   We know that multiple of the names Senate Democrats have put in the  appropriations language are affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood. We  know one is an anti-Semitic hate preacher. And we suspect that the  administration knows full well that if it released those names, it  couldn't defend them to the American people. It is counting on darkness  and secrecy to hide their conduct.   I believe the Senate--both Republicans and Democrats--have an  obligation to the American people to shine a light. If you are going to  extort our allies to release prisoners, tell us now: Are they  affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood? Are they anti-Semites? Are they  a national security threat to the United States or our allies? The  American people deserve to know.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
