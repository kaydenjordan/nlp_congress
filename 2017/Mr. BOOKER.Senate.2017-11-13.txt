 Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for the  votes on confirmation of Executive Calendar No. 159 and the motion to  invoke cloture on Executive Calendar No. 254.   On vote No. 270, had I been present, I would have voted nay on the  confirmation of Executive Calendar No. 159.   On vote No. 271, had I been present, I would have voted nay on the  motion to invoke cloture on Executive Calendar No. 254.                            ____________________
