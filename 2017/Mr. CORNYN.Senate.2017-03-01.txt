Mr. President, the Chamber is too slowly moving forward  on the President's Cabinet nominees. So far, this Chamber has confirmed  16 Cabinet nominees since January 20. I would note that the most recent  nominee, Secretary Zinke, was confirmed by a vote of 68 to 31 and that  Wilbur Ross, Secretary of Commerce, was confirmed by a vote of 72 to  27.   Why have we burned 5 weeks of this new administration and denied the  President the staff and the help and the team he needs in order to lead  the country? It makes no sense whatsoever.   I, once again, implore our friends on the other side of the aisle to  stop the foot-dragging and the delay for delay's sake and to let the  President have his Cabinet.
