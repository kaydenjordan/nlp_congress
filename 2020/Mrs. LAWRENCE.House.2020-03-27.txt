 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the CARES Act.   At this time, our country needs this Congress to act with a  bipartisan commitment to ensuring the safety and the well-being of our  constituents. Although this package is not perfect, we must support our  postal workers. We must ensure our municipalities have the funding to  survive.   But it will immediately provide workers, families, health  professionals, and first responders the resources that they need.   Today, we can provide a direct cash infusion into our economy, and we  will provide more than $170 billion in support to purchase the needed  PPEs and give our hospitals grants to offset revenue losses.   However, our work is not done. As confirmed cases in Michigan and  across the country continue to rise, I will work with my colleagues on  both sides of the aisle to address the outstanding issues.   And I want to say: God bless America, and we need to do our work.
