 Madam President, first, I understand that there are two  bills at the desk due for a second reading en bloc.    In order to place the bills on the calender under the  provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further proceeding en bloc.    Madam President, despite unprecedented obstacles, the  Senate has had an extremely productive first period of business.   It has been a little over 60 days since Democrats assumed the  majority in the Senate and Joe Biden was sworn in as President. In that  relatively short amount of time, the Senate has confirmed every  available Cabinet Secretary--a group filled with a bevy of historic  firsts--faster than under the prior two administrations.   Every single Cabinet nominee has received a bipartisan vote of  approval here on the floor, a tribute to their character, their  qualifications, and their caliber.   The Senate also conducted a fair and honest impeachment trial of the  former President, resulting in the largest and most bipartisan  conviction  [[Page S1792]]  vote in the history, in the history of Presidential impeachments.   And, of course, the Democratic majority in the Senate passed the most  sweeping Federal recovery effort in decades, the American Rescue Plan.   Again, despite several unprecedented obstacles, not only did we get a  late start on our work, a result of the runoff elections in Georgia, we  have had to contend with the aftermath of an armed insurrection at the  Capitol, an impeachment trial, and the difficulty of navigating an  evenly divided Senate.   Let's take a quick look at the scoreboard.   Economists project that the American Rescue Plan could double  economic growth while cutting child poverty in half--the biggest anti- poverty effort in a generation.   We have made the single largest investment in American education and  Native Tribes ever.   Experts have called the American Rescue Plan the most significant  legislation for Black farmers since the Civil Rights Act.   The American Rescue Plan provides a lifeline to Main Street  businesses from one end of the country to the other. Companies are  already scaling back layoffs.   In less than 100 days, the Biden administration and Democratic  majorities have helped deliver more than 100 million shots in people's  arms and 100 million checks in people's pockets. As a result, the  American people are more optimistic than at any time over the past  year, and for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic began, a clear  majority of Americans believe our country is back on track.   Just this morning, the jobs report showed that applications for  unemployment benefits fell by nearly 100,000 people--a sign that  businesses are reopening and Americans are optimistic about getting  back to work. After one of the most difficult years in American  history, the country is finally turning the corner, and the Senate is  off to a fantastic start.   Now looking forward, of course the job certainly isn't done yet. Now  that we have passed the American Rescue Plan, the Senate must continue  to make progress on other issues facing the American people. When the  Senate returns to session, our agenda will be no less ambitious than it  was over the past few months.   We will focus on three areas: one, voting rights, civil rights; two,  economic recovery and jobs, with an emphasis on climate change and  building back better; and three, health and gun safety.   This Senate will once again be the forum where civil rights are  debated and historic action is taken to secure them for all Americans.   Last week, the Judiciary Committee held the first-ever hearing on the  Equality Act, landmark legislation that would enshrine as a matter of  law that no American shall be denied justice based on their gender or  sexual orientation.   In the coming work period, the Democratic majority will also seek to  repeal a Trump administration rule that gives employers an unfair  advantage over workers when settling discriminatory claims.   At the same time, the Judiciary and Rules Committees have started  their work responding to the concerted, nationwide, despicable attack  on voting rights. In one State after another, new restrictions on the  franchise are taking aim at communities of color in ways we haven't  seen since the days of Jim Crow.   Yesterday, I attended the Rules Committee hearing on S. 1, the For  the People Act, and I listened to my Republican colleagues try to  defend these outrageous voter suppression laws. One member on the  committee told us not to worry about them because many are just  proposals and won't become law. Later that day, the same day, the  Montana State Senate advanced a bill to end same-day voter  registration.   Another member on the committee defended limits to early voting on  Sundays--a day when many African Americans go to vote after church--by  quoting the Bible and the Commandment to keep the Sabbath holy. I don't  know where to begin with that one, but I will start by reminding my  colleagues of the separation between church and state, and, frankly,  the Bible passage she talked about comes from the Old Testament, when  the Sabbath was on Saturday.   This is getting beyond ridiculous. Across the country, the Republican  Party seems to believe that the best strategy for winning elections is  not to win more voters but to try to prevent the other side from  voting. That is not America. That is not democracy. And this Senate  will take action to protect the voting rights of tens of millions of  Americans. The Senate will vote on the For the People Act.   We will also keep a laser focus on our economic recovery. In the  coming months, the Senate will consider legislation to rebuild our  infrastructure and fight climate change, boost research and development  and domestic manufacturing, reform our broken immigration system, and  grow the power of American workers. Finally, the Senate will address  health and gun safety.   When the Senate gavels back into session, we will vote on Senator  Hirono's COVID hate crimes bill, which my colleague Grace Meng has  sponsored in the House. It will give the Department of Justice and our  local police departments crucial tools to fight the wave of racist  violence we have seen against Asian Americans.   I have also committed to put a bill on expanded background checks on  the floor of the Senate.   On the health front, we will take aim against the former  administration's decision to roll back limits on methane emissions from  oil and gas production--gases that pack a much greater punch than  carbon dioxide when it comes to our climate. Senators Heinrich, King,  and Markey have been working very hard on this issue. I applaud them.  The Senate will take up a Congressional Review Act measure to reinstate  the commonsense regulation of methane emissions to fight climate  change.   The bottom line is this: The Senate of the 117th Congress has  accomplished a lot in its first few months, but we have a lot of work  left to do. The challenges our country still faces are immense, and  there is no reason both sides cannot work together on issues that will  affect our country and our children's future. We won't agree on  everything, but we must agree that inaction is unacceptable. The Senate  must help the country finish the job against COVID while continuing to  build a more equal economy and a more just society.
