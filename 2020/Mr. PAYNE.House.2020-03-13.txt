 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Ruby Ann Whittle Smith  on the occasion of her 100th birthday.   Ms. Smith has been a district resident for 95 years. She was born in  South Hill, Virginia, on March 15, 1920, and moved to Orange, New  Jersey, 5 years later.   Ms. Smith graduated from Orange High School and later the New York  Institute of Dietetics. She started her career as a hospital dietician  and worked at Community Hospital in Newark, New Jersey, then she spent  30 years as a clerk at Western Electric.   But she is known and loved for her passions: her dedication to New  Hope Baptist Church in East Orange, her enjoyment of Denzel Washington  movies, and her love of peppermints and bingo.   Happy birthday to Ruby Ann Whittle Smith. She is truly 100 years  young.                            ____________________
