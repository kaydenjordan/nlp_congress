 Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I thank the Democratic leadership for, I think the first time this  year, allowing our side to actually have a substitute to a major piece  of legislation. And I thank our leadership, because that substitute is  not a partisan substitute but, rather, a bipartisan substitute. In  fact, every single provision in this bill has got strong bipartisan  support, which was packaged together.   Tomorrow will mark the third anniversary of President Obama's signing  of 21st Century Cures, a bill that Diana DeGette and I helped shepherd  through our committee on a unanimous vote, and we passed here in the  House 392-26.   21st Century Cures increased NIH funding by some $45 billion over a  10-year span. It sped up the approval of drugs and devices, and just  after 3 years we have seen the number of cell, gene, and nucleoid  therapies have more than doubled. In fact, research this last year will  actually exceed $13 billion. The FDA is predicted to approve as many as  20 gene therapy drugs by the year 2025. That is wonderful news.   We all want to do something about drug prices, and that is what a  vote for our substitute, H.R. 19, will do. The President will sign that  bill, but he is not going to sign this bill, H.R. 3, because it is  going to slow down the ability to find the cures that we want to find  for these awful diseases.   Now, those aren't my words. That is the CBO, a nonpartisan group, it  is the CEA, the Council of Economic Advisers.   But in today's ``Wall Street Journal,'' the former director of the  FDA, Scott Gottlieb, writes, ``This week the House will vote on  legislation known as H.R. 3. The price-control approach would increase  uncertainty and reduce returns from biotech investment, raising the  cost of capital for these invaluable endeavors.'' He is right on. We  want to find new cures. We want to find new technologies and to use  those. We want precision medicine.   Madam Chair, I include the ``Price Controls Would Stifle Biotech  Innovation'' in the Record.               Price Controls Would Stifle Biotech Innovation         A House price-control bill would do the most damage to       transformative and lifesaving medications.                     (By Scott Gottlieb, Dec. 11, 2019)         Victoria Gray of Mississippi recently became the first U.S.       patient with a genetic disorder to be treated using the       Crispr gene-editing technique. Doctors used a novel drug to       overwrite the function of a faulty gene that gave rise to her       sickle-cell disease. Advances in life science can define this       century, but policy makers must resist the urge to adopt       policies that impose price controls and punish drugmakers for       taking risks.        The convergence of information technology and biology       allows scientists to translate the human genome into digital       data that can accelerate diagnoses and cures. Over the next       decade, it is a near certainty that we will have gene-therapy       cures for deadly inherited disorders such as muscular       dystrophy. Cell-based and regenerative medicine can restore       human functions lost to disease, including returning some       sight to the blind. Gene editing will be used to alter DNA to       erase the origins of a range of debilitating inherited       disorders.        These are only some of the opportunities at hand. Yet bad       policies could sap the risk-taking that brings forth the most       important innovations. For instance, the Lower Drug Costs Now       Act would expose the 250 costliest drugs to government price       controls. The high-cost drugs lawmakers target are often the       most innovative and potentially transformative new       medications. This week the House will vote on the       legislation, known as H.R. 3.        The price-control approach would increase uncertainty and       reduce returns from biotech investment, raising the cost of       capital for these invaluable endeavors. It would alter       incentives and shift money from the most speculative but       highest-value science, including regenerative medicine and       gene editing. Money would flow instead to known disease areas       and well-characterized targets, using proven approaches such       as pill-form drugs.        New and high-risk drug platforms like gene therapies are       often targeted first to treat rare and serious conditions;       after they are proven to work safely, they will be used to       treat morecommon maladies, such as heart disease. This is how       medicine advances. But if investors knew their returns would       be capped, they would direct their investments toward safer       projects with lesser payoffs. We would still get new drugs,       but the treatments would be very different.        Fifteen years ago, the standard refrain from drug-industry       critics was that all the big drugmakers did was develop ``me       too'' medicines--the seventh version of a blood-pressure pill       or a cholesterol-lowering statin. In response, the federal       government took steps, some of which shaped Medicare Part D,       to encourage investment in ``specialty'' drugs that were more       novel.        Since then, investment capital has shifted sharply. Cancer       and rare diseases receive substantially more attention and       resources. The number of cell, gene and nucleotide therapies       in development has more than doubled over the past three       years, while total investment in cell and gene therapies       eclipsed $13 billion last year.        The Food and Drug Administration approved four gene       therapies in only the past three years, with 800 similar       kinds of products in various stages of development. An       assessment of the current pipeline and historical rates of       success in clinical trials suggests that by 2025 the FDA will       be approving 10 to 20 gene-therapy drugs a year. Progress  [[Page H10133]]       is especially strong in oncology. The number of cancer drugs       in development has quadrupled since 1996.        These specialty drugs often aren't cheap. They target       narrow conditions for which the cost of risk-taking and drug       development is amortized over a smaller number of eligible       patients. Highly novel drug platforms can also cost more       initially to perfect. Based on my informal survey of       companies, enrolling a single patient in a clinical trial for       a gene-altering drug often costs between $500,000 and       $700,000 and can reach as high as $1 million.        To support this innovation, total spending on research and       development by the 15 biggest drugmakers topped $100 billion       in 2018, up 32 percent in the past five years. A cancer cure,       or a gene-therapy remedy, can sharply reduce the lifetime       cost of treating a debilitating disease. It can dramatically       alter the length and productivity of people's lives. But       high-cost treatments are pricing out a growing number of       underinsured patients, keeping them from using medications       that could alter their providence. This is unacceptable.        There are ways to make specialty drugs more affordable       without eroding the incentives that drive capital into the       riskiest but most promising endeavors. One is to help second-      to-market drugs get through the regulatory process.        Once an effective drug is approved to treat a deadly       condition, introducing a second drug to treat the same       disease can be hard. It's tough to recruit patients with a       debilitating disease for a clinical trial when a proven       medicine is already available. Moreover, the smaller pool of       patients who will be newly diagnosed each year with the same       disease isn't always large enough to support the cost of       developing a second drug, reducing competition that can lower       pnces.        We offer first-to-market breakthrough drugs an efficient       route through FDA review. We could give second-to-market       competing medicines the same regulatory benefits. Further,       when the biology of a drug target is very well understood,       and the basis for how it interacts with a disease firmly       established, we can create a new regulatory designation to       streamline development of a competing drug and shift data       collection to real-world, post-approval settings.        Many drugs targeted by H.R. 3 for government price controls       are examples of the innovation we should try to encourage. In       fact, they are the investments that critics who griped about       me-too medicines said they wanted. Now the same crowd is       crafting policies that would shift investment back into the       more mundane endeavors they once lamented.     Madam Chair, I have served on the Health Subcommittee for  all my days on the Energy and Commerce Committee, and we have seen  firsthand the different families impacted by these awful diseases,  whether it be Alzheimer's or sickle cell, cystic fibrosis.   Just this last week, we witnessed real advancements, we think, in  pancreatic cancer stage III, stage IV. SMA, spinal muscular atrophy, a  disease that is often fatal by the year 9 or 10; we saw a woman who had  been on a new drug for 15 days, and for the first time she could  actually move her neck after more than 10 years literally trapped in a  wheelchair.   If we want to find the advancements and cures for these diseases, we  need to pass H.R. 19.   I urge my colleagues to vote for that substitute and get a bill to  the President that he will actually sign, and we can get something  done.    Mr. Chair, I seek time in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I do rise in opposition to the amendment. I  would like to make a couple of points.   According to the Office of Personnel Management, OPM, the FEHB  program, the Federal Employee Health Benefits program, is, in fact, the  largest employer-sponsored group health insurance program in the world.  It covers nearly 9 million--9 million--Federal employees and their  families.   This amendment says that any private health plan that chooses to  offer coverage in the FEHB program must accept the government price  controls for prescription drugs established under this bill, H.R. 3.   So, clearly, we are not satisfied in this amendment with only setting  prices for Medicare and private businesses. It also creates another  harmful mandate and expands the already-radical scope of H.R. 3 to  other programs as well.   As my colleagues have noted again and again today and yesterday,  governments don't negotiate; they dictate. Taxing up to 95 percent of a  drug manufacturer's revenue if it refuses to agree with a government- mandated price is not free market negotiation.   And, as we have heard from both the CBO--nonpartisan body,  Congressional Budget Office--and the CEA, they tell us that we are  going to lose drugs that will solve cures, as they just won't happen  with this bill.   Government price controls lead to lower and fewer cures; and, as the  CEA said, nearly 100 cures for rare and difficult diseases likes  Alzheimer's, ALS, and cancer just aren't going to happen, or they are  going to be much delayed under H.R. 3.   So I would ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I would also just like to say that the CRS, Congressional Research  Service, has found that price controls in this bill, H.R. 3, the  underlying bill, may be unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment's  Takings Clause and the Eighth Amendment Excessive Fines Clause.   So, instead of considering yet another amendment which expands  radical government-mandated price controls at the expense of developing  lifesaving cures, our time would be better spent considering bipartisan  policies such as what is in the substitute, H.R. 19.   So I would encourage my colleagues to, instead, vote for the  amendment on H.R. 19 and vote against H.R. 3.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    I am in its current form.    Mr. Speaker, here is the beef: Tomorrow marks the third  anniversary of the enactment of 21st Century Cures, a bill that passed  this House at 392-26. In looking back at that legislation now, 3 years  later, we have made wonderful strides in finding the cures for the  diseases that have impacted every family, be it cystic fibrosis,  Alzheimer's and pancreatic cancer, just to name a few.   And just last week, a number of us met with a young girl who had been  in a trial for SMA. That is often a fatal disease known as spinal  muscular atrophy. She was in a wheelchair, barely able to talk. But  after 15 days on this trial, she could actually move her head and her  neck for the first time in more than a decade, all really because of  what we did on 21st Century Cures.   The CBO/CEA and Scott Gottlieb, in today's ``Wall Street Journal''  writes that H.R. 3, the underlying bill: ``The price-control approach  would increase uncertainty and reduce returns from biotech investment,  raising the cost of capital for these invaluable endeavors.''   You know, we are on the cusp of gene therapy for deadly inherited  diseases like MS, literally, finding cures to solve blindness. But  let's not stop. Let's build on what we did.   The language in this motion to recommit assures that cures will not  be slowed down, because we have the requirement that unless the  Secretary of HHS certifies the implementation of such provisions are  not projected to result in fewer new drug applications. That is what  this amendment is about.   We want to make sure that we have the resources to develop the cures  that all of us want for the thousands of diseases where we don't have a  cure.   Mr. Speaker, I would yield to the gentleman from Texas to talk about  his personal story, that many of us did not know until this bill came  up in the last couple of days.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Wright).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
