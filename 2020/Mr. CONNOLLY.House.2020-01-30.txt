 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my good friend  Barbara Lee's longstanding amendment, which would repeal the 2002  Authorization for Use of Military Force against Iraq.   More than 17 years ago, Congress passed a resolution authorizing the  equivalent of war with Iraq, a war I opposed then. It stretches  credulity to claim that same resolution now extends authorization to  the President's order to assassinate a foreign leader from Iran. Yet,  that is precisely what the White House would have you believe.   This AUMF is obsolete, and it is far past time that Congress make  crystal clear to the administration, our allies, and our adversaries,  as well as our constituents, the circumstances under which we would  authorize engagement by our men and women in uniform.   The Lee amendment repeals a misguided AUMF that has had disastrous  consequences, and it reasserts Congress' Article I authorities as  provided and mandated by the Constitution of the United States.   Let's live up to our constitutional responsibility. Madam Speaker,  let's support this amendment and get back to constitutional  responsibilities and powers.
