 Mr. President, this week the Senate continues to  confirm impressive nominees whom President Trump has asked to serve our  country. We have confirmed two Assistant Secretaries to the Department  of Education, Scott Stump and James Blew. We have confirmed a member of  the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, Randal Quarles. Now we  will turn to the judiciary and consider nominees to the Fifth Circuit  and Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.   First is Andrew Oldham of Texas, the President's choice for the Fifth  Circuit. Mr. Oldham has impressed the legal community in his years of  public service, most recently as general counsel to the Governor of  Texas.   Mr. Oldham has degrees from the University of Virginia, Cambridge,  and Harvard Law. He clerked on both the DC Circuit Court and the  Supreme Court. He carries the highest possible rating from the American  Bar Association, ``unanimously well-qualified.''   He comes highly recommended by peers and colleagues from across the  political spectrum. Judith Zaffirini is a Texas State senator. She is a  Democrat. She wrote the Judiciary Committee to support Mr. Oldham's  nomination ``confidently, enthusiastically, and without reservation.''  She and the nominee have worked together on a number of important  subjects. Through them all, she explains, ``Mr. Oldham reflected the  ideal qualities of a judge . . . open-minded, fair . . . thoughtful and  analytical.''   Lisa Blatt is a skilled litigator who argues frequently before the  Supreme Court. She is also a Democrat. She wrote the committee too. Her  letter describes Mr. Oldham as ``a great listener'' with ``a brilliant  legal mind, [and] a wonderful sense of humor and collegiality.''   Her conclusion? He would ``make a superb judge.''   What about Mr. Oldham's own words? If confirmed, he explained to our  colleagues during his hearing, he will ``uphold the rights of all  litigants--big or little--equally, and apply the law to all fairly.''   He understands his responsibility, clearly. I look forward to  confirming this nominee, and I urge each of our colleagues to join me.    Mr. President, in April, the Democratic leader and I  announced the reestablishment of the Senate NATO Observer Group.  Senators Tillis and Shaheen, both Members of the Senate Armed Services  Committee, were named cochairs. We have asked for the following  Senators to participate: Barrasso, Rubio, Gardner,  Ernst, Rounds,  Merkley, Coons, King, Booker and Van Hollen.                            ____________________
