 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because there is a lot we  need to do to fix healthcare here in the United States.   I will work with anyone, regardless of political party, who has ideas  to improve healthcare and get costs down, but I find it unacceptable  that the Department of Justice wants to gut the Affordable Care Act  with no plan.   We need to stabilize the volatile healthcare marketplace, increase  competition so that affordable prescription drugs are within reach for  everyone, cover preexisting conditions, and make sure that we always  protect the Social Security and Medicare that our seniors rely on.   Last Congress, the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus introduced such  a proposal, and we need to get it done now.   In New Jersey, we are very lucky to have some of the best healthcare  providers, innovators, and hospitals in the world. We are America's  medicine cabinet.   Our people deserve a bipartisan approach to fix our healthcare system  so that we can look out for everyone in New Jersey and everyone across  the country.                            ____________________
