 Mr. President, it is an honor to remember and  recognize the life of Governor Everett Chavez.   Governor Chavez devoted his life to the people of Santo Domingo  Pueblo and to building a strong future for the next generation of  leaders in Indian Country.   Chavez served three terms as the Governor of Kewa Pueblo, also known  as Santo Domingo.   Governor Chavez also served as the superintendent of the Santa Fe  Indian School, mentoring Native youth and setting high expectations for  their educational achievements.   He was a proud graduate of the University of New Mexico, where he  received a degree in electrical engineering.   Thanks to his dedication, many students received scholarships for  college and put their education to work in their communities.   Governor Chavez was powerful at influencing policy to benefit Indian  Country at the highest levels of government.   Governor Chavez served on President Obama's advisory committee for  Native American and Alaskan Natives.   He worked with New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver  to increase voter registration and election participation in Native  communities.   He was constantly building partnerships and implementing major  initiatives in his community.   He was hard at work serving others until the very end.   New Mexico has lost one of our greatest leaders.   My thoughts are with Governor Chavez's family.   His legacy will endure in all of those he inspired through his  selfless actions.                            ____________________
