 Mr. Speaker, imagine a system that frustrates you  being weaponized in order to deny you the care that you are entitled to  and that you should be entitled to in this country. That is what we do  when we say that the inefficiencies of the VA system is reason for us  not to pass this bill.   This bill is going to do so much good for veterans who deserve it,  and it is going to do so much good for particular veterans who served  in Guam and were exposed to Agent Orange. It is the only bill right now  that is going to get that done.   Mr. Speaker, the late Lonnie Kilpatrick died from his exposure to  Agent Orange. My bipartisan colleague, Gus Bilirakis, and I introduced  a bill to address that exposure. This legislation that we are talking  about today, the Honoring our PACT Act, will get that done.   Let's not weaponize the frustrations of the VA to prevent those kinds  of solutions. Let's get this done for our veterans. It is about time.  [[Page H1236]]
