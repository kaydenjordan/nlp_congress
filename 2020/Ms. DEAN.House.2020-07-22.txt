 Madam Speaker, our student loan debt crisis predates the  pandemic. We encourage high school students to attend college, to claim  their education, yet too many graduates are shackled with a mountain of  debt that limits their future, impedes their financial freedom, and  diminishes their purchasing power. The pandemic has only worsened this  problem.   During this pandemic, we owe it to a generation of debt-laden young  people, veterans, and transitioning adults to take bold action, to pass  meaningful debt forgiveness. Freeing up the ability to claim an  education without crushing debt will be a relief to so many Americans  and our economy.   An educated public should enrich us all, not create unsustainable  debt. So I call upon this body to pass bold and meaningful debt  forgiveness for millions of bright young people so that their futures  are determined not by the debt they incurred but by the knowledge they  gained.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, like many others in this Chamber, the last time I  heard Mr. Lewis' voice was on a Caucus call recently. Congressman Lewis  implored us: Be bold. Be brave. Keep the faith. Keep your eyes on the  prize. Keep working. There is much work to be done. Don't get weary.  Continue the work.   John Lewis was a hero to all of us for causing ``good trouble'' and  for standing on the right side of history, for standing for our common  humanity.   His humility, strength, and belief in the greatness of this country  never faltered. What a blessing it has been to me to serve with him.   I had the privilege of being with him on a visit in Florida to the  detention camp where immigrant children were kept separated from their  parents, and through an interpreter, he spoke to the children.   He had two messages. So whether he was speaking to us in Congress or  to a President or to children, his message was the same, and the same  was: Believe in the promise of America. Keep the faith. Be bold. Don't  be disturbed.   His other message, his second message, was one of welcome, and the  beaming children loved that. He said: Welcome to America. We welcome  you.   His was a memory of kindness and humility and optimism for a better  place, an America that was promised in our founding documents.   On many occasions, we have fallen short, short of the American  promise of equality and justice for all. Mr. Lewis' scars revealed  that.   His memory will be a beacon for justice and equality and for the  unfinished business of the people to be a country of mercy, of decency,  and of love.   Thank you, Mr. Lewis. Lucky us to have passed this way with you.
