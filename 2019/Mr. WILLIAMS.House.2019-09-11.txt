 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of those who  lost their lives on 9/11/2001.   Eighteen years ago, the lives of innocent men, women, and children  were senselessly taken at the hands of Islamic terrorists under the  command of Osama bin Laden. Before day's end, nearly 3,000 civilians,  firefighters, law enforcement officers, and servicemembers would perish  in the World Trade Center, on United Flight 93 in Pennsylvania, and in  the Pentagon.   Though another year has passed, the pain remains for the families who  lost a loved one that fateful day. I pray for all of those people who  have lost someone today and pray for them tomorrow, and I pray for  those in harm's way who continue to serve across the globe to ensure  that we can live safely in the greatest country in the world: the  United States of America.   Never forget, and may God bless America.   In God we trust.                            ____________________
