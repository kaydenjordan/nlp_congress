 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to declare the Baltimore  Oracles, my staff's congressional softball team, once again champions,  having completed a perfect season, including an impressive 18-3 victory  in the championship game.   Captained by Peter Gelman, Katie Teleky, and the equipment manager,  Raymond O'Mara, the team's stalwart defense and steadfast offense was  unstoppable. Yet roster depth proved to be the team's ultimate  advantage.   Mike Pulver, Lucinda Lessley, Paul Kincaid, Jocelyn Kissell, Maddie  Bainer, Laura Lubben, Ben Proshek, Rebecca O'Mara, Kate Durkin, Anna  Killius, Shannon Frede, and Zach Weber each contributed to form a  magnificent infield, while Brian Kaissi, Max Frankel, Andy Allen, Mike  VanDan Huevel, James Howard, Stephen Demarais, Jaelon Moaney, and Sam  Follansbee worked together to lock down the outfield, as did Jermaine  Vincent, who welcomed his newborn son, Jayden, into the world just  hours after lifting the trophy.   Tim O'Neil, the team's heart and soul, always kept hope alive with  his insistence that the team hit ``just a single,'' while the team's  loveable mascot, Winston, wagged his tail in agreement.   Mr. Speaker, the Baltimore Oracles are, once again, champions, and  that is truly world class.                            ____________________
