 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the work being  done on behalf of our veterans, the work that my office has been  working on.   Arizona's Sixth Congressional District is home to over 70,000  veterans. Our district has a historic legacy of service to our country  from the servicemembers at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base and Fort  Huachuca to incredible veterans like Walter Ram, a World War II veteran  and Purple Heart recipient.   In my role as their Congressman, I have made it my mission to secure  as much assistance as possible for those who risk their lives for our  freedom. That is why I made it a priority to help our veterans,  servicemembers, and their families as they navigate Federal agencies.  This year alone, my team has been able to return $345,000 to veterans.   The responsibility to provide for them is not one I take lightly, and  I am committed to ensuring they receive the care and support that they  deserve.   This is something that extends to my time here in Washington. As a  member of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, I have made a  concerted effort to introduce commonsense bills to improve the lives of  those who serve. My first bill ever introduced in Congress, H.R. 1378,  the Veterans' Appeals Backlog Improvement Act, aims to address the  lengthy waiting period our veterans face when trying to appeal a claim  at the VA.   I also led an effort to ensure and expand access to our veterans in  rural areas seeking disability claims with two pieces of legislation:  H.R. 5470, the Veteran Medical Exams for Distant Areas Act, and H.R.  5938, the Veterans Exam Expansion Act. It is critical that we ensure  our veterans receive the same care no matter their ZIP Code.   The same goes for the educational benefits they receive. That is why  I spearheaded H.R. 5702, the Expanding Access for Online Veteran  Students Act, legislation to ensure our student veterans taking classes  virtually receive the same housing benefits as their counterparts  taking classes in person. I learned about that need when I visited the  veterans center over at the University of Arizona. This was  highlighted, and we took immediate action.   We must ensure our veterans are equipped with the tools they need to  successfully transition out of uniform and into civilian life. That  includes a meaningful career, which is what led me to introducing H.R.  1669, the VET-TEC Authorization Act. The bill reauthorizes a popular VA  program that covers the cost of veterans seeking job training in high- tech industries.   Each of these bills is a small effort to improve the lives of those  who sacrifice so much.   On behalf of the people of Arizona's Sixth Congressional District, I  extend my deepest gratitude to the incredible men and women who have  served our country. While we will never be able to fully repay all of  them who have served, we have a duty to fight for them as they fought  for us.                            ____________________
