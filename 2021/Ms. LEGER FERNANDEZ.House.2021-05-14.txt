 Mr. Speaker, Sunday, we celebrated Mother's Day.  Today, we act to protect mothers-to-be.   Every pregnant worker deserves the opportunity to support their  family without risking the health of their pregnancy. Yet, pregnant  workers, especially those in low-wage and physically demanding jobs,  are often forced to choose between their health and a paycheck.   The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act will correct these flaws in our  system to ensure that pregnant women are treated fairly in the  workplace.   Women carried the brunt of losses during the pandemic, losing a net  5.4 million jobs. We need to make it easier for them to get back to  work, and that must include pregnant women.   I am proud that my home State of New Mexico passed legislation to  protect pregnant workers, with bipartisan support, last year. It is  time for Congress to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the ACLU in  support of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.                                                       May 11, 2021.      Re Vote YES for the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (H.R.           1065).         Dear Members of Congress: On behalf of the American Civil       Liberties Union, and our more than 1.8 million members,       supporters, and activists, we write to express our support       for H.R. 1065, the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. This       critical legislation would combat an all-too-common form of       pregnancy discrimination while also providing employers much-      needed clarity on their obligations under the law. We urge       all members of the House of Representatives to vote in favor       of this measured, bipartisan, and longoverdue legislation.        The ACLU has long fought to advance women's equality and       opportunity by challenging laws and policies that       discriminate against women in the workplace and by       dismantling the stereotypes that constrain women's full       engagement and participation at work. Although the Pregnancy       Discrimination Act has played a critical role over the past       40 years in securing women's place in the workforce, too many       women continue to be marginalized at work because of their       decision to become pregnant and have children. This kind of       discriminatory treatment has become most obvious when       pregnant workers--predominantly women in physically demanding       or male-dominated jobs, low-wage workers, and women of       color--request temporary accommodations to address a medical       need and instead are terminated or placed on unpaid leave,       causing devastating economic harm. The Pregnant Workers       Fairness Act would respond to this problem by requiring       employers with fifteen or more employees to provide       reasonable and temporary accommodations to pregnant workers       if doing so would not impose an undue hardship on the       business.          Pregnancy Discrimination, the PDA, and Young v. UPS, Inc.         Pregnancy and childbirth are often locus points for       discrimination against women in the workforce. Policies       excluding or forcing the discharge of pregnant women from the       workplace were common in the 1970s and reflected the       stereotype that a woman's primary or sole duties were to be a       homemaker and raise children. The adoption of the Pregnancy       Discrimination Act (PDA) in 1978, an amendment to Title VII       of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, established that       discrimination because of ``pregnancy, childbirth, and       related medical conditions'' was a form of discrimination       ``because of sex.'' It was intended to dismantle the       stereotype, and the policies based on it, that viewed       pregnant women's labor force participation as contingent,       temporary, and dispensable without regard to their individual       capacity to do the job in question.        The PDA also required employers to treat pregnant workers       the same as other temporarily disabled workers because       Congress recognized that working women contributed to their       families' economic stability and should not have to choose       between a career and continuing a pregnancy. Despite the PDA,       pregnancy discrimination persists, and for many years courts       routinely ruled against workers who brought pregnancy       accommodation cases where they alleged discrimination when an       employer provided a job modification to an employee       temporarily unable to work but failed to do the same for a       pregnant worker.        In Young v. United Parcel Service, Inc., the Supreme Court       granted certiorari to resolve a split in the Circuits and for       the first time addressed the PDA's application in the context       of an employee who needed an accommodation due to pregnancy.       The Court concluded that the statute's mandate applied with       equal force in these circumstances and articulated a modified       analysis for failure-to-accommodate cases. The Court also       offered a new pretext analysis that plaintiffs may rely on       when litigating claims under the PDA's second clause. Since       Young, the reflexive approval of employer policies favoring       workers with occupational injuries has largely disappeared.       However, the bright-line deference to employer policies, and       the overbroad reading of such policies as ``pregnancy-      blind,'' has been replaced, in many instances, with an unduly       demanding standard for plaintiffs in making a showing of       differential treatment--even at the initial pleading stage,       prior to having the benefit of discovery. This trend       undermines Young's intent of demanding that employers justify       failures to accommodate pregnancy. Instead, they impose       unwarranted--and often insurmountable--burdens of proof on       pregnant workers that increasingly confer ``least favored       nation'' status on the protected trait of pregnancy. The       stories of clients the ACLU has represented--both as direct       counsel and as lead amicus--illustrate the harm:        Lochren v. Suffolk County: Sandra Lochren and five other       police officers sued the Suffolk County Police Department       (SCPD) for refusing to temporarily reassign pregnant officers       to deskwork and other non-patrol jobs, even though it did so       for officers injured on the job. But for those officers who       opted to keep working patrol, SCPD also failed to provide       bulletproof vests or gun belts that would fit       pregnant officers. Their only safe option was to go on       unpaid leave long before their due dates.        Cole v. SavaSeniorCare: When Jaimie Cole, a certified       nursing assistant, was in her third trimester, she developed       a high risk of preeclampsia, a condition that can lead to       preterm labor or even death. Her doctor advised her not to do       any heavy lifting. Cole's  [[Page H2326]]       job required her to regularly help patients in and out of bed       and assist with bathing, so she asked for a temporary light       duty assignment. Instead, her employer sent her home without       pay for the rest of her pregnancy.        Myers v. Hope Healthcare Center: Asia Myers, a certified       nursing assistant, experienced complications early in her       pregnancy and was told by her doctor that she could continue       to work, but should not do any lifting on the job. Although       her employer had a history of providing light duty to workers       with temporary lifting restrictions, Myers was told not to       return to work until her restrictions were lifted. She was       out of work for over a month with no income or health       insurance coverage.        Hicks v. City of Tuscaloosa: Stephanie Hicks, a narcotics       investigator with the Tuscaloosa Police Department in       Alabama, wanted to breastfeed her new baby, but her       bulletproof vest was restrictive, painful, and prone to       causing infection in her breasts. She asked for a desk job       but her employer refused, even though it routinely granted       desk jobs to officers unable to fulfill all of their patrol       duties. Instead, it offered her an ill-fitting vest that put       her at risk.        Legg v. Ulster County: Corrections Officer Ann Marie Legg       was denied light duty during her pregnancy, even though       Ulster County gave such assignments to guards injured on the       job. In her third trimester, Legg had to intervene in a       fight, prompting her to go on leave rather than face future       risks.        Allen v. AT&T Mobility: Cynthia Allen lost her job because       she accumulated too many ``points'' under AT&T Mobility's       punitive attendance policy due to pregnancy-related symptoms       such as nausea. The policy makes accommodation for late       arrivals, early departures, and absences due to thirteen       enumerated reasons, some medical and some not, but none due       to pregnancy and pregnancy-related symptoms.        Durham v. Rural/ Metro Corp: Michelle Durham was an EMT in       Alabama whose job often required her to lift patients on       stretchers into an ambulance. When she became pregnant, her       health care provider imposed a restriction on heavy lifting.       Durham asked Rural/Metro for a temporary modified duty       assignment during her pregnancy, but was rejected, despite       the company's policy of giving such assignments to others.       She was told her only option was to take unpaid leave.          Why Congress Should Pass the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act         It is indisputable that Young was an important step forward       to combat pregnancy discrimination. Yet, too many pregnant       workers continue to face insurmountable obstacles in HR       offices, where employers misunderstand their obligations       under the PDA, and in courtrooms across the country, where       judges use Young to hinder access to needed accommodations.       Despite the clear mandates of the PDA, the current legal       landscape leaves exposed and unprotected those pregnant       workers who want to continue working while maintaining a       healthy pregnancy.        Similarly, many pregnant workers have not found protection       or recourse under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990       because absent complications, pregnancy is not considered a       disability that substantially limits a major life activity.       This legal reality means that many of the symptoms of a       normal pregnancy that can disrupt a worker's ability to do       her job--such as extreme fatigue, morning sickness, or       limitations on her mobility--are not entitled to       accommodation. Moreover, many pregnant workers seek       accommodation precisely because they wish to avoid the       conditions that might disable them or endanger their       pregnancy. Yet because the ADA is so expansive with respect       to other conditions that qualify as disabilities, the       population of non-pregnant workers entitled to reasonable       accommodation is exponentially larger than when the PDA was       enacted more than 40 years ago. Accordingly, without such       express entitlement to accommodation, pregnant workers face       an untenable ``least favored nation'' status in the       workplace.        The simple solution to this no-win situation is the       Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. This legislation, modeled       after the ADA and using a framework familiar to most       employers, takes a thoughtful and measured approach to       balancing the needs of working people and employers by       requiring businesses with fifteen or more employees to       provide workers with temporary, reasonable accommodation for       known limitations related to pregnancy, childbirth, or       related medical conditions if doing so would not place an       undue hardship on business. It also prohibits employers from       forcing a pregnant employee to take a leave of absence if a       reasonable accommodation can be provided; prevents employers       from denying job opportunities to an applicant or employee       because of the individual's need for a reasonable       accommodation; prevents an employer from forcing an applicant       or employee to accept a specific accommodation; and prohibits       retaliation against individuals who seek to use PWFA to       protect their rights.        At a time when women constitute nearly 60 percent of the       workforce and contribute significantly to their families'       economic well-being, passage of PWFA is a dire necessity.       When a pregnant worker is forced to quit, coerced into taking       unpaid leave, or fired because her employer refuses to       provide a temporary job modification, the economic impact can       be severe; if she is the sole or primary breadwinner for her       children, as nearly half of working women are, her entire       family will be without an income when they most need it. She       further may be denied unemployment benefits because she is       considered to have left her job voluntarily. She may have few       if any additional resources on which to rely. PWFA ensures       that women would not face such devastating consequences.       Instead, it treats pregnancy for what it is--a normal       condition of employment.        PWFA promotes women's health. Accommodations make a       difference in physically demanding jobs (requiring long       hours, standing, lifting heavy objects, etc.) where the risk       of preterm delivery and low birth weight are significant. The       failure to provide accommodations can be linked to       miscarriages and premature babies who suffer from a variety       of ailments. This bill would be an important contribution in       the fight to improve maternal health and mortality.        There is also a strong business case for PWFA. Providing       pregnant employees with reasonable accommodations increases       worker productivity, retention, and morale, and reduces       health care costs associated with pregnancy complications.       PWFA can also reduce litigation costs by providing greater       clarity regarding an employer's legal obligations to pregnant       workers. In fact, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce stated that       PWFA would establish ``clear guidelines and a balanced       process that works for employers and employees alike.''       Additionally, a group of leading private sector employers       expressed their support for PWFA and noted ``women's labor       force participation is critical to the strength of our       companies, the growth of our economy and the financial       security of most modern families.''        Finally, 30 states across the political and ideological       spectrum have recognized the benefits of providing reasonable       accommodations to pregnant workers. Congress should ensure       that all pregnant workers, not just some, have the       protections they need.        It is time for Congress to act and pass the Pregnant       Workers Fairness Act.            Sincerely,      Ronald Newman,        National Political Director.      Gillian Thomas,        Senior Staff Attorney.      Vania Leveille,        Senior Legislative Counsel.                                time  0930
