 Madam Speaker, last week, we were reminded once again of  the great sacrifice made by the men and women of law enforcement as  family, friends, and fellow officers gathered to pay their respects to  Deputy James Blair, who lost his life in the line of duty on Friday,  June 12 in Simpson County, Mississippi.   Deputy Blair was a husband, a father, a grandfather, and a great- grandfather, who devoted his life to his family, his community, and to  law enforcement. He was a generous man who was deeply loved and worked  to support his grandchildren following the passing of their mother.   Deputy Blair spent over 50 years of his life in service to his fellow  man through law enforcement. He will be deeply missed by our  Mississippi family, but his selfless spirit will live on through the  memory of his sacrifice and through those who had the privilege of  knowing him during his time on this Earth.   Please join me in a moment of silence in remembrance of Deputy James  Blair.                            ____________________
