 Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to speak to you today in  honor of our police force. What better time to honor the brave men and  women of law enforcement. They don't do it for the money. They do it  because of service.   What you are hearing from the other side is just not true. They are  the party of defunding the police. Their own Vice President put up bond  money for rioters. I can name you--and I am not going to name them by  name--you have got one, two, three--five sitting Congress people whose  statements are ``defunding police means defunding police,'' ``efforts  to defund the police department,'' ``no more police.'' They are the  party of defunding the police.   What better time to celebrate the fact that men and women are willing  to do this? They see things we don't see. They go places we don't go.  To have 135 officers shot in 2023 is unacceptable. Fifteen officers  have been killed by gunfire, and 43 officers were shot in ambush-style  attacks. The amount of officers shot in the line of duty is up 52  percent from this time in 2020.   Words are cheap, but it is what we as a party are doing to support  the police. The statistics are outrageous. I look forward to  considering legislation that supports our police officers and condemns  the leftists' efforts to dismantle local law enforcement agencies,  which they do.   To all those in law enforcement, Mr. Speaker, I thank them. For those  who are willing to go through good times and bad times to protect us, I  thank them. God bless every police officer in this country.
