 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of this  important, bipartisan bill to modernize the regulation of over-the- counter medicines.   An over-the-counter product is one that the Food and Drug  Administration has found to be safe and effective for direct consumer  use. To date, consumers have access to over 300,000 of these  nonprescription items. We are all familiar with these products, from  cough and cold medicines to antiperspirants, antacids, and sunscreens.  Our pharmacy aisles and medicine cabinets are filled with over-the- counter products that American consumers rely on each and every day.   These products do not need premarket approval but are required to be  consistent with monographs established by the Food and Drug  Administration. Making a simple change to existing monographs requires  a time-consuming and resource-intensive rulemaking process that can, in  fact, take years to effectuate even if the change is to enhance the  safety of a product. This creates undue delay in potential benefits  seen by consumers and is an inefficient use of public resources.                                time  1815    Fortunately, the Food and Drug Administration, patient and consumer  groups, and the regulated industry all agreed that reform is necessary  and have spent the past several years engaged in discussions about  modernization of the over-the-counter regulation. Congress worked with  these groups to turn these discussions into legislation that we are  considering this afternoon.   This bill would make the over-the-counter regulatory framework more  science based and responsive to public health concerns. It would  encourage the development of more innovative products and would provide  resources to the Food and Drug Administration to bolster the agency's  ability to review over-the-counter applications and regulate this  sector in a consistent manner.   Quite simply, it is a meaningful bill for each American.   I want to thank our Energy and Commerce Committee Members,  Representatives Latta from Ohio, Diana DeGette from Colorado, Brett  Guthrie from Kentucky, Debbie Dingell from Michigan, as well as Ranking  Member Green, my colleague from Texas, for their leadership in this  legislation.   I also want to recognize the hard work and the dedication of  committee staff on this legislation, particularly Warren Burke and  Michelle Vanek of the Office of Legislative Counsel; Danielle Steele,  with our majority staff; and Kim Trzeciak, with the committee's  Democratic staff. I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this  bill.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of this critical bill to  reauthorize the Animal Drug User Fee Act and the Animal Generic Drug  User Fee Act for an additional 5 years. Among other things, these user  fees provide critical resources to the Food and Drug Administration's  Center for Veterinary Medicine to ensure efficient and timely review of  animal drug applications, quality assurance measures for animal feed,  and surveillance of the safety and efficacy of animal drugs on the  market.   In addition to reauthorizing these user fee programs, this  legislation also includes new authority to facilitate greater  innovation in the animal drug space.   Mr. Speaker, these user fee programs must be reauthorized by  September 30 to avoid a major disruption of the operations of the  Center for Veterinary Medicine. The clock is ticking. The agency must  start sending pink slips to employees 60 calendar days before the end  of the fiscal year. That is the end of this month.   We are talking about real consequences for animal health and for the  American people. House passage of this bill today is an important step,  and I urge the Senate to do its work and promptly take up and pass this  bill so that President Trump can sign it into law. I thank the  gentleman for the recognition.
