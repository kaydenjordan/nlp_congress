 Mr. Speaker, I am deeply troubled by last week's  attack on our Capitol, and I pray for the families of Officer Sicknick  and Officer Liebengood.   As I have been saying all summer long, violence and rioting has no  place in America. The criminals responsible for last week's rioting  must be brought to justice. At a time when our Nation is still healing,  we must seek out issues to work on that unite us rather than issues  that further divide us.   I was greatly encouraged to see our country unite in condemnation of  last week's lawlessness and the rioting. I am further encouraged that,  despite my Democrat colleagues' claims to the contrary, President Trump  is committed to a peaceful and uninterrupted transfer of power.   But that is not good enough for my colleagues across the aisle. With  just 7 days left in President Trump's term, they are fast-tracking  impeachment proceedings, a move which will no doubt further divide an  already fractured Nation.    Even House Democrats' last impeachment effort, which was rushed  through in record time, at the very least, that had expert input,  depositions, hearings, and deliberation. This latest attempt at  impeachment ignores all precedent. It ignores all due process. It  cannot be voted on in the Senate before Joe Biden is sworn into office.   I am also very concerned by the charge against the President of  ``incitement of insurrection.'' At his rally, President Trump urged  attendees to ``peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.''  There was no mention of violence, let alone calls to action.   Look, I prosecuted terrorists in the Navy. I was a defense attorney  in the Navy JAG Corps. I was a district judge. Pull up the criminal  statute. Look at the criminal code. President Trump's  [[Page H159]]  words would not even meet the definition of incitement under criminal  statutes.   The measure before us today sets a dangerous precedent whereby  political parties can justify impeachment simply because they do not  agree with the President. I would, therefore, urge my colleagues across  the aisle to just take a step back, let cooler heads prevail, and  consider how the actions we are taking here today will alter the course  of history, will lower an already low bar of impeachment for all future  Presidencies.                                time  1015
