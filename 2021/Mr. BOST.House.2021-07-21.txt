 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of  Charles ``Chuck'' Poettker who passed away suddenly on Saturday.   I had the honor of calling Chuck a friend. And I know that he is  leaving a legacy that has impacted so many.   A U.S. Army veteran, Chuck served in the 101st Airborne Division  stationed at Camp Evans in South Vietnam. At just 20 years old, he and  his unit were given orders for a rescue mission in Laos. They were  tasked with rescuing two door gunners and recovering the bodies of a  downed helicopter pilot and co-pilot. Because of his heroic actions  during the mission and journey back to safety, Chuck was awarded the  U.S. Army Bronze Star.   A man of faith, Chuck prayed that if he made it out alive, he would  dedicate his life to building something of value for others. He did  just that.   He returned home and began a career as an apprentice carpenter,  taking night classes in construction management at what is now the  Southwestern Illinois College. He went on and founded Poettker  Construction, leading the company for 41 years. Today, the company  employs over 200 families across 26 States.   He was also committed to his community and giving back to the Metro  East area there in southern Illinois through numerous charities.   Madam Speaker, my prayers go out to Chuck's wife, Linda, and his  family and many friends during this difficult time.                   Supporting Apprenticeships for Veterans     Madam Speaker, I also rise today to talk about the fact  that when I ran Bost Trucking company for 10 years, many of our hardest  workers and most trusted employees shared something in common. They  were veterans.   The military teaches servicemembers invaluable skills, leadership,  teamwork, and dedication to compete and complete the missions that they  are assigned. But many veterans are facing challenges in finding work  after COVID-19 shutdowns. That is why I have introduced the Veterans'  Agricultural Apprenticeship Act.   This bipartisan bill will help connect out-of-work veterans with  farmers and ranchers who are in need of on-the-farm labor. It will help  farmers and ranchers expand their operations while also offering the  veterans new skills and career paths once they return home.   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Florida (Mr. Lawson) and our  bipartisan group of 15 additional cosponsors for supporting this  critically important bill. I hope that more of our colleagues will join  us in helping advance a win-win solution to an ever-growing problem.                            ____________________
