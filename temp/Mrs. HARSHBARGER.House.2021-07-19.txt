 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Hyde  amendment.   As a mother and grandmother of two precious grandsons, I am committed  to protecting the life of the unborn.   Since enacted, the Hyde amendment ban on taxpayer-funded abortions  has saved nearly 2\1/2\ million lives. We cannot understate the  importance of this amendment in saving these precious, innocent lives.   I have taken care of young women with infertility problems for over  30 years, and they would love to cradle a precious baby in their arms.  So many want to discard that precious child as just an unnecessary  interruption in their way of life.   This is why we need to enact H.R. 18, the No Taxpayer Funding for  Abortion Act, to ensure these pro-life protections remain in place.  [[Page H3660]]    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committees on Energy  and Commerce, Ways and Means, and the Judiciary be discharged from  further consideration of H.R. 18 and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.
