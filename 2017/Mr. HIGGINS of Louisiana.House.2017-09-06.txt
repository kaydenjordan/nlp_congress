 Mr. Speaker, due to a delayed flight I was  unable to return to D.C. in time for the first round of voting. Had I  been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 441 (H. Res.  502).  [[Page H6678]]        Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, today I missed rollcall vote No. 441 due to  family commitments. Had I been present, I would have voted ``aye'' to  provide necessary relief for victims of Hurricane Harvey.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  Representative Fitzpatrick's amendment, which would restore necessary  funds to the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector  General, to ensure that DHS is being run in the most accountable and  cost-efficient way possible.   I am in full support of the increases we have made to both Defense  and Homeland Security spending. However, it is imperative that the  programs administered by these agencies be operated in a transparent  manner that ensures the responsible expenditure of the people's  treasure.   In its most recent semiannual report, OIG reported that it recovered  $77.8 million from its audits and investigations and identified $32  million in questionable cost. OIG investigations during this time also  resulted in 86 arrests, 128 indictments, 55 convictions, and 19  personnel actions. This is a needed amendment, and I encourage my  colleagues to support it and vote ``yes.''
