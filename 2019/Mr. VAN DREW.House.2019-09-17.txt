 Madam Speaker, thank you for allowing me to honor a  remarkable young man of South Jersey.   Recently, Scout Sean Duffy of Egg Harbor Township in South Jersey  earned the outstanding honor of becoming an Eagle Scout. For his Eagle  Scout project, Sean decided to beautify the nature reserve in Egg  Harbor Township.   Sean led his fellow scouts in the construction of the gazebo and  oversaw the project from the very beginning to the very end. Because of  this exceptional young man, the community of Egg Harbor Township can  enjoy a new place of recreation and gathering at the nature reserve for  many years to come.   At times, we must all take initiative and assume a role of  leadership. We continue to be inspired by brave and passionate young  people like Sean Duffy who step forward and guide their peers in order  to better their own community. We are proud of him. He is a true  leader.   Congratulations, Sean. We wish you the best going forward and thank  you for your contribution to our community. South Jersey, New Jersey,  and the United States of America are proud of the work that you have  done.   Good luck.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.
