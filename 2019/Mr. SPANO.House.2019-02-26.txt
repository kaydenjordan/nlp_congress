 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor A.D. Shaw, founder and  pastor of Shekinah Glory Cathedral located in Plant City, Florida, and  who most gracefully offered this morning's opening prayer. He is also  my brother and my friend.   Pastor Shaw's dedication to family, friends, and community serves as  an example to many. His over 15 years of hard work in the ministry  without expecting anything in return embodies the definition of unity  and the best of the human spirit.   As I listened to his prayer, I thought of the many distinguished men  and women who have stood in this Chamber, at that podium, preaching the  importance of unity in our great Nation.   One such man was Abraham Lincoln, who said: ``A house divided against  itself cannot stand.''   In our fast-moving society, it is easy to focus on those things that  divide us over those things that bring us together. It is why, Mr.  Speaker, I stand here today calling for greater unity among all who  serve in this Chamber, among the American people and for the thousands  of communities across our great land.   Only together can we withstand adversity, not just as individuals,  but as a Nation. This does not mean that we will always agree. It does  mean we should seek unity in those disagreements.   We do not need to see eye to eye to walk hand in hand.   If, as a Nation, we seek to remain strong into the 21st century, we  must stand united through our differences.                            ____________________
