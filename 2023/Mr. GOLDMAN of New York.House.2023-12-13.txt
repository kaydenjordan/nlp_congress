 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in staunch  opposition to this resolution.   The Republicans have already spent 12 months on this exact  investigation. They have obtained more than 100,000 pages of documents  and dozens and dozens of hours of witness testimony, but there is  simply not a shred of evidence proving any wrongdoing by President  Biden related to his son or otherwise.   Whatever complaints that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  have about how the Department of Justice investigated a private  citizen, Hunter Biden, you should ask Donald Trump and Bill Barr, who  were in power at the time that this investigation was going on.   Since there is no evidence, now we are going to move the goalposts,  claiming an impeachment inquiry is necessary to gather more evidence,  but Chairman Comer himself said earlier this year that he had received  100 percent compliance from the administration, and they can only cite  two low-level career officials at the Department of Justice who have  not testified, even though their supervisors have.   Just this morning, Hunter Biden showed up to the Capitol ready to  provide evidence. The Republicans refused to take his testimony.   How can you sit there saying you need more evidence when you prevent  the central witness in the investigation from giving you evidence?   What are you afraid of?
