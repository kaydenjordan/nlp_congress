 DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, let me thank the  gentleman for yielding, and, of course, I come to join with all of  those who have extolled the virtues of this bill and urge its passage.  I also reflect on the fact that I grew up in the State of Arkansas.   My father, who was a tremendous historian, would often point to  places and show us sites in trees where lynchings were supposed to have  taken place. The fact that we are now saying that any lynching activity  should be a Federal crime is one that I concur with.   I want to thank the Reverend Jesse Jackson because that is really who  called me one day and said: You know, we need to do something about  this.   So I was pleased to interact with Congressman Rush and say: Let's do  something about this.   I want to thank Congressman Rush for taking the leadership on this  bill. I want to thank the Judiciary Committee for passing it.
