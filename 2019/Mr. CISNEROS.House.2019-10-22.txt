 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize 39th  Congressional District resident Megan Loh and her passion to ensure  more young women and girls are represented and encouraged to  participate in the field of science, technology, engineering, arts, and  mathematics.   Megan, an avid Girl Scout and Troy High School student from  Fullerton, formed her own nonprofit GEARup4Youth to encourage girls  interested in STEAM and STEM career paths.   GEARup4Youth has already benefitted more than 9,500 girls to date.   Megan also initiated the first girls-only robotics class at a local  Boys & Girls Clubs of America. And she partnered with over 200  organizations to host presentations, family STEM events, and expos  about her technology curriculum.   Megan even authored her own book, ``Easy STEM Activities You Can Do  At Home'' in order to broaden more young girls' interests in STEAM.   For all her amazing and passionate work on behalf of young girls,  Megan was named one of the 2019 National Gold Award Girl Scouts. In  Megan's own words, we must continue to show young girls that they do  belong in tech fields that aren't simply open to them, but need them.  And as an education advocate, I couldn't agree more.   I ask my colleagues to join me in offering my sincerest  congratulations to Megan and thank her for all her work on behalf of  young women like herself.                            ____________________
