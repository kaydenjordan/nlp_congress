 Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my friend  and colleague  [[Page H7660]]  Trent Franks for his hard work on this important issue. I rise today in  support of the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.   Children are gifts from God--before and after they are born. They are  tiny humans with endless potential and complete innocence.   This bill would stop the practice of ending these precious lives  after 20 weeks of pregnancy, except in cases of rape or incest or  necessity to save the mother's life.   Similar laws have been passed in about 16 states, and this Chamber  passed similar legislation in 2015. The United States is 1 of only 7  countries that does not ban abortions of these 20-week-year-old unborn  babies.   Science indicates that, at about this age, these children have the  physical structures needed to feel pain.   We do not want anyone to have an unwanted pregnancy, but we want  mothers to know that abortion is not their only option. And we want  these children protected from pain and harm.   Mr. Speaker, it is time to protect our Nation's most innocent from  inhumane suffering and premature death.                            ____________________
