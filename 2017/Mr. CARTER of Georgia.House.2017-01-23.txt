 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Mr. Wiley  Anderson Wasden, Jr., from Savannah, Georgia, who passed away on  January 18, 2017, just a few days shy of his 80th birthday.   Born in Millen, Georgia, to his parents, Wiley Senior and Katherine,  Mr. Wasden moved to Savannah after graduating from high school in 1953.  He then began studies at the University of Georgia, where he joined the  Phi Delta Theta Fraternity and ignited his interest in government.  Throughout his life, Mr. Wasden continued this interest in government  and used it to make the State of Georgia a better place to live,  eventually serving as chairman of the Georgia State Republican Party  and as a Georgia State senator. Outside of government, Mr. Wasden  worked hard for his community. He was a well-respected local Realtor in  Savannah while he also served as chairman of the board for Savannah  Country Day School.   I am proud today to recognize Mr. Wasden's outstanding life and the  positive impact he made on the State of Georgia. He will certainly be  missed.                            ____________________
