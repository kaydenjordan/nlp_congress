 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Austin  Meyer.   Austin moved to Reno, Nevada, to study transportation technology at  Truckee Meadows Community College. He had a passion for cars and  sports. He loved to watch basketball, especially the Boston Celtics.   Austin was excited to watch his favorite band perform at the Route 91  festival on October 1 in Las Vegas. Austin went to the festival with  his fiancee, Dana Getreu, to celebrate his birthday and their  anniversary.   Austin dreamed of opening up his own auto repair shop after  graduation and was excited to get married to Dana and start a family.  He always had a smile on his face and made people laugh.   Austin's friends and family remember him for being ambitious, smart,  and hardworking.   I would like to extend my condolences to Austin Meyer's family and  friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada,  and the whole country grieve with you.                            ____________________
