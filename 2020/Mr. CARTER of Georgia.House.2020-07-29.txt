 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember and  honor my friend, Andy Eugene Quinney, of Georgia's First Congressional  District who passed away at the age of 64.   Mr. Quinney was born in Savannah, Georgia, and graduated from Robert  W. Groves High School.   Andy was a dedicated insurance agent, serving Chatham County and the  Lowcountry of South Carolina for over 4 decades, most recently working  with Jimmy Swain of James M. Swain & Associates.   Andy took his leadership skills to new heights when he was the mayor  of Garden City, Georgia, from 2002 to 2009.   One of his goals as mayor was to ``put the garden back in Garden  City,'' and that he did. He was blessed with a green thumb and could  bring any plant or city back to life.   Garden City thrived thanks to his devout leadership and commitment to  improving the lives of its citizens. Andy was pivotal in making it the  success it is today.   Andy was a pillar for the Masonic Lodge through his service as  Worshipful Master and was one of the founders of the Band of Brothers.   Andy loved music, reading, and gardening, and he used all those gifts  he was given for God's glory.   Everyone who encountered him would be met with an infectious smile,  and it was evident that the joy of the Lord was his strength.   My thoughts and prayers will continue to be with my brother in  Christ's friends and family during this most difficult time.                            ____________________
