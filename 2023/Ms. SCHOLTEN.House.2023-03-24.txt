 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a west  Michigan leader, advocate, former colleague, and friend. Taken from us  too soon, she will go down in history as a trailblazing young woman.   Eva Alvarez was the daughter of migrant farmworkers, one of seven  children who worked her way through college and her master's degree.  She was the Public Policy Coordinator for the Michigan Immigrant Rights  Center.   I had the joy of working with Eva to help support hardworking migrant  farmworkers throughout Michigan, and together we partnered to shine a  light on injustice, uplift those often pushed aside in society, and  make our community a little more just, fair, and humane.   In addition to her work on policy, she co-founded Empowering Latina  Leaders and Advocates for Success, ELLAS, the first professional  network in Southwest Michigan for Latina women. In all she did, Eva was  bringing others up around her. She often reminded us ``we did not get  here alone, help pave the way for others.''   With a smile that could light up a room, an infectious laugh, and a  quick-witted sense of humor, Eva pressed on through difficult work. She  carried a vision of communities and systems that treat every individual  with dignity and respect, regardless of who they were, where they came  from, their skin color, or the language that they spoke.    Every day, she worked to bring Michigan a little bit closer to that  vision, practicing welcome everywhere she went. Her work will leave a  legacy of justice and compassion; her friendship memories of joy and  light. I continue my work to make west Michigan a better place because  of her.                            ____________________
