 Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, here we go again. Obviously, we took a 5- hour break, but now we are back to not making priorities.   The bottom line is, now we are up to $27 million out of this basket  of money that the Secretary has to manage a Department that is actually  increasing in size and increasing in complexity.   This is a very worthy cause, and there is no question in anyone's  mind, I hope, that colon cancer screening, for instance, is essential.  Every American who falls within the guidelines should be encouraged to  undergo the screening, but we have to set priorities.   If we are going to increase further the funding into that program-- because as we heard from the subcommittee chair, we have already  increased the funding--if we are going to increase it further, we have  to look somewhere to decrease funding. That is not a magical pot of  money that is endless. Literally, it is true that, sooner or later, the  Secretary is going to have to take out loans to pay salaries in his  Department because we will have drained the entire amount.   Again, since the last vote series, which we had 1 a.m. eastern time-- it is now 9:20 eastern time--since then, we have drained that fund by  $27 million. A lot of it transferred for good projects, but that is not  the way we should be doing business here.   When families in my district have a priority, they set a new  priority. They say this family needs this a lot right now. They look  into their budget and ask what they are not going to spend on. That is  what we ought to be doing.   If this is so essential, Madam Chair, I would suggest some other  program, not a magical pot of money that some people believe has no  bottom.   Again, the Secretary has to run an increasingly complex Department.  The bottom line is that we have now drained, if all the amendments pass  [[Page H4634]]  that we have discussed since 1 a.m., $27 million out of the fund. This  is not the way we ought to do business.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, we are showing the American people right now  that we live in fantasy land.   The bottom line is, the amendment that I and many of my colleagues  voted for last night merely restores this bill to the current state of  law. It makes it comply with the Budget Control Act. I didn't vote for  the Budget Control Act, but it is the law of the land.   We can pretend it is not. That is the difference between us and the  people in my district. They don't have Monopoly money to play with.  They can't pretend that the law isn't the law. They can't pretend that  they can invent money in their families. They have to follow the laws.  They have to follow their budgets. But I guess that is just not true.   This is why Congress has a 9 percent approval rating. The people  watching us today, the millions of people watching us--there are maybe  several hundred thousand watching us today--are watching promises being  made that can't be kept, promises being made that take money out of not  this generation but the next generation and the generation following.   Again, this is a worthy cause. But the bottom line is, last year,  when the majority was in the minority, every single member in the  Appropriations Committee voted against funding this program when it  left the committee, every single majority member when they were in the  minority.   I get how this game is being played. I get it. We have to restore  fiscal discipline, the same fiscal discipline every family in our  districts has. If you set a priority and you decide this is necessary  to spend on, you find something that is not necessary to spend on.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, parliamentary inquiry.    Is any time remaining on the other side because the  gentlewoman moved to reserve her time?    Madam Chair, I am a physician. I have taken care of  people for 35 years. I am not sure I should be lectured, Madam Chair,  on the proper way to take care of people in this country with regard to  their health.   I understand the attraction of maybe bringing a tax bill into this. I  am not sure why the proponents can't leave this as a discussion of  funding health.   The bottom line is, this is an important subject, no question about  it.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, what is disingenuous is trying to make an  argument that somehow this bill falls within current statute.   The Budget Control Act is the controlling statutory authority, and  this bill is 14 percent above the Budget Control Act.   Now, most people might think a move to restore the congressional  action to lawfulness is actually a good thing. In fact, maybe Americans  watching who have to live by a budget in their households actually  wonder why we can't do it here. They look at a trillion-dollar deficit  and they say: Wait a minute. I can't do that in my household. Why does  Congress do it to the country?   The gentlewoman from Connecticut, the gentleman from New York, they  share something in common with Maryland: We are where Lyme disease is  endemic. No question about it, it is a problem.   My problem is not with CDC dealing with Lyme disease. With this  amendment, we are now up to $28 million taken from the same source.  This pretend bottomless fund that all we have to do is we can draw all  we need out of this fund is not the way budgeting works. It is not the  way budgeting works in any family. It is not the way budgeting should  work here on Capitol Hill.   And, again, I remind my colleagues, people look at how Congress  operates in wonder--not awe, wonder. They figure: Why can't Congress  run the country like I have to run my household?   It is because we don't choose priorities here. We say this is  important, and it is, but we fail to do what all the families in  America do when they decide something is more important. They choose  something that is less important and forgo spending money on that.   So that is the deficit in this amendment. This amendment is a worthy  cause. Lyme disease is a terrible disease, as the gentleman from New  York knows. We are not even sure how to diagnose it. Chronic Lyme  disease is an enigma to scientists and to medicine. It should be a  priority. But coupled with that priority is finding something else that  is of lower priority and deciding not to spend as much there and to  spend more here.   So that is why, reluctantly, I urge the body, if they pass the other  amendments that we have chosen--that is, considered since 1 a.m., the  last time we met--this would make $28 million out of that mythical  bottomless fund that all these good ideas are funded from.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chairwoman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chairwoman, the Trump administration followed the  [[Page H4637]]  law. I know that for Congress here, we don't really like to follow the  law. We think we make it for everybody else, and we don't have to  follow it. In fact, the bill we are discussing today doesn't follow the  Budget Control Act. It pretends that the law doesn't exist.   Now, the Trump administration did the appropriate thing and said: You  know what? The law does exist. The reason why we get into trouble, and  why America looks at what Congress does, the profligate spending that  we have, the trillion-dollar deficits, and the $22 trillion debt is  because in some cases like this, we just don't follow the law. The  President says: No, we should return to the law.   If the Congress thinks we ought to spend more, then pass a bill that  changes the Budget Control Act. But, Madam Chairwoman, I would suggest  that if the President had not followed the law, the complaint would be:  The President is not following the law. You are damned if you do. You  are damned if you don't.   The President follows the Budget Control Act, submits a budget  consistent with that, and then gets blamed by the majority for  following the law, not playing make-believe budgets.   Madam Chairwoman, our families can't do make-believe budgets. They  have a certain amount of money and they have to stay within that  budget. But I guess we are Congress. We are different. We can make  believe.   This is why we have a 9 percent approval rating, because Americans  look at what we do here in Congress and say: This isn't the real world.   This education is important. There is no question about it, but we  have to place priorities. I reluctantly oppose the amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chairwoman, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining?    Madam Chairwoman, I won't take 3 minutes. We obviously  have a lot of work to do this morning and did a lot of work last night.   Part of the American Dream--and my parents as well came to this  country--and it is amazing that the children of immigrants can sit on  this floor, but they came to this country because there is a rule of  law in this country.   The law right now says, under the Budget Control Act, that we should  be spending much less than this bill suggests overall. The Trump  administration proposed spending within the law. Now, that law is not a  Trump administration law. That law was actually signed by the last  President with the majority controlling the Senate. It was a bipartisan  agreement, the Budget Control Act.   But again, we pretend that it just doesn't exist. This is part of the  problem. Americans look at us and say: Wait a minute. You expect us to  live by the law? In fact, you insist that we live by the law, and now  talk about imagination, this is really imaginary because we are  presenting a proposal here today that spends tens and tens of billions  of dollars more than the law says we are authorized to spend. That is  astounding.   No wonder we have a 9 percent approval rating. I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, let's get a handle on exactly what this  amendment does. This amendment says that we are going to take one of  the most controversial areas of research--controversial regarding the  ethics of the research--and we are going to say the Federal Government  can't determine whether it is ethical.   Madam Chair, we have a construct for this. This construct was  developed by Mr. Waxman two decades ago in a piece of statute signed by  President Clinton that said that when you submit research for funding  to the HHS Department, and it is a topic around which there are ethical  questions--and there are ethical questions--that the Secretary can  choose to seat a panel, not a sham panel, but a panel that consists of  attorneys, ethicists, practicing physicians, theologians, and  scientists with substantial accomplishments in biomedical and  behavioral research.   That doesn't sound too sham to me. It is a panel that is going to  review it because, Madam Chair, without that, the only review this gets  with regard to, for instance, an institutional review board is at the  institution that stands to gain the funding when the project is funded.  It is because of that conflict of interest that the Congress  thoughtfully said, in statute, that we ought to have a mechanism to  consider the ethics.   Madam Chair, we are going to hear about all kinds of things done with  fetal tissue. Yes, they were done decades and decades ago. Those  vaccines were done on cell lines that have been around for a long time.   Can there be some research that might benefit from fetal tissue?  Sure, there can be. But we should always make the determination of  whether it is ethical.   How can we stand in good conscience and say that we are going to  take, on the basis of ethics, one of the most controversial areas of  research and wall it off and say that the Federal Government can't  consider ethics? Oh, my gosh, that is a step way too far.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Parliamentary inquiry.    Madam Chair, are comments supposed to be addressed to the  Chair?    Madam Chair, may I inquire as to how much time remains.    Madam Chair, before I came to Congress, I was a medical  scientist. I actually held NIH grants. So, Madam Chair, I find it a  little unusual that someone would criticize my opinion on medical  science and dismiss it. But we live in a strange world. That is why the  American people look at Congress and wonder what is going on.   The fact of the matter is that it is not a Trump administration  policy that issues where ethics are involved should go to a committee  convened to consider that.   Madam Chair, I have had things go before IRBs, institutional review  boards, at institutions. It is a good first step, and the peer-review  process at NIH is probably a good second step. But for some issues like  fetal tissue research, where we saw fetal tissue marketed--brains, $800  plus tax--we think it is not at all unreasonable that the Federal  Government, before spending a dime of taxpayer money--because,  remember, the President's policy does nothing about funding it. It just  says taxpayer dollars shouldn't be used unless we have considered the  ethics.   My gosh, there is nothing wrong with that. The fact of the matter is  that Americans don't want their tax dollars spent on things that are  unethical, and this is the way that we can determine whether it is  ethical.   Again, this has not been set up by the Trump administration. This is  Mr. Waxman, who will never be confused with a Republican, and signed by  President Clinton.   I will remind the gentleman that this issue has been discussed in  committee for a few years. The committee has come down on both sides of  it because this is a controversial issue, and controversial issues are  best left to the experts just like this ethics committee statute  states.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, even though I don't oppose the amendment, I  rise in opposition.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for  this. This is a real problem that we have. As a physician, I will tell  you, we haven't gotten this right yet.   Again, I am an anesthesiologist, and I have been taking care of  patients for 30 years, three decades. What we still find is that we  have people who prescribe narcotics and opioids.   We know, by the way, Madam Chair, that if someone is given a 10-day  supply of opioids for an outpatient operation, there is a 10 percent  chance that they will be addicted 1 year afterward.   Yesterday, my son had an outpatient operation, and he got a  prescription for 50 opioid pills. I am sitting there thinking, oh my  God, is there an alternative?   We were taught for years that if you go to the emergency room and you  have a broken bone, you are going to get sent out with a narcotic  prescription. Then they did a study that shows that alternating Tylenol  with ibuprofen, acetaminophen with ibuprofen, is just as good as the  narcotic.                                time  1015    My God, for decades, we have been giving people narcotics, unaware  that we were committing a certain number of them to a terrible life.   And I appreciate the gentleman's passion about it, because we had  good news in Maryland yesterday, for the first time, the number of  deaths from overdoses went down. But the number of overdoses continues  to increase.   We got better at preventing the deaths. Now we have to get better at  preventing the addiction and treating the addiction.   Madam Chair, this amendment goes a long way toward that.   I reserve the balance of my time    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
