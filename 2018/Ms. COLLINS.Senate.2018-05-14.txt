 Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Dr. Susan J.  Hunter, president of the University of Maine, on her retirement after  27 years of outstanding service in higher education. Dr. Hunter joined  the faculty of the University of Maine at Orono in 1991 as a researcher  in cell biology. In 2014, she was named the university's 20th  president, the first woman to hold that position.   It is a pleasure to join the people of Maine in expressing gratitude  for Dr. Hunter's commitment to higher education. In her many roles  during a truly distinguished career--from researcher, to professor,  provost, and president--she has been an inspiring leader.   Even if Dr. Hunter had remained solely in the research field, her  contributions would be worthy of accolades. In addition to invaluable  work in bone cell biology, she served as coprincipal investigator of an  award-winning National Science Foundation grant that placed graduate  teaching fellows in primary and secondary schools as science  demonstrators. She also led the establishment of UMaine's Rising Tide  Center, an important initiative to enhance opportunities for women  faculty members in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and  social-behavioral sciences.   Dr. Hunter's service as an administrator includes chair of the  department of biological sciences, associate provost and dean for  undergraduate education, executive vice president for academic affairs  and provost, and vice chancellor for academic affairs for the entire  University of Maine System. Last year, while serving as president of  UMaine's flagship campus at Orono, she also became president of the  university's regional campus at Machias.   Dr. Hunter's leadership at UMaine played a key role in bringing about  advancements in enrollment, fundraising, and advocacy and partnerships.  During her presidency, UMaine has recruited its largest incoming  classes and the largest number of out-of-state students in the  university's 153-year history, and the university has seen a 22-percent  increase in private giving to its annual fund. Students and supporters  have expressed their confidence in Dr. Hunter's leadership in the most  meaningful ways.  [[Page S2641]]    Dr. Hunter's contributions reach far beyond the campus. In the  community, she has served on the boards of directors of the Maine  School of Science and Mathematics, the Bangor Symphony Orchestra, and  the Maine Mathematics and Science Alliance, and she worked with the  Maine Arts Commission to develop a cultural strategic plan for the  State of Maine. Currently, she serves on the boards of Maine & Company  and the Maine Development Foundation to foster economic growth and job  creation and on the advisory network for the Olympia Snowe Women's  Leadership Institute.   Her achievements have been widely recognized. In 2016, Dr. Hunter was  inducted into the Deborah Morton Society at the University of New  England in honor of her work to advance women in scientific fields.  Last year, she received the Wilma Award from the Collins Center for the  Arts at the University of Maine for her promotion and enhancement of  cultural activities and the Kenneth M. Curtis Leadership Award from the  Maine Development Foundation for her commitment to economic  opportunity.   In a recent interview, Dr. Hunter said that her leadership decisions  have always been guided by the best interests of students and the  people of Maine. Her decades of distinguished service and reverence for  education have created a legacy that demonstrates how faithfully she  has followed that guidance, and that will benefit our great State for  many decades to come.                            ____________________     Mr, President, I rise today to introduce the Protecting  Rational Incentives in Newsprint Trade Act of 2018, also known as the  PRINT Act, which seeks to address an urgent crisis facing printers and  publishers in the United States. I am very pleased to be joined by  Senator King and a bipartisan and distinguished group of cosponsors,  including Senators Blunt, Jones, Fischer, McCaskill, Moran, Wicker,  Isakson, and Capito, to advance this legislation, which is endorsed by  publishers representing more than 600,000 American jobs.   Earlier this year, the Department of Commerce instituted import taxes  on certain types of paper imported by the U.S. printing and publishing  industry from Canada. The paper--technically known as uncoated  groundwood paper, but better known as newsprint--is used by newspapers,  book publishers, and numerous other commercial printers in the United  States. These import taxes are being advanced under the principle of  trade enforcement to protect the domestic paper industry. It is  telling, however, that nearly all of the U.S. paper industry opposes  these import taxes, including the large trade association representing  the entire industry, the American Forest and Paper Association. The  paper industry opposes the import taxes because they threaten to  decimate the paper industry's customers and drive printers and  publishers out of business forever.   The import taxes are as high as 32 percent on some products. The  printing and publishing industry is already facing a severe economic  threat from the overall trends in the publishing market, including the  shift to digital consumption of news. The printing and publishing  industry simply cannot absorb the increased costs of paper caused by  the tariffs. The Tampa Bay  [[Page S2645]]  Times, for example, has announced that the tariffs are increasing the  newspaper's operating costs by $3 million annually and, as a result, it  must lay off around 50 employees. Other newspapers across the Nation  face the threat of layoffs and closures, particularly smaller  publications and businesses serving local communities. The Swift County  Monitor News in Benson, Minnesota, reported a 43 percent net increase  in its newsprint costs from the duties. But let's not forget the impact  of these tariffs on such an important profession in our society. The  Executive Editor of the Lewiston Sun-Journal and seven Western Maine  weekly newspapers put it this way: ``While tariffs are going to cost  the newspapers in real dollars, the real cost will be to the mission of  journalists and the ability of newspapers--of all sizes--to carry on  critical work in the public interest.''   Mr. President, I strongly support the robust enforcement of our trade  laws to protect U.S. interests, but these new import taxes are having  the opposite effect. The import tariffs are dramatically increasing  costs for publishers, accelerating the decline of local and regional  papers across the Nation, and undermining the United States paper  industry's customer base without any chance of recovery.   I trust that the Department of Commerce has accurately applied the  trade enforcement remedies in this case, but that is exactly the  problem. The antidumping and countervailing duty trade remedies are not  equipped to address a situation like this where the import duties will  actually harm the industry they were intended to protect.   That is the reason that we are introducing the PRINT Act. Our bill  would suspend the import taxes on this paper while the Department of  Commerce examines the health of--and effects on--the printing and  publishing industry. It is important to note that the legislation does  not propose that Congress step in and substitute its judgment. The  President would retain full authority to implement the duties after the  Commerce Department completes its study.   Moreover, the legislation is only a pause. It is designed to ensure  that the government makes decisions about these import tariffs with an  understanding of all the anticipated and potential collateral effects  on the U.S. industry and jobs.   Mr. President, this bill is both sensible and urgently needed.  Printers and publishers throughout the country have indicated that the  import taxes are threatening irreparable harm to their businesses.  Adoption of the PRINT Act would ensure that we evaluate fully the  impact of these tariffs before the duties kill American jobs for good.  I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this important  legislation.                            ____________________     Mr, President, I rise today to introduce the Protecting  Rational Incentives in Newsprint Trade Act of 2018, also known as the  PRINT Act, which seeks to address an urgent crisis facing printers and  publishers in the United States.
