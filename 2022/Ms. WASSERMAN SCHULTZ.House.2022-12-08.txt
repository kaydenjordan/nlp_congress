 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the  Respect for Marriage Act because every American deserves to have their  union recognized and respected in law.   Since the Obergefell and Loving decisions, millions of families rely  on the constitutional guarantee that marriage equality affords. Yet, we  just saw what happens when half our population relies on this High  Court to protect our sacred rights.   Recent far-right Court nominees broke their pledges to respect the  precedent of Roe, and look at the legal chaos, unequal treatment, and  financial and physical ruin they have unleashed.   We can no more rely on their word than we can their apologists who  say these legal extremists will uphold marriage equality.   This bill ensures that by guaranteeing that same-sex and interracial  couples have a legal right to build a life with someone who shares  their love.   I am honored to stand with the LGBTQ+ community to make this a more  just, equal, and perfect union. Without these rights and this  legislation, America can never truly aspire to that.   Madam Speaker, I remind all of my colleagues that history is  watching, and I urge them to vote ``yea'' on the Senate amendment.
