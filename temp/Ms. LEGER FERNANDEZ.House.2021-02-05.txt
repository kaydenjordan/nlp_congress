 Mr. Speaker, my district is home to breathtaking  mountains, incredible diversity, and rich history. To understand my  district, you must know not only its beauty but also its poverty and  promise.   We must create opportunities in places like my district with  tremendous challenges but also endless potential: create opportunities  for countless New Mexicans who lost their jobs, create opportunities  for essential workers who risk their lives to keep our country running,  and recognize that education is the key to realize the promise of our  communities.   That is why the first bill I co-led, the Learning Recovery Act, will  create opportunities for the most educationally disadvantaged students,  who are falling further behind because of the pandemic. This bill will  address the disparities we know too well in New Mexico.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to ask us to always work to empower our  communities; protect my State's beauty, diversity, and people; and  unleash the potential we know we have.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for  the budget rule and resolution because Americans cannot wait any longer  for us to rescue our economy and our health.   We are the Congress of the United States. Our job is to solve  problems. We can't neglect our duty. This pandemic has devastated  everything we love--everything each of us loves. If we don't do this,  millions of Americans--especially people of color, in my State, Tribal  communities, the Navajo, the Pueblos, the Apaches, and women--will  continue to suffer and die.   New Mexicans are waiting for our help so they can afford to put food  on the table and keep a roof over their heads, so they can go to eat at  the restaurants, and have their kids in school where they feel safe.  They are waiting for more COVID vaccines.   New Mexico is one of the best States in getting the vaccine out, but  we don't have enough, and this will help us get enough vaccines. They  are waiting for certainty that this year will be better than the last.  Lives are on the line and all Americans' voices are loud and clear.  They need us to act and to act boldly.   I am listening to American voices from the rural areas, from suburban  areas, from conservative areas. I represent an incredibly diverse  district, and they are all asking us to act. So let's listen. Whether  you are a Democrat or Republican, let's listen to their voices, to  their pleas. Let's take action. Let's stop the pain.
