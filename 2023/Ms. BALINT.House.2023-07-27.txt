 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the public  schools. I am a parent. I am a former middle school teacher. I am also  the child of a working-class mom and an immigrant dad. I understand so  deeply that education is the bedrock of this great democracy.   Nevertheless, Mr. Speaker, I am worried about our public schools. I  am worried about the news stories about banning books and erasing Black  curriculum from schools. These Republican actions are not supportive of  our public schools or teachers or parents or our students. This assault  on public education does not make us a stronger nation, a kinder  nation, or a more thoughtful one.   We don't have any fear about facing the complexity of our Nation's  history. Our democracy is stronger than that. It can withstand the ugly  details, the inconvenient truths, and the uncomfortable nuance. We have  a robust democracy, and we have a republic that can face tough  questions about its history.   We need not be afraid of this. Age-appropriate curriculum about our  Nation's history must include the hard parts. Our students, our  parents, and our teachers can handle it. Let's trust them.   It is concerning to me that in some districts we have movements to  prevent students from learning about slavery or the Trail of Tears or  Martin Luther King, Jr., or Rosa Parks or Anne Frank.   As the grandchild of an immigrant, a man who was killed in the  Holocaust--a grandchild of someone killed in the Holocaust, I know the  importance of knowing history. I know the importance of speaking  frankly and clearly about what happens when we don't know the details  and when we simply demonize a group or dehumanize a group of people.   What we need to do is shine the light of day on complex history. When  we use our time here in Congress to fan the flames of culture wars  instead of investing in our schools, then we are not doing the job that  we were sent here to do and that parents want us to do.   It doesn't matter what your political stripe is, Mr. Speaker, or  whether you are not involved in politics at all. Mr. Speaker, what you  want for your children and grandchildren is essentially the same. You  want a strong education for your kids and grandkids. You want schools  where all students feel safe and supported and can be the very best  selves.   We know that kids suffer when they don't have the resources that they  [[Page H4062]]  need. We should be investing our time and energy into making sure all  of our schools regardless of ZIP Code have the resources they need for  every single American kid to be successful. That is our job.                                time  1600    Balance is at the core of who we are as Americans. It is not banning  Judy Blume or trying to pretend that racism wasn't part of our past  and, indeed, in many instances, isn't still a part of our present. We  should not be afraid of these details.   To ensure that the next generation of Americans is equipped for  adulthood, we have to support well-rounded, holistic education that  sets up our children for success.   I have a 13-year-old--almost 13; she will be 13 in a couple of  weeks--and a 15-year-old. I will tell you that every time we sit down  to dinner at my house, we have robust conversations about the news.   In fact, when I first started in Congress, I used to walk through the  door on Friday afternoons and my son would say, ``Mom, let's talk about  your votes.''   We have complex conversations about geopolitics. I don't shy away  from talking about the hard stuff with my son or my daughter. I trust  them to ask questions of me that are age-appropriate.   I wish that we would trust our families across this country to be  able to have rich and complex conversations with their students about  curriculum that is often complicated.   That is the human experience. That is the American experience. It is  not tidy, nor would we want it so. We are a nation of ideas. We wrestle  with concepts. This is who we are at our best. We should not be afraid  of this happening in our public schools.   I know the impact that quality education can have on our young people  and the danger that lies ahead if we use our positions as elected  officials to be proscriptive about what should be discussed in our  public schools.   The continued attack on our public education, which is often fueled  by divisive rhetoric and often, unfortunately, manufactured  controversies, is an affront to parents and students everywhere. As I  said, they know how to navigate complex issues. Why are we so afraid of  this?   Our continued dependency within this building on creating groups of  people to demonize and dehumanize for political ends then,  unfortunately, gets played out in public schools across this country.  How is this possibly helping our democracy?   I want students who ask hard questions. When I was a teacher, I  welcomed them. I welcomed people from across the political spectrum and  their parents to be able to come into my classroom and have deep  conversations about difference.   It is not about indoctrinating people. It is about having a place  where we are not afraid to talk about hard things. Isn't that what we  want for our schools and for our communities?   I fear that we are so afraid of having hard conversations that we  have stopped talking at all. Better to shut down any conversation about  something that somebody perceives as controversial than to try to come  together with differing opinions, wrestle with ideas, wrestle with  complexities.   This is who we are at our best. This is actually what this body was  supposed to be and what our public schools can be at their best: a  microcosm of the democracy.   As a public schoolteacher, I taught middle school. People often say  middle school is great preparation for being in Congress for a whole  lot of reasons, that public schoolteachers and the parents that support  those teachers and those students are some of the most committed,  compassionate members of our communities.   They are invested in their students. They are committed to their  communities. Unfortunately, they have become targets of baseless  attacks that have come from divisive politics.   I have to say, the attack on public schools, the attack on teachers,  is not serving us as a nation. It is not, as I said, making us  stronger. It is not making us more thoughtful. It is not making us more  equipped to deal with the complicated world of geopolitics that we must  confront.   I welcome hard conversations, and I always have in my classroom. This  is what teachers across this country are trying to do, to hold space  for hard conversations. Why are we so afraid of that?   I also have to say, as a woman who has two kids, and my spouse is  another woman, I want my kids to be able to go to a school where their  teacher is not going to be reprimanded for acknowledging that my kids  have a particular kind of family. I want my kids to feel like they have  as much of a right to be in a classroom to get an education as anyone  else. Why are we so afraid of difference?   For many years in this country, difference, diversity of experience,  diversity of background--we talked about our Nation as a great melting  pot.   Sometimes it was called a fruit salad. Sometimes it was called a  potpourri of experiences. It used to be that we celebrated that, that  we did not see that as a danger to our very democracy.   We are in what I feel like is not just uncharted territory. It is  dangerous territory for the Republic.   I know from representing Vermont, which is a rural State with  hundreds of communities dotted across our wooded landscape, that the  public schools are the heart and soul of our communities. They are  where young minds are nurtured, where curiosity is fueled, where  community itself is fostered.   Our teachers, in conjunction with the parents in those communities,  play an invaluable role in shaping our children's futures. They deserve  to be acknowledged for the work that they do, not vilified.   One of the things that I heard as I was campaigning across Vermont to  represent my State in Congress--didn't matter what community I was in-- people would come up to me at the end of events and say: I don't want  to hate my neighbors. I don't want to feel like the only way forward is  to be fearful of other Americans, people within my own community.   I try to live my life here in Congress and as a former teacher as  someone who is always thinking about how we bring the community of man  back together. How do we move away from a meanness of spirit that is  not just corroding our work here but is actually corroding our Nation?    Schools are an important part of people being able to come together  and speak honestly about their experiences and histories. It is a way  forward for us as a nation. Why are we so afraid of having difficult  conversations?   Now, I never imagined that, as the child of an immigrant and a  working-class mom, I would be standing here before you. As a gay woman,  I never thought that I would be walking in these Halls, but I am here.  I have a place here, and I am going to use my voice to continue to ask  questions.   What happened to our ability to have tough conversations without  demonizing each other, without dehumanizing each other?   We know what happens when norms are upended, when rights are  attacked. We have seen this across the globe. We have seen it here in  our own country.   Public schools are an important part of building back the strength  and vibrancy of our democracy.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague from Michigan (Ms. Tlaib).    Mr. Speaker, parents and voters across this country  understand the biggest challenges facing America's students in our  public schools, and it is not about curriculum that includes details  about slavery or the Trail of Tears or Anne Frank. That is not what  most voters and parents care about.   What do they care about?   Number one, they care about getting students the support they need,  and in some instances, that is one-on-one support to meet the needs of  their students.   They care deeply about addressing the educator shortages that we see  across the country.   They care deeply about ensuring that their students have the mental  health services that they need.   They care deeply about the dangers of gun violence in their schools.   They want candidates to address these issues. They want leaders who  will address these issues.   I will say the needs of parents are really not that different from  the needs and desires of students. I have spent quite a bit of time  traveling across Vermont, speaking to predominantly middle school and  high school students about what it is that they are concerned about.  They talk about the same kinds of things.   They talk about needing mental health support. They talk about how  afraid they are to go to school because they are worried about the  epidemic of gun violence. They are concerned that they won't be  prepared for the future.                                time  1615    They are not clamoring to have curriculum restricted. They want to  have those hard conversations. I taught middle school for many years. I  run into some of my former students who are now adults, and we talk  about the conversations that we had in my classroom that were on hard  issues, but they were age appropriate. I trusted them and their  families to be engaged in the work that was happening in my classroom.   I fear that where we are headed is a future in which what it is that  teachers are allowed to discuss with students will be so restricted  that our students will not be prepared for the future outside of their  little communities.   History is complicated. It is often ugly, sometimes really  distasteful. I studied African-American history and Native-American  history when I was earning my master's in history. I studied African- American communities post-Reconstruction, during an era known as racial  uplift. I looked at Black women's community organizations and the work  that they did post-Reconstruction to have vital supports within their  communities. I studied Native-American land claims and the missteps and  mistakes and atrocities that happened in history regarding Tribal  claims to land.   I am a better person for knowing these things. It did not  fundamentally make me a less patriotic American. It did not make me  less grateful that my father came here as an immigrant to build a new  life.   Every nation has its complex histories, its difficult chapters, its  reckonings. No nation is without dark spots in its past.   Where we can rise above as a nation is to say, we will embrace head- on the complexity and the nuance and trust that our students, parents,  and teachers can have those conversations, and it will not make them  less likely to love their country.   Having taught middle school for a very long time, and community  college, I will tell you that students feel betrayed when they are not  given age-appropriate curriculum about the hard stuff, and then they  find out about it later, and they feel like we have been withholding  history from them, that we don't trust them enough to ask the good  questions.   I wish so sincerely that we would trust parents more across this  country to be able to have a relationship with their local public  school and their teachers and together have those meaningful, sometimes  difficult conversations.   One of the things that I am also quite concerned about is that we are  not investing even in the infrastructure of schools. I am concerned  that there are so many aging buildings across this country that in a  decade or two they are not going to be structurally sound for our  students. It is going to take a big investment of money to make sure  that every single student has a safe building to learn inside. However,  our priorities often in this building are not around investing in the  needs of our children and our families.   I know that bill is going to come due, and there is going to be a  time when parents and communities say: Why didn't we make those  investments when we should have? Is it not true that our children are  truly the most precious resource for the Nation?   Now, the other thing that I have been thinking about is that we, as  parents, need to be willing to show up for our schools and our students  even when there is no controversy. Take an interest in what is  happening, not because you have any kind of agenda but just because you  want to know what is happening in the schools.   I can tell you that most of the schools that I know of in Vermont  would welcome involvement from the community, whether it is a community  garden or helping to lead after-school programs. What the most  frustrating thing is when people are not involved in the work of the  school or what is happening there, and there is a sense of suspicion  about what is happening there. I can tell you, as somebody who  volunteered as much as I could at my kids' school when they were  little, I knew what was happening in their schools because I was there  communicating.   Public schools are not the enemy here. Teachers are not the enemy,  nor are trans people and queer people that seem to be on the receiving  end right now of a lot of the vitriol around public schools.   I went into teaching for one reason--alleviating suffering. That is  the same reason why I ran for State senate, and it is the same reason  why I ran for Congress, alleviating suffering in all of its forms. When  you are a teacher, you have to do that in real time because kids come  into the classroom with whatever they were dealing with that morning at  home, and it is the job of the teacher to hold all students where they  are and make the classroom environment a place where all feel safe and  supported.   It is not an easy job; I can tell you. Oftentimes when you are a  teacher, you get to the end of the day and you haven't remembered to  eat or use the bathroom or take care of any of your personal needs  because there is only one thing that is important to you, which is  making sure your students get what they need when they are with you  that day.   Can we please stop demonizing teachers? Can we please stop thinking  there is some sinister agenda?   People serve in that capacity because they want to make a positive  difference in the lives of children, and sometimes it is as simple as  sitting with a student who had a rough time on the bus in the morning  or someone who is carrying with them a deep insecurity about themselves  and that is getting in the way of their learning.   We talk in education about differentiated learning, and we use that  to talk about how students come in with different levels of success at  a particular topic, particular curriculum, and you try to  differentiate, make it possible for them to be successful.  [[Page H4064]]    I have often thought when we talk about differentiated learning, we  forget that that is what teachers do day in and day out with every  single student they have. What does this student need right now? How  can I help them get what they need so they can be successful? It is  both exhausting and rewarding.    Can we please stop attacking teachers?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. Tokuda).    Mr. Speaker, we have important work to do in this  country. We need to continue to invest in schools so that we can reduce  poverty. We need to alleviate hunger. We need to work together to build  better outcomes for kids. We need to give teachers a living wage and  create equitable systems that don't leave anyone behind. Your ZIP Code  should not determine whether you get a robust, rich education or not.                                time  1630    Students, parents, educators deserve more. They need partners, not  partisans. They don't need bullies. What they need is for us to stand  up for robust, rich education and not be afraid to talk about the tough  stuff.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
