 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for those kind words  and for yielding to me.   Mr. Speaker, I represent Las Vegas, which is the heart of southern  Nevada. We have over 2 million people, and we welcome 40 million people  from around the world every year. Let me give you a different  perspective.   I have been fighting Yucca Mountain since the 1980s. I do know these  issues. I appreciate some of the points that have been made, but some  of them are just incorrect. H.R. 3053 is a flawed piece of legislation,  and it just doubles down on bad policy and bad politics.   I testified in front of the Energy and Commerce Committee on this  bill when it was first introduced last year and noted many of the flaws  in the legislation, flaws that remain in the bill.   I also presented a map that showed that, if this waste is taken to  Nevada, it will go through over 300 of our Members' districts: past  their schools, past their churches, past their businesses, in their  backyards. So I want them to keep that in mind as they focus on Nevada.   Other flaws with the bill: First, the bill would bust the cap for the  amount of highly radioactive nuclear waste that would be dumped in  Nevada. The bill arbitrarily increases the amount by 37 percent, 37  percent over what was authorized in 1987. But what is more, not one of  the environmental impact studies, the five-volume safety evaluation  report, or any scientific document that relates to Yucca Mountain has  studied the impact of increasing that original 70,000-metric-ton cap.  So this would not only increase it, they haven't even studied what the  impact of the increase would be.   The bill also deems approved changes in the EPA's radiation  protection standards for Yucca Mountain prior to the NRC's final  licensing document. This leads one to conclude that, no matter what  challenge they face, they will just figure out a way to get around it  regardless of what the science says.   Proponents of this legislation also say that, well, you will get  generous host benefits if you take this facility. Well, that is just  another falsehood. The provisions in the bill that were changed after  it passed the committee in order to bring down the cost of the bill and  address the massive scoring issues make our getting those benefits much  less likely.   These benefits have to be approved by future Congresses appropriating  hundreds of millions of dollars. You don't really think they are going  to do that, do you? They shut down the government twice just this year  alone over disagreements on spending.   If this legislation were about good policy or addressing the issue or  getting the technicalities correct, I would be standing here supporting  it, but I just cannot do that the way it is written.   Mr. Speaker, the Congress first passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act,  as you heard, in 1982. It was amended in 1987 just to look at Nevada,  not any of the other sites. We call that the ``Screw Nevada'' bill.   Well, we call it that because you didn't have Nevada wanting it to  come there. You didn't have the science to put it there. You just  screwed Nevada and stuck it there.                                time  1245     Well, this is just more of the same. It is politics, pure  and simple. It is three decades later. We have heard we spent $15  billion. All you got is a hole in the ground. This is ``Screw Nevada  2.0.''   I am going to offer an amendment that allows for consent-based  decisionmaking, which was the Blue Ribbon Commission's recommendation,  and I hope that we can go in that direction. You allow consent-based  for interim storage, why not for permanent storage? That would be the  way to solve this problem. That would be the way to move us forward. We  wouldn't waste billions more and decades more in terms of time.   So I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule and a ``no'' vote on the bill.
