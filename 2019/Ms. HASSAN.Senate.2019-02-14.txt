 Madam President, I am proud to recognize Heather  McGlauflin of New Boston, NH as the February Granite Stater of the  Month for her remarkable work to help prevent substance misuse. Now a  high school senior, Heather has worked with a number of organizations  since her sophomore year to help prevent substance misuse among her  peers and to fight for young people to have a seat at the table in  efforts to combat this devastating epidemic.   Heather's advocacy on this issue began after a guidance counselor  encouraged her to attend a weekend training with CADCA, Community Anti- Drug Coalitions of America. At the end of the weekend, Heather  participated on a panel of students proposing solutions to government  officials and advocates on how to strengthen the response to this  crisis that was broadcast live on New Hampshire's WMUR.   The CADCA training inspired Heather's continued activism, and in the  years since, she has gotten involved in a variety of initiatives such  as training younger students on over-the-counter medication safety,  presenting on the importance of youth advocacy to DEA agents from  across New England and the country, and participating in a public  service announcement training with the Mark Wahlberg Youth Foundation.  As a result of her work with the Mark Wahlberg foundation, Heather  created several PSA's which were selected for further production and  participated in an Emmy-winning PSA with WMUR. Heather also helped  found Empower Youth 603--a youth coalition focused on substance misuse  in New Hampshire--and she recently presented at CADCA's national  conference in Washington, DC, where I met Heather and heard more about  her work.   Heather says she is driven by the stories of her friends and peers,  too many of whom have been impacted by New Hampshire's devastating  opioid crisis. She believes that it is critical to stop substance  misuse before it happens and that the best messenger for young people  is often someone their own age.   For her continued efforts in preventing substance misuse, I am proud  to recognize Heather McGlauflin as February's Granite Stater of the  Month.                            ____________________
