 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of David  Bernhardt's nomination to be the next Secretary of the Interior.   Members of the Western Caucus strongly support his nomination.   David Bernhardt loves his country and has served her well as a model  public servant for over 15 years. David has already been confirmed  twice by the U.S. Senate, once to be the solicitor and the top legal  mind of the country on these issues and the second time to be the  Deputy Secretary. Just last week, the Senate Energy and Natural  Resources Committee advanced his nomination by a strong bipartisan vote  of 14-6.   During his tenure with DOI, David has worked diligently to increase  hunting and fishing access, ensure clean water for future generations,  and empower local decisionmaking. David is a champion for sportsmen and  rural communities.   Mr. Bernhardt is the most qualified candidate we have ever had as the  Secretary of the Interior. Simply put, David Bernhardt is the leader  the Department and the American people deserve.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to vote tomorrow  based on David's credentials, leadership, and principles. If that  occurs, I have no doubt he will be confirmed with a strong bipartisan  vote.   Confirm Bernhardt.                            ____________________
