 Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the  Coronavirus Commission Act. Representative Adam Schiff has introduced  companion legislation in the House.   This bill would establish a commission on the coronavirus pandemic to  better understand the vulnerabilities it has revealed in our national  security and healthcare system and improve our preparedness for future  crises.   It is crucial to improve our understanding of pandemic threats and  health issues that the United States could face in the coming decades  to better protect our population and mitigate the risk of a similar  human and economic catastrophe.   Nearly 130,000 Americans have died from COVID-19. Hospitals have  struggled to secure enough personal protective equipment to keep health  workers safe, testing levels remain inadequate, and a breakthrough  therapeutic, let alone a vaccine, has yet to be developed.   More than 41 million Americans have been laid off, and the  unemployment rate is likely well over 20 percent. Large numbers of  businesses have permanently closed due to the coronavirus pandemic.   The commission that would be created by our bill would conduct a  comprehensive review of the government's coronavirus response and make  recommendations on how we can be better prepared in the future. The  commission would complement other oversight efforts in Congress and  elsewhere.   The coronavirus commission would examine U.S. Government preparedness  in advance of this pandemic, the Federal Government's response to it,  and provide recommendations to improve our ability to respond to and  recover from future outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics.   This legislation is modeled after and closely mirrors legislation  enacted in 2002 that created the 9/11 Commission.   The Coronavirus Commission would be composed of 10 members, with the  same partisan balance as the 9/11 commissioners and prohibited from  being current Federal officials, with a variety of backgrounds in  relevant fields, including public health, epidemiology, emergency  preparedness, armed services, and intelligence; provide a full  accounting to the President, Congress, and the American people of the  facts and circumstances related to the outbreak in the United States,  including our preparedness, the intelligence and information we had  available before the virus reached the United States, and how Federal,  State, and local governments, as well as the private sector, responded  to the crisis; hold hearings and public events to obtain information  and to educate the public; possess subpoena power to compel cooperation  by relevant witnesses and materials from the Federal Government, as  well as State and local governments; make specific recommendations to  Congress and the executive branch to improve our preparedness for  pandemic disease; have adequate staffing and resources to be able to  complete expeditiously the monumental task at hand so we can be  prepared for the next epidemic or pandemic to hit the nation; and the  commission would be established after February 2021, hopefully when the  pandemic has been overcome and after the presidential election.   The coronavirus showed just how unprepared and slow we were to  respond to a major outbreak, and that lack of readiness has endangered  lives.   We were unable to ramp up testing, we had insufficient safety  equipment for doctors and nurses, and we lacked any kind of consistent  Federal guidelines for States and cities.  [[Page S4139]]    We know this will not be the last outbreak, so a 9/11 Commission- style panel is necessary to fix these mistakes going forward and apply  the lessons from this pandemic to future crises.   I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this bill.   Thank you.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Reed, Mr. Cardin,          and Mr. Merkley):   S. 4139.
