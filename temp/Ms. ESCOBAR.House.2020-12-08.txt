 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 8354) to establish the Servicemembers and Veterans  Initiative within the Civil Rights Division of the Department of  Justice, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 8354         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Servicemembers and Veterans       Initiative Act of 2020.''       SEC. 2. SERVICEMEMBERS AND VETERANS INITIATIVE.         (a) Establishment.--There is established the Servicemembers       and Veterans Initiative within the Civil Rights Division of       the Department of Justice.        (b) Duties.--The Servicemembers and Veterans Initiative       shall--        (1) serve as legal and policy advisor to the Attorney       General on the Department of Justice's efforts to enforce       criminal and civil laws that impact servicemembers, veterans,       and their families;        (2) develop policy recommendations for the Attorney General       on how the Department of Justice may improve enforcement of       Federal law to support servicemembers, veterans, and their       families;        (3) serve as the liaison and point of contact between the       Department of Justice and the military departments;        (4) provide counsel to the Assistant Attorney General for       the Office of Justice Programs to ensure funding decisions       take into account servicemembers, veterans, and their       families;        (5) consult with components of the Department of Justice to       promote the provision of civil legal aid to servicemembers,       veterans, and their families;        (6) serve as a liaison and point of contact with the       Consumer Protection Branch of the Civil Division of the       Department of Justice, with respect to the prosecution of       Federal crimes involving fraud that target servicemembers;       and        (7) serve as a liaison and point of contact with other       components of the Department of Justice as needed to support       the enforcement of other Federal laws that protect       servicemembers and veterans, as the Attorney General       determines appropriate.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of my bill, H.R. 8354,  the Servicemembers and Veterans Initiative Act of 2020.   I thank Chairman Nadler for his leadership and support of this  important legislation, along with my colleague from Texas, Congressman  Taylor, for leading this bill with me.   This measure is the result of a truly bipartisan effort. My staff  also worked closely with the committee and incorporated feedback from  the Department of Justice in drafting the text. I am so grateful to  everyone who made this bill better.   The Servicemembers and Veterans Initiative Act establishes in statute  the Servicemembers and Veterans Initiative within the Department of  Justice's Civil Rights Division. The bill details the initiative's  responsibilities to promote the legal interests of servicemembers,  veterans, and their families, such as advising the Attorney General on  efforts to support this population; developing policy recommendations;  and serving as the liaison and point of contact with other components  of DOJ to support the enforcement of Federal laws that protect  servicemembers and veterans, like coordinating the prosecution of  fraud.   As the proud Representative of Texas' 16th Congressional District,  home to Fort Bliss and nearly 50,000 veterans, I know firsthand the  importance of protecting this population with unique needs that  necessitate specialized knowledge of the armed services and veterans'  affairs.   I have learned more about the military community through my seat on  the House Armed Services Committee, where I have heard various examples  of the challenges they face, from financial scams that unfairly target  this population to unsafe housing conditions.   Currently, the Servicemembers and Veterans Initiative draws on  personnel from the Civil Rights Division and the Office of Justice  Programs to enforce civil laws, such as the Uniformed Services  Employment and Reemployment Rights Act, the Uniformed and Overseas  Citizens Absentee Voting Act of 1986, and the Servicemembers Civil  Relief Act, among others, to protect our servicemembers, veterans, and  their families.   Creating an independent and permanent home for these employees will  allow them to better protect servicemembers and preserve institutional  knowledge. The bill would also ensure that DOJ is coordinating closely  with the military departments so that servicemembers, veterans, and  their families are aware of their legal rights and available benefits.   Several veterans service organizations have endorsed this measure-- Paralyzed Veterans of America, Student Veterans of America, and  Veterans Education Success--recognizing the significance of having a  dedicated focus on those who have served our Nation.   Finally, I am grateful to Senator Hirono for introducing this measure  in the Senate, and I look forward to working with her to advance the  bill further.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to thank my  colleagues, specifically Mr. Taylor for his partnership on this very  important bill and, again, Chairman Nadler and all of those, including  staff and members of the Department of Justice, who made this a better  bill.   Our servicemembers and veterans have worked tirelessly to protect us  at home and abroad. It is only right that we work as hard as possible  to protect their rights and shield them from abuses such as fraud,  predatory lending, and other victimization.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this bipartisan effort to  ensure the best for our servicemembers, veterans, and their families,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
