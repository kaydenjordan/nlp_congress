 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Mrs.  Craig) for yielding and I thank my friend, Mr. Meadows, for his  comments, for his support of this effort, which is, as he said and as  Congresswoman Craig said, very much about giving young people a sense  of competition, a sense of accomplishment, a sense of creating a  vehicle through their own hands and their own work and their own  efforts. So this is a very good effort for us and for young people.   One of my favorite events of the year is the Soap Box Derby.   I am speaking, of course, from experience in terms of our district,  which I am going to talk about.   This resolution that has been called up today, along with other  members of the region's Congressional delegation, Representatives  Connolly, Beyer, and Wexton from Virginia, and   David Trone,   John  Sarbanes, and Anthony Brown from Maryland, and, of course, the  Representative of the District of Columbia, Eleanor Holmes Norton, who  is a big supporter of this, authorizes the use of the Capitol Grounds  for the derby.   Now, Mr. Speaker, this is my 28th year sponsoring the Soap Box Derby  resolution, and I am pleased that it has passed every year unanimously.  This is the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby's 78th year.   It will be held on, as has been said, June 15, and we will see soap  box racers from ages 8 to 17 compete in three divisions: stock, super  stock, and masters.   The winners from each division, as has been said, will each have a  chance to compete at the National All-American Soap Box Derby in Akron,  Ohio.   Soap box derbies have been called the greatest amateur racing event  in the world.   In America, we have a long tradition of families participating, and  many adults carry fond memories with them throughout their lives of  having built soap box racers with their parents or other relatives  during their childhood.   Soap box derbies are educational, teaching children about  sportsmanship, engineering, manufacturing, and leadership.   Many of the racers are sponsored by civic groups, police and fire  departments, and service organizations, with members coming out to  cheer on their participants.   Several greater Washington soap box champions, as it will not  surprise you, I am sure, Mr. Speaker, have come from Maryland's Fifth  District in recent years, including the winners from 2007, 2008, 2009,  2012, 2013, 2014, and last year, 2018.    So we are really into this and we have some very, very talented young  people who are excited about participating, and obviously do well.   Our racers, Mr. Speaker, even won the National Championship in both  2007 and 2008. So the Soap Box Derby is a big deal in the Fifth  Congressional District.   Last year, Tyler Jameson from Hollywood, Maryland, won the stock  division. His brother Ryan Jameson won ``Best Decorated'' soap box  racer in the super stock division. It was decorated as a Maryland flag,  which we love very, very much.   Aspen Tomasello from Waldorf, Maryland, which I represent, won in  super stock and then went on to win third place at the National All- American Soap Box Derby race in Akron.   Kenny Tomasello, her brother, prevailed in the masters division and  took fifth place in Akron.   I have a lot of confidence in our Fifth District folks, and, Mr.  Speaker, you can imagine I would be in a lot of trouble if this  resolution didn't pass allowing them to compete in this wonderful  event.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the organizers of the Greater Washington  Soap Box Derby as well as the cosponsors of this resolution, and in  particular, Congresswoman Craig and Congressman Meadows for their  support and help in getting this passed.   Mr. Speaker, it is a fun event, but it is also a great event to teach  young people values and participation and competition.  [[Page H3109]]                                     time  1700
