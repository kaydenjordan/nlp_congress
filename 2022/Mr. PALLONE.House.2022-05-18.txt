 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  Infant Formula Supplemental Appropriations Act.   I particularly thank Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Rosa DeLauro  for all she has done to shed light on the contamination of infant  formula and the problems with FDA enforcement. She talks about me, but  I will talk about her, because she has really taken this issue to heart  for such a long period of time.   I have to say that I am extremely upset listening to the Members on  the other side, the Republicans, talk about this crisis and how it  could have been avoided. I have been on the Energy and Commerce  Committee for over 30 years. FDA's policies of food safety, unlike that  for drugs and medical devices, are not based on fees paid by the  manufacturers. This is because Republicans in the past have not been  willing to impose those fees on the manufacturers.   I can tell you from personal experience, when I tried to include a  fee structure in food safety initiatives in the past before my  committee, the Energy and Commerce Committee, every time, it was  opposed by the Republicans because they were listening to the  manufacturers who didn't want that fee schedule imposed on them. We  have it for drugs. We have it for medical devices. We don't have it for  food safety, and that is right in the hands of the Republican  leadership.   I am not particularly blaming the appropriators today, because this  was not an appropriations issue. This was an Energy and Commerce issue.  But to suggest in some way that this is the Democrats, I will tell you,  it is the Republicans. If that money had been in place, we would have  had the inspectors, and we would have had the ability, in my opinion,  to do a lot more on the issue of food safety. So this crisis, to some  extent, is based on the Republicans' unwillingness to adopt a fee  schedule and provide that regular source of funding for the FDA.   Now, let me also say that in addition to the emergency funding, the  House is also voting tonight to grant flexibility to the WIC program. I  thank the Committee on Education and Labor for that.  [[Page H5161]]    The Biden administration has taken a number of important actions to  respond to this shortage, including working with manufacturers to  increase production and encouraging importation of safe infant formula.  Today, as the chairwoman of Appropriations said, the operation the  White House has announced, including the use of the Defense Production  Act, shows that this administration has continued to commit to end this  crisis.   The Energy and Commerce Committee also today unanimously passed a  measure to allow the FDA to streamline processes for hiring highly  skilled professionals and retain them with competitive salaries. This  will help to ensure our infant formula supply is safe and inspectors  are on the job.   Now, I just want to say, Madam Speaker, manufacturers have to do a  better job in the future to alert the FDA of potential shortages so we  can shift production quickly. The FDA must be empowered to move more  quickly to set limits on contamination, which is currently bogged down  in long and cumbersome regulatory processes.   We understand that more needs to be done, but this bill needs to be  passed today.                                time  2000
