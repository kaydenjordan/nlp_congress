 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Raskin of the Rules  Committee for yielding the time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this rule and H.R. 8, the  Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019. I am proud to be a cosponsor,  and I thank Congressman Thompson for his leadership.   Our bill is intended to ensure that individuals who are prohibited  from owning a firearm are not able to possess one.   Representative Raskin is right. America is in the midst of a gun  violence emergency. Each year, 120,000 Americans are injured by a  firearm; 35,000 Americans die; and of those, 17,000 who are injured and  killed are children.   No other country in the world suffers the ravages of gun violence,  and I am afraid we have become numb to it. But we don't have to accept  it, and we are not, because we are going to finally pass legislation  here today.   Mass shootings are on the rise. Military-style assault weapons are  deadlier than ever. People are being gunned down in churches, schools,  movie theaters, nightclubs, and synagogues.   For so many years, the Republican-led Congress blocked action on  commonsense gun safety laws. But, finally, to the American people: We  heard you; to the students who marched for their lives: We are finally  going to act.   It is time now. I urge adoption of this bipartisan bill, the rule. It  is a vote for the safety of our communities and our families.
