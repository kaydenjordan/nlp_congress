 Mr. Speaker, I rise today during National Police Week  to encourage my colleagues to support a bipartisan bill to help our  communities better recruit and retain local law enforcement  professionals.   This week a bipartisan group from Ohio introduced H.R. 3376, the  Enhancing COPS Hiring Program Grants for Local Law Enforcement Act.   My colleagues from Ohio, Republican and Democratic, Congressman  Carey, Congressman Miller, and Congresswoman Strong Sykes, have  partnered together to alleviate the strain on local police departments  by expanding the COPS hiring program. This bill will allow them to use  existing grant dollars for recruitment and retention bonuses.   We will also be introducing similar legislation for communities to  better recruit and retain firefighters.   Public safety is a top priority for me. We are making sure police and  fire departments across the country have what they need to keep our  children and families safe.   I hope Members will join us in this fight.                            ____________________
