 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of a free Cuba. As  the Cuban people cry out to the free world for democracy, communism  works relentlessly to silence their voices through violence and  censorship.  [[Page H3800]]    Among my best friends growing up in Arkansas were the wonderful  Villalon family, who fled Cuba and escaped the tyranny of Castro. I was  best friends with the kids in elementary school. The father of the  family was a leader in our church and our Boy Scout troop, and the  mother was my Spanish teacher.   The Villalon family had the opportunity to grow up in a free country,  one that provided jobs, opportunities, and freedoms that every human  should have access to. Unfortunately for my friends in Arkansas, it  took them fleeing their homeland and escaping the grips of communism to  get a taste of the freedoms that we Americans enjoy each and every day.   During my career I have seen firsthand the systematic destruction of  commerce, community, and human spirit by communism.   So, Madam Speaker, I stand with the Cuban people, and I call on our  Nation's leaders to do what we can to support a new and free Cuba.
