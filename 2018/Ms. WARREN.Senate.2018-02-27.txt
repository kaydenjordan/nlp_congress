 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to call on President Trump to  nominate a Director for the Indian Health Service.   There are many critical issues facing Indian Country--economic  development, infrastructure, protection of Native lands, respect for  Tribal governments--and after years and years of broken promises,  discrimination, and neglect, Washington owes Tribes a fighting chance  to build stronger communities and a brighter future.   The Federal Indian trust responsibility means that Washington has a  basic legal obligation to the Tribes. Washington also has a fundamental  moral obligation, and that starts with basic healthcare.   American Indians have treaty rights to healthcare from the Federal  Government, but the U.S. Government cannot fulfill our treaty  obligations if key posts, such as the Director of IHS, lay vacant for  years.   The IHS is a big deal. It is the primary Federal healthcare provider  for American Indians and Alaska Natives. It serves 2.2 million people  spread across 36 States. It has a budget of nearly $5 billion annually.  The IHS provides care through more than 660 clinics, hospitals, and  health stations on or near reservations, many of them in remote and  rural locations located hours away from other health facilities. It  serves more than 13 million outpatient visitors a year.   The doctors, nurses, and other healthcare providers at IHS hospitals  and clinics do everything from delivering babies, to providing dental  services, to fighting the opioid crisis.   Right now, more than a year into President Trump's term, there is  still no permanent leader at the Indian Health Service. Two weeks ago,  the nomination for IHS Director was withdrawn, and there hasn't been a  Senate-confirmed Director for years. This leadership vacuum creates a  serious problem. The IHS cannot engage in long-term planning without a  permanent Director at the helm. It cannot officially fix problems at  hospitals that failed inspections and where Medicare and Medicaid  funding is in jeopardy. It cannot move as decisively to ensure that IHS  facilities stay open. It cannot implement agency-wide standards for  quality of care, as the Government Accountability Office has  recommended. The IHS cannot prioritize competing issues, solve serious  and longstanding problems, or work through how to meet multiple goals  more effectively.   Its relationship with other Federal agencies is weakened without a  stable leader--critical relationships with the Centers for Medicare and  Medicaid Services, the Office of Management and Budget, the Substance  Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, and the rest of the  Department of Health and Human Services. It cannot ensure that programs  like the Special Diabetes Program for Indians, which has created real,  positive outcomes, is implemented as well as possible. The IHS cannot  work out a direction for the Service and hold a single stable leader  accountable for doing a good job.    The IHS faces serious challenges that require the attention of a  permanent, dedicated Director. The agency is underfunded and has been  underfunded for a long time. As a result, its facilities often lack  medical equipment that many Americans take for granted when they visit  a clinic or a hospital, like an MRI machine or a functioning operating  room. A 2016 report by the inspector general of the U.S. Department of  Health and Human Services found that IHS hospital administrators have  had difficulty recruiting and retaining critical staff. Aging hospital  buildings and outdated equipment also raise concerns about patient  safety. The inspector general cites concerns about corroded pipes  leaking sewage into the OR and not being able to find replacement parts  to fix old equipment the hospitals are relying on. Doctors and nurses  should be able to focus on helping their patients get well, not on  whether the building is habitable and basic facilities are available.   There are also serious staffing shortages. At its Great Plains  facilities, for example, IHS vacancy rates have reached 37 percent.  Compare that to my home State of Massachusetts, where only 6 percent of  nursing jobs were vacant in 2015.   Tribal leaders are understandably concerned about the direction of an  [[Page S1237]]  agency that plays such a vital role in their communities. Here is what  I heard from Chairwoman Cheryl Andrews-Maltais, of the Wampanoag Tribe  of Gay Head--the Aquinnah--in Massachusetts: ``This vacancy has created  significant instability and negatively affects the already burdened IHS  system.'' She added: ``Not only is it a failure on the part of the  Federal Government to not adequately fund healthcare for Indians; the  failure to appoint someone to lead this critical service area is  considered by many Tribes as gross negligence.'' The chairwoman says  that the United States is failing to keep its word and failing to  fulfill its ``solemn responsibility'' to the Tribes. I agree with the  chairwoman.   Healthcare is a basic human right, and everyone in this country  deserves access to quality, affordable healthcare. But the stakes are  particularly high for Native people.   An American Indian or Alaska Native baby born today has a life  expectancy that is almost 4\1/2\ years shorter than the U.S. average.  These little babies are also more likely to die before they ever reach  their first birthday. Native infant mortality is about 25 percent  higher than for the U.S. as a whole.   Chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease hit Native Americans  harder too. For instance, American Indians and Alaska Natives die from  diabetes at a rate that is three times higher than that of the entire  American population.   Mental health and addiction issues are also a very big concern. The  opioid epidemic has devastated communities all over our country, but it  is a particularly virulent problem for Native Americans, who have the  highest per capita rates of opioid overdoses in the country.   Similarly, the alcohol-related death rate for Native Americans is  about 500 percent higher than for the rest of the population.   Suicide rates are about 70 percent higher.   Everyone struggling with addiction deserves access to high-quality  treatment, no matter who they are or where they live. That is the only  way we are going to make progress in tackling this crisis. But right  now, in a place where the need is great, the Federal Government is  failing to provide adequate care.   With so much need, investing in improving the IHS should be a top  priority for Washington. I am glad that the Trump administration's  latest budget for the IHS includes a funding increase. Still, this  government needs to do more--much more. A Senate-confirmed Director can  serve as the advocate the IHS needs in order to get the resources it  deserves. In fact, Federal law explicitly says that advocating good  Indian health policy is one of the Director's job responsibilities. We  should be doing that job.   We need a good person in this job, which means the nominee must be  thoroughly vetted. But that is not an excuse for more delay or for the  White House to drag its feet. It needs to work with the Tribes to find  the right person for the job and then submit the nomination quickly.   The person who heads up the IHS should be knowledgeable and should  have a vision for how to deliver better healthcare to Native Americans.  The person should have the determination and commitment to push  Congress to meet its treaty obligations in providing healthcare to  Native communities.   The Trump administration doesn't have a stellar record when it comes  to nominating the right people for important jobs. I often strongly  disagree with the President's picks. But leaving hundreds of critical  posts across our government vacant, including the IHS Director, has a  devastating effect all its own.   It wasn't until just 2 weeks ago that President Trump finally named a  nominee to be Commissioner of the Administration for Native Americans.   Several offices in the Federal bureaucracy have an important role in  running important programs for Tribes, and the President hasn't  nominated heads for some of those offices--for instance, the Director  of the Department of Justice's Office on Violence Against Women, which  administers key grant programs for Tribal programs to combat domestic  violence and sexual assault, and the Assistant Secretary of the  Employment and Training Administration in the Department of Labor,  which provides workforce innovation and opportunity grants to Tribes  and Tribal organizations. These vacancies hit Native communities hard,  and they represent one more broken promise to Native people.   There is no excuse for delay. I urge President Trump to move quickly  to consult with Tribes and to submit a nomination for IHS Director. The  Native community should not have to wait any longer.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
