 Madam Speaker, I rise today because I want to call the  name of George Floyd.   George Floyd lost his life this week because of a Minneapolis police  officer.   George Floyd died for no known reason. He was not armed. He was not  intoxicated. He was not aggressive. And he was not threatening.   George Floyd pleaded for his life. He cried out for help. He groaned  in pain. And then he died with his face pressed against the ground and  the knee of a police officer against his neck.   This was not an arrest. This was murder. It was the murder of George  Floyd, and it ought to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.   God help us as a Nation if we choose to be silent at this sad and  tragic time.                            ____________________
