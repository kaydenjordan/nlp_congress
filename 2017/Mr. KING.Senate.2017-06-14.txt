Without objection, it is so  ordered.                            Healthcare Legislation     Mr. President, I was in Maine over the weekend, and people  said: How do you feel about healthcare? What do you think we ought to  be doing? I said: I like the President's plan. I think President Trump  has it just right. He says we need healthcare that will cover everyone,  low premiums and low deductibles, no preexisting conditions. That is  the right formulation, and I hope that is what we can work toward, and  that is what we should be working toward.   He also said yesterday that the bill that passed the House was mean.  Well, a couple of weeks ago I said it was cruel, but I will accept  mean; both mean the same thing. It is a terrible blow to literally  millions of people across this country and thousands in my State of  Maine.   By the way, the problem with the House bill is that it is so bad that  some kind of compromise has developed here that is halfway, and it is  still mean or cruel. Now people are talking about a ``soft landing.''  That is a euphemism for stretching out the crash. It is not a soft  landing. Whether we take Medicaid and healthcare coverage away from  people in 2 years, 4 years, or 7 years, it is still going to happen,  and it is a crash. It is not a soft landing. That is just stretching it  out into beyond the next couple of elections, but it doesn't really get  to the core of the issue, which is taking healthcare and health  insurance away from millions of people.                   Congressional Baseball Practice Shooting    Mr. President, before I began, I meant to acknowledge what happened  this morning to our colleagues across the way at the baseball  practice--tragic, inexplicable, horrible, and just inexcusable. My  heart goes out to the Capitol Police who, I understand, were incredibly  brave and met their responsibilities admirably to Representative  Scalise and to any others who were injured--a terrible incident and one  that we hope we never see the likes of again.                            Healthcare Legislation    Going back to healthcare, I think it is important for people to  understand the big picture of what is going on with this issue that is  now before both the House and the Senate.   What we are really talking about is a massive tax increase on middle- class and lower middle-class people and a massive tax cut for the  wealthiest Americans. It is as simple as that. It is a gigantic  transfer of wealth--probably one of the greatest in a short time in  recent American history--where we have millions of people across the  country who have health insurance under the Affordable Care Act and are  protected under Medicaid and Medicaid expansion, and we are taking that  away. The Affordable Care Act exchange policies are a tax credit. So  when you take that away, you are increasing people's taxes; you are  increasing the taxes of people who are making between $15,000 and  $45,000, $60,000, $70,000 a year, and you are decreasing taxes in a  huge way only for people who make more than $200,000 a year.   The 400 highest taxpayers in the country will get a tax cut of $7  million apiece. That makes no sense. We are taking resources away from  the people who need it--the middle class--and we are giving it to the  people who don't need it. It is Robin Hood in reverse.   That is the fundamental point of this legislation. It is all about  that big tax cut for the rich--for the really rich--and I just don't  understand why we are even thinking about that, because the American  people need help with the cost of healthcare. If you divide the total  healthcare bill in this country by the number of people, you come up  with about $8,500 a year per person, on average, or $35,000 a year for  a family  [[Page S3466]]  of four. That is the cost of healthcare. That cost has to be paid, and  I would argue that people who are in the middle income can't afford it.  They can't afford to pay those costs, and they need some help, and that  is what the Affordable Care Act does. But, instead, we are talking  about repealing it--knocking those millions of people off.   In Maine we have 75,000 people on the exchanges. And then, of course,  we have hundreds of thousands on Medicaid. We are talking about  severely constricting their access to healthcare. That is just wrong,  ethically, morally, and in any other way. We are taking healthcare away  from people so we can give a massive tax cut to the people who don't  really need it.   In Maine, if the House had taken a blank sheet of paper and said  ``How can we design a healthcare plan that would really hammer the  people of Maine?'' it would have been the AHCA--misnamed the American  Healthcare Act; it ought to be the anti-healthcare act because that is  what it is all about--taking healthcare away from people. It could not  be more tailored to harm people in Maine.   We are the oldest State in the country. We have more people in the  older age brackets--50 and up--than any other State in the United  States as a percentage of our population. We also are a relatively low- income State. You put those things together, and you really get hurt.  Also, in Maine, as in the Presiding Officer's home State, we have a lot  of hazardous occupations--logging, agriculture, fishing, the iconic  Maine lobsterman.   This is a guy named David Osgood from Vinalhaven, an incredibly  beautiful island off the coast of Maine. Lobstering is an essential  part of the Maine economy. It is a part of our way of life. Vinalhaven,  where Dave lives, has a population of about 1,200. It is really hard  work. It is all-weather, and it is dangerous. You have to haul tracks,  repair them, be out on the water in the wintertime, which is no fun.  David Osgood has been lobstering since he was 13, like his father and  grandfather before him.   As of this spring, all three of David's and Elaine's children have  finished college. That is amazing. That is a real achievement for any  family, but fishing is challenging and tough.   The Osgoods are really thankful for the fact that they can get  affordable health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. Once, they  weren't covered, and David had a back problem that required surgery.  Like a lot of people in Maine, he paid it off, month by month by month.  But the ACA, according to Elaine, has given them some comfort and peace  of mind.   I don't think those of us who have pretty much had health insurance  all of our lives realize the importance of that peace of mind, of not  being anxious about a health problem that could wipe you out, make you  lose your house--an illness or an injury. Elaine said: We will be OK.   The deductibles are a problem. They are too high. I agree. What we  ought to be working on is how to get the deductibles down, how to work  on the premiums, how to work on the cost of healthcare.   All of this debate about the Affordable Care Act and Medicare and  Medicaid and a public option and single payer--all of that is about who  pays, when a big part of the problem is how much we are all paying. We  pay roughly twice as much per person for healthcare than anyone else in  the industrialized world. That is a real problem that we have to start  debating. We have to start talking about that because, whoever pays,  whatever the insurance plan is, if the underlying cost is something  that people just can't afford, then we are going to be arguing about  who pays, how much, and what part. We have to get at that $8,500 per  person.   People say: Yes, but we have the best healthcare system in the world.  Yes, we do, for the people who can afford it. But for the millions of  people who don't have health insurance, who get treated only in  emergency rooms or more often don't want to get treated at all because  they don't want to go in because they know they can't pay for it, the  healthcare system does not deliver for them.   By all objective measures--longevity, infant mortality--we are not  first in the world. We are like 20th in the world. We are way below our  colleagues, and yet we are paying much more. We have to address high  deductibles, high premiums, and high costs, but also, in the meantime,  we have to keep people covered.   Another couple in Maine, Jonathan Edwards and Jennifer Schroth, live  in Hancock County. It is another coastal county. They are farmers, and  they raise vegetables.   Here is a great Maine story. I have known Jen's mother for about 40  years. I just met Jen at a healthcare forum in Bangor a few weeks ago,  but I knew her mother way back. Everybody in Maine knows everybody  else. I suspect it is like in Alaska. We are a big small town with very  long roads.   Jonathan and Jennifer own and operate a farm. By the way, this farm  is in a town called Brooklin, but this is the real Brooklin--Brooklin,  ME. They grow potatoes, vegetables, strawberries, raspberries, and  asparagus. They make maple syrup. They could never afford healthcare  until the ACA came along because they were essentially a small  business, but they were not a big enough business to have a group plan.  They didn't have employer-based health insurance. They just didn't have  it.   They are both in their fifties, and one of the changes made under the  Affordable Care Act was that the ratio between the premiums for younger  people and older people can't be more than three times. It reflects the  reality that older people have more healthcare needs and cost the  system more. So there is a reflection. It is allowed to be a three- times basis. The House bill changes that to five times. That is a huge  shift directly toward people in their fifties and early sixties.   When Jen was pregnant with each of their two boys, they had no  insurance. They paid the hospital. Just like my friend David Osgood,  they paid the hospital. That is what Maine people do. But what if there  had been complications? They were pretty straightforward births, but  what if there had been complications? They would have been wiped out  because they had no health insurance. Jen says she doesn't feel it is  responsible to go without health insurance, especially when you have a  family.   It is critical to them that the ACA is affordable, and it is because  of the tax credits. They also appreciate that they have real insurance  that really covers things. There are no exclusions. People say: Well, I  have this really cheap insurance policy, but it doesn't cover anything.  It may not even cover hospitalization or it doesn't cover doctor visits  or it doesn't cover drugs. It doesn't cover what you really need. That  is not insurance. That is illusory. But now, Jen says, they have peace  of mind because they have coverage. She told me that face-to-face not  long ago.   Running a small business is tough. It is tough because you generally  can't get group policies. Sometimes you can join a small business  association, but generally you can't. This is a way to have coverage  that people can afford.   Imagine if somebody came to this body and said: I have a great idea  for a bill. I am going to raise taxes on the middle class and give a  great big break to hedge fund managers. We wouldn't even think about  it. It wouldn't even get out of committee. Yet that is essentially what  this is all about.   How much of a tax increase is it on somebody? Well, in Hancock  County, where these folks live, for a 60-year-old making $40,000 a  year--these are real numbers from the Kaiser Family Foundation--under  the Affordable Care Act the premium is $4,080 a year, about 10 percent  of your income. That is still substantial. But under the bill passed by  the House, that would go to $17,090 on a $40,000 gross income. It is  ridiculous to go from $4,000 to $17,000.   Where does that difference come from? It is going back to the people  who don't need it. It is going back to the people who make $200,000,  $400,000, $800,000, $1 million, $5 million a year--a 300-percent  increase in out-of-pocket costs for healthcare. In Knox County--I think  David is younger than 60, but if he were 60--his premium goes from  $4,080 to $10,590, more than doubled.   This just doesn't make sense to me. This whole discussion doesn't  make sense to me. I agree that we need to talk about healthcare, and I  agree that we need to do something about it, but we are doing the wrong  thing. We are making it worse.  [[Page S3467]]    There are two problems with healthcare in this country. We can boil  it down to two issues--cost and access. The Affordable Care Act,  although it dealt somewhat with cost, was mostly about access--allowing  people who don't have health insurance to get it, whether through  Medicaid expansion or through the exchanges.   Cost is a bigger issue, and it is one that we also have to deal with.  But that is not what is on the floor now, or will be soon, and it is  not what is being considered in Congress. But I would argue that we  really have to pay attention to that issue as well.   So all of this and taking coverage away from my friend David or Jen  and John and thousands--we know the number from the House bill, 23  million people in America--to give a massive tax break so a guy making  a couple million dollars a year can buy an extra Maserati just doesn't  pass the straight-face test for good public policy.   I am the first to agree that the Affordable Care Act is not perfect.  I think there are things about it that need to be fixed and adjusted,  and we need to work on how we do the deductibles, how we improve that,  and how we broaden the coverage and maybe make it more of a sliding  scale. All of those things are things we can discuss and work on, and I  am absolutely willing to do it--but the idea of repealing it just to  check a box to meet a campaign promise and to be so divergent from what  the President has said over and over in the campaign and since that  time--that he wants coverage for everyone, no preexisting conditions,  and lower premiums and deductibles. I am for it. But what we are doing  is the exact opposite--the exact 180-degree opposite.    So let's take a breath. There is no deadline here of next week or the  July 4th recess. Let's take a break and back off and start talking  about it as Senators and Representatives from all over the country and  all parties. I think we ought to be able to come to some agreement  here.   Now, if there are people who are just hell-bent to provide a tax cut  to multimillionaires, then, there isn't an agreement to be had. If that  has to be part of the deal, include me out. But if we can start talking  reasonably about how we can improve the Affordable Care Act--I don't  care if we improve it, change it, tinker with it, and call it TrumpCare  or McConnellCare or RyanCare. Call it what you want, but let's provide  health insurance, which is so important to the American people.   I have told this story a couple of times, but I am going to conclude  with why I am so passionate about this. Forty years ago, I worked here.  I was a staff member, and I had insurance. For the first time in my  young life, I think, I had health insurance. Part of the health  insurance was a provision for preventive care, which is also required  under the Affordable Care Act. So you could have a free physical. I was  28, 29 years old and immortal. We all were at that age. But I said:  What the heck; it is free. I guess I will have a physical.   So I went in and had a physical. The doctor looked me over, looked at  my eyes, and down my throat. But he happened to notice that on my black  I had a black mole. He said: I don't like the looks of that. That ought  to be taken off.   I didn't even notice it. I didn't even know it was there. He took it  off, and it turned out to be something called malignant melanoma, which  is one of the most virulent and serious forms of cancer. The thing  about malignant melanoma is that, if you catch it in time, you are  good. Here I am, 40 years later. If you don't, you are gone. I have had  friends in Maine and in other parts of the country who have died of  melanoma. It has always haunted me to this day that the only reason I  caught it and my life was saved was because I had health insurance, and  somewhere in this country there was a young man who also had a mole on  his back or on his arm or on his neck and who didn't have health  insurance, didn't have preventive care, didn't go to the doctor, and he  is gone. That is not fair. That is not right. In a country as advanced  and wealthy as this is, it is not right that that guy died and I am  here.   So don't ever tell me that health insurance doesn't save lives  because it does. There is no doubt that it does. That is why it is so  important for us to get this right and not just cavalierly and blithely  rip health insurance away from people--many of whom have gotten it for  the first time, many of whom are small business people--the very people  we all talk about wanting to help.   We can't do it. It is a dereliction of our duty to serve the American  people.   We need to figure out how to do it right. We need to figure out how  to do it effectively and efficiently. In the end, we are here to help  our fellow citizens. I am here for Maine, and I can't let my people  suffer under a law that would take something away which they have come  to depend upon and that has saved lives and means so much to them. We  can do better. I am sure of it.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Steve Schley who  is stepping down as president of Pingree Associates after nearly three  decades of leadership later this month. Eight generations after his  descendant initiated this effort, Steve Schley has, in his 32 years of  service both to Pingree Associates, of which he was president for 28  years, and to the State of Maine, continued a tradition of leadership  in the development and fiscal health of Maine's forest products  industry as well as the sustainability of Maine's forests. Steve's  retirement provides an opportunity to honor his wide array of  accomplishments and contributions to the State of Maine--all achieved  in the spirit and essence of his lineage.   In the year 1820, Maine, as included in the the Missouri Compromise,  was ushered into the Union as a new State. That same year, a prominent  Massachusetts shipping merchant named David Pingree initiated what  would become a historic and indispensable string of investments in  Maine forestlands. Over the next nearly 200 years, sudden growth and  advancement of Maine's forest product industry, and thus statewide  economic development, blossomed from the easement agreements signed and  purchases made of Maine forest land by the Pingree family.   Today Pingree Associates is in possession of close to 1 million acres  of Maine forest land, bringing a great burden of responsibility upon  the president of the association. In every respect, Steve has thrived  under this burden. During his tenure as president, he has undertaken  initiatives to revitalize Maine's struggling wood-products industry by  collaborating with the University of Maine's Forest Bio-products  Research Institute to help nurture the next generation of innovators  and leaders in the bioproducts industry, setting the stage for the  development and integration of sustainable, forward-thinking forest  products. By ``paying it forward'' through the youth of Maine, he is  ensuring that his integrity and hard work will continue to live on  through these kids for generations to come. Steve's sustainability and  conservation efforts were not limited to just ensuring a bright future.  Back in 2001, when I was Governor, I announced Steve's success in  closing the largest forestland conservation easement in the history of  the United States between Pingree Associates and the New England  Forestry Foundation, which independently protected 762,192 acres from  development and opened up the land to recreation for Mainers and all  U.S citizens for time immemorial.   Because of Steve's hard work and leadership as president of Pingree  Associates, Mainers of all ages will continue to benefit from his  successes in Maine's forest industry, as well as in conserving land for  their recreation. Steve has honored our collective heritage as well as  his own, and I thank him for his friendship and his many contributions  towards bettering our State.
