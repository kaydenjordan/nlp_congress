 Mr. Chief Justice, I have a question for the President's  counsel, and I am being joined by Senators Rounds and Young.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senator Inhofe, joined by Senators Rounds and  Young, is for counsel to the President:         Even if additional witnesses are called, do you ever       envision the House Managers agreeing there has been a fair       Senate trial if it ends in the President's acquittal?    Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, the  answer is no.   Now, they will not agree that it is fair because what will happen is,  if there is a discussion of witnesses and if we go to witnesses, Mr.  Schumer has laid out the four he wants, and he tells me we could have  anybody we want. The reality is that also includes documents, and that  includes other witnesses that it may lead to. So, at some point, this  body will say--because this cannot go on forever, and we will be at the  election--this has to come to an end, and they will say: Aha, it has  been brought to an end as we were about to get the key evidence.  [[Page S719]]    But what is so interesting here is they had 17 witnesses--that they  had. When the hearing took place before the Judiciary Committee, if I  am not mistaken, Manager Nadler, you had four witnesses at one point,  when you had the law professors, and there were three law professors  from the Democratic side and there was one from the Republican side. So  if we are going to take that same four-to-one analysis, for every one  of their witnesses, we should get four.   But there was a question earlier asked about the truth of the  poisonous tree. The taint of the poison does not age well. The longer  it goes does not make that poison go away. It gets deeper and deeper  into the soil, and here, the soil we are talking about is a trial that  would be not only ongoing, but they put up 17 witnesses. You have heard  them. They are acting like there have been no witnesses presented here.  They presented the testimony of 17. They may not have liked that we  were able to respond to those 17 by playing those witnesses' words. By  the way, those witnesses--the testimony of those witnesses--were never  done with cross-examination by the counsel for the President.   So does this end? Will it ever be enough? No, it will only be enough  if they got a conviction because that is what it is about, because  let's not forget for a moment that this has been going on, in one stage  or another, for 3\1/2\, 3 years now.   My concern is there is not a--where is the end point in that? So  their end point is: Well, just give us John Bolton, and then, you know,  you don't get anybody or then, you know, you get one and we get one,  and then that one may lead to somebody else. It is not the way it  works.   So they have said ``overwhelming,'' ``proved,'' 63 times--63 times.  And as we are 3 hours away from answering the end of the question  section, we are about to go into--I mean, it sounds like we have been  arguing about witnesses for the last couple hours, but that starts  tomorrow.   But do I think that there will be--is it our position that there will  be--a recognition that there is due process that has been reached and  we have reached a happy accord? No, I do not believe that.   I also don't believe that what can be cured here. I don't think what  they did can be cured here by anything you were to do as far as  witnesses or anything else. That process was so tainted, and I thought  Mr. Philbin did a very effective job of explaining--painstakingly, now,  and multiple times, I know--the issue of those subpoenas. And I thought  the perfect analysis was when one of the managers said: Well, when  people file freedom of information requests, they get answers. And Mr.  Philbin said: That is because they followed the law; they followed the  rules. That is not what happened here.   Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from Delaware.
