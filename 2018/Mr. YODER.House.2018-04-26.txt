 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Blue Valley West  High School and Pleasant Ridge Middle School on winning their regional  competitions of the National Science Bowl.   Since 1991, the Department of Energy has been using the National  Science Bowl to encourage students from diverse backgrounds who excel  in science and mathematics to pursue careers in those areas. For our  Nation to remain the beacon of innovation and creation that it is  today, we must support and inspire our youth to experiment and explore  the world around them.   In January of this year, 9,000 high school students and 4,500 middle  school students passionate about science and mathematics began to  compete. The young people from my district worked hard and have found  themselves participating in the national finals. Starting today, these  two bright groups of young people will represent Kansas in the National  Science Bowl's national finals.   Mr. Speaker, I call upon all of us in this body to join me in wishing  Blue Valley West and Pleasant Ridge's team good luck in the National  Science Bowl's national finals.                            ____________________
