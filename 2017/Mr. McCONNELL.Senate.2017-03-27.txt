 Mr. President, at the end of the Cold War, many  wondered whether NATO could or should survive absent the glaring threat  from the Soviet Union, which tied together a diverse coalition of  Western countries. That Soviet threat held the alliance together  through myriad issues and challenges of burden sharing, nuclear  doctrine, and how to balance the roles of the European Union and a  security alliance.   The United States, as a global superpower, was at times criticized  for not paying enough attention to the alliance and at other times for  its heavyhanded leadership.   When the Berlin Wall came down, NATO was forced to evolve. At its  core, the alliance is not only about defeating a common threat but also  about common values.   When our Nation was attacked on September 11, NATO acted on September  12 and invoked article 5 of the Washington Treaty for the first time in  history, and NATO partners have worked to assist us in the war on  terror ever since.   With Russia's resurgence and quest for renewed greater power status,  NATO has given notice that it will stand up for Western democracies, as  well, and has continued to do so.   Let's be clear. President Putin mourns the fall of the Soviet Union.  He is intent on using all elements of national power to expand Russia's  sphere of influence. He is also threatened by the examples of  representative democracies anywhere near Russia's borders, and he is  accordingly trying to intimidate other nations from seeking entry into  the alliance.   The Partnership for Peace, established in 1994, has given newly  independent states a path toward developing capabilities that would  bind them closer to the democracies of the West. It has given them  something to strive for. Through the use of the Membership Action Plan,  NATO is capable of setting forth the various reforms required for  membership of those countries that aspire to join the alliance.   This is the path Poland took--and Romania, the Czech Republic, and so  many of our friends in Eastern Europe. Today it is the path Montenegro  is taking.   A positive vote on the NATO accession treaty that is before us tells  those countries that complete NATO member action plans that this  undertaking, while difficult, is not futile.   Let us remember that we face a variety of threats in the world--from  ISIL to the Syrian civil war to China's military buildup and  territorial ambitions--and our European allies face many threats as  well.   NATO remains an incredibly valuable alliance. It is an alliance,  however, that must be sustained. That is why we ask our partners to  meet their commitments to NATO by spending 2 percent of GDP on defense  so the alliance can improve its capabilities, and that is why we must  meet our own commitments, including voting yes on the accession treaty  before the Senate today.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, last week Supreme  Court nominee Judge Neil Gorsuch came before the Senate Judiciary  Committee for his confirmation hearing. His testimony reaffirmed what  we already know about Judge Gorsuch. He is fair and impartial. He has  an outstanding legal mind, and he is humble and well respected. He also  has a record of building consensus.   Here is what he said about that record at his hearing.         I have decided . . . over 2,700 cases, and my law clerks       tell me that 97 percent of them have been unanimous, 99       percent I've been in the majority. They tell me as well that       according to the Congressional Research Service, my opinions       have attracted the fewest number of dissents from my       colleagues of anyone I've served with that they studied over       the last 10 years.    So let's repeat that. Judge Gorsuch has ruled in more than 2,700  cases. He has been in the majority 99 percent of the time, and 97  percent have been unanimous decisions.  [[Page S1982]]    It is no wonder the American Bar Association--an organization that  the Democratic leader and the former Democratic Judiciary Committee  chairman have called the ``gold standard''--gave Judge Gorsuch its  highest rating, unanimously ``well qualified.''   In that ABA rating, it noted: ``Based on the writings, interviews,  and analyses we scrutinized to reach our rating, we discerned that  Judge Gorsuch believes strongly in the judicial branch of government,  and we predict that he will be a strong but respectful voice in  protecting it.''   The ABA isn't alone in its support for Judge Gorsuch. In fact, people  from across the political spectrum have sung his praises, including  many on the left that you might not expect--people like Professor  Laurence Tribe, former President Obama's legal mentor, who called  Gorsuch ``a brilliant, terrific guy who would do the Court's work with  distinction,'' and Neal Katyal, former President Obama's top Supreme  Court lawyer, who called him ``one of the most thoughtful and brilliant  judges to have served our nation over the last century.''   This is the Obama Solicitor General saying that he is ``one of the  most thoughtful and brilliant judges to have served our nation over the  last century.''   There are liberal law professors, including Alan Dershowitz, who said  Gorsuch would be ``hard to oppose on the merits,'' and Donald Elliot,  who called him ``a brilliant mind'' who ``tries very hard to get the  law right . . . [and] follows the law as best he can wherever it might  lead.''   At his confirmation hearing last week, we heard from former and  current colleagues on the Federal bench who enthusiastically support  his nomination. These are all Federal judges who know him well.   Judge John Kane, who was appointed to the district court in Colorado  by President Carter, wrote that Judge Gorsuch has voted both to affirm  and reverse his decisions. ``In each instance,'' he remarked, ``I have  felt I was clearly understood and properly informed.'' He goes on to  say:         I think Judge Gorsuch listens well and decides justly. His       dissents are instructive rather than vitriolic. In sum, I       think he is an excellent judicial craftsman.    Former colleagues on the Tenth Circuit testified last week on his  behalf as well. Two former chief judges of that circuit--one appointed  by President Reagan and another appointed by President Clinton--have  written that Judge Gorsuch was ``like most good judges, assiduously  attentive to the facts and law in each case.'' Judge Deanell Tacha and  Judge Robert Henry went on to say that if Judge Gorsuch were confirmed  to the Supreme Court, his other important traits are not likely to  change either--things like ``his fair consideration of opposing views,  his remarkable intelligence, his wonderful judicial temperament  expressed to litigants and his collegiality toward colleagues.''   They conclude by saying:         If we seek to confirm to the Supreme Court a noted       intellect, a collegial colleague, and [a] gifted and eloquent       writer--as well as a person of exhibited judicial       temperament--Gorsuch fits that bill. He represents the best       of the judicial tradition in our country.    Perhaps David Frederick, a board member of the left-leaning American  Constitution Society, best summed up why the Senate should confirm  Judge Gorsuch. In a recent Washington Post op-ed, he praised Judge  Gorsuch for his ``reverence for our country's values and legal  system.''   Mr. Frederick states:         The facts developed in a case matter to him; the legal       rules established by legislatures and through precedent       deserve deep respect; and the importance of treating       litigants, counsel, and colleagues with civility is deeply       ingrained in him.    Therefore, this self-proclaimed ``long-time supporter of Democratic  candidates and progressive causes,'' said that ``the Senate should  confirm [Gorsuch] because there is no principled reason to vote no.''   Let me repeat that. ``The Senate should confirm him,'' he said,  ``because there is no principled reason to vote no.''   Unfortunately, some of our Democratic colleagues are trying  desperately to find any excuse to block this nomination. Although this  is unfortunate, it is not surprising. Recall that the Democratic leader  stated before Judge Gorsuch was even nominated that he would oppose any  person on the President's long list of qualified candidates, even if it  meant keeping the seat open for years.   Look, we know that our Democratic friends are under an enormous  amount of pressure from some on the far left who want them to  ``resist.'' It is clear that many radical special interest groups  simply refuse to accept the results of the election and would like  nothing more than to obstruct the serious work before the Senate.   We saw the impact that had on the Cabinet confirmation process, which  represented a historic level of obstruction. We are seeing the same  calls for obstruction now.   This much is clear. If our Democratic colleagues choose to hold up  this nominee, then, they are acknowledging that they will go to any  length--any length--to block any Supreme Court nominee of a Republican  President. If Neil Gorsuch can't be confirmed, there is no nominee of  any Republican President who our friends on the other side would argue  deserves 60 votes. This isn't about the nominee at all. It isn't about  his background. It isn't about his temperament. It isn't about his  reputation as a judge. It is about those on the far left who want to  prevent our country from moving forward.    Judge Gorsuch's suitability for the appellate court was so  noncontroversial that not a single Senate Democrat opposed his  nomination--not then-Senator Obama, not then-Senators Biden, Clinton,  or Kennedy, not even my good friend the Democratic leader--and there is  no reason that Judge Gorsuch shouldn't receive similarly overwhelming  bipartisan support now. This is an important moment for our country.   I urge each of our colleagues to rise to the moment and together move  forward with the confirmation of our next Supreme Court Justice, Judge  Neil Gorsuch, and give him the up-or-down vote that he deserves.   Will the Presiding Officer announce the business of the day.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text  of the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 728         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
