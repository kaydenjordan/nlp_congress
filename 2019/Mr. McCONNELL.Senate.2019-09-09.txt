 Mr. President, I welcome my colleagues back to the  Senate. I hope all of us took advantage of the past weeks that we spent  in our home States and with our constituents. Washington is where we  come to work. We come here to fight for our neighbors and for the  places we love and are proud to hail from.   The American people know this is a highly charged political moment.  They haven't sent us here to stage pitched battles or score political  points. They elected us to make a difference for them and their  families. We do that by taking care of the people's business and by  collaborating in good faith to complete our work and attend to the  pressing matters that are before us.   While we were spread out across the country, we heard an unwelcome  announcement from our dear friend and colleague, the senior Senator  from Georgia. Senator Johnny Isakson has determined that his health  challenges will lead him to conclude his distinguished 15-year Senate  career at the end of December, putting Georgians first, like always.   His departure will be a significant loss for the people of Georgia  and for the 99 of us here in this Chamber. Senator Isakson is a  tireless legislator. In particular, he is a dogged advocate for our  Nation's veterans. But he is even more than that. Johnny is universally  seen as one of the warmest, friendliest, most respectful, and most  collaborative Members of this body. He has strong views and solid  principles, but he knows that broad, often bipartisan cooperation is  the way to advance those very goals.                            ____________________     I hope that as the Senate tackles the important  matters before us in the weeks and months ahead, we will not only make  sure to savor our last few months working alongside this great friend  and colleague but also to embody his example in our work. Here is what  that work will need to include:   Right off the bat this week, the Senate will begin working through a  slate of nominations to important Federal offices. The American people  deserve to be governed by the government they voted for, and every time  we confirm another one of the uncontroversial, amply qualified public  servants whom President Trump has selected for these executive branch  posts, we fulfill a constitutional responsibility and make manifest the  people's decision.   Of course, in the days and weeks ahead, another major duty before us  will be the appropriations process. Just like last year, under the  leadership of Chairman Shelby and Ranking Member Leahy, I am confident  we can make significant progress on regular appropriations this month  and then pass an interim continuing resolution to prevent any funding  lapse while that work continues.   Let me say that again. A major focus of the Senate this month will be  moving forward as many of the regular appropriations bills as possible  and then passing a temporary continuing resolution for the outstanding  parts of the government before the end of September.   We have the parameters in place, thanks to the bipartisan funding  agreement President Trump signed last month. Now it is time for the  rubber to meet the road and for the Senate to pass appropriations bills  this month.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, the postcloture time on the Craft nomination  expire at 11:50 a.m. on Tuesday, September 10; further, that if cloture  is invoked on the Darling nomination, the postcloture time expire at  2:15 p.m. and if either of these nominations are confirmed, the motions  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action; finally, that  notwithstanding rule XXII, following disposition of the Darling  nomination, the Senate vote on cloture motions for the Akard, Cabaniss,  and Byrne nominations.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, it is a distinct privilege to recognize  my friend, Henderson County Sheriff Ed Brady, who is celebrating 50  years of a remarkable law enforcement career. Throughout his  distinguished service, Ed has answered the call of duty and protected  Kentucky families and communities. I am proud to join his family,  colleagues, and friends in marking this golden anniversary.   Ed began his career in law enforcement as a dispatcher with the  Kentucky State Police. He joined the department while in college,  attending classes all day before working the dispatch's third shift  overnight. It certainly wasn't easy, but the experience showed Ed's  work ethic and steadfast commitment to the public's safety.   Although his father was a Kentucky State Police Trooper, Ed never  thought he would be one himself, but after a few years as a dispatcher,  he heard the calling to leave the office and enter the academy. As the  youngest member of his class--and for a time the youngest trooper in  Kentucky--Ed focused diligently on his training to get the experience  he needed to excel. For 22 years, Ed worked for the Kentucky State  Police, earning a reputation for his leadership and service.   Ed remembers his decision to leave the Kentucky State Police was  among the hardest of his entire life, but he was presented with an  offer too good to turn down. The City of Henderson, Ed's hometown,  asked him to lead their police force as its chief. Although it was a  major shift from his previous job, he was ready to hit the ground  running. In fact, he was sworn-in as the Henderson Chief of Police only  hours after turning in his State trooper badge.   As the new police chief, Ed knew he had to work to earn the trust of  both his law enforcement colleagues and the Henderson community. To  address the former, he invested a great deal of time into hearing from  his new officers and building relationships. To gain the respect of the  citizens of Henderson, Ed implemented community policing practices. He  and his officers went directly into previously underserved areas in a  coordinated effort with the city government. He organized more bicycle  and foot patrols and a committee focused on minority relations.   Looking back on his career, Ed called the transformation of this area  of Henderson his proudest accomplishment because, in his words, ``We  gave people back their neighborhood.''   After more than a decade and half as a successful chief, Ed was on  the lookout for a new challenge. He wanted to get back to his rural- policing roots and decided to run for Henderson County Sheriff. Since  his first election and for the last 12 years, he has done just that. As  Sheriff, Ed leads his deputies with distinction.   Over the years, I have worked with Ed on a number of projects in our  Commonwealth, including to deliver critical resources to bolster the  work of local law enforcement. It is an honor to call him a dear  friend. To celebrate his golden anniversary in law enforcement, Ed's  family and colleagues surprised him with an event in his honor. He  certainly deserves our recognition for his dedication to his community  and his years of leadership in Kentucky. I would also like to recognize  his wife Amy, an impressive public servant in her own right. As  Henderson County's jailer, Amy is the other half of this remarkable  team. I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in marking this wonderful  occasion and wishing Ed and Amy many more successful years to come.  [[Page S5354]]                                ____________________     Mr. President, I want to take a moment today to honor  Tony Reck, who recently marked 50 years of excellence in the railway  industry. He has been a friend and a leader in western Kentucky for  many years, and I would like to join his family, friends, and  colleagues in celebrating Tony's great success.   Interestingly enough, Tony never planned to enter the railroad  business at all. He studied aviation and joined the Air National Guard,  expecting to spend his career in the skies. Instead, Tony's half- century career in the railroad industry began as a summer job at the  Illinois Central railroad after his first year of college. When he  returned to school, Tony kept working at the railroad, eventually going  to class all day and working at night. Clearly, Tony had developed an  unbeatable work ethic early on, and it has served him well throughout  his career.   Tony was selected to join the railroad's sales department based in  St. Louis, giving him the chance to travel throughout its service area.  It was that position in which Tony began overseeing the operations in  Kentucky.   Changes in Federal regulations also meant big changes for Tony. When  Jim Smith and David Reed purchased a Western Kentucky railway, they  named it the Paducah & Louisville Railway and asked Tony to help them  run the operation. Two years later, Tony was named the president of the  P&L Railway, and in 1995, he became chairman and CEO. According to P&L,  this full-service, 265-mile, regional railroad moves more than 21  million tons of freight each year and supports hundreds of good jobs in  western Kentucky.   Tapping into Paducah's geography as the inland waterways capital of  the world, the railway coordinates with barge operators to expand its  reach even further. Shipping many important products, including coal,  P&L also connects to five of the largest railroads in the country.  Tony's long career managing these complex logistics has earned him a  top-notch reputation both in the industry and the local community.   Tony's experience and leadership continue to serve western Kentucky  well, and I am proud to help him celebrate this milestone  accomplishment. I wish him and his wife Farideh many more happy years  as they continue to help make Paducah a great place to live and work. I  urge my Senate colleagues to join me in marking 50 years of Tony's  remarkable career in the railway industry.                            ____________________     Mr. President, recently my home State of Kentucky had  the opportunity to celebrate the 103rd birthday of a truly remarkable  individual. Brigadier General Ron Van Stockum marked the occasion by  sharing his lifetime full of rich memories in Shelbyville's ``Sentinel- News.'' I would like to take a moment today to pay tribute to my friend  and join Ron's admirers across Kentucky in thanking him for his  service.   Ron was born in England in the midst of the First World War. His  father, a sergeant in the British forces, was tragically killed in the  Battle of the Somme a week before the birth of his son. While her heart  may have been broken, Ron's mother Florence felt determined to continue  serving their Nation in uniform. Before his second birthday, Florence  placed Ron in the care of their relatives and joined the Women's Royal  Air Force.   Through her service in the war effort, Florence first met Anton Van  Stockum, an immigrant to the United States who volunteered to serve his  adoptive homeland in the U.S. Army Air Corps. Florence and Anton  quickly developed an affection for one another, sharing a letter- writing correspondence that lasted beyond the war's conclusion.   Returning home, Anton settled in Seattle, WA, and worked at a lumber  mill. Florence decided to travel with Ron, now nearly four, to visit  her pen pal. It was a journey that would forever change their lives and  set Ron on a previously unimagined path.   After traveling thousands of miles, Florence and Ron finally reunited  with Anton in British Columbia. They married and settled in the United  States to start a new family. Interestingly, no record was made of  Ron's entry into our country. That oversight would prove challenging in  the coming years when Ron, like his father, mother, and stepfather  before him, chose to serve in uniform.   While studying at the University of Washington, Ron sought to enter  the Advanced Reserve Officers' Training Corps. It would be his first  step in a distinguished career of service. Without an official proof of  citizenship, however, he almost wasn't allowed in at all. Ron and his  family were forced to gather multiple testimonials documenting his life  in the United States and attesting to his story. He was permitted to  join the ROTC and was later commissioned as a second lieutenant in the  U.S. Marine Corps. The experience led Ron to value the high honor of  calling himself an American.   For the next three decades, Ron honorably served as a marine. During  World War II, he was part of the amphibious assaults in the Pacific.  Ron also served at sea with the Navy aboard a battleship and an  aircraft carrier. Because of his diligent service and remarkable merit,  he eventually achieved the rank of brigadier general.   When Ron retired from active duty, he and his wife Susanne moved to  her family's historic farm in Shelby County, KY. Since 1970, our  Commonwealth has been made better because of Ron's many contributions  to the State. Here, he began his second career in education. Spending  11 years at my alma mater, the University of Louisville, Ron served as  the assistant dean for administration at the school of medicine and  later as the assistant to the president of Uof L.   In 1981, Ron began what he calls his second retirement, but his  friends knew there was no chance he would slow down. Since then, he has  written six books chronicling the history of our Commonwealth and his  own family lineage. He has also taken to writing for the ``Sentinel- News,'' and he has published more than 250 columns on a wide variety of  interests.   Over the years, it is been a privilege to call this great American a  dear friend, and I've enjoyed reading his reflections. As he celebrates  his 103rd birthday, I share my sincere congratulations and best wishes.  We are so proud of his contributions to our Commonwealth and his  service to this Nation. I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in  wishing a happy birthday and many future successes to Brigadier General  Ron Van Stockum.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of H. Con. Res. 57, which was  received from the House.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  concurrent resolution be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  September 10; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, morning business be closed, and the Senate proceed to  executive session and resume consideration of the Craft nomination  under the previous order. Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate recess following the cloture vote on the Darling nomination  until 2:15 p.m. to allow for the weekly conference meetings.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order, following the remarks of Senator Gardner.
