 Crying, vomiting, and 8 months pregnant, the young  woman walked for an hour in labor pains in search of an ambulance. She  was 23 years old.   Her journey did not end with that. She finally got to a place where  she found a taxi. She had to convince this taxi driver in the midst of  confusion, desperation, lack of food, to take her--12 hours in labor-- to a place where she could deliver her baby.   That is the plight of almost 650,000 women in Pakistan, where the  flood waters are monstrosities that you would not imagine.   In visiting Pakistan over the last 10 days with the Congressional  Pakistan Caucus, I could see water as far as the eye could see. The  devastation is overwhelming: 33 million people displaced, more than  600,000 homeless, but more than that, hungry.   I continue to thank the Biden administration for its initial support  of the U.N. fund of $30 million and the additional funding of $20  million. After our briefing in Islamabad and working with the  administration, the United States military joined in in delivering  300,000 tents.   To my colleagues, more is needed. I will be introducing legislation  that reflects the delegation's work and, as well, their efforts; and  that is, we need additional funding for these devastating conditions.   We have to realize, as I visited the people in Dadu, children are  without schools, pregnant women are without medical care, and as I  indicated, more and more women will be giving birth over the next 6  weeks. This can turn into a medical crisis.   The water is not moving, primarily because this water is without a  place to drain. There are no drainage facilities, if you will, in that  area. So we will also have water-borne diseases, like hepatitis, dengue  fever, malaria.   The people of Pakistan need our help. The Pakistani Americans have  risen to their call. So many in my Congressional district are providing  and offering to help send medical care, if you will. Doctors are  leaving various places in America to head in that direction. But it is  very important for the United States Congress to go on record in  recognizing the devastation that the people are facing every single  day.   Would you imagine, even in the trials and tribulations that we have  in the United States, that you have populations of people who are  isolated by dirty water and that there are people who are living in the  outlying areas with no shelter whatsoever. The people are hungry, the  lack of food is rising. The pregnant women are fearful for the  unbelievable challenges they have in giving birth.   Madam Speaker, I am calling upon Congress, as I introduce this  legislation dealing with the devastation of the floods in Pakistan, to  join me in supporting the legislation and, as well, recognizing the  dire conditions that our friends in Pakistan are having.   Our final point is to be reminded that Pakistan has been a friend and  has helped us in the evacuation of Afghan refugees; helped us in the  war on terror, where they lost Pakistani military in the war on terror.  And, of course, the huge and very engaging Pakistani diaspora,  Pakistani Americans who are both respected and, of course, energized to  be collaborative with their government here in the United States to try  to save the lives of babies and children, women and men, people who are  sick, who need kidney transplants, who can't get their medicine, it is  imperative that we rise up to this occasion.   Let me thank the members of the Pakistan Caucus who joined us, Mr.  Suozzi and Mr. Green. We are grateful for all of our members who have  been so energetic in advocating for strong Pakistan-U.S. relations.   I also recognize the USAID, the embassy staff, and of course, the  President and Prime Minister, and other leaders of government who  opened their doors in the midst of this crisis for us to be briefed and  to see the ongoing devastation that is going on there.   Madam Speaker, I will come back to the floor again because I am in  fear of the devastation of pregnant women being stranded in places  around that region who cannot be reached.  [[Page H7788]]    This 23-year-old traveled 12 hours, out of her mind, if you will, to  get to a place.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I thank the distinguished gentlewoman for  her work as chairwoman of the Committee on Oversight and Reform. Again,  I give her my deepest appreciation for the enormous legacy of  leadership that she has given to issues of empowerment, civil rights,  civil liberties, and the rights of women. I thank Chairwoman Maloney.   I rise today to support the underlying bill, H.R. 2988, and address  my amendment, of which I am very grateful has been included in the en  bloc.   It does make a difference. Whistleblowers can help change governments  for the best. They are part of the constitutional infrastructure of  ensuring due process and the rights of the vulnerable.   My amendment reinforces the spirit of confidentiality by providing  another way to communicate whistleblower information to an OIG that  poses less risk of confidentiality being lost or being breached while  not affecting existing mechanisms, especially in some cases when there  is a concern about the threat of retaliation. A potential whistleblower  might be unwilling to provide information for fear of consequences if  their identity is disclosed.  [[Page H7832]]    I am very glad to say that the Government Accountability Project is  supporting my amendment. They wrote in their letter of support for my  amendment: ``This is solid, commonsense legislation to restore what  works if we let it. For many whistleblowers, the decisive factor  whether they bear witness or remain silent observers is whether they  will remain anonymous.''   ``It will increase the flow of evidence and prevent retaliation.''   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record the Government Accountability  Project letter dated September 13, 2022.                               Government Accountability Project,                                 Washington, DC, September 13, 2022.      Hon. Sheila Jackson Lee,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Lee: This letter is to express support       and appreciation for your amendment to the Whistleblower       Protection Improvement Act that would upgrade the safety of       channels for anonymous whistleblowing disclosures to Offices       of Inspector General. The amendment would require OIG's to       restore traditional, effective channels to share evidence       that had been canceled for more convenient but unreliable       high tech options such as the internet or telephones. In       addition to those channels, agencies would have to restore       services such as secure drop boxes and accept anonymous       disclosures by mail.        This is solid, common-sense legislation to restore what       works if we let it. For many whistleblowers, the decisive       factor whether they bear witness or remain silent observers       is whether they will remain anonymous. Unfortunately, many       understandably do not trust OIG confidentiality safeguards,       because OIG's routinely breach them with impunity. While       nearly all lG's have anonymous hotlines or phone channels,       those engaging in surveillance often are one step ahead with       tactics that expose the witness. This is an instance where       the old-fashioned way is the safest. But at too many agencies       it no longer is available, as risky high-tech options now       monopolize the disclosure channel.        The bottom line is that sometimes tried and true approaches       can work best, even if less convenient. Your amendment would       apply that truth where it counts most--shielding the identify       of endangered whistleblowers. It will increase the flow of       evidence and prevent retaliation.            Appreciatively,                                                        Tom Devine,                                                    Legal Director.     Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to support the en  bloc, the underlying legislation, and the Jackson Lee amendment.   Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2988, the Whistleblower  Protection Improvement Act, and thank you for bringing this important  legislation to the floor today.   I applaud the Committee on Oversight and Reform for this timely and  purposeful bill. By strengthening whistleblower protections, H.R. 2988  would enhance the capabilities of the Offices of Inspector General at  each government agency to improve government accountability and  transparency.   Whistleblowers are uniquely positioned to know of actions that  derogate from laws, regulations, stated government objectives, and the  best interests of the American people.   As a matter of public policy, potential whistleblowers should be  encouraged to come forth with information that improves our  government's operations, efficiency, and effectiveness.   To incentivize such noble conduct, whistleblowers must be assured of  protection and insulated from retaliation for the accountability they  facilitate when an OIG pursues their leads.   Indeed, being a whistleblower is an act of patriotism--helping our  government serve Americans more responsibly--and those who provide this  service should be honored, not vilified.   I would also like to thank the Rules Committee for making my  amendment in order, and the Committee on Oversight and Reform for  including it in the En Bloc amendment.   My amendment adds a key mechanism to amplify the operational impact  of the bill, and it is supported by the Government Accountability  Project.   H.R. 2988 addresses very important aspects of the handling of  whistleblower complaints, whistleblower rights against any retaliatory  action, and vital protections to avoid disclosures of identity,  breaches of confidentiality, and retaliation.   My amendment reinforces the spirit of confidentiality by providing  another way to communicate whistleblower information to an OIG that  poses less risk of confidentiality being breached, while not affecting  existing mechanisms.   In some cases--especially when there is concern about a threat of  retaliation--a potential whistleblower might be unwilling to provide  information for fear of consequences if their identity is disclosed.   To encourage whistleblowers to share information in these situations,  my amendment directs the Office of Inspector General in each agency to  establish a mechanism to receive whistleblower information that is  completely anonymous and assured of remaining anonymous.   By being able to submit information in a way that anonymity is  assured, some potential whistleblowers who might otherwise not be  willing to share information with the OIG may be willing to do so.   As the Government Accountability Project wrote in their letter of  support for my amendment, ``This is solid, common-sense legislation to  restore what works if we let it. For many whistleblowers, the decisive  factor whether they bear witness or remain silent observers is whether  they will remain anonymous. . . . It will increase the flow of evidence  and prevent retaliation.''   The anonymous method could be by sending a letter through the mail,  dropping a paper note into a receptacle, or some other mechanism  devised by the OIGs that cannot be traced back to the whistleblower.   These approaches assure anonymity, unlike submission through a  website or phone call, which could be traced back to the person  submitting the information.   By submitting facts with full anonymity, a whistleblower does not run  the risk of their identity being disclosed either accidentally, by  court order, or by other means.   Ideally, an OIG may prefer to know the identity of the person  providing insights so they can contact them for more details.   Yet, since some people with vital information may refuse to submit it  due to the risk of exposure, the public interest in receiving useful  insights from an anonymous source outweighs an OIG's interest in  contacting them.   With the information that it receives, the OIG could pursue facts and  elevate its investigation through other channels.   My amendment would create a channel for this to occur.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R. 8326,  the Ensuring a Fair and Accurate Census Act, and thank you for bringing  this vital legislation to the floor today.   I applaud the Committee on Oversight and Reform for this necessary  and thoughtful bill. By establishing structural and functional  standards, H.R. 8326 would insulate the Census Bureau from the type of  tactics and abuse it encountered in the few years preceding the 2020  decennial census count.   Among its key provisions are the statutory codification of the  Director's and Deputy Director's roles. Doing so would improve the  Census Bureau's operational effectiveness, accountability, and  transparency.   Specifying their duties also provides the opportunity to establish  responsibilities that will enhance the work product of the Census by  improving the fair and accurate counting of all Americans.   In that context, I offered an amendment to H.R. 8326, and I would  like to thank the Rules Committee for making my amendment in order, and  the Committee on Oversight and Reform for including it in the En Bloc  amendment.   By reforming the operations of the Census Bureau, this bill enables  us to ensure that racial and ethnic equity in the decennial count will  be a priority in future decennial counts.   My amendment would enhance the bill's operational impact.   It would specify that the deputy director appoint an official with  responsibility to optimize racial and ethnic equity in the Census  count. To ensure that equity be a priority, this official would report  directly to the director and deputy director.   My amendment directs the equity official to engage and collaborate  with organizations that have influence with racial and ethnic groups,  develop strategies and tactics to maximize participation of these  populations, and rectify the undercount that has been typical of recent  Census counts, especially among immigrants and homeless people.   The status of the efforts to optimize racial and ethnic equity will  also be included in the Census Bureau's biannual reports to Congress,  to ensure accountability and bolster the likelihood of progress.   Optimization of racial and ethnic equity in the Census count requires  designation of a high-ranking official with direct responsibility for  achieving this goal and reports directly to the Census leadership.   My amendment establishes that function, makes racial and ethnic  equity in the decennial count a priority, specifies key strategies that  must be undertaken, and ensures that Congress receives regular reports  about the progress toward the goal.   H.R. 8326 is an excellent bill with vital reforms that are aptly  augmented by my amendment's use of this opportunity to, at the same  time, advance equity in the Census count.   In light of the decennial count's extremely consequential impact in  terms of funding allocation formulas, political district apportionment,  and other uses, it is imperative that the Census Bureau elevate racial  and ethnic equity to a top priority in its counting strategies and  procedures.   My amendment would create a framework for achieving this objective.
