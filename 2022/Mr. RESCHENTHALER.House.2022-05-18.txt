 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman  from New York for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield  myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the rule before us today provides for consideration of  three pieces of legislation, including H.R. 350, which my colleagues  claim will prevent incidents of domestic terrorism. But let's make no  mistake, Republicans are committed to fighting hatred and violence in  all forms.   Unfortunately, H.R. 350 does absolutely nothing to actually make our  communities safer. Rather, this legislation expands the Federal  bureaucracy. It ignores new and evolving domestic terrorist threats,  and it makes it more difficult for law enforcement to recruit and  retain qualified candidates.   Alarmingly, it empowers Biden's DOJ to continue labeling American  parents and other political opponents as threats to stifle their First  Amendment rights.   The rule before us today also provides for consideration of H.R.  7688, the Democrats' attempt to distract and shift blame for President  Biden's self-inflicted energy crisis. Since his first day in office,  President Biden has waged an unrelenting war on American energy  producers. From canceling the Keystone XL pipeline to suspending oil  and gas leasing on Federal lands, President Biden's radical Green New  Deal policies have discouraged and denied development of American  energy resources and the American energy sector.   Yet, at the same time that Joe Biden has done all this, he absolutely  refuses to take any accountability for the soaring gas prices and the  economic pain he continues to inflict on hardworking American families.   First, the President tried to blame Putin, despite the fact that gas  prices had risen more than 50 percent during his first year in office.  A quick history lesson: That is 1 year before Russia ever invaded  Ukraine. In fact, gas prices have increased every single month of this  Presidency.   Now, the President is blaming hardworking oil and gas producers in  places like Pennsylvania and across the country, accusing them of price  gouging, even though multiple FTC investigations have repeatedly  concluded supply and demand is the ultimate driver of these rising  prices and, by the way, an artificial decrease in supply thanks to  these radical policies.   H.R. 7688 will impose a socialist price-fixing scheme on oil and gas,  leading to even less production, which will hit small businesses and  American families the hardest.   Now, I wasn't alive in the 1970s, but I know there are a lot of  Members in this Chamber who were, and I am sure they can remember  waiting in line to fuel up their cars. If H.R. 7688 is signed into law,  that travesty will once again be a reality.   Finally, the rule before us makes in order H.R. 7790, the Infant  Formula Supplemental Appropriations Act. Under President Biden's  leadership, our Nation is facing an infant formula supply crisis, with  reports that more than 40 percent of formula is out of stock. Instead  of working with Republicans to redirect excess stocks of formula at  Federal agencies and force the FDA to develop a plan to address this  shortage, House Democrats simply want to throw money at the problem  with absolutely no plan, no guardrails to ensure that funding is spent  to actually put baby formula back on grocery store shelves.  [[Page H5129]]    Let me be clear. We are giving $28 million to the very same unelected  career bureaucrats who failed to address this crisis when it came to  their attention a year ago. It is absolute madness.   H.R. 7790 will do nothing, absolutely nothing, to alleviate Biden's  baby formula crisis, and it is American babies and American families  who will be forced to suffer the consequences.   Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss if I failed to mention that today's  rule also does not make in order a single Republican amendment, but I  guess I shouldn't be surprised. Republicans have attempted to work with  our Democratic colleagues to make our communities safer, to address  inflation and lower gas prices, and to help parents feed their babies.  But it is absolutely clear from today's rule and from their actions  over the last 3 years that House Democrats would rather continue their  partisan political theater than put forth real solutions to help real  Americans.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Oklahoma (Mrs. Bice), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I would be more than happy to answer the question that  my friend from Illinois posed.   The difference from 2 years ago and now is that the DOJ has started  going after concerned parents that are showing up at school board  meetings labeling them domestic terrorists.   The difference is that the Department of Homeland Security thinks it  is fitting to have a truth and disinformation board, like something  from an Orwellian novel. This is a different time.   Also, in the last 2 years, we had $2 billion of damage that was  caused by antifa. Yet, my colleagues across the aisle refuse to label  antifa a domestic terrorist organization.   Those are just a few of the things that have changed between now and  the last time we had this bill.   Now, my good friend from New York was talking about the oil and gas  industry. Let me just remind everybody that in 2020, the oil and gas  industry lost $76 billion.   There was talk about buybacks. Maybe we should consider why these  buybacks are occurring. Maybe it is because of investor shareholder  activism and this notion of ESGs that has something to do with it. And  by the way, that activism also dries up investment and capital into the  oil and gas industry.   But don't take my word for it, Dr. Jason Furman of Harvard  University--clearly no bastion of conservative thought--he actually was  an adviser to President Obama. Listen to what he said: ``When more  people want to buy things than companies are capable of making, prices  go up. That's just the law of supply and demand. Companies always want  to maximize their profits. I don't think they're doing it any more this  year than any other year.''   Again, that was Jason Furman, not exactly a conservative.   But while we are talking about all these issues, we are also failing  to talk about police week. It is National Police Week. Across our  Nation, police departments are struggling to recruit new officers, to  fill open positions. Some cities are facing shortages as high as 17  percent. At the same time, our Nation is in the midst of a crime crisis  with homicide rates up 48 percent compared with just 2 years ago.   The crime crisis is a direct result of President Biden and the  Democrats' efforts to demonize the police, to defund the police, and  also pushing for soft-on-crime policies.   House Republicans will always stand with our police. We will always  invest in our Nation's law enforcement, and we will always fight to  make our communities safer.   That is why, if we defeat this previous question, I will personally  offer an amendment to the rule to immediately consider the Communities  Deserve Cops Act.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment into the Record, along with any extraneous materials  immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Rutherford), a former sheriff, good friend, and the  author of this legislation, here to explain the amendment.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I just have to push back a little bit on my good  friend from New York because the facts just don't line up with his  argument, respectfully.   I will give you a great example. During the committee markup,  Representative Steube of Florida offered an amendment to strike  references to white supremacists and neo-Nazis, and insert neo-Nazis,  white supremacists, antifa, Black Lives Matter, and radicalized social  justice organizations.   So when the Democrats had the chance to actually include a whole slew  of domestic terror organizations, when they had the chance, that  amendment that Representative Steube offered, it failed on a party-line  vote with only one Republican joining the Democrats in voting ``no.''                                time  1515    While Democrats refused to put antifa, Black Lives Matter, and  radicalized social justice organizations into the definition of  ``domestic terrorism,'' they simultaneously believed that concerned  parents at school board meetings are the domestic terrorists. That is  the problem, and that is what has changed between 2 years and now.   I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Rice) to  talk more about the police. Again, it is Police Week, and we are doing  very little talking about the police.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I have a lot of respect for my good friend from New York, but, again,  facts don't care about friendships. If you look at the facts, and just  a quick history lesson, on September 29, 2021, the National School  Boards Association sent a letter to the Biden White House asking the  administration to treat parents as terrorists. Madam Speaker, 5 days  after that letter, which, again, asks Biden's DOJ to treat parents as  domestic terrorists, 5 days later, Attorney General Garland sent a memo  to the Director of the FBI, directing the FBI to work with each U.S.  attorney to convene meetings with Federal, local, and territorial  leaders within 30 days of the issuance of the memo and to open  dedicated lines of communication for threats reported at school board  meetings. Just a few weeks after that, they created a threat tag to be  used on parents.   Fast forward, during a markup in the Judiciary Committee, Judiciary  Republicans expressed concerns that H.R. 350 will codify what took  place last fall, treating parents as domestic terrorists.   To date, that memo has not been rescinded.   Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Morelle) to see if he supports the actions of the Attorney General, if  he supports the letter, and if he has anything to say in response.    Madam Speaker, reclaiming my time, the question  was simple. It is on the issue of the memoranda, whether or not my  colleague agreed that the FBI should treat parents as domestic  terrorists.   The letter has not been rescinded. It is still in place, and the  actions of the Attorney General and the DOJ are irrefutable. Again, I  point to the fact that that letter has still not been rescinded.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Mississippi  (Mr. Guest) to elaborate more on this matter.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Malliotakis), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to  the gentlewoman.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Herrera Beutler), my good friend and  fellow appropriator.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Roy), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers at this  time, and I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, for over 3 years, House Democrats have pushed for a  radical, far left agenda that does absolutely nothing to address the  serious issues facing American families. The legislation made in order  under today's rule is no exception to that.   H.R. 350 adds bureaucracy and adds red tape to existing law  enforcement resources, while completely ignoring new and evolving  terrorist threats.   H.R. 7688, this is the Democrats' socialist energy price-fixing  scheme that will actually lead to less energy production and further  exacerbate American families' pain at the pump.   Finally, H.R. 7790, does nothing--I repeat, nothing--to put more  formula on store shelves or hold Biden's FDA accountable for ignoring  this crisis despite knowing about it for the last year.   Madam Speaker, the American people deserve more than empty promises  and meaningless legislation, they deserve action.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous  question and ``no'' on the rule, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
