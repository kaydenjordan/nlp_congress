 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 6052, the  Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General Training Act  of 2021.   The bipartisan VA OIG training act, which I introduced with  Congressman   David McKinley of West Virginia last fall, is a critical  step to promote accountability at VA and ensure our veterans are  receiving the world-class care and benefits that they have earned.   This bill requires every current and future VA employee to  participate in the VA's OIG training, which will ensure that staff are  prepared to report fraud, waste, and patient abuse, and are aware of  protections for employees who report wrongdoings.   An assessment of initiatives carried out by VA's OIG found that every  dollar spent on oversight yielded a $21 return on investment. Ensuring  the OIG can carry out its crucial oversight work will save taxpayer  dollars, while also improving care and ensuring that veterans receive  every dollar and benefit that they have earned.   My commonsense, bipartisan bill codifies OIG's training requirement,  which strengthens the Department's Office of the Inspector General,  protects VA employees who report wrongdoing, and most importantly,  honors the service and sacrifices of our veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote  for the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General  Training Act today. I thank Chairman Takano and Ranking Member Bost for  their support to advance this legislation.   I also thank Representative McKinley for co-leading the bill with me  in the House, and Senators Hassan and Boozman for leading this  bipartisan bill in the Senate.
