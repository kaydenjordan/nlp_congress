 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Struthers Library Theatre in Warren, Pennsylvania, on its 135th  anniversary. It has been a community treasure since it opened in 1883.   In 1882, local citizen Thomas Struthers generously offered to erect a  building that would house a library. It included a public hall and  rental space where the profits would be used by the Library  Association.   The Struthers building would eventually become the center of the  town's cultural activity, and Thomas Struthers would long be remembered  as a visionary.   It has celebrated many milestones over the years:   In 1919, the new Library Theatre opened, after a complete gutting and  remodeling of the auditorium, with a popular Broadway play.   In 1983, the Library Theatre celebrated an extensive renovation and  its 100th birthday with a gala reopening featuring various performances  throughout the night.   In 1984, the Library Room was restored to its original splendor and  outfitted for special events and gatherings.   Mr. Speaker, the Struthers Library Theatre continues to be a cultural  gem in Warren that is enjoyed by all. It maintains the fantastic legacy  of its founder, Thomas Struthers, who would certainly be so proud  today.                            ____________________
