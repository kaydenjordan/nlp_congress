 Mr. Speaker, yesterday was big cats. Today it is big  cannabis. When is it time for real COVID relief? When is it time for us  to help our constituents, our small businesses, our struggling and  exhausted frontline workers, and teachers?   To legalize marijuana or not is one thing; to pass a bill that has no  recourse for States that don't want mass legalization, which totals 35  states, is irresponsible. To not limit or regulate potency is  carelessness. To not do anything to regulate advertising, which proved  to be an issue with vaping when the industry targeted kids and teens,  is negligent. To not provide funding for the FDA or USDA to manage the  regulatory framework is reckless.   Take marijuana out of the scenario. None of us would support a  reckless, negligent, careless, and irresponsible bill.   This flawed legislation is not time sensitive, does not require  consideration this week, and should not take priority over the very  serious and real issues facing our country.   There are real external threats facing our Nation. We should focus on  strengthening America and not weakening it. There is a lot to be done  before the end of the year, and Congress must be focused on rebuilding  our economy and restoring our way of life.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill.
