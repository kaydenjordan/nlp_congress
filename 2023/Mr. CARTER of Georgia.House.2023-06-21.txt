 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  Dick James of St. Simon's Island on his induction into the Ranger Hall  of Fame.   Mr. James served in the Army for 22 years, including two tours of  duty in Vietnam and retiring as a Lieutenant Colonel.   In his first tour, he acted as an adviser for a Vietnamese battalion  with 750 soldiers. This battalion suffered a high casualty rate, with  two-thirds being lost in the 9\1/2\ months he served with them. He  later returned to Vietnam as the commander of the 75th Ranger Regiment,  173rd Airborne Brigade, where he fearlessly led his Rangers in 450  missions, with 229 of them being fights with enemy troops.   Mr. James has been the rightful recipient of many awards, including  four Bronze Star medals, a Vietnam Service Medal, Superior Service  Medal, and a National Defense Service Medal, among many others.   I thank Mr. James for his service and congratulate him for his  induction into the Ranger Hall of Fame. His extraordinary dedication to  his country and his fellow Rangers makes him the perfect addition.               Honoring the Life and Legacy of Starling Sutton     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  and the legacy of Mr. Starling Sutton, a dedicated servant to his  country and a community activist.   During the Vietnam war, Starling cross-trained in four different  areas, airborne, special forces medic, combat engineer, and infantry  officer.   His work in the Army's 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg led him  to pursue a degree in criminal justice, which he then applied to  professional and volunteer efforts devoted to helping homeless and  marginalized people.   Mr. Sutton created two programs for the Atlanta Rotary Club to help  inner-city youth learn about the camaraderie of the military, and his  work with the Golden Isles Rotary helped homeless veterans find homes.   Professionally, he helped create affordable housing in Atlanta and  converted two major warehouses into public art spaces.   Starling's service to our country and his impact on our State will  continue to be felt for years to come, and we mourn his loss immensely.            Congratulating Glynn Academy Boys and Girls Golf Teams     Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  the Glynn Academy boys and girls golf teams on their recent 6A State  Championship wins.   Both teams took a big lead on day one, and they never looked back.  After day one, they had to fight through harsh weather conditions that  plagued the rest of the tournament, but even that could not derail  their efforts.   The Glynn Academy boys shot an impressive score of 591 overall to  secure their first win since 2001. The Glynn Academy girls finished  with a score of 480 to win their second championship in a row.   These impressive scores, and the fact that this is the second  championship in a row for the girls, speaks volumes. These young adults  are true athletes, and I am inspired by their amazing performance on  the golf course.   I look forward to seeing what these great teams do in the coming  season, and I know they will continue to make the First District of  Georgia proud.         Honoring the Life of Lieutenant Colonel George Allen Tindle     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of retired  Lieutenant Colonel George Allen Tindle of the U.S. Army National Guard.   Mr. Tindle was born in Chicago, Illinois, on September 12, 1941. He  was a proud member of the Chicago Police Department for 10 years, until  he transferred to the Federal Protective Service in 1974, right here in  Washington, D.C.   George began his career at the Federal Law Enforcement Training  Center in Glynco, Georgia, in 1986. He was the Director of Management  Training for U.S. Customs until his retirement in 1999. After his  retirement, George began his favorite career as an instructor in the  Behavioral Sciences Division.   George was an avid fan of the Frederica Academy football team and a  beloved member of the Community Church on St. Simons Island.   George was an animal lover with a quick wit and a compassionate  heart.   George Tindle passed away on April 3, 2023, at the age of 81 in  Brunswick, Georgia. He is survived by a son, a nephew, and nieces,  along with the legacy he left behind in the Brunswick community.                            ____________________
