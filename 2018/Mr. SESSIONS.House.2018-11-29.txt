 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 1160 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 1160         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to take from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R. 88)       to modify the boundary of the Shiloh National Military Park       located in Tennessee and Mississippi, to establish Parker's       Crossroads Battlefield as an affiliated area of the National       Park System, and for other purposes, with the Senate       amendment thereto, and to consider in the House, without       intervention of any point of order, a motion offered by the       chair of the Committee on Ways and Means or his designee that       the House concur in the Senate amendment with an amendment       consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115-85       modified by the amendment printed in the report of the       Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution. The Senate       amendment and the motion shall be considered as read. The       motion shall be debatable for one hour equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Ways and Means. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the motion to its adoption without       intervening motion.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), the ranking member, pending which I yield myself such time  as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time  yielded is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this rule and  the underlying legislation. The rule provides for consideration of the  Senate amendment to H.R. 88, showing the text of the Retirement Savings  and Other Tax Relief Act of 2018 and the Taxpayer First Act of 2018.   This past December, Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the  interests of the American people. It was done around December 18, this  last year.   The legislation was a bold, pro-growth bill that helped overhaul our  Tax Code, and I believe it has unleashed the free enterprise system all  across this great Nation.   Mr. Speaker, this was done because 8 years of anemic economic growth  is what America had been working through. We had been working through  high taxes, high rules, high regulations that were taking American jobs  away from Americans and moving them elsewhere. It was limiting the  future of not only America, but also Americans: the newest Americans in  the job market, whether they be high school graduates, whether they be  college graduates, or whether they be those that entered and finished  professional school.   The bottom line, Mr. Speaker, is that for too long, for some 8 years,  we had had a circumstance where the American Dream for so many fathers  and mothers became to get their child out of the house after college,  and that became an American Dream if a job was possible.   No longer, as a result of this tax act, do we find America in that  sort of circumstance.   Today we find not only are there jobs aplenty, but the market is  rising, wages are being increased, and the opportunity for all  Americans is bright again. That is because Republicans and President  Trump worked together to pass not only a jobs and tax bill, but we had  a bill that would increase the amount of revenue that is flowing into  the United States coffers and Treasury right now.   Despite what is being told by many in the marketplace, that we are  simply running at a huge deficit, more money is coming into the  Treasury supporting not only America, but the American Dream, and more  people have money in their pockets.   So growth and competition have always been keys to an expanding  economy, more jobs, increased wages. And in my home city of Dallas,  Texas, and across the country, it is seen by people every single day.   Now, does that create new responsibilities and new issues? Yes, it  does. And I will tell you that we must be prepared as a Nation to  tackle those issues also.   But today, this legislation is about the person that goes to work.  This bill today is about the entrepreneur, the family, the small  business owner, the American people.   And also, as we will soon learn as we work through this debate,  people who were impacted by disaster, whether it be floods, typhoons,  tornados, fires, or other things that have occurred in this great  Nation, we are turning the attention to ask for people back home to  help and to help more, and we are going to do that through encouraging  them as a part of the Tax Code.   We are going to do much more. We are going to help the soldier and  the soldier's family. We are going to help the people who are those  that see tax cheats and tax fraud, and protect the whistleblower.   We are going to take what is 300 pages of a small bill that can  easily be read in a short period of time and understood, this is all  about, not helping any one person or persons, it is helping millions  across the country for an extension of their taxes and tax relief for  yet one more year.   This is simply a jump-start to make sure that the economy looks  forward, not backwards, does not look to one year, but looks to two in  the relief that we are going to have.   Mr. Speaker, the question is, how is it going in America today?   Well, the answer is we have the lowest number of people who are  searching for jobs and entering the jobless market to about the same  number since 1996.   The annual skyrocketing amount that we have of business investment,  of people who are taking jobs, people who are reinvesting in America is  at a high level.   This package today will build upon that, it will build upon the  successes that we are presently having and will make sure that we are  doing the right thing.   We know that America is still hurting. We know that not all of  America has recovered. As a matter of fact, we know that about 40  percent of Americans would not be able to cover an emergency expense of  $400 or more without having to take out a loan. We know that half of  American working age adults say they do not still have enough savings  to be prepared for their retirement.   That is why Republicans are here, once again at the end of the year,  to say we need to look at the aggregate, the whole country, and to make  sure that we are looking at the effects of a year. We are trying to  make sure that we continue making sure that the American family has a  chance with an opportunity, not just to save, but to be able to use the  Tax Code to their advantage.   Mr. Speaker, what this is about is continuing economic success,  economic development, the ability that we have to continue giving the  American worker, the American who is out of perhaps work, the newest  student, or someone who was deeply impacted by a natural disaster, or a  person who serves in the United States military, or for a person who  sees a tax fraud or tax cheat to have a fair and equal footing to  continue to call out those that take advantage of our system rather  than using it properly.    That is what this small bill is about. It is about trying to end the  year to give the American people the advantage that they need.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Yesterday, we had an opportunity in the Rules Committee to hear many  of the same words, words certainly of very kind and sincere remarks. I  appreciate the distinguished gentleman. He and I personally get along  very well and have enjoyed my time during the some, I guess, 18 years  or so that we have worked together in the Rules Committee.   But, Mr. Speaker, I also would say to you that there is kind of a  different story to be told, and the different story is the actual bill.  That is what we are going to focus on today.   I had a chance to read the bill--I actually read it--and there was a  conversation yesterday about that. I actually read it for comprehension  to understand what is in it rather than to read it with the viewpoint  of opposing it--actually, read it to learn more about it, to learn the  business behind a lot of work that had been taking place by the Ways  and Means Committee, a lot of work that had been public debate and  public discussion for a long time.   For instance, if we were to talk about those seniors who are required  to begin taking part of their IRA at 70\1/2\ and start spending down  that money that they have saved hard for over the years, government  coming and telling them how they are going to become less able to  support themselves by diminishing, taxing, using their IRA when they  may not want to, that is a policy discussion. That is not related to  millionaires and our GOP friends. That is related to some common sense  and some policy.   Perhaps, page 73, as an example, Mr. Speaker, disaster-related tax  relief, providing for people who were in hurricanes, tornadoes,  typhoons, and wildfires, it says here the Camp and Woolsey wildfire  disaster area. These were declared disasters that had become national  priorities, not only people from my home State of Texas, my home city  of Dallas going to help our neighbors to the west, but actually getting  this in legislation quickly to make sure that people who live there are  able to give more charitable deductions and get credit not just for  that, but doing the right thing.   Mr. Speaker, it goes on and on, treatment of payments to Guam and the  Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.   It is undeniable, as you read the bill, that you do this with an idea  of understanding, comprehension. This isn't about special interests.  This is about everybody who lived in these areas.   The deferral of people who are in the military, for reservists of the  armed services. For the American people, Mr. Speaker, and you, page 131  of the bill, this is what we are attempting to get across, that this is  for the American people.   Mr. Speaker, page 203, the IRS Free File Program, this is something  that came from lots of work with one of my colleagues, Lynn Jenkins.  Ms. Jenkins from Kansas, as a member of the Ways and Means Committee,  worked carefully for a long period of time with a large group of people  who were involved in this program.   We were able to upgrade not just tax law, but also to look at  retaliation when people see tax cheats, tax frauds. They were given on  page 238, Mr. Speaker, antiretaliation whistleblower protection for  employees who see this.   Mr. Speaker, I could keep going and might in a few minutes. That is  what this bill is about.   This bill is not as you have heard, but, as advertised, it is a year- end extension to make sure that the things during the year that needed  to be addressed are getting addressed.   I read for comprehension to find a good deal, and, Mr. Speaker, I  found one.   The Ways and Means Committee, our young chairman, Kevin Brady, his  membership, these hardworking people, this is done for the American  people. This is not done, as we have heard, for special interests, rich  people, or millionaires. It is done for the right reason.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I appreciate the feedback from the gentleman from Wisconsin, a very  dear and very good friend of mine, and I appreciate the differences  between our parties.   The differences between the philosophies of the parties and the  differences of the direction are apparent. But what is also apparent,  Mr. Speaker, is that what these dadgum Republicans did is working: more  money is coming into the Treasury; millions more people have a job.   The opportunity that happened--a result of the Tax Code changes--have  brought, at minimum, $50 billion back into America in less than about 9  months, money flowing back in, which is the reverse of what was  described in the nineties with that sucking sound of jobs leaving  America. It is now the rush of the beautiful breeze of jobs coming back  in, manufacturers not just in Wisconsin, but all through the Midwest,  down even as far as Dallas, Texas.   Mr. Speaker, there was one point where I held a meeting and a press  conference at a manufacturer, and that manufacturer said that this is  the most robust period of time he had had in the history of the company  and actually challenged the TV stations to say he was looking for 12  more workers. He found two the next day, people who called who were  looking for jobs.                                time  1600    Mr. Speaker, we are talking about things that work, not axioms of  these feel-good things: Oh, we can do better.   Well, for 8 years, they didn't do better. For 8 years, the philosophy  was tax, spend, regulate, overregulate, move jobs overseas, blame  somebody else for their problem.   That is not a winning hand. A winning hand is more people having  jobs. Today, the highest numbers of people ever are working in America.  The facts of the case are: more African Americans today work than ever,  more Hispanics, more women, more opportunity, better chances for you to  get a higher paying job, better opportunities.   Mr. Speaker, I wouldn't have to say too much, but these same policies  that they talk about here today are the same policies that you would  get out of the State of California that has 125,000 homeless people,  55,000 homeless people in Los Angeles. How can that be?   Well, it is easy to understand. The same policies that they want for  us in Washington are the same policies they  [[Page H9707]]  have in Los Angeles and in California. That is called overregulate,  overtax, and run them the heck out of town.   That is why there are so many unemployed people. That is why there  are 55,000 homeless people in Los Angeles. Friends of mine who visit  the beautiful, coveted city of San Francisco come back and tell the  story of heartbreaking demise of people living on the streets of San  Francisco, a drug-ridden, crime-ridden, despicable opportunity for  people to see a great city in despair, in ruin.   That is what you get when you raise taxes, when you don't give  opportunity, and when America fails to be able to look forward for the  best opportunity.   Mr. Speaker, I get what they want. They don't want this bill that  gives opportunity. They don't want the opportunity for people to have a  fighting chance, and then they will blame it on somebody else.   Mr. Speaker, we are going to stand behind this bill, and we are going  to pass it. I think there will be some Democrats who will vote for it.  We are going to be proud to have them.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the distinguished gentleman who will,  presumptively, be the new chairman of the Budget Committee.   I think what is interesting is, he said that Republicans promised  more investment. Yes, that happened. Republicans promised more jobs. He  said thousands. It is millions, Mr. Speaker, not thousands. We promised  millions more jobs. He then said we promised thousands.   Mr. Speaker, then he went to a very interesting perspective, and that  was: all companies really use this money just to buy back their own  stock. Mr. Speaker, investment in a company is great, and while that  might not be necessarily one of the greatest ways to do it, it buoyed  the stock market up 40 percent.   It buoyed the stock market up to where every senior, every person  that would have a stock market account, a savings account, a saving for  their future, saving for their children, it buoyed that opportunity  with value.   That is what we promised, and it worked, and they don't like that.  They don't like the success of the stock market. They don't like the  success, and so they act like it didn't even happen.   Mr. Speaker, the difference between thousands and millions is  literally a thousand times difference. I spoke about this earlier when  we were talking about this bill right here.   Oh, it is full of giveaways, they say, to millionaires and GOP fat  cats.  [[Page H9708]]    It is extenders. It is continuing the success. It is doing the right  thing. It is about people who had fire ravaging their homes and their  areas, not just the Republican houses. It was about helping members of  the military. It was about good policy from the Ways and Means  Committee that was equally known as bipartisan with the work that was  done there to make sure that we acknowledged tax cheats and let the  employees who saw that get a better footing.   There were lots of hearings, lots of information. But if you simply  read to have a jaundiced view of the world and to oppose it, as opposed  to reading for substance, I see how you could get it wrong, Mr.  Speaker. I see clearly how you could get it wrong if you don't read for  comprehension.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Once again, I will reiterate that this bill is about doing great  things for events that have happened in this country. I really can't  imagine that Members would want to simply take the things that the  leadership class of people from Mrs. Pelosi want to vote against-- disaster tax relief for people all across California, all across the  Mariana Islands, and all across the country--except just to say that I  do know that people in their party oppose the tax bill. I get that.   But there is more money coming in today than there was yesterday.  There are millions of more people who have a job today than yesterday.  I do know the numbers that were expressed are numbers that they want to  tout, but that is not the way it worked. That was what the CBO said.  But the reality of the circumstance is some 4 million people today have  a job who did not have one and had been looking.   Mr. Speaker, just a few years ago, the major newspapers and major  magazines across America said:         We are going to just have to get used to this is the way       the world is now--high unemployment, higher taxation.    Newsweek magazine had on its cover: ``Is America Really Turning  Socialist?''   The answer came back that the American people disagree with  unemployment. The American people disagree with high taxes. The  American people see what is happening in California, 55,000 homeless  people in Los Angeles. That is not an accident. That is policy in  action; 125,000 homeless people in California, that is not an accident,  that is policy directly from the Democratic Party that ran jobs out of  the State so that the average family there didn't have a job.   That is what they are pushing right here. We are not going to do  that. We are going to stand up and say: We read the bill. We read the  bill. That is what it is here for. That is why we can stand up and tout  this.   By the way, Mr. Speaker, when you are from Texas, if there is one  riot, all it takes is one Ranger.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Just one Ranger, Mr. Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining on my side?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I, of course, want to acknowledge and thank the distinguished  gentleman from Massachusetts. His time in the committee has been  forthright, honest, and straightforward. The opportunity that he has to  serve in the minority will be reflected with an opportunity for him to  serve in the majority.   I think the Rules Committee is also headed for a bright future with  an opportunity to fully vet ideas, the opportunity to talk, and to hear  dialogue. I must say I have been through a number of chairmen, several  at least, and I attempted to craft my own way for the committee.   I appreciate and respect the gentleman. I think it is also important  to state that it extended to his young wife and his daughter who  visited the committee several times. His wife, who, in a most genuine,  professional and straightforward spousal context, to my wife, Karen,  enjoyed a relationship and they found common interests, not only in  working with cancer, but Jim's wife sent me a gracious letter  acknowledging the work that I personally have done in cancer and in the  areas of the FDA and dealing with cancer research and trials. That  professionalism extended not just from Jim but to his young bride who  was most genuine in her remarks.   Mr. Speaker, the opportunity for us to close today is a chance to  reflect upon not just the ideas that we represent, but really our  commitment to the American people. The American people do deserve a  right to see a better process, and that I acknowledge. They have a  right to know that the forthrightness of a committee, whether they are  up at 2 in the morning or 8 in the morning because we had not completed  necessarily our work the night before, the Rules Committee did its  service. It did its service to this body on a bipartisan basis. It did  it from professional content of a professional staff, not only from the  minority that was led at the very top with Don Sisson, who did an  awesome job, but also Steve Cote, the staff director. It was a  relationship that has been successful for this body.   Mr. Speaker, I do want to say this, that just as the distinguished  gentleman from Massachusetts, the soon-to-be chairman--I assume  chairman of the Rules Committee--as he has asked his side to look at  and how they would vote, I would also ask you, Mr. Speaker, and the  team, which today is in the majority, to make sure they read this bill  with content orientation to the needs of the American people, to look  at the real successes as we walk outside today to see that the booming  economy that is taking place in America where people who did not have  jobs do; for those who have been on our TV sets and in our prayers  where some natural disaster has claimed them, whether it be through a  mistake or through necessarily Mother Nature, that we as America are  better when we work to solve problems together.                                time  1630    We are better in America when we believe there is no problem bigger  than a solution, where we in America want to put our best foot forward  and can work together.   Mr. Speaker, we are all better, all of us, than any one of us. My  party is better with the Democratic Party than without the Democratic  Party. My ideas are better to be vetted and even challenged. That way,  the American people have a chance to see not only the possibility and  probability, but also to vet the ideas that have made this Nation a  great nation for so many years.   While it is true my service to this body will be coming to a close  after 22 years, I would say to you, Mr. Speaker, that your service,  too, to this great Nation has made our country better.   For those who are on the floor today, I would thank the distinguished  gentleman from Texas. I would thank the distinguished gentleman from  Massachusetts. I would thank the distinguished gentleman from Florida,  one of my fraternity brothers, who has brought forth ideas on this for  other colleagues of Texas, like Mr. Green, who might be in attendance  today.   I would say that we have tried to make this work as evidence that the  [[Page H9710]]  American people can see, and I think they can see it today. Mr.  Speaker, I end my statement with a focus on this innovation and  entrepreneurship.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the  previous question on the resolution.   The previous question was ordered.
