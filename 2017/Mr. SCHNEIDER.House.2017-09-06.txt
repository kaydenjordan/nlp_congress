 Mr. Chairman, I rise today as a proud cosponsor of  this amendment.   This amendment is significant not only to our oceans, but to our  Great Lakes. The Great Lakes contain a fifth of the world's freshwater  and are a magnificent natural wonder. They are critical to our economy  and the quality of life in my district and in many States.   The National Ocean Policy helps protect the integrity of the Great  Lakes' ecosystem. However, this bill would undermine the National Ocean  Policy and the ability of agencies to coordinate with States, local  governments, and other agencies to protect these beautiful waters.   If we are to sustain our national, ecological, and environmental  health, and its natural beauty and precious resources, we must protect  the National Ocean Policy. That is why I support this amendment, and I  urge my colleagues to do the same.
