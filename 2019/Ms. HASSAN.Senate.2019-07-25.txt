 Mr. President, I am proud to recognize Caroline  Dillon of Rochester, NH, as July's Granite Stater of the Month for her  work ensuring that every public high school and middle school in New  Hampshire provides free feminine hygiene products to students who  cannot afford them.   When Caroline first learned about ``period poverty'' in her high  school's U.S. history class, she was shocked by the magnitude of this  crisis. Period poverty occurs when someone does not have the means to  afford basic feminine hygiene products. Caroline knew many of her  classmates were on the reduced or free lunch program, and it did not  take long for her to connect the dots and realize that some of her  classmates were struggling with this problem every month.   Caroline turned her concern into political action. She took her  history teacher's advice, who told Caroline's class that, if they ever  had a problem with how things were run in the State, they should reach  out to an elected official. She reached out to State Senator Martha  Hennessey, an outspoken advocate for women's health and education.   Caroline, who at the time was not old enough to vote, worked with  Senator Hennessey to draft the bill and to gain support for their  legislation in the New Hampshire State House and among interest groups.  Their argument was simple: If students do not need to bring essentials  like toilet paper to school, why should they need to bring their own  feminine hygiene products, which are just as essential?   Thanks to Caroline's efforts, the New Hampshire Governor last week  signed into law a bill that mandates that every high school and middle  school in the Granite State provide free feminine hygiene products in  their female and gender-neutral bathrooms.   I want to thank Caroline once more for her work to help reduce the  stigma around periods and to provide essential feminine hygiene  products for those in need. I want to congratulate her as well for  demonstrating how powerful individual compassion and advocacy can be in  our democracy.                            ____________________
