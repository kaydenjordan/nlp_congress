 Mr. Speaker, I express my gratitude and thanks to my  colleague and good friend, Trent Franks, for yielding and for his  leadership and tireless work on behalf of the unborn.   Congressman Franks' fight to save each and every life is one that we  should all be championing, and I am proud and pleased to be standing by  his side today. I am grateful that I have had the opportunity to fight  for the unborn in venues around the world at various multilateral  institutions standing on behalf of the unborn.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a proud cosponsor in support of H.R. 36,  the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. If signed into law, this  legislation will prohibit abortions starting at 20 weeks, almost 5  months, in all 50 States.   The pro-abortion lobby will tell you to disregard the rights of  unborn children, but science shows that they are just as human as you  and I. In fact, emerging science has proven that babies feel pain  inside the womb as early as 20 weeks old.   In cases of fetal surgeries occurring after the 20-week mark,  anesthesia is regularly administered to the fetus to protect against  fetal pain. Doctors have also experienced babies born prematurely at or  near 20 weeks who experience pain in the same way that a full-term baby  or an adult would.   It is inhumane to subject these innocent beings to that gruesome  practice of abortion, knowing full well that they will feel every  painful moment.                                time  2000    Mr. Speaker, I think about my own children and how excited my wife  and I were throughout her pregnancies. Even without today's developed  science, we knew that our children were special, that they were alive,  that they were helpless, and that we had the responsibility for their  safety and well-being in the womb. We never would have intentionally  caused pain or harm to any of our unborn children.   But by allowing this practice to continue, we are not only torturing  these helpless babies who will be dismembered limb by limb, we are also  ending their lives. They will never realize their God-given potential  on this Earth. They will never be mothers, wives, husbands, and  fathers. They will never be siblings. They will never be able to  fulfill the measure of their creation. Their last memory will be filled  with great agony and distress.  [[Page H7658]]    Mr. Speaker, there is nothing that we do in Congress that will have  efficacy if we choose to fail to protect the most innocent among us.  If, at the very least, we cannot defend those who feel pain, then we  are unworthy to lead this Nation.   We have a great responsibility and charge to protect these children,  and we will not fail them. Please vote ``yes'' tomorrow.
