 Will the Senator from Ohio yield for a question?    Will the Senator from Ohio yield for a question?    Will the Senator from Ohio yield for a question?    As to the issue on economic growth, I have been coming  down to the floor in my relatively short time here and talking about  growth, growth, growth, growth. I have not in 3 years--3 years--heard  my colleagues on the other side of the aisle say that economic growth  of 1.5 percent for almost 10 years is good for the country, good for  workers in Ohio.   Mr. BROWN addressed the Chair.    Here is my question.    Here is my question.    Here is my question.    Here is my question. Will the Senator yield for a  question?    Here is the question.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.    Do you believe that the new normal is 1.5 percent, like  CBO, like the Obama administration said--GDP growth of 1.5 percent for  the entire future? Is that what you believe?    If you don't, how do we get that faster growth?    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in  order for Senator Nelson and Senator Baldwin or their designee to each  offer a motion to commit, which are at the desk, and that no amendments  to the  [[Page S7548]]  instructions be in order. I further ask consent that following leader  remarks on Friday, December 1, there be up to 20 minutes of debate on  each motion, equally divided in the usual form, and that following the  use or yielding back of that time, the Senate vote on the motions with  no intervening action or debate.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.                               Motion to Commit     Mr. President, I want to compliment my good friend from  South Carolina who came down here and talked about what this is all  about. I couldn't agree with him more. This is about families. This is  about American families. He has these poster boards up there showing  the American people what this is about. I want to reiterate a couple of  points he mentioned.   First, the most important thing we are doing here, the bulk of the  relief we are providing in this tax bill is to provide middle-class  families with more take-home pay, more money in the pockets of American  citizens. That is what Senator Scott just talked about, and I couldn't  agree more.   So, on average, right now, our bill would bring the average American  middle-class family about a $200 additional amount of money in their  pocket per month--per month. Now, some people watching that might think  it may not seem like a lot, but it is over $2,000 per year. Every tax  bracket that we have right now in the Senate bill would get a  reduction.   So I want to echo the words of my good friend from South Carolina. It  is confounding to me that our friends and colleagues on the other side  of the aisle would deny hard-working Americans that extra money in  their pockets. You don't hear them say that, but that is what they are  doing, and they would spin and twist the facts to make the public  believe the middle class is actually getting a tax increase. The public  is getting spun by them.   This would be a tax cut for these families, a significant amount.  That is a plain fact.   What is so puzzling about this debate is that those who oppose this  bill is trying to deny the Americans who need it--we need it--extra  money in their pockets, particularly right now.   I want to talk a little bit about an article I read last year in the  Atlantic magazine. It still haunts me. The article was titled ``The  Secret Shame of the Middle Class.'' Here is a copy of it, ``The Secret  Shame of the Middle Class.'' It says: ``Nearly half of all Americans  would have trouble finding $400 in a crisis.''   You often talk about families. Forty-seven percent of American  families, according to one Federal study, wouldn't be able to come up  with $400 in case of  [[Page S7549]]  an emergency. This is truly the definition of living paycheck to  paycheck. The bill that we are debating helps to address this  significantly--more money in the pockets of American middle-class  families.    Let me quote from this article. The author says:         It was happening to the soon-to-retire as well as the soon-      to-begin. It was happening to college grads as well as high       school dropouts. It was happening all across the country,       including places where you might least expect to see such       problems. I knew that I wouldn't have $400 in an emergency.    That is the author.         What I hadn't known, couldn't have conceived, was that so       many other Americans wouldn't have that kind of money       available to them, either. My friend and local butcher,       Brian, who is one of the only men I know who talks openly       about his financial struggles, once told me, ``if anyone says       he's sailing through, he's lying.''    That is from this article.   These are our constituents he is writing about. These are the people  whom we see when we go home. These are American citizens who need this  kind of relief. They tell us they are struggling. They tell us they  felt left out of the system and that nobody is listening.   This bill is listening. It is about listening to them. It is about  giving them a voice through more economic security.   The other thing this bill does--the other thing that is so important  to do in this Congress and the other thing that we should have no  issues with bipartisan support for what this bill does--is finally  getting our economy back to traditional levels of economic growth-- growing our economy, which has been stagnant for well over a decade.   The next chart I have is one that I have come to the floor and spoken  about many times. It is an important chart. It shows the levels of  economic growth that have occurred year after year in the United States  since the Eisenhower administration. It shows GDP growth. Let me  explain it a little bit.   It starts with Eisenhower, and then goes to Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon,  Carter, Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Bush 43, and President Obama. These are  the numbers. The green is growth. We have a couple of years of 8, 6, 7  percent growth. But the line I want people to take a look at is this 3  percent GDP growth line--3 percent. Now, that is not a great growth  rate. It is not a bad growth rate. The average since World War II is  closer to 4 percent, but 3 percent is pretty good.   When we look at this chart, and we think about what we are trying to  do on the floor here today, it tells a really important story. It is 3  percent every year. Reagan, Bush, Clinton are 4, 5, and 6, and then we  get to the Obama years. Actually, we get to the last 10 years we have  had, and we never hit it. We had the Bush great recession, and in the  entire 8 years of President Obama, we never hit it.   Now, GDP sounds like some kind of technical economic term, but it is  really a proxy for the health of our economy. It is a proxy for the  American dream. It is a proxy for hope. We have had a sick economy. For  over a decade, we have had a sick economy.   One thing that surprises me is how few of our colleagues talk about  this. As we have debated the tax bill, a lot of my colleagues on this  side of the aisle have been talking about growth--growth, growth,  growth--and how we ought to get back to traditional levels of GDP  growth--3 percent or higher. It is a bit of a surprise to me that in my  little under 3 years in the Senate, I don't know if I have heard any of  my colleagues on the other side of the aisle come to the floor to talk  about this--that this number, below 3 percent is not good for the  country. To the contrary, some of them, unfortunately, have bought into  what the Obama administration used to tell us: Listen, we can't hit 3  percent. So guess what, America, this is the new normal. We can't  expect 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 percent growth. We had years of 7 percent GDP  growth during the Reagan era and strong growth during the Clinton era.  Don't expect that anymore. The new normal is about 1.5, maybe 2  percent, if we are lucky.   I asked one of my Democratic colleagues this morning: Do you believe  in the new normal? Do you? Because that is a surrender. That is a  surrender of the American dream.   There has been a lot of talk over the last year about what makes  America great. This is what makes America great--strong economic  growth. We haven't had it in over a decade.   This tax bill, we believe, is going to spur economic growth. That is  another reason why it is so important--families' take-home pay and  finally getting back to traditional levels of strong, robust economic  growth that has enjoyed bipartisan support from every President since  the end of World War II. Yet, somehow, on the other side of the aisle,  they don't want to talk about it. Well, to me, it is the most important  thing we are doing here.   So how do we do it? There is tax reform, certainly, and also energy  policies that unleash our opportunities, infrastructure, and regulatory  reform. But we have to get out of this lost decade.   I want to go back to that ``Atlantic'' article I mentioned. The  author talks about the fact that people don't have the money they once  did because of this--because we are not growing; because the strongest  economy in the world, for the last 10 years, is sick.   The author says: ``In the 1950s and '60s, American economic growth  democratized prosperity.''   Everybody had opportunity with strong economic growth. That is what  he is talking about right here. Then he says: ``But, in the 2010s, we  have managed to democratize financial insecurity.''   We went from democratizing prosperity for families to democratizing  financial insecurity, where almost half of the American people don't  believe they have $400 in an emergency. Yet my colleagues don't want to  provide a tax cut for middle-class families who are struggling.   What we need to do is to end this democratization of financial  insecurity and get back to prosperity and get back to traditional  levels of GDP growth through tax reform, through energy, through  infrastructure, and through permanent reform. We can do it.   Any American watching: Please don't believe this idea of the new  normal, that we will never get back to these strong rates, that somehow  our future is destined to be below this 3 percent line. Don't believe  it. What we need are policies that can get us there.   That is why I am hopeful still that some of my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle are going to join us in promoting this tax  reform that will do one of the most important things we can do--get the  U.S. economy growing again. Families will benefit, middle-class  families will benefit, hard-working Americans will benefit, our economy  will benefit, and our national security will benefit, but we need to  act. We can't accept this.   I yield the floor for my colleague from Connecticut.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.
