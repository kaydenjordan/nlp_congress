 Mr. Speaker, I rise today, like so many others, to honor  the memory of Barbara Bush.   She has already been noted in the history books for her place as one  of the only two women to be the wife of one President and the mother of  another. But for millions of Americans, Barbara Bush's legacy is deeply  personal.   As First Lady, she drew attention to the issue of family literacy in  a way that resonated with the American public. In her own  straightforward and down-to-earth way, she worked to remove the shame  and stigma of illiteracy for adults. She knew and believed that  children are the future, but she recognized that if a child's parents  didn't have basic reading and writing skills, the whole family's future  is at risk.   As the House continues to focus on workforce development and closing  the skills gap, it is fitting to recognize the voice Barbara Bush gave  to that basic cornerstone of all education: the power of reading. She  embraced lifelong learning, and the best way to honor her legacy is to  do the same.   As chair of the Committee on Education and the Workforce, it is a  privilege to honor her memory and her contributions to the work we  continue to do every day.                            ____________________
