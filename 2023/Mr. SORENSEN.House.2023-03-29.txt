 Madam Chair, as Congress' only meteorologist, I rise  today in strong opposition to H.R. 1, House Republicans' polluters over  people act.   This bill does nothing to lower energy costs for working families.  This bill does nothing to help our farm families dealing with the  effects of extreme weather. This bill does nothing to support the  domestic production of biofuels in central and northwestern Illinois.   In fact, instead of lowering costs for working communities across the  Nation, the polluters over people act pads the pockets of Big Oil and  Gas, guts environmental protections, and adds $2.4 billion to the  deficit.   Earlier this week, I offered an amendment that would have prevented  big corporations from selling natural gas overseas until we could  ensure that it won't raise prices here at home. I am disappointed that  Republicans put polluters over people and blocked my amendment from  being considered today.   At home in Illinois, sustainability is not a partisan issue.  Democrats, Republicans, and Independents all want our communities to be  clean and prosperous. I thought this would be a bipartisan goal in  Congress, but it seems that my colleagues across the aisle are willing  to let the Federal deficit balloon for Big Oil and corporate interests  at the expense of our communities' futures.   Not only will this decision impact our daily lives; it impacts the  lives of our children, grandchildren, and their grandchildren.   I stand ready to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  on commonsense solutions that meet our Nation's energy needs while  lowering energy costs for working families. American families deserve  much more.
