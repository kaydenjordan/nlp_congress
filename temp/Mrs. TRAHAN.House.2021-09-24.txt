 Madam Speaker, my generation and every generation of  women after us has grown up with the freedom and the security under Roe  v. Wade.   Today those protections are under attack from lawmakers and  activists, many of whom have never had to make the tough personal  decisions about family planning or about the health of a pregnancy.   Those attacks have been successful, and it is chilling as a mom of  two young daughters.   Roe is on the verge of elimination, and millions of women are rightly  terrified of what that means for their bodily autonomy and the future  of reproductive care even beyond abortion.   Today, we are going to pass the Women's Health Protection Act because  we know that no one can be more trusted to make the best health  decisions for themselves than women.   The government should not have a role in that choice, and I reject  the hypocrisy on the other side of the aisle that suggests otherwise.   Please, join us in passing this critical legislation and protecting  reproductive rights, protecting the freedom of women to decide. If not  for the people you represent, then for the women in your lives.                                time  1015
