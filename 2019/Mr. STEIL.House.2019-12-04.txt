 Mr. Speaker, in 2018 an estimated 47 billion spam  robocalls were placed in the United States. Americans lost $1.5 billion  to fraud last year. Weekly, sometimes daily, our phones are flooded  with spam calls. Not only are these calls annoying, but these criminals  trick people into giving away personal information such as their Social  Security number or bank information.   Robocalls affect everyone from Janesville to Kenosha to Racine and  everywhere in between.   Last month I held an identity theft fraud prevention workshop in  southeast Wisconsin. More than 200 residents attended and received  useful tips from Federal and State agencies on how to protect  themselves from fraud. Making  [[Page H9228]]  communities resilient from scammers is critical.   Robocalls are becoming more sophisticated every day. It is becoming  easier for Americans to fall victim to scamming. That is why Congress  must act.   Today the House is voting on a bill I cosponsored, the Telephone  Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence Act, or the TRACED  Act.   The TRACED Act strengthens penalties for criminals who conduct spam  robocalls. This bill also requires telecommunications companies to  develop new ways to certify all calls are from legitimate people.  Working together with phone companies, consumer groups, and the Federal  Government will protect our community--and go after the bad guys.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense,  nonpartisan bill.           We Must Recommit to Ending the Global HIV/AIDS Epidemic     Mr. Speaker, this week we recommit ourselves to ending the  HIV/AIDS epidemic. We have made progress to prevent infections and  enhance treatment, but more work must be done.   Supporting the Global Fund and fully funding its programs is an  important piece of the puzzle. The Global Fund is a partnership  organization that works with governments and private sectors to end the  AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria epidemics. By developing low-cost,  high-impact treatments and technologies, we can save lives.   Since the creation of the Global Fund in 2002, deaths caused by these  diseases have been reduced by one-third each year in countries where  the Global Fund invests. I was proud to cosponsor the bill and see the  House support the Global Fund.   This is an important issue to many across southeast Wisconsin.  Earlier this year, I met with Pastor Bob Griffith and Pastor Lawrence  Kirby to discuss the United States' commitment to battling these health  epidemics, whether that be at home in southeast Wisconsin or throughout  the world.   Pastor Griffith's and Pastor Kirby's work in the Racine and Kenosha  communities is admirable. They advocate for those in poverty and for  our global community dealing with these diseases.   We thank Pastor Griffith and Pastor Kirby for their dedication to  this cause, for bringing awareness to the fight.   We must continue working together and ensure education, treatment,  and assistance is available to those who need it.                            ____________________
