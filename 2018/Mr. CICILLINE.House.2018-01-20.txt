 Mr. Speaker, I have a parliamentary inquiry.    Mr. Speaker, has debate concluded on the rule?    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R.  4872, the End the Shutdown Act of 2018, a continuing resolution through  Tuesday that would immediately reopen the government while negotiations  continue on a budget agreement that adheres to parity, reauthorizing  the Children's Health Insurance Program and other critical healthcare  programs, addressing DREAMers, and providing assistance to Americans  impacted by natural disasters.   Mr. Speaker, I am asking unanimous consent to bring this bill up to  reopen the government. To all the claims my Republican colleagues just  made about opening the government, here is their chance.    Mr. Speaker, I appeal the ruling of the Chair.
