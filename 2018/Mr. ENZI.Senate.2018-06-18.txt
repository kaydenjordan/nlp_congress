 Mr. President, section 251 of the Balanced Budget and  Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, BBEDCA, establishes statutory  limits on discretionary spending and allows for various adjustments to  those limits. In addition, sections 302 and 314(a) of the Congressional  Budget Act of 1974 allow the Chairman of the Budget Committee to  establish and make revisions to allocations, aggregates, and levels  consistent with those adjustments.   The Senate is considering S. Amdt. 2910, a ``minibus'' spending  measure  [[Page S3979]]  covering programs within the jurisdiction of the Senate Appropriations  Subcommittees on Energy and Water, Military Construction and Veterans  Affairs, and the Legislative Branch. This legislation includes funding  for military construction designated as overseas contingency operations  funding pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(ii) of BBEDCA. These  provisions provide $921 million in budget authority for fiscal year  2019. The inclusion of the overseas contingency operations designations  with these provisions makes this spending eligible for an adjustment  under the Congressional Budget Act.   Accordingly, I am increasing the fiscal year 2019 budgetary aggregate  by $921 million in budget authority. Further, I am revising the budget  authority allocations to the Committee on Appropriations by increasing  revised security budget authority by $921 million in fiscal year 2019.   I ask unanimous consent that this notice and the accompanying tables,  which provide details about the adjustment, be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                      REVISION TO BUDGETARY AGGREGATES  (Pursuant to Sections 311 and 314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of                                   1974) ------------------------------------------------------------------------                        $s in millions                            2019 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Current Spending Aggregates:     Budget Authority.......................................    3,547,094     Outlays................................................    3,508,052 Adjustments:     Budget Authority.......................................          921     Outlays................................................            0 Revised Spending Aggregates:     Budget Authority.......................................    3,548,015     Outlays................................................    3,508,052 ------------------------------------------------------------------------    REVISION TO SPENDING ALLOCATION TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS FOR                             FISCAL YEAR 2019  (Pursuant to Sections 302 and 314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of                                   1974) ------------------------------------------------------------------------                     $s in millions                            2019 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Current Allocation:     Revised Security Discretionary Budget Authority..            647,000     Revised Nonsecurity Category Discretionary Budget            597,000      Authority.......................................
