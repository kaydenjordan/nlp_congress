 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (S. 490) to reinstate and extend the deadline for commencement of  construction of a hydroelectric project involving the Gibson Dam.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 490         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. REINSTATEMENT AND EXTENSION OF TIME FOR FEDERAL                     ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION PROJECT INVOLVING                     GIBSON DAM.         (a) In General.--Notwithstanding the time period specified       in section 13 of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 806) that       would otherwise apply to the Federal Energy Regulatory       Commission project numbered 12478-003, the Federal Energy       Regulatory Commission (referred to in this section as the       ``Commission'') may, at the request of the licensee for the       project, and after reasonable notice, in accordance with the       good faith, due diligence, and public interest requirements       of, and the procedures of the Commission under, that section,       extend the time period during which the licensee is required       to commence construction of the project for not more than 3       consecutive 2-year periods from the date of the expiration of       the extension originally issued by the Commission.        (b) Reinstatement of Expired License.--        (1) In general.--If the period required for the       commencement of construction of the project described in       subsection (a) has expired prior to the date of enactment of       this Act, the Commission may reinstate the license effective       as of that date of expiration.        (2) Extension.--If the Commission reinstates the license       under paragraph (1), the first extension authorized under       subsection (a) shall take effect on the date of that       expiration.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material in the Record on the bill.  [[Page H6227]]     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill, S. 490, authorizes the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission, FERC, upon request, to extend by 6 years the  time period during which construction must commence on a hydroelectric  project involving the Gibson Dam, which is located on the Sun River in  Montana. Additionally, FERC may reinstate the construction license if  it is expired.   This bill passed the Senate by unanimous consent back on June 28, and  I would urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation so  that we can send it to the President's desk.   I would also note that when the Senate passed this bill, they also  passed five other House bills extending construction licenses for hydro  projects in North Carolina, New York, Virginia, and West Virginia.  These now have become law. So this is the last one.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Montana (Mr. Gianforte). I would note that he was the sponsor of the  House companion bill. This is a Senate bill that we are taking up, but,  obviously, he has great interest in it.   I would note that we passed it with strong bipartisan support through  the Energy Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to correct the record. We were going to  take this up and pass it like that, but the Senate acted first, which  is why we are taking up the Senate bill. It does have bipartisan  support.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for it, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
