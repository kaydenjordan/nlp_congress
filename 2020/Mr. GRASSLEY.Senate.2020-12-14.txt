 Mr. President, I ask for 1 minute in morning business.    Mr. President, I come to the floor to thank the Library  of Congress and to talk about something that honors our veterans.   Iowa has a rich history of veterans serving on behalf of our country.  Their service ensures that all Americans will live in peace and  prosperity for generations to come. Over the past 2 years, I have  delivered 31 personal accounts to be stored at the Library of Congress  as part of their program called the Veterans History Project. I thank  the Library of Congress for preserving the individual stories as  reported in the veteran's own words.   Today, I will submit six more interviews to this collection that we  recorded at the Waverly Area Veterans Post last month. I am proud to be  a part of the Veterans History Project, preserving the stories of Iowa  veterans for future generations.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, for over a year, Senator Johnson and I  investigated the Biden family's financial dealings. For over a year,  the liberal media and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  falsely said that we were peddling Russian disinformation. They ginned  up any story they could to falsely portray our investigation in an  effort to delegitimize the report's findings. Even my colleague Senator  Wyden, with whom I have worked on many bipartisan investigations, said  the following:         This disinformation also became the basis of the Johnson-      Grassley investigation. The political nature of this       investigation has been clear all along. Bottom line: The       Johnson-Grassley investigation is baseless. It is laundering       Russian propaganda for circulation in the United States.    It seems the liberal media and Democrats have a very nervous tick.  Any time a Republican gets close to the truth and is about to serve  justice, the other side yells: ``Russian disinformation.'' Of course,  as we see now, that is a load of garbage.   As I have said on this floor several times before, our report was  rooted in information from U.S. Government agencies and a left-aligned  U.S. lobby shop that represented a corrupt Ukrainian gas company, and  by now, the American people know that it is really the Democrats and  liberal media that are connected to Russian disinformation. Just think  of the Steele dossier. It was infected with Russian disinformation and  paid for by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's  campaign.   The liberal media and those on the other side of the aisle were  scared of the facts. They were scared that the American people would  see the Biden family's deep and extensive link to foreign governments,  including the Communist Chinese Government.   And once Senator Johnson and I released publically our findings,  those same liberal outlets said the report repackaged old material and  that there wasn't really anything new to it.  [[Page S7458]]    They went into full Joe Biden protection mode, and they didn't even  try to hide it.   One Washington Post columnist said: ``Even after accepting  disinformation from Russian agents, Johnson and Grassley couldn't come  up with anything new or interesting on Hunter Biden.''   Well, we know today the Post should be ashamed that they said that.   POLITICO ran a story with this headline: ``GOP Senators' anti-Biden  report repackages old claims.''   And National Public Radio said about the New York Post Hunter Biden  stories: ``We don't want to waste our time on stories that are not  really stories, and we don't want to waste the listeners' and readers'  time on stories that are just pure distractions,'' end of the NPR  quote.   Now, look at what Twitter and Facebook did to Hunter Biden news.  Simply said, they interfered in the election and gave the Biden  campaign a multimillion-dollar in-kind donation, courtesy of their  blatant and unforgiveable censorship.   So, my fellow Americans, let us never forget what Twitter and  Facebook did during the 2020 elections.   Now, let's fast forward to this very day. Now it is confirmed that  Hunter Biden is under criminal investigation, reportedly for his taxes  and financial dealings--the very fact pattern that we described in the  Johnson-Grassley report.   It shouldn't take Hunter Biden to confirm that he is under criminal  investigation before the mainstream press gets permission--from whom, I  don't know--to report the news. It is a complete outrage the way the  liberal media used its power to cover up facts relating to Hunter Biden  and the Biden family and, yet, ran story after story with false  information about the Russian investigation into Trump and the  credibility of the Steele dossier.   The recent news also shows that our report was not ``baseless''--that  is the word that shows up all the time--and it didn't ``repackage old  claims.'' That is another set of words that showed up quite regularly  as people were trying to distract the Johnson and Grassley report.   So quite the opposite--our report was well-founded, ahead of the  curve, and right on the money, in more ways than one.   Our report teed up the facts, but the mainstream press never stepped  up to the plate.   Some of the Nation's supposedly leading press outlets, with teams of  investigative reporters, were scooped by the Congress--the Johnson- Grassley report. Now, of course, they are scrambling to chase the story  that they for so long ignored.   Now, it didn't have to be this way. We already did much of the heavy  lifting before issuing our report. The report made public information  that hadn't ever been known before. For example, it showed the  following: Hunter Biden and his associates and family members were  connected to Chinese nationals and Chinese companies linked with the  Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army. This includes the  CEFC China Energy Company Limited and that company's subsidiaries.   Records show that a company linked to the Communist regime sent  Hunter Biden's law firm millions of dollars.   Other records show that Hunter Biden opened a line of credit with a  Chinese national linked to the Communist regime and funded it with  approximately $100,000. Then he, James Biden, and Sara Biden went on an  extravagant global spending spree.   Still other records show that Hunter Biden, via his law firm, also  sent a million dollars to James Biden's consulting firm, the Lion Hall  Group. These transfers began less than 1 week after CEFC sent $5  million to a company called Hudson West III, a company linked to CEFC  and Chinese nationals associated with the Communist regime, which then  sent money to Hunter Biden's law firm.   When the bank contacted Sara Biden, who was associated with the  firm's bank account, she refused to answer their questions and provide  any additional documentation. According to the records that we have on  file, the bank submitted the account for closure.   Senator Johnson and I recently issued a supplemental to our report  that showed Hunter Biden's close business associate Rob Walker received  $6 million from a Chinese company linked to the Communist regime.   There is yet another link in the chain from the Biden family and  their associates to the Chinese Government.   The report also showed that State Department officials believed that  Hunter Biden's Burisma board membership created the perception of a  conflict of interest and was ``very awkward for all U.S. officials  pushing an anticorruption agenda in Ukraine,'' end of quote from a  State Department official.   Secretary of State Kerry publicly denied knowing of Hunter Biden's  role on the Burisma board. We acquired evidence that shows that Kerry  did, in fact, know about that role.   In December 2015, instead of following U.S. objectives of confronting  oligarchs, Vice President Biden's staff advised him to avoid commenting  on Burisma's oligarch and instead say: ``I am not going to get into  naming names or accusing individuals.''   Joe Biden was running an anticorruption agenda in Ukraine, and he  pulled his punches while his son was on the board of Burisma.   Based on witness testimony, Burisma's owner allegedly paid a $7  million bribe to officials serving under Ukraine's prosecutor general  to shut the case against him. When he allegedly paid that bribe, Hunter  Biden was on the Burisma board.   These examples are just a sampling from the report that Senator  Johnson and I put out and just the tip of the iceberg with respect to  the Biden family's troubled ties to governments adverse to U.S.  interests.   These associations, and the millions of dollars that passed between  and among Hunter Biden, James Biden, and others, create criminal  financial, counterintelligence, and extortion concerns. That is why I  have written to the Justice Department about the risk that Hunter and  James Biden essentially served as agents of the Communist government  for purposes of their registering under the Foreign Agents Registration  Act.   After Hunter Biden publicly confirmed he was under criminal  investigation, liberal news outlets reported on concerns that his  financial associations could create criminal financial and  counterintelligence problems--something you heard from the Johnson- Grassley report several weeks ago. That is what we said in September  2020, and we were roundly criticized for it.   And just over the weekend, a new email was made public that  reportedly says that Joe Biden and his brother were ``office mates''  with the very same Chinese nationals whom we wrote about in our report.  Those same individuals were the ones with links to the Communist regime  and that regime's military.   Based on all the facts known to date, Joe Biden has a lot of  explaining to do. I have run many oversight operations and  investigations during the course of my career. I am interested in the  facts, in the evidence, and in the truth. I learned a lesson a long  time ago when I first started my oversight focus; that is, no matter  how difficult the media or the other side of the aisle makes it to find  the facts, never give up. Keep working hard. The American taxpayers  deserve nothing less.   That is the attitude and approach that I have had my entire career,  and that is what I will take with me as I continue to look into the  Biden family matters and as I move to a leadership position on the  Senate Judiciary Committee.   I yield the floor.
