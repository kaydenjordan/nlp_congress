 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize a fallen hero from  Rockland County.   Two years ago yesterday, Jared Lloyd went to the Columbian Engine  Company No. 1 firehouse, like he had hundreds of times before, to help  keep our community safe.   He did not know that it would be his last call when he and his  company were called to the Evergreen Court Adult Home in Spring Valley  to combat a fire that started, putting the lives of hundreds of elderly  residents at risk.   He, along with hundreds of other first responders, descended on the  scene, running headlong into the building that was becoming engulfed  with flames. Together, they saved over 100 lives that day, a heroic  feat.   Tragically, Jared lost his life in this effort, which serves as a  stark reminder of the incredible bravery shown by all of our first  responders in the Hudson Valley and across our Nation, but especially  our volunteer firefighters.    Thank you, Jared. Thank you for your service, your sacrifice, and  your example. I know all of Rockland mourns you today and every day,  and we will always be there to support your family, including your two  incredible sons.                            ____________________
