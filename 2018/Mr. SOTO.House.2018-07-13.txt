 Madam Speaker, on behalf of our central Florida community,  I am proud to recognize the Orange County Library System for being the  recipient of the Nation's 2018 National Medal for Museum and Library  Service.   The Orange County Library System was selected from 29 national  finalists to receive this prestigious medal. This is the highest honor  given to libraries that make exceptional contributions to their  communities through dynamic programming and services. It is a  tremendous win for our community.   Orange County Library is bringing positive change to central Florida,  and they are specifically being recognized for their work providing  access to STEM education for children living in underserved  communities, providing ESOL classes for adults and families, and their  commitment to providing access to high-quality educational tools for  children in Orange County's public school system.   I would like to recognize Mary Anne Hodel, Orange County Library  System Library director and CEO, and Lisa Franchina, president of the  library board of trustees, for their leadership and inspirational work;  Erin Sullivan, Orange County Library System's public relations  administrator, for taking the initiative of recognizing the great work  of OCLS; and all the dedicated staff and volunteers of the library for  their work in helping residents of central Florida to foster personal  growth and development.                            ____________________
