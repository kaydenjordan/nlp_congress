 Madam Speaker, we are now being sent home for 3 weeks,  I don't know whether it is coincidence or not that we are being sent  home when we have such a problem at our border, and we just got done  voting on a few immigration bills.   All of us Congressmen should have a to-do list over the next 3 weeks.  I want to give the press corps a to-do list. Right now, our Border  Patrol is under a gag order in which they cannot educate the press or  Congressmen as to what is really going on. This, at a time when you  have almost three times as many people trying to get across the border  than at this time last year, and we have huge numbers of unaccompanied  minors down there.   The press should be outraged at this gag order. I have been at the  border four times so far over the last couple years, and it is always  very illuminating what the Border Patrol can say to us. Now, like we  are in some totalitarian state, they are not allowed to speak to us.   I don't care whether you care about the government benefits, the  unaccompanied minors, the drug trafficking, the human trafficking, the  money the drug cartels are making on illegal immigration, we should  want to know and we can't know unless the Border Patrol tells us.  Please wake up, sleeping press corps.                            ____________________
