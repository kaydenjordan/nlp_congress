 Mr. President, today I wish to discuss the Women's  Entrepreneurship and Economic Empowerment Act, WEEE Act, which the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee reported yesterday afternoon. It has  been my honor to work with Senator Boozman on this legislation, which  House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce and Representative  Lois Frankel originally introduced. The House passed the measure on  July 17, 2018. Yesterday, the Senate took a big step toward passing  this important bill into law.   Both here in the U.S. and abroad, how a country treats its women is a  barometer of its success. I believe that, when women succeed, so do our  communities, especially economically. The WEEE Act is critical in  achieving this goal. It brings attention to helping women  entrepreneurs, including those living in poverty, to access the tools  they need to start and grow their businesses and invest in themselves,  their families, and their communities. It recognizes that women are not  always on a level playing field, particularly when they face  discrimination, gender-based violence and harassment, and restrictions  on their opportunities.   Roughly 1 billion women around the world are currently left out of  the formal financial system, which causes many to rely on informal  means of saving and borrowing that are riskier and less reliable. In  many countries, because men are considered legal heads of household,  married women are required to receive permission from their husbands  just to open a bank account. As a result, we have observed the  propagation of savings groups, primarily composed of women, recognized  as a vital entry point, especially for poor and very poor women, to  formal financial services. There is a high demand for such groups to  protect and grow the savings of women with formal financial  institutions. Evidence shows that, once a savings group is linked to a  bank, the average savings per member increases between 40 to 100  percent, and the average profit per member doubles. Investing in  financial literacy, business leadership training, and mentorship are  key elements to these outcomes.   By requiring that 50 percent of the U.S. Agency for International  Development's--USAID--micro, small, and medium-sized enterprise  resources are targeted to activities that reach the very poor, as well  as enterprises owned, managed, and controlled by women, the WEEE Act  will help break down the barriers preventing women from participating  in their local economies. It will help diminish the estimated 70  percent of women-owned small and medium-sized enterprises in the formal  sector that are unserved or underserved in terms of access to financial  services, resulting in a financing gap of $300 trillion for women-owned  small businesses. Furthermore, the WEEE Act will modernize USAID's  development assistance toolkit to include innovative credit scoring  models, financial technology, financial literacy, insurance, and  actions to improve property and inheritance rights.   We know that women's economic advancement can lead to greater  security and resilience, as well as stronger investments in health and  nutrition, education, and safety--not only for women but for their  families and communities too. According to the World Bank, for each  additional year of schooling, a woman's labor earnings increase by  nearly 12 percent. CARE reports that participation in village savings  groups increased spending on children's school fees by 76 percent in  Tanzania and nearly doubled the health spending for families in Rwanda,  along with increases in their spending on food and nutrition. This is  exactly the evidence-driven development work that the U.S. should be  supporting.   We are making enormous strides, but there is still much to be done.  Enacting the Women's Entrepreneurship and Economic Empowerment Act into  law will help equip women to overcome the critical barriers they face  when seeking economic opportunity and will open doors for children,  families, and communities to benefit as well. A McKinsey Global  Institute report estimates that achieving global gender parity in  economic activity could add as much as $28 trillion to annual global  gross domestic product by 2025. These stark statistics serve both as a  beacon of hope and a reminder of the great challenges that still must  be overcome. The WEEE Act will help advance us towards this goal, and  we must not stop fighting until such parity is reached.                            ____________________
