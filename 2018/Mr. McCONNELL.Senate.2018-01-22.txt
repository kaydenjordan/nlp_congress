 Mr. President, in 2 hours every Senator can vote to  end this government shutdown. At 12 noon we will vote to end the  Democratic leader's filibuster and advance instead a bipartisan bill  that would put this mess behind us.   The bill before us does three things that every Democrat and  Republican should be able to support. First, it ends the shutdown and  restores full funding for the Federal Government through February 8.  Second, it extends health insurance for 9 million vulnerable children.  Third, it will enable Congress to resume serious bipartisan talks on  the important issues facing our Nation.   I respect the passion that many of our friends in this Chamber, both  Democrat and Republican alike, bring to the major issues before the  Senate--all of these issues. Each of us brings our own views and  personal perspectives to discussions of immigration policy, healthcare  reform, or details of government spending.   But we should not let the political feuds or policy disagreements  obscure the simple fact that every Member of this body cares deeply  about the challenges facing our country. All of us want to make life  better for the American people.   Bearing this in mind, I hope and intend that we can reach bipartisan  solutions on issues such as military spending, immigration and border  security, and disaster relief before the February 8 deadline.   But yesterday evening, I restated my position that these negotiations  can't last forever. Should these issues not be resolved by the time the  funding bill before us expires on February 8, so long as the government  remains open, it would be my intention to take up legislation here in  the Senate that would address DACA, border security, and related  issues, as well as disaster relief, defense funding, healthcare, and  other important matters.   Let me be clear. This immigration debate will have a level playing  field at the outset and an amendment process  [[Page S430]]  that is fair to all sides, and it would be my strong preference for the  Senate to consider a proposal that could actually be signed into law. A  bipartisan, bicameral group is already negotiating, and I look forward  to completion of its work.   But it is abundantly clear that the Senate cannot make progress on  any of these crucial matters until the government is reopened. We need  to move forward. The very first step is ending the shutdown. It is  evident that this government shutdown is doing nothing--absolutely  nothing--to generate bipartisan progress on the issues the American  people care about. Every day we spend arguing about keeping the lights  on is another day we cannot spend negotiating DACA, defense spending,  or any of our other shared priorities.   Let's join together and put the filibuster behind us and get back to  work for the American people.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I thank the Democratic leader for his  comments and his indication that he intends to support the measure  before us.   I think if we have learned anything during this process, it is that a  strategy to shut down the government over the issue of illegal  immigration is something the American people didn't understand and  would not have understood in the future. So I am glad we have gotten  past that, and we have a chance now to get back to work.   Therefore, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory  quorum call be waived.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Con. Res. 33.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table with no intervening action or debate.    Madam President, I know of no further debate on the  motion to concur with amendment.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, after 3 days of an unnecessary lapse  in funding, a bipartisan majority has brought the Democratic leader's  extraordinary filibuster to an end and passed a bipartisan bill to  reopen the Federal Government.   As I have said repeatedly over the past week, shutting down the  government is an irresponsible way to do business. It does not reflect  the seriousness with which I know my colleagues on both sides would  like to approach the people's business here in the Senate.   All our important work for the American people had to be put on hold  while this manufactured crisis was dealt with. We made no substantive  progress--not one inch--on the serious bipartisan negotiations that it  will take to solve issues such as immigration, border security,  healthcare, defense spending, and many other matters. I am glad we can  finally get back to work here.   Amid the political gamesmanship, the past 3 days have highlighted the  commitment of many of my colleagues to honest and bipartisan work. I  would like to particularly thank Senator Graham, Senator Collins,  Senator Flake, and several of our Democratic colleagues who worked  tirelessly to bring this impasse to a conclusion.   Soon, Federal operations will be getting back to normal for the  American people. We all know what comes next--challenging negotiations  on a host of serious issues. The weeks ahead will require the best from  all of us.   I hope we can remember some lessons from this regrettable incident.  Brinksmanship and hostage-taking do not work. They make bipartisan  progress harder, not easier, to achieve.   Senators must focus on the common good of the American people, not  the warped priorities--the warped priorities--of extreme voices, no  matter how loudly they shout at us to do otherwise.   With the pointless, damaging, partisan theatrics of this government  shutdown behind us, serious and bipartisan negotiations can resume. We  have been talking for months about how to address military spending,  disaster relief, healthcare, immigration, and border security, and the  rest of Congress's unfinished business. Now those talks can get going  again. Whether they bear fruit is up to all of us.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 594, Jerome Powell.
