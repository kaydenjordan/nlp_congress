 Madam Speaker, in 7 days, our country will face one of  the greatest self-inflicted threats to national security in our  lifetime.   In 7 days, our country faces default while House Republicans continue  to play partisan political games with the debt limit.   In these Chambers, we talk a lot about keeping Americans safe,  strategic competition, and national security.   We point a finger at foreign threats and international bad actors but  let us be clear: The biggest threat to American lives and livelihoods  is House Republicans holding everyday Americans hostage for partisan  political gains.   If we as a Congress are serious about ensuring national security,  then we must stand up against this House Republican manufactured  crisis.   We must do the right thing, invest in our country, and recognize  that:   Financial security is national security. Health security is national  security. Food security is national security. Housing security is  national security. People's security is national security.   I will not support lifting the debt ceiling on the backs of working  families, our veterans, or our seniors. Know this: As Democrats, we  will continue to do the right thing and put people over politics.                            ____________________
