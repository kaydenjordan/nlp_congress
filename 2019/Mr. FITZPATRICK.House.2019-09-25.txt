 Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss a very  important matter and one that is bipartisan in nature.   I thank my friend and colleague from Michigan (Mr. Kildee) for  helping us organize and bring awareness to an issue that affects  communities across the United States.   As co-chair of the Congressional PFAS Task Force, I am pleased that  PFAS remediation efforts are receiving the attention so desperately  needed.   In Bucks and Montgomery Counties, we have seen firsthand the negative  impacts PFAS contamination has had on our community. Further action  must be taken on a Federal level.   Earlier this year, the House and the Senate passed their NDAA bills  that both included important provisions to address PFAS contamination.  These provisions will help to clean up contaminated sites, stop PFAS  from polluting our drinking water in the future, and protect our  servicemembers and our first responders.   In order to protect veterans and families in our communities from  PFAS, in the final NDAA, we must have the best PFAS provisions from the  House and Senate NDAA bills.   Madam Speaker, I call, tonight, for all NDAA conferees to ensure  resources for PFAS remediation efforts are included in the final  package. This issue cannot wait any longer. Congress must act now.                            ____________________
