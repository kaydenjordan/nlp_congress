 Mr. Chair, in 2017, with little debate, the Republican- led Chamber quietly approved a provision to open up the Arctic National  Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling. ANWR is our Nation's largest  wildlife refuge, and it is the ancestral home to the Gwich'in people  and current home to more than 250 species of wildlife, including  threatened species like polar bears that raise their cubs there.   As the chairman said, I have traveled to this special place. I have  met with the Gwich'in people. I saw the pristine beauty of the coastal  plain, and I saw thousands of Porcupine caribou in their annual  migration process. I know how important this refuge is to our entire  ecosystem.   Instead of protecting this important environment, this administration  is going to open it up to drilling and allow it to be destroyed for an  indeterminate amount of oil. Why? The American people are  overwhelmingly opposed to this plan. They want this land preserved, not  destroyed.   This bill, H.R. 1146, will block the administration's disastrous plan  and protect the refuge.   Mr. Chair, I strongly urge all of my colleagues to support it.
