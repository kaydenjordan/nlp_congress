 Madam Speaker, I rise today in solidarity with the  Jewish community, with Jewish parents, with our rabbis, people who are  still reeling in the aftermath of yet another attack on one of their  houses of worship.   Anti-Semitism is real and growing, and it is a threat to our  neighbors and to our collective conscience in this country. Paired with  near-unfettered access to firearms, spaces for online hate to fester,  and the echo of xenophobic dog whistles from our Nation's highest  offices, it has and can cost us American lives.   We have failed when our educators and faith leaders need to  supplement their daily duties with violence intervention rehearsals. We  have failed when our students and congregants need to calculate exit  plans upon entering classrooms and sanctuaries. And we have failed when  we fear the next attack that impedes our neighbor's ability to practice  their faith.   To the Jewish community of Michigan's 11th District and beyond: I see  you, I am here for you, and I will continue to do my part to uproot  intolerance and hate wherever it grows.                            ____________________
