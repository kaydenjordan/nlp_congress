 Mr. Speaker, while the President was  vacationing at his beach house, and the Border Czar Kamala Harris  enjoyed a football game, our Border Patrol agents were working around  the clock to address the over 12,000 migrants who illegally crossed the  Del Rio International Bridge this week.   This is on top of the more than 200,000 apprehensions Border Patrol  agents encountered in August, a 317 percent increase from the same time  last year.   So what has changed?   The Biden administration's reckless repeal of President Trump's  successful border policy and the Biden open border agenda. Even the  Democratic Mayor of Del Rio, Texas, admitted that ``this is beyond  crisis. This is urgent. This is dire.''   The President campaigned on open borders and free health care for  illegal immigrants. Americans need to wake up to the socialist policies  that are destroying our Nation and undermining the rule of law. The  Biden experiment has not worked and will not work and it is a total  failure.  [[Page H4877]]    In my State of Texas we are always open for business. Now we are open  to illegal behavior every single day, thanks to President Biden.   In God we trust.                            ____________________
