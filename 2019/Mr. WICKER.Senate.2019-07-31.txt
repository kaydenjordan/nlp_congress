 Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I congratulate the junior Senator from  Mississippi, Mrs. Hyde-Smith. I thank her for her leadership. She took  the lead on this legislation, and I am delighted and honored to join  her in this regard.   If Americans could take a moment, a few hours, to come to the South  Delta of Mississippi and see for themselves what Senator Hyde-Smith is  talking about, they would understand the gravity of this situation.   She mentioned 7 months. If you are there today, you see dead wildlife  floating on the floodwaters. You see coffins that had been buried that  are floating on the surface of the floodwater in this area. There is no  prospect of an income this year on these small farms and no prospect of  a crop this year from some of the most fertile land the United States  has been blessed with.    The tragedy of this is that it is entirely preventable. The  prevention involves a promise that was made, as the Senator from  Mississippi said, back in 1941 when this country and this Congress  collectively adopted the Mississippi River and Tributaries System. That  system included, up and down the river, a series of levees and flood- control structures. It also included a series of pumps. We are the only  State that still, after this entire time, doesn't have our pump that  has been promised to us.   There have been environmental challenges along the way-- unsubstantiated, I might add. As a matter of fact, the environment is  harmed, wildlife is harmed when a flood of this magnitude comes into  the area, as graphically  [[Page S5256]]  demonstrated by some of the photographs the Senator has offered.   She mentioned the bathtub effect. Let me make sure my colleagues  understand this. When the Mississippi floods, the Yazoo River backs up  into the delta. As a result, we put down a floodgate, and that is  designed to keep the flooded Yazoo River from backing up into this  fertile farmland.   We had made a promise--or at least we thought we had a promise--to  people with property 87 feet above sea level that when the floodwater  behind the floodgate reaches 87, we would start pumping and pump that  water back into the Mississippi River, where it has a minimal effect.  This gives certainty. We know there is going to be a flood. People with  property 87 feet above sea level and below know they are going to be  flooded. But the promise of the pump is that if you have land that is  above 87 feet, you can build a house there, you can put your business  there, you can plant your crop there, and you can be certain that you  will get the same protection from flooding as everybody else up and  down the Mississippi River Tributary System gets. That is the promise  that everybody else gets but has been foreclosed to us.   So I congratulate the Senator for thinking of this solution. That is  a piece of legislation that would correct this problem. Clearly, it  would also help if we simply got the Corps and the EPA to agree that  the decision 10 years or so ago was made incorrectly and let us have  what the rest of the system has; that is, a flood-control promise that  gives us certainty that we can conduct our business, have a home, and  conduct our lives as it was promised. That is all we are asking for.  For 7 months this year and for weeks and months in previous years, we  have been denied that.   I want to congratulate the Senator and associate myself with the  remarks of the junior Senator from Mississippi and thank her for her  leadership in thinking of this particular solution, which would give us  a remedy, but also say that there are other ways this could be solved.  We deserve the certainty that everyone else up and down the Mississippi  system now has, and we deserve to have that promise made to us back in  the 1940s fulfilled even at this late date.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I congratulate the junior Senator from  Mississippi, Mrs. Hyde-Smith.
