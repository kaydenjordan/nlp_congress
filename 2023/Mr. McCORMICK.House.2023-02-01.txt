 Mr. Speaker, I want to address the Freedom for  Healthcare Workers Act that has been submitted and we will soon vote  on.   As an ER physician who has treated thousands of patients, who has  been exposed to COVID thousands of times, and watched nurses and  midlevels and healthcare workers of all kinds complain about the  government's involvement in healthcare, I wanted to address this topic.   I believe I am the only Congressman who has actually been an ER  doctor in the pandemic. My last shift was December 28. I intubated a  patient and saw three critical patients. Several of them had COVID.  Nobody was admitted for COVID, though.   Back to the point, though. During this pandemic we started off with  no vaccination. Meanwhile, most of us were exposed regardless of what  PPE we had, and it was limited at times to people who had fevers, who  had symptoms even before we knew what COVID was. A lot of us got sick  and developed immunity naturally.   Then the government stepped in. Although well-meaning, a lot of times  government officials think they have the answer to everything,  including things they really don't know about. What they will do is  cherry-pick the experts that agree with them to say this is what  experts believe, and that is why all healthcare professionals should  believe this also. That is not how we make progress in medicine. As a  matter of fact, it stifles innovation and progress.    At one time we had a President, President Garfield, who was shot, and  it was poor practice in medicine where doctors probed his wound and  made him septic that caused him to die. There was a dissenting opinion  by Dr. Lister--you may have heard of Listerine--who believed in  antiseptic but he was scoffed at and belittled because he was the  outlying person. Imagine where we would be if government stepped in and  said: Our experts said you don't need to wash your hands before you  probe wounds. We would still be in the Dark Ages of medicine.   I beg the government to stay out of the way of healthcare progress.  To stay out of the debate of healthcare professionals because, quite  frankly, very few people in Congress understand medicine the way  healthcare professionals do. They haven't been to medical school, and  even those who have, they haven't been in medicine for a long time.  Quite frankly, the Doctors Caucus is seldom relied on for healthcare  policy, which is a shame.   If you haven't been to medical school, if you haven't taken your  boards, if you haven't been through a residency, if you haven't seen  tens of thousands of patients, you shouldn't be telling doctors who  have a dissenting opinion what to do.   There is no standard of care based on government. It is based on  physicians having a good decision, trying different things, and finding  out what works. That is how medicine has progressed in America; far  beyond any limitations that we have in foreign counties.   We are the leaders of innovation and healthcare. We should consider  our healthcare professionals when we make decisions and not consider  government first when it comes to standard of care.   If you want to require healthcare professionals to have a  vaccination, why do you think the government understands that  requirement better than the very healthcare professional who not only  treats this but was exposed to it, who has natural immunities, and who  understands the side effects; not only of the disease but of the  vaccination.   Once again, I submit to you that it is time to let healthcare  professionals make their own decisions, especially when it comes to  their own lives. They are the ones that put their lives on the line  during the pandemic. They are the ones that treated the sick patients.  They are the ones that know best whether a vaccination will benefit  them or harm them, not a government.   I must also remind you that our Constitution is based on individual  rights, not on a collective governance by politicians telling people  what to do in things they don't know about.   Mr. Speaker, I hope we support the Freedom for Healthcare Workers  Act.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, for the last 2 days, I have heard  repeatedly the other side of the House say that Republicans want to cut  Social Security or reduce spending on Social Security and reduce  benefits from Social Security.   I will call that a lie. Just because you repeat it multiple times  does not  [[Page H590]]  make it a fact, Mr. Speaker. I actually asked around my entire  delegation, my entire caucus: Does anyone want to reduce spending on  Social Security? Not one person said yes. As a matter of fact,  everybody said no.   As a caucus, we have discussed this multiple times, both on the floor  and in conference, and we have all unanimously said that we are not  going to reduce spending on Social Security.   As a matter of fact, I will challenge anybody who says differently to  show me in writing where this secret document exists or where the  secret statement exists because I haven't seen it.   I want to take this opportunity to express that just because you say  it doesn't make it fact. The fact is that no Republican is talking  about reducing spending on Social Security as a caucus.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I can understand why there is some  confusion. I understand why we can get distracted by foreign nations  and communism, which most of us agree is a bad thing.   What I think is enlightening, though, is how we opened. What was  stated, in my understanding or recollection, was that it was just said  that the last Democratic-controlled Congress was the most effective and  productive in recent history, which you just agreed to.   The standard that the statement was made and measured by, though,  shows  [[Page H596]]  why we are having this discussion, why my Democratic colleagues are  confused.   They equate record spending, record debt, and unprecedented control  by government over private business as success. That is why they are  confused about what this bill is about and why it is germane.   They do not understand what socialism is or, worse, don't recognize  that their policies are in direct support of socialist leanings. Their  policies have continuously placed government in a position to control  businesses, picking winners and losers, deciding what is moral and  immoral, and continue to advance the idea that government somehow  should have been empowered to solve the very problems that it created.   To clear up things and create less confusion, we are trying to  counter a movement that is moving toward something we have never been,  a socialist nation.   We are a unique government created by the people, for the people,  empowered to protect, not to provide for, and not to determine the  outcome of people's endeavors.   We are uniquely positioned to benefit our citizens by empowering  them, not through more government. I believe that we the people are far  more valuable than we the government. That is why we speak against  bigger government and socialism.
