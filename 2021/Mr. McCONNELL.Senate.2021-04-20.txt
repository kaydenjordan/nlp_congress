 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the situation on our southern border is  bad and getting worse. Last month saw overall migrant totals hit a  nearly two-decade high. More unaccompanied minors arrived than during  any prior month on record.   These kids, crowded in underequipped facilities, tended by  increasingly overwhelmed personnel, have become the heart-wrenching  face of this crisis. Yet the most resolve, the most strength that this  administration has shown on the border has been their commitment to  their talking points, their refusal to call the crisis a crisis.   This past weekend, the President of the United States himself slipped  up and used that forbidden word. But--get this--he was then overruled  by his own staff. Yesterday, his Press Secretary said President Biden  actually didn't intend to describe the situation as a crisis.  Fascinating.   But then, yesterday, at last, we saw this administration take some  new action on immigration. Finally, some proactive steps. Memos were  issued to Immigration and Customs Enforcement and CBP with new  instruction. Were they new policies to stem the crisis? No. Stepped-up  enforcement? No. A way to fix the administration's signals that have  induced these new waves of  [[Page S2045]]  vulnerable people to try their luck? No, not this either.   Here was the big news: The government will be adopting new, more  politically correct rhetoric. Under this administration, we will no  longer have ``illegal aliens,'' not because they will secure the  border; just because they now will be called ``noncitizens'' or  ``undocumented migrants'' and so on.   These priorities are almost a parody of leftwing governance: not  securing the border, not a better plan for the children, just woke  proofreading. This is not going to get the job done.                               Opioid Epidemic    Mr. President, on a related matter, of course, the flow of actual  people is not our only border security problem. Americans are dying and  communities are being hollowed out because foreign drug dealers and  profiteers have taken our opioid crisis as a business opportunity.   Fentanyl and fentanyl analogues that pour into our country impose a  staggering, tragic loss. In 2020, the CDC recorded more overdose deaths  than any year on record. They attributed the spike primarily to  synthetic opioids like fentanyl.   My home State of Kentucky logged a 50-percent year-on-year increase  in overdose deaths. Fentanyl and its constantly changing analogues are  as toxic and lethal an illegal drug as there is. We are talking about  substances that can be orders of magnitude more potent than morphine.   Customs and Border Protection say fentanyl seizures jumped more than  70 percent in fiscal year 2020. They are on pace for another record  year in 2021. Much of this poison is manufactured in and exported from  China.   The scope of this crisis is truly staggering. But incredibly, some on  the political left want to respond to this national crisis by letting  the criminal status of fentanyl analogues lapse this spring.   People want to let these drugs become legal. They actually want to  let these drugs become legal. I am not making this up. Fentanyl  analogues are poised to fall off the schedule of controlled substances  in just a few weeks if Congress does not act, and some corners of the  soft-on-crime left want us to do nothing. They are unhappy with the  sentences that be can be imposed on drug dealers as a result.   These people are seriously arguing--seriously arguing that we should  let these substances flow even more freely through American streets and  American neighborhoods, costing who knows how many additional American  lives to help some drug dealer avoid prison.   I understand that even among Democrats who say they don't want to  decriminalize these poisons, there is some effort to kick the can a few  months with a temporary extension so that a soft-on-crime bill could be  crafted and forcibly paired with this step.   Look, these are terrible ideas, just terrible ideas. The right thing  to do is obvious. This isn't a trick question. We need to permanently  schedule fentanyl analogues, take this permanent step to protect  Americans, and be done with it. We should not just kick the can down  the road for 2 months or 5 months or 12 months. We should not let this  commonsense step be held hostage for liberal horse trading. We simply  need to do the right thing.   Congress cannot hold American lives and communities hostage to try to  grease the skids for drug dealers. Continuing to ban these analogues is  not even a recipe for mass incarceration. The main effect is to cut  down on the incoming supply of these poisons by changing the incentives  for producers in China and other foreign countries.   The Department of Justice reports that, in the last 3 years, only 8  people--8 people would have qualified for the mandatory minimum  sentences that some people are complaining about. More than anything  else, scheduling these terrible drugs is a harm reduction and  prevention tool. It works upstream. It disincentivizes their  manufacture and their import into our country.   Too many of our neighbors have already been taken from us. Too many  communities have already been hollowed out. There is simply no excuse  for inaction.   It should not just be a Republican priority to slam the door on the  opioid epidemic in every possible way. This should actually be a  bipartisan no-brainer. Let's permanently schedule these analogues and  keep this poison out of our land and out of our citizens' bloodstreams.                                 Afghanistan    Mr. President, now, on one final matter, this afternoon, President  Biden is sending his top national security officials to brief Members  on his misguided plan to abandon the battlefield in Afghanistan.   As I said when this decision was announced, the enemies that threaten  America, our allies, and the people of Afghanistan are not vanquished.  Taliban retribution and repression and the terror of al-Qaida, ISIS,  and the Haqqani Network will likely only grow after we have left.   I know many colleagues on both sides of the aisle share my concerns.  I expect that the administration's representatives will face tough  questions about the rationale behind their plan for a rushed  withdrawal.   So it is appropriate to ask: Does the Taliban share the  administration's commitment to a negotiated solution, to not harming  Afghan women or girls or seeking vengeance on those who have worked  with the United States to root out terror? Somehow I doubt it.   Does the administration have a plan for keeping terrorists off- balance in the absence of troops and leverage in the region? Will it  seek to maintain the 2001 AUMF, which authorizes the ongoing  counterterrorism operations that have actually kept our homeland safe  for 20 years?   How does the administration plan to maintain our insight into  terrorist activities or our ability to strike them without a presence  on the ground, to sustain our partners who are doing the fighting? I  worked hard to find common ground with this administration on foreign  policy, but if the White House is serious about making America, our  allies, and our interests more secure, it will need to start tacking  toward a more enduring approach centered on strength, grounded in  reality and not wishful thinking.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
