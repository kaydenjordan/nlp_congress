 Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the  Fairness for Farmworkers Act, which I am reintroducing today.   Farmworkers feed our Nation. This is especially true in California,  the agricultural heart of the Nation. California  [[Page S2363]]  is the most successful State in agricultural production and has the  largest population of farmworkers. In fact, more than one-third of our  country's vegetables and two-thirds of fruits and nuts come from  California. During COVID-19, a time of incredible hardship, farmworkers  put food on the tables of millions of Americans despite working in  extreme conditions and facing deep-rooted inequities in the workforce.  The time to address these inequities is now.   While the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act established Federal standards  for minimum wage and overtime pay, the law excluded millions of  domestic and agricultural workers, who were overwhelmingly people of  color. In 2016, California recognized the need to provide farmworkers  overtime protection. The California overtime law, which ensures  farmworkers will have an equal right to overtime pay, is the same model  as this Federal bill.   Farmworkers in California and across the Nation deserve an end to  discrimination in labor laws. We must undo the discriminatory exclusion  of farmworkers by amending the Fair Labor Standards Act.   That is why I am proud to introduce this bill, which will improve the  lives of farmworkers and their families, create equity in our food  system, and benefit farming communities as the increased wages are  spent in local businesses.   This bill will gradually implement overtime pay over the course of 4  years and bring greater equity to the American agricultural industry to  greater prosperity to historically marginalized workers.   This legislation will also boost farming community economies as  increased wages are spent in local businesses.   I want to thank Congressman Grijalva for introducing this bill with  me, and I hope our colleagues will join us in support of this bill that  would provide a measure of long overdue fairness for our Nation's  farmworkers.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Wicker):   S. 2261. A bill to ensure that significantly more students graduate  college with the international knowledge and experience essential for  success in today's global economy through the establishment of the  Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Program in the Department of State; to  the Committee on Foreign Relations.
