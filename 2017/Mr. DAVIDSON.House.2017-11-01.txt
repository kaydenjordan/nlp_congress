 Mr. Speaker, access to capital is crucial to promoting  a thriving U.S. economy. It allows companies to invest in growth and to  develop new and innovative products and services. Historically,  companies seeking a considerable amount of capital have preferred to  use an initial public offering and have shares traded on a national  securities exchange.   However, the United States has experienced a 37 percent decline in  the number of U.S. listed public companies, which is considerably lower  than in the 1980s and 1990s.   Public company compliance costs have grown sufficiently large that  many smaller firms stay private rather than spend their profit  overcoming these regulatory burdens. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd- Frank Act, and other legislative and regulatory actions have  contributed to these costs.                                time  1415    Title I of the JOBS Act created a new category of issuers known as  emerging growth companies, or EGCs. These issuers must have less than  $1 billion in annual revenue or $700,000 million in public float when  they register with the SEC.   While the JOBS Act made it easier for companies to go public, it was  not enough to overcome capital formation obstacles entrepreneurs and  small businesses are facing.   H.R. 3903, the Encouraging Public Offerings Act of 2017, would allow  any company, regardless of size or EGC status, to take advantage of the  popular provisions of title I of the 2012 JOBS Act.   Title I of the JOBS Act has proven to be a real policy success, and  Congress and the SEC should continue to advance policy that will reduce  or eliminate barriers to economic growth.   Mr. Speaker, I applaud Mr. Budd and Mr. Meeks for their work on this  important piece of legislation. I appreciate our chairman, Mr.  Huizenga, for moving it expeditiously through our committee; and our  chairman, Mr. Hensarling, for presiding over it.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1585 does one of the things that most  of us came to Congress to do: solve problems and change laws.   The current law excludes most of America from participating in one of  the most dynamic parts of our economy, which is private placement  investment into small startup companies or, sometimes, very big  companies but they are not yet publicly traded. There are opportunities  all over to do this, but there are only a small number of Americans who  can make the investment.   For many smaller companies, they are faced with a dilemma. One option  is no option. They may not have the network of prospective high net  worth, accredited investors who can take a look at the kind of capital  that would help that company become a thriving larger company, that  would help grow the companies that drive the growth in our economy.   As investors, there are people who work in the investment industry  who are doing the underwriting--charter financial analysts, for  example. Whether they are working for a private equity group, they are  doing the work but don't yet have the high net worth. They have true  domain expertise.   Imagine the skilled labor who is actually doing the technology  implementation, who knows exactly everything that it would take in a  program to make a program be the winner in the marketplace but is also  well informed on the rest of the risks, has been well educated on the  market, and he is prevented from participating.   This act is a step in the right direction. I hope we can accomplish  more together. I am confident we will see great success if we can pass  this and build on it by taking a bigger bite at the apple soon.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues Mr. Schweikert for  offering the bill, Mr. Hill for getting it through, Mr. Hensarling, and  Mr. Huizenga, but I also want to thank my colleagues because it is  really nice to see something go through unanimously in our committee.
