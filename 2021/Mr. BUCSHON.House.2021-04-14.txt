 Mr. Speaker, I would like to speak in support of S. 164,  the Advancing Education on Biosimilars Act of 2021, which is the Senate  companion of H.R. 1873, a bill that I introduced with my friend and  colleague, Congressman Scott Peters from California.   This bipartisan, bicameral bill will require FDA to create a public  website to educate patients and providers about biological and  biosimilar products.   As new biological and biosimilar products become available, it is  important that physicians have current information on these therapies  in order to choose the best treatment for their patients.   Availability of information and education on these new and complex  treatments for providers and patients will lead to healthy competition  in the biologic and biosimilar product space and ultimately help to  lower the cost of these important drugs for patients.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I look forward to the  President signing it into law.
