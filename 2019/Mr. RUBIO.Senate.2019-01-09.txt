 Mr. President, what is before us right now is S. 1. For  those who are here today watching or who are at home or will watch this  later and are wondering what the Senate is doing, other than coming  down here and giving speeches, what we are trying to do is start debate  on a bill, on S. 1.   S. 1 is the Senate effort to respond specifically not just to general  events that are happening in the Middle East but, in particular, the  decision made a few weeks ago that the United States would be leaving  Syria and our presence there.   At the time when the decision was made, I told everybody I thought it  was a bad idea. A lot of people agreed, and there are a lot of reasons  why it was a bad idea. Although I do think it is important anytime we  ask the American people to send their young men and women abroad--in  the case of Syria, it is about 2,000 special operators working  alongside tens of thousands of Kurdish and Syrian democratic forces.  Anytime we spend money or send Americans abroad to risk their lives,  the American people deserve for us to go to them and justify why it is  we should be doing it or continue to do it. That is certainly the case  with Syria.   So I don't agree with the decision, but I do think it has given the  Senate and those of us who disagree with that decision an opportunity  to go out and tell people why it is that it is important. That is a  broader topic, and I will have more to say about that in the days to  come, but one of the reasons why it is important is because the U.S.  withdrawal from Syria will have a dramatic impact on the security of  Israel.   Now, again, anytime we ask the American people to support another  country with money or diplomatic support or anything that it might be-- weapons--we should justify it. We should never take for granted why it  is that it is important that we support that other country.   In the case of Israel, at a time when very few things enjoy  bipartisan support, support for Israel has wide bipartisan support in  Congress and across the country, and rightfully so. Our support of the  State of Israel is founded both on morality and our national interest.   On the issue of morality, the State of Israel is very unique. It was  founded for a very specific purpose in the aftermath of the holocaust,  in which millions of Jews lost their lives. It was vowed that never  again would the Jewish people not have a place to go and seek refuge or  live in a place of peace and security. The State of Israel was  established to be that homeland for the Jewish people. It is unique in  the fact that it was given birth by an international organization. It  is unique in the world in that regard.   The second reason we should support Israel is because it is in our  national interest. Israel is everything we wish more countries in the  Middle East and around the world were. They are a pro-American, free  enterprise democracy. I would ask you, for a moment only, to imagine  what the world would be like, how much easier our foreign policy would  be if there were more countries in that part of the world that were  pro-American, free enterprise democracies. We have one, the Jewish  State of Israel. That is why we should support it.   From its very birth, Israel has faced threats to its very existence,  but I would say today that the threats it faces are the greatest ones  it has had to confront in almost a half century. The impetus for much  of that threat comes from one place, and that is Iran, a country which  almost as a matter of course as a government chants ``Death to  America'' and ``Death to Israel'' on a regular basis. It is one of the  stated purposes of that government, to destroy the State of Israel, but  they aren't just words; they are actions.   I have a map of Iran and Israel. Of course, notice that Israel is the  tiny little area on this map. At its narrowest point, Israel is 9 miles  wide. This is not a large country in terms of the map area. It is  unreal how much of the world's attention, both from international  organizations and international debates, focuses on this one tiny  country, but there it is, the very small nation that you see right  there in yellow.   There is Iran. It is, clearly, larger in terms of on the map and in  reality. Iran isn't simply a rhetorical enemy of Israel; it is taking  action to encircle Israel and to threaten its security.   It begins with engagement in its missile program. Iran is developing  and has developed ballistic missiles with a range that reaches every  part of Israel. Here is the bottom line: Iran can lodge ballistic  missiles that reach any city in Israel right now, which is why their  nuclear ambitions are so dangerous.   Imagine that at some point in the future, Iran is able to attach a  nuclear warhead to one of those ballistic missiles--a country whose  leaders on a regular basis chant ``Death to Israel'' with a nuclear  weapon that can reach Israel. Well, that is a proposition nobody wants  to see come about. That is why the Iranian ambition to have nuclear  weapons is so dangerous. They already possess that as it is today. But  they don't simply directly target Israel; they also--I believe  directly--they hide behind surrogates in the region, who do their  bidding. These surrogates have for many years been found in southern  Lebanon among Hezbollah. We will talk about them in a moment. They are  a surrogate that works at the behest of the Iranian Government.   There have been conflicts--in fact, wars--between Israel and  Hezbollah in which there have been massive military attacks coming from  Lebanon, rocket strikes into Israel and Israel's response. The last one  was in the 2005-2006 time period, and it could happen again. In fact, I  believe the conditions are ripe for it to happen again. It could happen  at any moment for a variety of different reasons that will have to be  part of another speech because time doesn't permit. Suffice it to say,  it is a dangerous proposition.   How does Hezbollah get this weaponry? They get this weaponry from  Iran. It is shipped through Syria. The U.S. disengagement from Syria  will make it easier for Iran and the IRGC and Hezbollah to bring those  weapons into southern Lebanon to strike at Israel at some point in the  future. In addition to that, Iran is also present on the ground in  Syria, which, as you see, borders Israel. So not only does Iran help  Hezbollah, but Hezbollah and Iran are in Syria, on Israel's very border  in the same region in the south, and a U.S. withdrawal will make it  easier for Iran to grow their presence there. So now Israel faces a  threat from Hezbollah, from southern Lebanon, and a threat from Iran  and Hezbollah in Syria.   We also see that the Iranian influence has grown in Iraq. The second  leading political movement in the current Iraqi Parliament is a Shia  group, directly aligned in Iran, with growing political influence. They  want to kick America out of there. Believe me, they want to turn Iraq  into another base of operation from which Israel can be targeted.   Down here in Yemen, the Houthis are an agent of Iran. You may say:  Well, that is kind of far. It isn't in the sense that those missiles  and rockets could reach there as well, but it also allows  [[Page S95]]  them the opportunity to shut off transit here at this chokepoint on the  bottom of the Red Sea, which could directly impact, ultimately, the  ability for trade and commerce for Israel and for the region writ  large.   Obviously, we see a growing Iranian presence in Bahrain and Kuwait.   Suffice it to say that Iran is carrying out an effort to grow its  influence and encircle who it views as its enemies--the Sunnis in Saudi  Arabia but more than anyone else, the Israelis.   This is not the only threat, by the way, that Israel faces. It also  faces growing violence and resistance in the Judea-Samaria region-- often called by some the West Bank--and Gaza, where there have been  upticks in violence.   I failed to mention that in southern Lebanon, Hezbollah routinely  builds tunnels from Lebanon into Israel. The purpose of that is to be  able to sneak fighters right into Israel through those tunnels so they  can conduct commando raids and kill civilians--not military personnel  but civilians.   The threats Israel is facing are growing every single day.   I want to talk specifically for a moment about the missile threat to  Israel. Here are the ranges of these rockets. There was an Israel- Hezbollah war. The next one will be far deadlier. It will be far  deadlier for a couple of reasons.   The first is that Hezbollah can build these rockets; they no longer  need to ship them in. Over the last decade and a half, they have built  the capability to construct these rockets themselves.   The second is that they have more of them. That matters because  Israel has a very good missile defense system, but you can overwhelm a  missile defense system with volume, meaning 100 rockets are launched,  and you knock down 99 of them, but 1 of them gets through and hits a  population center and kills 10,000 people. Hezbollah now has that  capability.   These rockets are also precision-guided. They are not just lobbing  them over and they hit what they hit. They can launch precision-guided  munitions to target specific areas within Israel. The ranges of these  rockets they now possess are stunning. As an example, if you look at  this little ring here, it tells you how many seconds it would take from  launch to impact, meaning 10 to 25 seconds before they could hit, for  example, the area of Nazareth and Tiberias. Moving farther down, you  see 35 to 50 seconds. Farther down, around Tel Aviv, 75 seconds.  Jerusalem, just south of that is probably another 10 seconds added, 85  seconds. A hundred and twenty seconds. A hundred and fifty-five  seconds.   Imagine for a moment that you are visiting Israel or live in Israel  or are a student studying there--whatever it might be--and one of these  launches comes in, a barrage of 1,000 rockets launched. You literally  have 35 to 50 seconds--less than 2 minutes. There is no country in the  world that can mobilize people to get out of the way in 2 minutes.  These are their population centers. This is the threat that faces them  right now, and that is just from Lebanon. Imagine that same capability  I just described also existing in Syria. Imagine it all being launched  simultaneously from Syria, from Lebanon, and from Iran. Now you begin  to see the construct of a plan to destroy this tiny nation and why it  is so critical that the United States support them in fighting for  their existence. The threat is extraordinary.   There is one more element to it. There is now a global effort called  boycott, divestment, and sanctions, BDS. It is designed to wage  economic war on Israel--in essence, to pressure companies to boycott  Israeli companies and people who do business in Israel until they stop,  to pressure investment funds and banks to no longer do investments in  anything related to Israel, and to pressure governments around the  world to sanction Israel. That is what this effort is about. It is to  undermine them economically as well. It is economic warfare and being  waged at every level. It is working. People are adopting this around  the world, and there are some who advocate for it here. We have  recently seen in the news a number of companies that decided not to do  business in certain parts of Israel because of the pressure from that  movement.   By the way, I would point out that they are not just boycotting the  economy; there are people who won't do concerts, and they won't play  the Israeli sports teams. They want the Israeli Government kicked out  of the international committee for different sports, including soccer-- the Olympic committee. They boycott cultural events. They boycott  universities. They are pressuring universities to cut ties with any  university in Israel over all this. It is an effort to destroy Israel  culturally and economically in a way that works in combination with the  effort to destroy it physically. It is a very real threat.   We have tried to confront both of these issues in bipartisan  legislation. I have up here a chart, and I will talk about it in a  moment. Twenty-six States in this country have tried to do something to  condemn BDS. I will get to that in a moment before I tell you the  ``what.''   I told you why it is so important that we stand with Israel and the  threats that Israel faces. Now I will describe what this bill does.  This bill has four components to it. One deals with the human rights  violation in Syria. We will discuss that further, perhaps tomorrow. The  second component of this bill deals with Jordan, which is one of the  neighbors that Israel has that is actually critical to its security.  One of the best things that happened to Israel security was the deal  with Jordan and Egypt that allowed them, at their periphery, to have  countries that at least recognize them and are not out to destroy them.  Jordan faces its own threats from some of the same actors, by the way.  And add ISIS to that.   The other two elements are we took these two bills that have  bipartisan support--cosponsored by Republicans and Democrats--we  combined them with the other two bills, which also had such support,  into one bill. That is S. 1. We viewed it as an opportunity for the  Senate and for Congress to weigh in on foreign policy at a time when we  believe that all of the threats to Israel that I just described are  made worse by the decision to withdraw from Syria. That is the bill  that is before us.    Today, I want to talk about the two components that impact Israel  directly. The first is basically the United States-Israel Security  Assistance Authorization Act. That is a fancy title for a bill that I  coauthored with my very good friend and another strong supporter of  Israel, Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, who sits on the other side of  the aisle. Again, I told you this is a bipartisan issue.   This bill has 72 cosponsors here in the Senate. It passed  overwhelmingly by a voice vote. We didn't even have to have a rollcall  vote. It was just voice-voted out, meaning there was unanimous  consent--no one objected--on the 1st of August of last year. It passed  in the House, with an amendment, on September 12. Then it was hotlined  for a potential voice vote here on October 11, 2018.   What does this bill do? The first thing it does is it lays out a  statement of policy. Let me tell you why that is important. People say:  Statement of policy words--why do they matter? They matter in the  region because one of the things that would encourage Hezbollah or any  of Israel's enemies to perhaps attack it is the belief that the United  States is no longer as committed to Israel's security as we once were.  They could miscalculate. They read these headlines about one or two  people in America saying something negative toward Israel, and they  think that somehow we are weakening in our resolve. I know that sounds  silly to us, but to people involved in that over there, it is not. They  read into this, and they miscalculate it. They make errors. A  miscalculation here could lead to an all-out war that could cost the  lives of thousands of people and potentially lead to the destruction of  Israel, along with other nations in the process.   It is important for us to make very clear that our commitment to  Israel is unwavering. It is especially important in light of the  decision to withdraw from Syria because what a lot of these countries-- including Iran--are reading into this is, U.S. commitment to the Middle  East is no longer very strong. Not only are they not committed to being  involved in the region, they are actually withdrawing any of the assets  they could be using to be supportive of their allies in the region.   So these statements of policy are important. What we put in this bill  lays out a statement of policy that says:   [[Page S96]]              It shall be the policy of the United States to provide       assistance to the Government of Israel in order to support       funding for cooperative programs to develop, produce, and       procure missile, rocket, projectile, and other defense       capabilities to help Israel meets its security needs and to       help develop and enhance United States defense capabilities.    What that means is, this is a cooperation. Israel may be developing  some of these technologies because they have an immediate need. We  would benefit from that technology too. If Israel develops the next  generation of missile defense systems, we would use that as well in the  case where we were threatened by it. That is that statement of policy.   The bill also authorizes U.S. security assistance in foreign military  financing at no less than $3.3 billion a year for the next decade.  That, by the way, is simply the language from a memorandum of  understanding that was signed by the Obama administration and Israel.  We put that in the statute, and we authorized it.   This is very important. It extends a war reserve stockpile authority  and extends loan guarantees to Israel through 2023. Israel has never  defaulted on a U.S.-backed loan guarantee, and this program helps  provide rainy-day insurance on Israel's stability given the many  threats it is facing.   It authorizes the President to transfer precision-guided munitions  and related defense articles and services to Israel as necessary for  legitimate self-defense. That means this weaponry wouldn't be sent, but  it would be put on reserve status--assuming it doesn't impact our  readiness--and it would be made available to Israel in case a war broke  out and their reserves were quickly depleted. If they start running out  of rockets, munitions, and defense apparatus, the United States has set  aside weaponry that we are ready to rapidly send to them so they can  defend themselves. They pay for this. But at least they know it is  sitting there. We don't have to scramble to find it, it takes 2 weeks  to get there, and by then, the war is over.   It has other requirements. It expresses the sense of Congress that  the President should prescribe procedures for rapidly acquiring and  deploying what we need to support production of these precision-guided  munitions for our U.S. counterterror mission.   It requires the President to report no later than 120 days to the  appropriate congressional committees on Israel's eligibility for the  strategic trade authorization exception to certain export control  licensing, including the reasons as to why Israel has not yet been  included in the list of countries eligible for the strategic trade  authorization exception.   This one is also very critical. This is a new threat that is  emerging. It authorizes the President to enter into a cooperative  agreement--meaning it benefits them and us--to counter unmanned aerial  vehicles and the threat they pose. The reason for that is that on  February 10 of last year, an Iranian drone was shot down by Israel.  Everyone has every reason to believe that these unmanned aerial  vehicles are the next threat that will be deployed both in the  battlefield and potentially by terrorists. We would work with Israel,  which faces an immediate threat, to develop counters to that. Today, we  don't have good counters to that.   Above all else, it makes one more very clear policy statement that  has been the linchpin of our support for Israel, which is that it is  the policy of the United States to ensure that Israel maintains its  ability to counter and defeat any credible conventional military or  emerging threat from any state or possible coalition of states or from  nonstate actors while sustaining minimal damage and casualties through  the use of superior military means possessed in sufficient quantities,  including weapons, command, control, communication, intelligence,  surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities that in their technical  characteristics are superior in capability to those of such other  individual or possible coalition states or nonstate actors.   Here is what this means: It is the policy of the United States to  ensure that Israel's weapons and systems are better than anyone else's  in the region. Whatever anybody else has we will sell to Israel and  allow it to access and acquire something better so that it will always  have an advantage. If anyone in that region believes it could beat  Israel in a war, one will try to beat Israel in a war. That was the  history from its very birth, and that was the lesson of 1967 and the  lesson of 1973. We don't want that to happen again. That is what this  bill does. That is why it has so much support. That is why it is so  important for us to move to debate on this issue.   It also tackles this economic warfare. What is included in this is a  bill we filed last year with Senator Manchin, called the Combating BDS  Act. By the way, last year, the Banking chairman, Senator Crapo of  Idaho, and the ranking member, Senator Brown of Ohio, discharged this  bill from their committee, and they didn't even require a hearing. They  did it late last year after running it by all of their members, and we  tried to pass it in the Senate by a voice vote but were unable to  because of one Senator who blocked it.   Let me start by thanking Senators Crapo and Brown for working hard to  advance this bill last year, as well as for coauthoring with me last  year the new Hezbollah sanctions law, known as the Hizballah  International Financing Prevention Amendments Act of 2018. We  strengthened the sanctions on Hezbollah that we had passed in the 2  years previous.   First of all, let me tell you what it doesn't do. It does not outlaw  BDS. If you are an American company and you want to boycott or divest  from Israel, this doesn't make it illegal. It doesn't stop you from  doing it. It only says that if there is some city or county or State in  this country that wants to support Israel, it has a right to say it is  not going to buy services or goods from any company that is boycotting  or divesting from Israel. That is all it does. It gives cities and  counties like these--26 States--the opportunity to have their elected  officials who respond to the people of those States or cities or  counties who elected them to make decisions that they are not going to  do business with people who don't do business with Israel and boycott  Israel. In essence, it allows us to boycott the boycotters.   Some say that it is an infringement on the First Amendment. First, I  will tell you that the First Amendment protects speech and actions that  function in the form of speech. This is not an effort to silence speech  nor is this an effort, by the way, to defeat an effort per se. It is an  effort to defend the right to counterspeak. The First Amendment is a  two-way street. You have a right to express your views on something,  but others have a right to respond. You have a right to boycott a  country, and people have a right to boycott you. That is what this law  allows them to do. It is that simple.   By the way, this is not some domestic debate. They are not trying to  influence some law that we are passing here with BDS. They are not  trying to influence your opinions on a topic. They are trying to  influence the foreign policy of another country. This is not  traditional free speech. The courts have weighed in on this in the  past, and the courts have given Congress and the executive branch  extraordinary discretion on the setting of foreign policy. When a  company weighs in on BDS, it is not trying to influence a domestic  debate or a topic of opinion here in the U.S. political system; it is  trying to punish a nation-state so that the state changes its policies  in another country.   There is an open question about whether the First Amendment even  covers that. The bill basically says, notwithstanding whatever is in  the bill, nothing in the bill shall be construed to invade or to hurt  anyone's First Amendment rights. So anyone who hides behind the idea  that this is designed to silence speech isn't being truthful.   This does not outlaw BDS. If you want to boycott or divest from  Israel, you can. It is legal. We are not outlawing that as that would  be an infringement. All we are saying is, if you are going to boycott  Israel, those who support Israel will have a right to boycott you. That  includes cities and counties and States that don't want to buy stuff  from you. That is what this bill does. That is why it enjoys this broad  bipartisan support.   Some have asked me to take it out of this bill and have said it is  the reason we are not moving to it. At least, that is what I heard  earlier. Now there is another reason. It is absurd. Vote against it and  then justify it, but if you  [[Page S97]]  are trying to shield the boycotters, that is the de facto support of  BDS, in my opinion, and I think it is important for us to pass it.   I emphasize again that this was not overly controversial 2 weeks ago.  Look at the list of people who supported this bill last year: the  majority leader, the minority leader, the Foreign Relations Committee  chairman, the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, the  Senate Finance Committee chairman, and the ranking member of the  Finance Committee. Democratic and Republican leaders on multiple  committees and at the very top of this Chamber support this bill. Yet,  somehow, we can't even proceed to debate on this bill.    You may say, ``Well, wait until the shutdown is over,'' because that  is the argument that is being used now--that we shouldn't move to  anything until we deal with the shutdown. I don't like the shutdown. I  hope it ends tonight or tomorrow morning. Yet this is not just any  other issue. There is a credible argument to be made that there is a  time sensitivity to this because the enemies of Israel aren't sitting  around, waiting. This could happen at any moment. These aren't the  kinds of things that build up. Hezbollah's desire to destroy Israel is  longstanding, and what they choose to do about it will not wait for the  U.S. Senate to deal with other topics. This is an immediate threat. It  is right before us, and it deserves our immediate reaction.   This could rapidly escalate, but I am not going to take up another 30  minutes to describe all of the scenarios under which that could happen.  Yet I will give you one that is not out of the realm of possibility.  Now that they know that the United States is going to be withdrawing  from Syria, the Israelis could decide--and, I believe, rightfully so-- that for their own defense, they will need to start attacking even more  inside Syria. Regarding those supply lanes that Iran is using, every  time they see a truck with rockets on it, they are going to blow up the  truck. Every time they see IRGC or Hezbollah militias forming anywhere  near their border, they are going to hit them. They are now going to  step up those attacks because we are not there anymore. Iran is going  to fill that void, so they are going to have to step up their attacks.   At some point, Iran and/or Hezbollah is going to respond to those  stepped-up attacks with attacks of its own, at which point Israel is  going to respond with even bigger attacks. Then the cycle of escalation  will begin. Then very quickly--before you know it--in this region, we  could have a shooting war, not a war of words and not a vote at the  U.N., but rockets and missiles being fired at one another from Lebanon  or from Syria into Israel, with Israel's responding back into Syria and  Israel's responding back into Lebanon. In fact, Israel has said that  all of Lebanon is on the target list since now Hezbollah and the  current President of Lebanon have created a political alliance. You  also have these other countries running around inside Syria, including  the Russians now and the Turks up to the north. There is the potential  that their troops would get caught in the firefight in their eliciting  a response back to Israel. Before you know it, we could have a  multistate, multiparty, all-out war in the Middle East. The possibility  of that happening is not farfetched.   I say this to you today with no pleasure. There will be another  Israel-Hezbollah war. It is just a matter of time. Yet the next one  will be far more deadly. It is incumbent upon us to do what we can.  There are things we cannot do, and there are things we can do. It is  incumbent upon us to prolong it and to prevent it for as long as  possible. One of the things we can do to help prevent that or to extend  the time before that happens is to make it very clear to Hezbollah and  Iran and everyone else that if they take on Israel, we will support  Israel. That is what this bill is designed to do. It is not just to  send that message but to put in place that reality.   Given the tinderbox that is the Middle East and given the  unpredictability of the various actors involved, particularly those  that hate Israel, why would we not move immediately to address  something like that? Why are we not capable of voting on something that  will probably get 80 votes here and still deal with the government  shutdown?   The last time we had a government shutdown, we were still voting on  bills that had nothing to do with the government shutdown. When the  other party was in charge, we were doing that. There is no precedent  for doing it. I believe that it is possible for us to do both, and that  is what we should do. This isn't tax reform or healthcare reform. This  is something that is urgent and immediate and requires our attention  because of the unpredictability of foreign events today and because of  the unpredictability of this part of the world.   I know, at some point here soon, that the leader will bring up for a  second time a vote on the motion to proceed. It is not even a vote on  the bill. It is a motion to begin debate on this bill. Nothing else is  going on around here. Let them continue to meet and have a dialogue and  talk about how to get us out of this shutdown. I hope we do. I hope  that happens. Yet don't shut down the Senate, particularly on a topic  of this importance, because these events will not wait for us. It is  important for us to act.   Please don't go around asking people to stand up to this  administration's foreign policies that we don't agree with--when we at  least offer a counter or something to diminish its negative impacts-- and respond with obstruction and not just obstruction because of policy  but with obstruction in order to make a political point or to avoid a  vote that three or four Senators might not want to take. I don't think  that makes a lot of sense.   I think, when it comes to the issues of national security and foreign  policy, we should try, to the extent possible, to remove them from the  daily grind and back-and-forth of American politics because the  repercussions are dramatic. That is the one thing that makes national  security and foreign policy different from domestic policy. You can  always go back and change a bad tax law. You can always go back and  change a bad healthcare law. You can always go back and make changes to  a bad banking law. You can't undo history. You can't undo wars once  they have started. You can't undo carnage once it has occurred. Foreign  policy is often irreversible, and once mistakes are made, you have to  do the best you can with the hand you have been dealt.   That is why I hope that on this one, we stop playing games, that we  get on this bill, and that we pass it so that even as this debate about  the shutdown continues, we will make clear to the world and we will  make clear to her enemies that we stand with Israel. We always have and  we always will across party lines. We may bicker and fight about many  things, but when it comes to the support of Israel, we are united-- House and Senate Republicans and Democrats and the White House--in the  support of our strongest ally in the region and of one of our strongest  allies in the entire world.   I yield the floor.
