 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I call up my motion to instruct  conferees, which is at the desk.    Madam President, this is truly one of the more  inappropriate additions that the House made to this bill: to ban the  production of farming of mink for the production of fur. I have no idea  why they have included it here. It makes no sense to be included.  Actually, in Wisconsin, it supports hundreds of jobs and produces  exports to China.   So my motion simply instructs the conferees to reject any proposal  that would ban mink farming.   I want to thank Senators Romney, Daines, and Boozman for their  support of this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to support American  farmers by voting in favor of this motion to instruct.
