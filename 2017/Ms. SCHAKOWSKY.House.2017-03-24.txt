 Mr. Speaker, I sincerely ask my Republican  colleagues: Did you really come here to take health care away from 24  million people?   Over 40,000 people in my district will lose their coverage.   Did you come to Congress to make insurance more expensive for my  constituent, Mary, who has a preexisting condition and now pays half of  what she used to pay for insurance because of the tax credits she got  from ObamaCare?   Did you come to Congress to impose a crippling age tax on Americans  50 to 60 years old?   Your bill would increase their premiums an average of $8,000 a year.  According to the Congressional Budget Office, within 10 years, nearly  30 percent of those 50-to 64-year-olds would be without any insurance.   Did you really come to Congress to take nursing home and home care  away from the elderly and the disabled?   Did you get elected in order to take health care from mothers?   Your bill would kick them off of Medicaid if they don't find a job 60  days after they give birth.   We have heard over and over that patients need choices and should be  empowered to choose the care that they want. But, apparently, that  doesn't apply to women. The bill would block millions of women from  choosing Planned Parenthood, a trusted healthcare provider to 2.5  million patients every year.   The American people are not clamoring for you to repeal ObamaCare.  Only 17 percent of Americans say that you should vote to repeal  ObamaCare. The average American overwhelmingly wants you to vote  ``no.''
