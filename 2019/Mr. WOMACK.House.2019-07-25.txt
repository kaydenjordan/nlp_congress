 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, one of the most fundamental duties of Congress is to  fund the government. I am pleased that, after months of uncertainty, a  budget agreement has been reached, thanks to the work of the President,  his Cabinet, and the Congress.   This 2-year funding deal ends the threat of sequestration and  continues to improve our military strength. It doubles down on our  commitment to serving and protecting the American people by enhancing  the United States' defense capabilities and ensuring our courageous  troops have the resources they need to deter, fight, and win.   It wasn't that long ago, Mr. Speaker, that our military was in the  midst of a readiness crisis. It would be irresponsible, in my strong  opinion, to retreat back to that point. This deal helps us prevent  that.   The legislation averts a $71 billion cut to defense that would have  taken place early next year, absent an agreement.   Mr. Speaker, I am a 30-year veteran of the Arkansas National Guard,  one deployment under my belt. I chair the Board of Visitors at the  United States Military Academy at West Point, and I recognize the rise  of the threat facing us around the globe. I also understand the  devastation a sequester would cause.   It is not something that we can allow to happen, and I have seen the  numbers floating around about what Congress is about to do.  [[Page H7402]]    Let me be clear, Mr. Speaker. The sequester numbers that would have  taken place if this Congress didn't act were never going to happen.  Anybody who suggests that we were going to cut $71 billion from  national defense is not being intellectually honest. We were not going  to allow that to happen.   Mr. Speaker, this bill also takes the chaos that would ensue  following another government shutdown off the table. Nobody in this  room likes continuing resolutions or big omnibus packages. We take  those off the table.   Now, I will be honest. This is not a perfect deal. It is not the bill  I would have written if I were just a Congress of one. No compromise in  any serious negotiation where there are two competing sides will ever  result in a perfect outcome. But it does allow us to move forward with  a measure of stability for our economy.   Again, I highlight that these negotiations brought forward an  important agreement in which there will be no poison pills in the  funding bills for this year or next and a concerted effort to strive  toward no shutdowns and no large omnibus packages.   Any compromise involves hard choices. I don't know of a committee in  the Congress, in the House of Representatives, that has to make more  hard choices than the people who gather around that Committee on  Appropriations markup room.   For our distinguished chairwoman, Nita Lowey, and all of my fellow  appropriators who have a lot of requests, there are never enough  resources to meet all of them, but we have to make some very hard  choices.   Then, let's not forget the real and practical impact of our current  debt and the deficits that add to that debt. We need to put America  back on a responsible fiscal path. While I support the progress we have  made in this bill, I feel strongly that Congress must address the  looming crisis of our debt for our children and our grandchildren.    But here is an inconvenient truth: Total discretionary spending, when  I came to Congress, was almost $1.3 trillion. That was what we spent on  the discretionary budget of the U.S. Government. That is the part of  government that most people identify with. Next year, under this caps  agreement, discretionary spending is going to be just under $1.4  trillion. That is not much of an increase over a 10-year period.   To put it in perspective, discretionary spending was 9 percent of GDP  when I came to Congress. It is down to 6 percent now.   If you look at the CBO report that we highlighted earlier this year,  CBO says--their words--as a percentage of the economy, discretionary  spending is going down, and mandatory spending continues to skyrocket.   The year before I came to Congress, mandatory spending was 61 percent  of the Federal budget. Today, it is about 70 percent of the Federal  budget.   Mandatory spending is putting intense pressure on a lot of programs  on the discretionary side that a lot of America relies on.   I think we have to fix that. I don't know what the answer is, but I  do know this, Mr. Speaker. I know one of the answers is that we have to  get back to regular order.   I can't say it any clearer. We haven't done the budget process that  is enshrined in the 1974 Budget Act since I have been in Congress. In  fact, most people in Congress look at how we do things now--CRs, omnis,  shutdowns, those kinds of things--as normal. It is anything but normal.   I know my friend, Mr. Yarmuth, and I worked very hard, as did Mrs.  Lowey, on the Joint Select Committee on Budget Process Reform last  year. We got close. We made a few recommendations. We couldn't quite  meet the threshold for reporting, but we took a stab at it. I hope we  can elevate that discussion in the 116th Congress and have some success  doing that.   Today, we are here to vote on a bipartisan bill, a bill that has been  carefully negotiated over weeks with competing interests. The  administration has been involved, with Mr. Mnuchin representing the  President, and the four corners of leadership. Not the most ideal way  to come up with an answer or a solution, but it is what we have today.   Mr. Speaker, with all the things that we have in front of us, let's  take the chaos off the table, and let's pass this deal. Then, maybe-- maybe--we can elevate the conversation to talk about the real drivers  of the deficit and the debt in this country when we come back and as we  move into the remainder of this year.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), the distinguished Republican whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Fort Worth, Texas (Ms. Granger), the ranking member on the House  Appropriations Committee and a former mayor. I believe mayors have a  pretty good idea of what it takes to get things done when there are  competing interests.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Corona, California (Mr. Calvert), who is the ranking member on the  Appropriations Committee that funds the national defense of this  country.    Mr. Speaker, on occasion it is important to reach out to  the rural areas of our country for wisdom, and we are going to reach  out to west Texas, near Clarendon, Texas. I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry), my friend, the Republican lead  on the House Armed Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   A constant theme on our side has been that of national security, a  reason why we should support the agreement that has been hammered out  between the administration and the four corners of leadership in the  House and the Senate, and I stand by that.   We have had speakers from the House Armed Services Committee, the  House Appropriations Committee, Defense Subcommittee and so on, and it  is an important reason because of how much money it commands of Federal  taxpayer money to actually protect, secure, and defend the United  States of America.   But, Mr. Speaker, one of the discussions, one of the debates we are  not having is about the true drivers of the deficit and the debt, and  that is a conversation that I would like to introduce in these  proceedings today. I brought a chart with me.   As I was preparing my remarks today, I got to thinking: What were the  numbers back in 2010 when I first sought office in the House of  Representatives versus what we are talking about today?   So we have a snapshot in time of 2010 and a snapshot in time of what  we are debating today. Mr. Speaker, I direct your attention to this  chart because, in 2010, discretionary spending, which is the spending  that most of us kind of relate to the Federal Government, everything  from keeping the lights on at this Capitol to paying for the men and  women who are downrange defending our freedoms, was a little over $1.2  trillion in 2010.                                time  1445    The number that we are debating today and that others have been  critical of is just under $1.4 trillion. It is  [[Page H7406]]  $1.37 trillion. It represents an increase of $114 billion in 10 years.  Most people would probably say that, given 10 years--we had a couple of  years there where we had trouble with our economy--a percentage  increase like that might be within reason.   Now, Mr. Speaker, I want to direct your attention to the mandatory  side of the spending. It has come up a couple of times in our  discussion today, the true driver of the deficit and the debt.   When I came to Congress in 2011, the 2016 number was $2.1 trillion.  Today, not part of this discussion, mandatory spending is just under  $3.3 trillion. Mr. Speaker, that is an increase of almost $1.2 trillion  in 10 years. We are not having that discussion today.   I am reminded of the old Bronx-born bank robber, Willie Sutton, Mr.  Speaker, who when captured, legend has it, was asked, ``Why do you rob  banks?'' He said, ``Because that's where the money is.''   If we are going to have a meaningful discussion, a constructive  discussion about how we put the balance sheet of the U.S. Government  back in order, we cannot have an intellectually honest conversation if  we are ignoring the bottom line here. In 10 years, mandatory spending  has grown 10 times the rate of discretionary spending, yet we are not  talking about that today.   Mr. Speaker, I am hoping that when this is all finished, and we pass  this bill and put our country on a pretty solid budgetary framework for  the next couple of years, that maybe we can sit down to talk about the  true drivers of the deficit and the debt.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to read from a book that we are all very familiar  with, the Constitution of the United States, for just a moment. One of  my concerns about what we are doing today, though I support the  outcome, is written in Section 8 of Article I of the Constitution:  ``The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties,  imposts and excises, to pay the debts and provide for the common  defense and general welfare of the United States; but all duties,  imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States.''    Article I, Section 8, it lays it out pretty simply that the Congress  of the United States has the power of the purse.   While I support what we are doing today because I recognize the  importance of getting chaos and uncertainty off the table for the  reasons already stated in this debate, I am disappointed that the  agreement was hammered out by basically four people, four plus one, the  administration and four Members of the Congress referenced in Article  I, Section 8.   That is our job. The only meaningful debate that has happened over  discretionary spending in this country happened only in this Chamber  during the debates on appropriations that Mr. Hoyer referred to  earlier. We have had those discussions.   I don't agree with everything in those appropriations bills. I never  have. But at least we have had that debate on the floor of the House.  They have not had that debate on the floor of the Senate.   Here we are today, relying on an agreement hammered out by leaders of  both parties in both Chambers with a representative from the  administration. To me, Mr. Speaker, that flies in the face of what  Article I, Section 8 says it should be like.   Again, I hope and pray that, over time, once we put this issue behind  us, realizing that mandatory spending is growing at 10 times the rate  of discretionary spending, the very fight that we are having today on  this floor, maybe we can get back to regular order, do some legitimate  budget process reform so Members like   John Yarmuth and myself can  work together jointly to produce budgets, engage in debates on the  floor of the people's House, and arrive at outcomes that probably we  are all going to agree has stuff in it we like and stuff in it we don't  like.   That is the way the Framers intended this Chamber to be. I am hopeful  that we will get there eventually.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McCarthy), the distinguished Republican leader of the  United States House of Representatives; my friend and colleague from  Bakersfield, California; and a man that I know has a great desire to  see regular order played out on the floor of this House and an  opportunity to go back to the budget process and appropriations process  that we once knew in this great Chamber.                                time  1500     Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, it is not the most ideal situation to be in. As I  reflect back on the many days I spent in my district--and I am about to  go back there for the August recess, and I am going to circulate around  my district and have some townhall meetings and engage in conversation.  I know this subject is going to come up.   I already know that most people are going to say: Look, you guys have  a spending problem up there in Washington. I hear that a lot, and I  would agree with that. Very few people say that we have a revenue  problem, but we do have a spending problem.   Mr. Speaker, you can bet your bottom dollar that I am going to be  carrying this chart with me that I brought up earlier that shows the  big difference between the mandatory side of Federal spending and what  we are discussing here today about a $1.37 trillion discretionary  budget.   For all of the reasons that have been mentioned today by my  colleagues, namely, national security, the ability to give our Pentagon  certainty over the next 2 years as we continue to rebuild the readiness  of the men and women who, on a voluntary basis, might I add, put their  hand up and say, ``I will go anywhere, anytime, to defend the  principles of freedom''--they make that pledge willingly. They are not  conscripted into the service. They make it on a voluntary basis.   The least that we should be able to do is to make sure that the  resources are there that properly man the force, train the force, and  equip the force so that we never, ever face a fight that is fair. We  should always have the advantage.   So, for these reasons, Mr. Speaker, and with kind of a measure of  hope that going through this process, as we have today, maybe it will  inspire both sides of the aisle here and at the other  [[Page H7409]]  end of this building to work together to improve our processes so that  it is the House and the Senate, collectively, doing the work that is  prescribed as our fundamental duty in Article I, Section 8 of the  United States Constitution, Mr. Speaker, I encourage a ``yes'' vote on  this bill.   Let's put this issue behind us. Let's move on to the more important  things of our country, to include deficits and debt and the drivers  that actually are making the situation much worse.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, let me say, for the record, that the feeling  is mutual. I admire and appreciate the great relationship that Mr.  Yarmuth and I have.
