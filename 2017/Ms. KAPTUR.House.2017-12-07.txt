 Mr. Speaker, the American public has caught on to our  Republican colleagues' tax scam. They know their bill takes from our  struggling middle class and rewards bountifully the billionaire class  and transnational corporations--the very ones that will use the money  to ship more of our jobs overseas.   In fact, the only permanent tax giveaways this bill will cause are  for big corporations. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates their  bill will add $1 trillion additionally to our debt minimum, and that  doesn't count the interest.   This chart shows over time how much more of our gross domestic  product--our economic prowess, what we produce every year in our  country--is related to the national debt. The national debt has been  exploding over time. Their bill makes it worse, not better. We should  not so highly leverage our economy.   Their bill flies in the face of fiscal responsibility, and to what  end? The bill would decrease Federal revenue by a projected $5.5  trillion, tragically putting our national economic security at grave  risk. What is put on the table for cuts? Social Security, Medicare, and  Medicaid--all on the chopping block.    There is little in the Republican bill good for average Americans.  With their legislation, our Republican colleagues will actually push  America into deeper financial servitude to foreign investors buying our  debt like China and Saudi Arabia. How does this make America great  again? Foreign investors will be financing more and more of U.S. debt.   This chart shows how much now is being financed by foreign interests.  Way back, the American people used to buy Treasury securities, and we  financed our own debt. But over time, what has happened is that because  we were leveraging our economy too highly with debt--borrowed money-- foreign interests started to buy our securities. They now own nearly  half. Do you know what? That means we owe not just the principal they  have borrowed, but interest. So over time, the hole is being dug  deeper, and foreign interests literally have now become the largest  holder of U.S. debt.   Under their scheme, foreign nations will snap up and buy more U.S.  Treasury securities, and this will rob future investments that would  benefit Americans because we are required to pay back not just the  principal but the interest to foreign creditors. Imagine if that money  that we are paying on interest to foreign creditors could actually be  invested here in America through tax cuts that actually target middle  class families to increase their buying power. But with this massive  debt, the American Government is sliding on a slippery slope more  beholden to foreign creditors, not the American people.   China is now our largest foreign creditor. If you look at the debt  that we owe, you will see China has been growing as an owner of the  United States of America. Over time, they already own $1.2 trillion  along with other Asian powers, or 19 percent of our foreign-owned debt.  Our taxpayers are paying China principal plus interest--not a good  formula for American independence.   Yet China's authorities are not hesitant to undermine American  interests starting with democracy itself. But on economic issues, they  dump steel to such an excessive level on global markets that it has  crushed our domestic steel industry. They manipulate their currency to  advantage the yuan, and they continue to rob intellectual property from  American companies and universities every day. Being in the pocket of  China to finance our debt is not in America's interest.   Other top countries buying U.S. debt include--get ready for this--the  Cayman Islands with $260 billion, and India and Saudi Arabia with  between $135 billion and $248 billion; and that is a conservative  estimate. Even Russia--Russia--owns $86.2 billion of our debt--a  country that interfered in our election process and in our closest  allies in Europe's elections.   America best be careful because we are ending up in foreign servitude  through the ownership of the U.S. debt. Defeating the Republican tax  plan is one way to start righting the ship of state.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, the International Olympic Committee has  banned Russia from the 2018 Winter Olympics due to rampant and state- backed doping. The Olympic Committee says that Russia's scale of  cheating is unprecedented.   Unfortunately, this is yet another example that the enemy of  democracy knows no limits under the Putin regime. Russia's Government  and its corruption--some say depravity--is so pervasive that it even  tarnishes the dignified and ancient tradition of the Olympic Games.   Russia dishonors athletes around the world who make countless  sacrifices and give their blood, sweat, and tears to compete. While  this decision rightly penalizes Russia, Russia is looking ahead to host  the 2018 World Cup in soccer. Putin will relish this global platform to  spew out his propaganda to the world while thousands of Ukrainians are  killed and millions more throughout central Europe are stifled under  his repressive thumb.   The global community must be on alert. We must stand for liberty. We  must counter Russia's corruption, interference, and aggression in all  its forms.   As the 2018 World Cup nears, I call upon the international community  to choose again an honorable field on which the world's athletes can  compete.   Mr. Speaker, I include in today's Record a news article from The New  York Times dated December 5, 2017, titled ``Russia Banned from Winter  Olympics by IOC.''                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member, Congresswoman  Lowey from New York, for the phenomenal job that she has done this  year, and commend Chairman Frelinghuysen for trying to herd cattle on a  very vast range.   Mr. Speaker, here we are again, mere hours away from a needless  shutdown, a cliff created by the Republican majority.   Already we are 3 months into the 2018 fiscal year, and Congress is no  closer to finalizing one of our chief constitutional responsibilities,  and that is funding the departments of our Nation to do their jobs.   For a nation at war, the Department of Defense, the largest  Department in this bill, can't let contracts because of this adolescent  dallying by Congress.   I rise with frustration today, as the Appropriations Committee's  subcommittees did their job over the last year. They toiled away for  months, chipping away in each subcommittee bill, but that proved to be  a fruitless effort since we had no agreed upon budget caps within which  to make those decisions, because the Republican majority produced no  budget.   There is simply no good reason why we are here again kicking  decisions down the road, and for 2 weeks. Let me remind my colleagues,  we were over 7 months late last fiscal year before we fully funded our  government.   This fits and starts, fits and starts surely is not what the American  people deserve. For example, we know a million people, our fellow  citizens in Puerto Rico, still don't have energy and power, and vast  numbers lack access to fresh drinking water. We need that FEMA budget  certain so contracts can be let for 2018. Federal funding for the  Children's Health Insurance Program covering more than 220,000 children  in Ohio expired 68 days ago.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, this disruption to those responsible for managing  healthcare adds an unnecessary burden under the circumstances they  confront daily. Many States are now preparing to shut down their CHIP  program in case Congress doesn't act. How is that for a Christmas or  Hanukkah present to the children of America?   The Republican majority's priorities are out of line, and no  leadership on budgetary caps, no leadership on working with Democrats  to find common ground on funding priorities, no leadership to finalize  government funding for the entire 2018 fiscal year, which began 3  months ago. Unacceptable.   Instead, Republicans choose to avoid doing what is critical. Rather  than pass a tax bill that rewards the wealthiest in our country and  wreaks havoc on America's hardworking middle class families, they ought  to do the dutiful work of managing the funds to operate the departments  that serve the people of the United States. The American people are  worried, Mr. Speaker, and the majority has abdicated their leadership.   I urge my colleagues to keep their powder dry on any hasty vote on  this bill, and demand the majority come to the table to finalize the  fiscal year 2018 spending plan.
