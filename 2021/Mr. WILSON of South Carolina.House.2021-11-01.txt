 Mr. Speaker, the Biden economy is  moving in the wrong direction, destroying jobs and destroying small  businesses.   In the Commerce Department report last week, the estimated third  quarter Gross Domestic Product--the value of all goods and services  produced in America--came in at a low 2 percent, lower than the last  quarter, with Americans making less, below inflation.   Congressman Kevin Brady, the Republican leader of the House Ways and  Means Committee, has said that there is more proof that President Biden  is bungling the recovery, and now faces serious questions about his  competency to heal our economy.   Economic growth has already peaked for President Biden's Presidency,  and now he is nearly a million jobs short of his promises. Democrat  elite think they are smarter than anyone, and they think Democrat  voters are ignorant to believe that $3.5 trillion in spending costs  zero.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from Afghanistan to America due to Biden ignoring military advice.                            ____________________
