 Mr. Speaker, most Americans may not be aware of  what is taking place by our government. Our government is spying on  Americans and I think it is in violation of the U.S. Constitution.   In all of the talk that we have been having the last few weeks, we  are missing one of the most basic issues that we hold dear: the right  of privacy.   Let me explain how it is taking place.   Go back to Snowden. We didn't know about all of the spying going on  in America until Snowden revealed that. I am no fan of his. I think he  ought to be prosecuted, but we know information about our government  spying on our Americans because of his disclosures.   Let me talk about specifically the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance  Act.   What is that?   FISA allows our government to spy on foreign agents, which includes  terrorists, primarily overseas. So what happens is the government goes  to a FISA court.   What is that?   It is a secret court that operates in secret that issues secret  warrants.   I personally have an issue with that because it reminds me too much  of the Star Chamber in England where they operated in secret and tried  people in secret.   As a former judge, I am very concerned about the loss of our Fourth  Amendment right of privacy in the United States based on this law.  Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act courts operate in secret and  issue warrants to go after bad guys overseas. So they seize that  information and they put it in a database.   Here is what happens: while seizing that information of  communication--maybe an al-Qaida guy talking to another al-Qaida guy-- they put that information in a database, but also that information is  seized on Americans. Incidental is what they call that. That may be a  communication with an American that has nothing to do with terrorism.  It could be something else. So that information is seized on Americans  based on this warrant by a FISA judge on foreigners. The information is  put in the database.   Here is what happens: occasionally, the government decides to go into  that database that was seized without a Fourth Amendment warrant and  see how many times a name comes up. They call it a query. That is  another fancy name for a search. So they search that database to see  how many times Bobby Oglethorpe's name pops up. Then they go to their  administrative folks and get a piece of paper that allows them then a  second search.   They search that database to see if Bobby Oglethorpe is committing  crimes in the U.S., having nothing to do with terrorism. Maybe it is  bank robbery, maybe it is IRS fraud, maybe it violates other laws in  the United States.   So then they seize that information, and we don't know how many times  they do that. The Judiciary Committee has asked the Justice Department:  How many times have you done that?   They refuse to tell us.   Suspicious, isn't it?   I will tell you how many times it is. According to The Washington  Post, 90 percent of the account holders whose communications were  collected were not the targets, the bad guys overseas. Ninety percent  of them. Many of them were Americans. Nearly half of the surveillance  files contained names, email addresses, and other details that the NSA  marked as belonging to U.S. citizens or residents.   So what information are they getting?   Emails, communications, text messages. They seize that, then they go  through that database to see if Bobby Oglethorpe is a bank robber or  whatever, and all of that is done in secret. Remember, secret courts  issuing secret warrants, and they don't tell anybody about that. That  is a violation of the Fourth Amendment on Americans.   Let me read the Fourth Amendment: ``The right of the people to be  secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against  unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no  warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or  affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and  the persons or things to be seized.''   Mr. Speaker, the Fourth Amendment is sacred to this country, and I  include in the Record the Fourth Amendment.                              Amendment [IV.]         The right of the people to be secure in their persons,       houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches       and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall       issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or       affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be       searched, and the persons or things to be seized.     Mr. Speaker, in this situation, government seizes  the information without a probable cause warrant. Then they search the  information to see how many times Bobby Oglethorpe maybe has violated  other laws, and they do it without a probable cause warrant.   That is allowed under 702 of the FISA legislation. We are getting  ready to reauthorize FISA. This 702 provision should require a warrant  to search that information, a warrant to take the content of that  information and make it public, and file on Bobby Oglethorpe.   Mr. Speaker, Congress must set the standard for privacy, not the  courts; and we are called upon to fix this spying on Americans and not  allow it.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, as Americans gathered around their  Thanksgiving tables, joined hands with their families, and gave thanks  for their blessings, a Texas Highway Patrol trooper was murdered.   While returning to his patrol car during a routine traffic stop,  Trooper Damon Allen was shot in the back by a dastardly criminal, the  driver of that vehicle. Trooper Allen was working alone, as most  troopers in Texas do. The multiple shots killed Trooper Allen.   The crook had illegally procured a weapon in Trooper Allen's  homicide. The criminal, like most do, quickly fled the scene, leading  Texas Rangers and other law enforcement on a chase across Texas, but he  was finally apprehended.   Mr. Speaker, this wasn't the first time that the criminal had  targeted our men and women in uniform. A slew of previous convictions  are on his rap sheet, including drug possession, evading arrest, and  violence toward law enforcement. The killer is now where he belongs: in  the jailhouse. The bandit will face Texas justice.   Texas Department of Public Safety Officer Allen was a devoted  husband, a father of three, and a 15-year member of Texas law  enforcement. He served with courage, placing the badge--the star--over  his heart and reporting for duty every day.   We pray for Trooper Allen and his family. Trooper Allen, like all  peace officers, placed his life between us and the lawless. We should  remember him and thank God that such men have lived.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
