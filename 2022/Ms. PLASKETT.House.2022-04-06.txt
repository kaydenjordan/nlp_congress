 Mr. Speaker, the Virgin Islands and its people speak of  great resilience. We are a people rich in history and agriculture,  struggles and triumphs in the face of disenfranchisement.   March 31, 2022, marked 104 years that the Virgin Islands of the  United States have been part of the United States. Our islands were  acquired by the United States in the costliest per-acre sale in U.S.  land purchase. We became the most easterly point of the United States,  and served to protect the Caribbean Basin and the Panama Canal,  particularly during World War I.   The sale of the Danish West Indies pulled Denmark out of depression  and gave them the capital resources, gold bullion, necessary for them  to become the happiest country that we know today. The brutal slavery  and serf system that they inflicted on my ancestors, however, was not a  happy time.   During the transfer of ceremonies on March 31, 1917, the people of  the Virgin Islands, my people, were citizens of no country. All four of  my grandparents were alive and living on the island of St. Croix at the  time of the transfer.   Only qualified Danish citizens living in Denmark were able to vote in  the plebiscite.                                time  1045    Of my eight great-grandparents, I believe one may have met the land  and income requirement mandatory to be able to vote. Only one would  have been able to vote for his destiny.   And after the purchase, those living in the territory, my  grandparents, great-grandparents, aunts, uncles, my family, were  citizens of no country, nowhere, for 10 years.   Yet, after becoming citizens, Virgin Islanders came immediately to  Washington and petitioned, pleaded to be part of the draft. You see,  Virgin Islanders, like the other territories, serve and give the  ultimate sacrifice in far greater number per capita than those  Americans on the mainland. We wanted and still are willing to take on  the responsibility, not just the privilege.   Until the United States began ownership of territories, largely  comprised of minority, Black and Brown people, disenfranchisement of  territories was a temporary condition. From the 1787 Northwest  Ordinance until the acquisition of Puerto Rico, lands were deemed  territories with the expectation that they would become States.   The disenfranchisement and unequal treatment of people in the Virgin  Islands are de jure law. The Insular Cases decided at the turn of the  century in the Plessy v. Ferguson-era by the Supreme Court, established  a doctrine of separate and unequal status for overseas territories.   However, the disenfranchisement and unequal treatment continues today  through court cases in the Bush, Obama, Trump, and now Biden  administration, through their oral and written arguments to the Supreme  Court, as well as my own colleagues, Congress' unwillingness to grant  equal treatment requests made by representatives from the territories.   My fight in Washington has been to level and create equity, to  counter the many ways that such disenfranchisement affects our lives,  Federal funding, healthcare access, veterans' benefits, structural  damage after natural disasters due to longstanding unequitable funding.   It is my deepest honor to be grounded by my history, my parents, and  my ancestors from the Virgin Islands, many of whom have played an  integral role in the history of this Nation, long even before we were a  part of this country; from Denmark Vesey, leader of the Charleston,  South Carolina, slave revolt; David Levy Yulee, the first Jewish  Senator in the United States; William Leidesdorff, the founder of San  Francisco; Edward Wilmot Blyden, one of the founders of Liberia; even  today, my predecessor, the first female physician of this body as a  Member of Congress, Donna Christensen; and even this weekend, NCAA  Women's Basketball Champion, Aliyah Boston.   Our contributions to this Nation are undisputed, and 104 years after  our transfer from Denmark to the U.S. possession, our claim to full and  inviolable rights as citizens of this country are long overdue.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for all the good  work that they have done to support American small businesses during  the pandemic.   Democrats working with President Biden have helped businesses to keep  their lights on and employees on payroll.   Biden's plan has enabled a remarkable rebound in small business  activity with small business demand for labor and inventory near record  high.   The share of small businesses that have created new jobs in the first  quarter of this year is higher than at any point in the Trump  administration.   Democrats are continuing to drive stability and growth in small  businesses. H.R. 3807 is in furtherance of that. The bill provides $13  billion to establish a Hard Hit Industry's Award Program to provide  awards to small businesses across all industries and sectors that were  hardest hit by the pandemic, regardless of industry or business.   My colleagues and I are proposing solutions focused on assisting  small businesses, the true engine of our Nation's economy, to rebuild  and help our economy be better than before.                            ____________________
