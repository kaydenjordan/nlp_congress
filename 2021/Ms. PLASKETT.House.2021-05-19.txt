 Madam Speaker, the Virgin Islands of the United States  sits at the most southern, most easterly point of the United States.  Because of this geographic position and its proximity to South America  and its almost sentry lighthouse position to the rest of the Caribbean,  it has been fought over; exploited by many nations; owned by seven; and  used as a base by pirates, privateers, rum and drug runners, and even  great corporations.   Despite so much potential, the benefits of our location, climate, our  deep ports--one of the deepest in the Caribbean, our fertile soil--the  people of the Virgin Islands have not received equitable return on  investment and have instead been the spoils of others.   Our people continue to work to create economic benefits for our  homes, jobs, skills, revenue, financial independence. Our journey in  oil refining is one such chapter in that search.   In the 1960s, the Virgin Islands began refining oil. Our island of  St. Croix became the second-largest petroleum refinery in America. In  2012, the refinery closed, exacerbating the shocks of the Great  Recession, leading to unemployment rates of 18 percent. Our government  made the decision to work to bring the refinery back and, after several  years, the terminal and refinery reopened.   In the last few weeks, my office has been in contact with the EPA  regarding air emissions incidents, odors, and emissions around the  vicinity of the refinery, which threaten the health of residents and  our environment.   On May 14, the EPA ordered Limetree Bay, the owners of the terminal  and refinery, to pause all operations on the St. Croix refinery due to  multiple improperly conducted operations that present an imminent risk  to public health. Limetree Bay is in a community that is  disproportionately affected by environmental burdens, and recent  incidents have raised significant environmental justice concerns.   My office has continued to discuss with the EPA regarding the  shutdown of the refinery, which, when fully operational, contributes  tremendously to the Virgin Islands' economy. I have also been in  contact with the owners of the refinery, as well as the Virgin Islands  local government, and I will share with you all, with this Congress,  what we can do to rectify the issue.   But part of my concern and one of the reasons I came to Congress was  to create mechanisms and funding, incentives so that communities like  the Virgin Islands, places long-neglected, can have the tools, funding,  incentives, stable schools, healthcare, to create diverse sustainable  industry.   As I have said in the past, and continue to reiterate, the current  problems in my community further demonstrate the need for so many  communities like it to have a diversified economy. This would provide  flexibility. A diversified economy creates an economic health in a  community, not tied to a single industry or market sector. It also  creates and supports innovation.   Not only do companies support one another financially, but they  engender an ecosystem of new ideas and product generation. I recognize  that funding from the American Rescue Plan should not only be used by  the Virgin Island's government to undergird our most vulnerable  citizens, our children, mentally ill, our seniors; it should be used to  support creation of clean resilient jobs.   I and other Democrats recognize that we must rebuild our communities  and our economy better than before through the American Jobs Plan. Now  is the time to think boldly with a once-in-a-century investment to  create millions of good-paying jobs to ensure America can outcompete  any other country in the world.    The President has promised to deliver clean drinking water, a renewed  electric grid, high-speed broadband; build, preserve, retrofit more  than 2 million homes and commercial buildings; modernize our Nation's  schools and childcare facilities; upgrade veterans' hospitals and  Federal buildings.   The President's plan includes $20 billion for new programs that will  reconnect neighborhoods like the Virgin Islands, cut off by historic  investments, and ensure new projects increase opportunity, advance  racial equity and environmental justice, promote affordable access,  safeguard critical infrastructure and services, and defend vulnerable  communities.   President Biden will call upon Congress, our body, to ensure that new  jobs create clean energy, and manufacturing and infrastructure are open  and accessible to women and people of color. The House is working on  this. We have a historic package to build back better, creating jobs  and justice.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill, the  National Commission to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the U.S.  Capitol.    I want to thank Chairman Thompson and Ranking Member Katko for  bringing this bill to the floor.   On January 6, we witnessed one of the darkest moments in our Nation's  history when a violent mob attacked the U.S. Capitol. These individuals  desecrated the Halls of Congress, attacked law enforcement, and  attempted to stop the democratic process. The clearest way for us to  uphold our oath to defend the Constitution and protect this  institution, our democracy, from those who directly attempted to thwart  its operations, is through an independent, evenly-divided, bipartisan  commission. We need to understand not just what were the breakdowns in  security and the failures of our intelligence, but why. What are those  issues which caused fellow Americans to believe they needed to  overthrow their government?   Those who believe the former President had no culpability should not  be afraid of a commission that derives its power from both sides  equally.   I ask all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.
