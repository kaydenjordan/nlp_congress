 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 7790, the Infant  Formula Supplemental Appropriations Act.   American families are facing yet another crisis. Parents don't have  the access to the formula their children need, and they are angry and  they are frightened; and I understand why they are angry and they are  frightened.   There are reports that more than 40 percent of baby formula is sold  out across the United States. Some families are having to drive hours  just so their children don't go to bed hungry.   At a time when Americans are paying record-high gas prices, no one  can afford this.   We had the opportunity to work across the aisle on a bipartisan  solution to this crisis. Unfortunately, the text we are considering  today has not been agreed to by both sides.                                time  1945    I have four concerns about the bill. First, the bill does nothing to  force the FDA to come up with a plan to address the shortage. Second,  it does nothing to address whether Federal agencies have excess formula  that could be directed to American households. Third, it fails to  leverage the Federal Government's existing capabilities to transport  formula. Finally, the bill gives the FDA an additional $28 million,  when funds are already available to address this issue.   Two months ago, we increased the FDA's operating budget by $102  million. This included an $11 million increase specifically for  maternal and infant health and nutrition. There is also more than $1  billion that the Department of Agriculture has available to address  supply chain issues. My question is: Why can't these existing funds be  spent?   Ultimately, I fear that H.R. 7790 will not put more formula on store  shelves, and that is why I am opposing this bill. We should take the  time to do it right.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Harris), the acting ranking member of the Subcommittee on  Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and  Related Agencies.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Iowa (Mrs. Hinson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
