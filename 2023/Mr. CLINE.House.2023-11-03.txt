 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the 50th anniversary of  the Garth Newel Music Center, which is in the heart of Virginia's  Allegheny Mountains.   Garth Newel, the estate of celebrated artists and accomplished  musicians Christine and William Sergeant Kendall, has been a home to  the fine and performing arts since 1924.   In 1973, with the help of Rowe String Quartet members Luca and Arlene  Di Cecco, Ms. Kendall established the Garth Newel Music Center.   When Ms. Kendall passed in 1981, her vision lived on through the  leadership of the Di Ceccos and visiting artists.   Today, the Music Center offers world-class performances, including  the Garth Newel Piano Quartet, and educational programs.   It has received several recognitions for its contributions to the  cultural life of the Allegheny Highlands, such as the Chamber Music  America's Acclaim Award, and Garth Newel is now listed on the National  Register of Historic Places.   Congratulations, again, to the Garth Newel Music Center on its 50th  anniversary.                            ____________________
