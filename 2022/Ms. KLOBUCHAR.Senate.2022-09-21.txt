 Mr. President, I rise today in support of the DISCLOSE  Act and the need to take action to get secret money out of our  elections.   I want to thank Senator Whitehouse for his leadership on this  legislation--and testimony at the Rules Committee hearing I held on it  this summer--as well as Leader Schumer for holding this vote. Senator  Whitehouse has championed this bill since 2012, and I have been proud  to support it alongside him in every Congress.   This vote could not come at a more important time, as we are seeing  an unprecedented flood of money into our elections. Over $14 billion  was spent during the 2020 elections, the most expensive in our  country's history.   As we approach the general election in November, with 48 days left,  this is already the most expensive midterm election ever. One estimate  expects that nearly $10 billion will be spent just on political  advertising this election cycle, more than double the $4 billion in the  2018 midterm elections.   As spending on elections increases, the sources of the spending are  less accountable than ever before. One investigation found that more  than $1 billion was spent on the 2020 elections by groups that do not  disclose their donors at all.   Americans know there is way too much money in our elections, and--for  our democracy to work--we need to know where this money is coming from.  But since the Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United opened up the  flood of outside money, no significant improvements have been made to  our disclosure laws or regulations.   Unlimited, anonymous spending in our elections doesn't encourage free  speech; it drowns out the voices of the American people who are seeking  to participate. And this unrelenting secret spending will continue  unless we take action to address it, which is why we need to pass the  DISCLOSE Act.   The DISCLOSE Act would address this tidal wave of secret money by  requiring outside groups that spend in our elections to disclose their  large donors--those that contribute more than $10,000--to the public.   Importantly, the bill also makes it harder for wealthy special  interests to hide their contributions or cloak the identity of donors;  and it cracks down on the use of shell companies to conceal donations  from foreign nationals.   I held a hearing on the bill in the Rules Committee this summer,  where we heard about the effects that secret money is having on our  democracy--and why we need to pass this legislation.   Senator Whitehouse testified at that hearing, and he spoke powerfully  about the impact that secret money is having on our government-- affecting all aspects of our lives, from the makeup of our courts to  people's healthcare decisions to addressing climate change.   We also heard from Montana's Commissioner of Political Practices Jeff  Mangan, who told us how his State's version of the DISCLOSE Act passed  in 2015 with bipartisan support. I couldn't agree more that  transparency in our democracy should not be a partisan issue, and  regardless of political party, we should know who is spending in our  elections.   The American people know what is at stake, so it is no surprise that  campaign finance disclosure laws have overwhelming support. One recent  poll found that in swing States, 91 percent of likely voters-- Republicans and Democrats--support full transparency of campaign  contributions and spending in our elections. Another poll from 2019  found that, across America, 83 percent of likely voters support public  disclosure of contributions to groups involved in elections.   There is also a long history of bipartisan support for reducing the  influence of money in our democracy. In fact, the very first limits on  corporate campaign contributions in 1907, the landmark Federal Election  Campaign Act in 1972, and the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act in 2002-- which my friends and former colleagues Senators John McCain and Russ  Feingold joined together to champion--were all passed on a bipartisan  basis and signed into law by Republican Presidents.   Former Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia--never one to hide his  opinions--was also a staunch supporter of campaign finance disclosure.  In a 2010 case, Doe v. Reed, he wrote: ``For my part, I do not look  forward to a society which, thanks to the Supreme Court, campaigns  anonymously . . . hidden from public scrutiny and protected from the  accountability of criticism. This does not resemble the Home of the  Brave.''  [[Page S4910]]    Ensuring the transparency of our elections has been--and should  continue to be--a bipartisan value. These issues are at the very heart  of our democracy, and this commonsense bill would protect the right of  voters to make informed choices and know who has been trying to  influence our elections.   While we are here today to vote on legislation to counter the flood  of secret money in our elections, there is so much more we must do to  safeguard our democracy, and I continue to support this and the other  reforms in the Freedom to Vote Act.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting these measures that are  so fundamental to our system of government and voting to advance this  legislation.                            ____________________
