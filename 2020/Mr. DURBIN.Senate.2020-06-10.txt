 Madam President, I would like to follow up on the speech  just made on the floor by my colleague from South Dakota because his  observations about shortages when it comes to healthcare across America  affect not just his State, South Dakota, but certainly affect Illinois  and many other States as well.   We are in desperate need of additional doctors and nurses and  dentists and medical professionals. We are in need of more technology-- telehealth, of course, is one of those technologies--to make sure we  expand the reach of Medicare in the United States. In the midst of this  coronavirus pandemic, we understand that now more than ever. That is  why I have introduced legislation called the Health Heroes 2020 Act  with specific design to dramatically expand the number of healthcare  professionals.   There is one way to reach that goal, I believe, and that is to  incentivize medical students and dental students in America to make a  commitment to serve in areas of greatest need in this country for at  least 2 years and to remain in a reserve, if needed, for medical  emergency. What would they receive in return? Forgiveness of the cost  of their medical education.   Do you know that most doctors and dentists who graduate have a  minimum of $240,000 in additional student debt over and above the  undergraduate experience--$240,000 in debt when they become licensed  doctors and dentists? Some have even more. Imagine if those young men  and women with all this talent and all this determination want to serve  in the areas of greatest need but throw up their hands and say: I have  to pay off this loan. I have no choice but to go to a different place.   If we had the National Health Service Corps expanded to provide loans  for the cost of medical education, with the incentive that those new  medical professionals would serve in areas of great need, it would  certainly help to solve a major problem in America. We feel it in the  inner cities, but we feel it as intensely, if not more so, in the rural  and  [[Page S2844]]  smalltown areas of the Senator from South Dakota's State and my State  of Illinois. Could we work together to do this? Could we work to come  up with the money to make sure these medical professionals are there?   When we talk about doctors and nurses, don't overlook the need for  dentists. There are millions of people in my great State of Illinois  who do not have ready access to dental care. The Illinois Dental  Society once or twice each year has a free dental service weekend, and  they--usually on a Saturday--will allow any patient to come in and have  dental care given to them for nothing. People wait in a queue, in a  line overnight for this opportunity.   Can you imagine having a problem with your teeth, some pain or  discomfort or perhaps a disfigurement, and being unable to afford the  care you need? For many of these people, this is their last chance, to  wait in line all night to get in for free dental services from the  Illinois Dental Society. I have seen it. It is remarkable, and my hat  is off to the dental society and the dentists who provide these  services. What an eye-opener to see all of these people who are in  desperate need of dental care.   We need more dentists. We need to make certain that they are  accessible and affordable for Americans wherever they may live. I  support the suggestion of the Senator from South Dakota when it comes  to telehealth, but let's make sure we have the men and women on the  front end of the process who are still an important and critical and  essential part of the kind of professional medical service and dental  service we all need.   There is another way to help make sure we have enough dentists and  doctors. It is to make sure that those who are currently in the United  States in dental school or medical school, who are protected by DACA,  have a chance to remain in this country.   By way of background, 20 years ago, I introduced a bill called the  DREAM Act. The DREAM Act was designed for those brought to the United  States as children, infants, and toddlers, who were brought into this  country perhaps on a visitor's visa and overstayed their visa and  didn't file the necessary documents and soon became undocumented in  America. They didn't leave. They grew up here. They were little kids  who grew up in this country going to our schools, being part of  America, and believing America was their future.   Usually, sometime in their adolescence, their parents would sit down  and tell them the grim reality that they have no legal right to be in  this country. Despite the fact that they knew no other country, spoke  no other language, pledged allegiance to the same flag we do, they were  technically not legally in America.   We introduced the DREAM Act to give them a chance. If they completed  school and had no serious criminal issues, they would be given a chance  to become American citizens. The bill went back and forth. It would  pass the House one year and pass the Senate the next year. It would  come up the majority of the Senate but not 60 votes.    It languished until I appealed to the President of the United  States--then Barack Obama--and asked him if he would consider creating  by Executive order some protection for these young people, and he did.  This was the DACA Program, and under DACA, these same Dreamers I  mentioned earlier would pay a substantial filing fee, go through a  criminal background check, and be given, for 2 years, the--be spared of  any threat of deportation and be given the right to legally work in  this country.   How many young people showed up for this Obama DACA Program and went  through it successfully? There were 800,000. There were 800,000 from  all around the country just to get a chance to go to school, to  complete their dream, and to even serve in America's military. They  just want to be part of this country--800,000.   What was going to happen to this program when a new President named  Donald Trump came to office? The very first time I met President Trump  was just minutes after he had been sworn in as President. There was a  lunch for him--an inaugural lunch--in Statuary Hall, and I went up to  him and introduced himself.   I said: Mr. President, I am begging you, do what you can to extend  the protection of DACA to these 800,000 young people. They are counting  on it.   He leaned over, and he looked at me, and he said: Oh, Senator Durbin,  don't worry. We are going to take care of these young people.   Well, that was the President's assurance, but unfortunately he didn't  keep his word. He decided, unfortunately, to abolish the DACA Program,  saying that President Obama had no authority by Executive order to give  this kind of protection.   Then a number of people filed a case in court saying that the  Executive order of the President should or should not be sustained. It  had to be contested in court. Luckily, for the DACA recipients--800,000  of them--while the court case has been pending, they have been  protected by court order from being deported. But the decision is going  to be made by the Supreme Court, and it could be made next week or in  the 2 weeks that follow. So in the month of June, the fate of 800,000  of these young people will be decided across the street in the Supreme  Court.   These are the young people who have become an important part of  America. When the Republican Senator from South Dakota talks about  shortages in medical personnel, I hope he knows that 41,000 of those  DACA recipients are currently providing vital healthcare services in  this pandemic that we are facing as a nation, and if they are judged to  be deported and illegal to work in this country and leave, it will  leave a gap in the medical services that this country desperately,  desperately needs.   Some of these young people are incredible. Their stories are nothing  short of amazing. I would like to tell you of one here at this moment-- Mariana Galati. This is her photograph. Today, I want to tell you that  she is the 122nd Dreamer whose story I have told on the Senate floor.   Mariana came to the United States from Mexico when she was 5 years  old. She grew up in Camden, NJ. It wasn't an easy life. She grew up in  a single-parent household, and her mother did not speak English. Here  is what she told me about it:         I had to fend for myself at a young age. I feel like I       never got to have a childhood. I tried to never let that       backdrop define me or stop me from my dreams.    What was her dream? To become a nurse. While working at a bakery, she  went to a technical school to become a medical assistant, and then in  2012 President Obama created DACA. Mariana was able to work as a  medical assistant. Here is what she said about DACA:         Before DACA, I had no future, purpose, or chance of a       better life. The fear with DACA is that it can go away--an       expiration date approaching that means that I would have to       go back to the way things were. Now I understand why we are       called Dreamers--it is because before DACA all we could do       was dream of the life we wanted to have--a dream about being       ``someone.''    While working as a medical assistant, Mariana is studying to become a  nurse. She is now a junior at Rutgers University Nursing School. Here  is what she said about that experience:         To be a nurse is a way of living. I do not look at it as a       job, it is beyond that for me--it's a calling. Advocating for       and giving people a voice is a reward within itself. Helping       people in their time of need where they are most vulnerable       is a privilege.    Mariana is currently on the frontlines of fighting the COVID-19  pandemic. She is a registered medical assistant at the Jefferson Cherry  Hill Hospital COVID-19 testing center. She faces exposure to that virus  every day that she goes to work. She takes every shift that she is  offered. She said:         I have to be there. I want to be there. I am not scared,       but I am scared at the same time. I know what the risks are.    I want to thank Mariana Galati for her service. She is an immigrant  health hero. She is putting herself and her family at risk to save  American lives. She shouldn't have to worry about whether she is going  to be deported next week.   We can do better for Mariana and for thousands of other DACA  recipients just like her. They are counting on those of us who serve in  the Senate to solve this crisis that President Trump created.   I cannot imagine, as I tell the 122nd story of a Dreamer on the floor  of the Senate, that anyone listening believes we would be a better  country if Mariana were deported. That is the option that the President  has created. He has  [[Page S2845]]  failed and refused to consider any solution or any effort to rescue  people like Mariana and to give them a chance to be part of America's  future.   When we look at those in essential services, medical and social  services, it turns out that one in six of them are immigrants to this  country. I know it is not a popular thing to say to this  administration, but I have to remind him that we are a nation of  immigrants. My mother was an immigrant to this country, and her son has  been fortunate enough to be elected Senator and represent the great  State of Illinois. That is my story. That is my family's story, but it  is also America's story.    We are in this together. People from across the world have come to  this country to be part of its future. Mariana is an example--a young  woman who could have thrown up her hands and said: I am undocumented. I  am not going to have any way of legally being part of America. My  dreams are just going to be put on hold.   But she didn't. She was determined to make the best of her life. Then  when President Obama created DACA, a door opened for her that she  couldn't have imagined. She had the opportunity to move from medical  assistant to become a nurse. She is studying at Rutgers for that  purpose.   Really, Mr. President, do you think New Jersey or America would be  better if Mariana is deported out of this country?   As soon as next week, maybe even next Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court  is about to rule on the future of DACA. The President of the United  States can solve this problem if they decide that DACA is to be  abolished. He can fix this himself.   There is another person who has a critical role, too, and that is  Senator McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate. He has the  power to bring this issue to the floor of the Senate for a debate and a  vote.   The House of Representatives has already passed the Dream and Promise  Act, which would solve the challenge that would be created if the  Supreme Court abolishes the DACA Program. Are we overwhelmed with  business in the U.S. Senate, as I peer at an empty Chamber with my  wonderful speech being the only thing as an item of business at this  moment? We have time. We have more than enough time to deal with this  issue. For 800,000 protected by DACA, it is literally a life-and-death  issue.   I would appeal to Senator McConnell to use his power as the  Republican leader to solve this problem, to address this issue, to say  that, if you qualify for the DACA Program, you are going to be  protected until the end of the year or, beyond that, given an  opportunity to become citizens of the United States, a goal which I  have been seeking for the 20 years that I have worked on the Dream Act.   We know that we need the help of wonderful young people like Mariana  Galati to make this a better nation. The question is whether the  President ever will realize that or whether Senator McConnell would  make room in our schedule for us to debate this issue.   Let's get this right. Let's make sure that we have sensible  immigration policies in America. The notion of abolishing DACA and  saying to Mariana, ``you will now be deported back to a country you  cannot even remember,'' is not the answer.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr.  Markey) is necessarily absent.
