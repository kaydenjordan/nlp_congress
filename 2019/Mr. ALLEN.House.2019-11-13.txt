 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support, as others have  said, of National Apprenticeship Week.   The Republican-led Congress and President Trump jumpstarted America's  economy, making it the best in the world. There has never been a better  time to enter the workforce. However, every time I am back in the  district, I hear about the need for skilled workers.   That is why apprenticeships are absolutely vital to developing  America's future workforce. By connecting employers directly to their  future workforce, Americans have the opportunity to develop technical  skills while gaining valuable work experience.   The numbers show just how successful these programs are. Ninety-four  percent of those who complete an apprenticeship program retain  employment with an average salary of more than $70,000.   I am proud that Georgia is leading the way in career and technical  education and apprenticeships. For example, in Lyons, Georgia, Chicken  of the Sea has invested millions in state-of-the-art technology and  helped train our next generation of skilled workers through their  apprenticeship program, creating even more jobs and promoting economic  opportunity throughout Toombs County. We must continue with this  training.                            ____________________
