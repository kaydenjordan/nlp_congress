 Mr. Speaker, the new Republican healthcare  scam, again, slams good hardworking Americans with higher costs and  less healthcare coverage. Fewer people will have healthcare coverage,  and insurance companies will increase their already record profits.   And what would a Republican healthcare bill plan be without a massive  tax cut for high-paid insurance executives?   UnitedHealthcare is one of America's largest insurers and is under  investigation by the Department of Justice for defrauding Medicare and  the American people out of billions of dollars over the past decade.   On page 67, in seven words, this Republican bill gives their chief  executive officer, who made $66 million in 2014, a massive tax cut.   Mr. Speaker, this is disgusting and morally reprehensible.                            ____________________
