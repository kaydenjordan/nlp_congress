 Mr. Speaker, we are here today to honor the memory of  our dear friend and colleague, Senator Daniel Akaka.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. Gabbard).    Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from Alaska  (Mr. Young). As everyone knows, Alaska and Hawaii's relationship is  more than legendary.   (Mr. YOUNG of Alaska asked and was given permission to revise and  extend his remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentlewoman from Guam  (Ms. Bordallo).    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of my  dear friend and former colleague, Senator Daniel Kahikina Akaka.   For 36 years, Senator Akaka represented Hawaii in the Congress of the  United States. He was the first person of Native Hawaiian descent to  serve in the United States Senate.   A 22-year veteran of that body, he chaired the Committee on Veterans'  Affairs, Committee on Indian Affairs, the Homeland Security and  Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight and Government  Management, and was a senior member of the Senate Committees on  Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, and Armed Services.   Prior to serving the Senate, he proudly represented Hawaii's Second  Congressional District for 14 years in this Chamber. He fought with  humility and respect for his beloved home State of Hawaii and its  people.   A relentless champion of Native Hawaiians, an indigenous people, he  advocated for increased access to healthcare, education, and economic  opportunity. He worked to secure recognition and benefits for veterans.    Before pursuing elected office, he served in the U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers during World War II. He used the GI Bill to earn his  undergraduate and graduate degrees from the University  [[Page H3313]]  of Hawaii before teaching math, music, social studies, and serving as a  principal.   He would later transition into State government as a director of the  Hawaii Office of Economic Opportunity, focusing on policies and  programs to help alleviate poverty.   Senator Akaka's distinguished service and congressional contributions  are numerous and distinguished. He embodied the aloha spirit, and his  kindness and empathy is his greatest legacy.   Mr. Speaker, it is difficult to articulate how much he means to the  people of Hawaii. Senator Akaka represented everything that is and  could be good in all of us. He saw the best in everyone and never had a  bad word to say about anyone. If you were fortunate to meet him, as I  was humbled to do so on many occasions, you walked away feeling better  about yourself and the world. Your spirit refreshed and refocussed.   He preached that kindness and aloha must never be sacrificed to get  things done. We do not need to emulate the aggressive brinksmanship and  bullying that too often define our policy debates here. Senator Akaka  embraced bipartisanism and knew that, if we could empathize with those  we disagreed with, we were that much closer to a compromise.   Toward the end of his service in the Senate, he remarked: ``I feel  that since I came here, one of the things I've tried to do--and done it  as much as I can--was to bring about a feeling here of a spirit that  comes from Hawaii, that we call aloha spirit, because it opens things  up, it cuts down fences, it helps people to feel the need to work with  each other.''   Whenever deciding how to vote, it wasn't about looking to the left or  looking to the right, but what was inside his heart. He recalled many  instances in which he disagreed or voted differently than his friends,  but he never let a policy difference impact that friendship.   Always a schoolteacher, he was a stickler for grammar and  punctuation. Senator Akaka mentored generations of public servants. In  every office of the Hawaii delegation, you will find the Senator's  staff carrying on his mission. One of his former legislative assistants  is now my colleague in the House, who spoke earlier, Congresswoman  Tulsi Gabbard.   My legislative director, Elizabeth Songvilay, and military  legislative assistant, Dan Kouchi, were fortunate to work for the  Senator.   Liz shared a story, one of many that live on, about how the Senator  and Auntie Millie managed the annual Senate ice cream reception. They  insisted that the entire office, including committee staff, go with  them into the Senator's-only section, where Members and their immediate  family were served with no lines. Auntie Millie would walk in and tell  everyone the staff was her and the Senator's grandkids.   He maintained one of the most diverse offices on the Hill, which  usually included people of all races who definitely did not look like  they were related to the Akakas. That was the Senator, always generous  and striving for equality. There was no special line for Senators. He  considered that everyone he ever worked for was his partner and equal.   Mr. Speaker, I will forever be grateful for what Senator Akaka meant  to me as a friend and mentor. I was humbled and honored to have his  support. I urge my colleagues to honor the Senator's legacy by  committing to bipartisan leadership and civil discourse but, more  importantly, by living with aloha.   Mr. Speaker, Senator Akaka was known to break into song at special  occasions, and his favorite song was called the ``Hawaiian Lullaby,''  words by Hector Venegas and Peter Moon, music by Peter Moon. These are  the words, and they epitomize him:       Where I live, there are rainbows,      With life in the laughter of morning and starry nights.      Where I live, there are rainbows,      And flowers full of colors and birds filled with song.      I can smile when it's raining,      And touch the warmth of the Sun.      I hear children laughing in this place that I love.      Where I live, there are rainbows,      With life and the laughter of morning and starry nights.    Mr. Speaker, that is Senator Akaka.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks on the  subject of my Special Order.    I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 1 o'clock and 28 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until Monday,  April 16, 2018, at noon for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
