 Madam Speaker, last year, on August 4, 2019, around 1  a.m., a gunman opened fire on a crowded street in the Oregon district  in Dayton, Ohio.   The police officers at the scene ran toward the danger. Within a mere  32 seconds, because of the courageous acts of the police officers, the  shooter was dead. Hundreds of lives were saved.   A year later, our community is still reeling from this senseless act  of evil. Even with the police's quick action, nine lives were lost:   Lois Oglesby   Megan Betts   Saeed Saleh   Derrick Fudge   Nicholas Cumer   Thomas McNichols   Beatrice Warren-Curtis   Monica Brickhouse   Logan Turner   My community remains thankful for the quick action of the Dayton  police officers.                            ____________________
