 Mr. Chair, as if Biden's border crisis isn't bad enough,  this administration is now seeking to convert our national parks,  America's most cherished national treasures and historical sites, into  tent cities for illegal aliens.   Such actions not only debase our national heritage but blatantly  violate numerous Federal statutes, including those covering management  and protection of our national parks, NEPA, and the Administrative  Procedure Act.   How bad is this latest move to convert our national parks to  ungovernable tent cities? While Wyoming's efforts to prevent  catastrophic wildfires destroying our national forests are met with  intensive scrutiny from the unelected bureaucrats in this  administration, President Biden is categorically exempting the housing  of thousands of individuals in our national parks from any type of  environmental review.   This double standard is indefensible, and the Biden administration's  refusal to engage with Congress on this bill only confirms that fact.  We need serious reforms to end the flood of illegal immigrants into our  Nation, not half measures that fail to correct the disaster of this  administration's own making and endanger what is the very best idea  America ever had.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to protect our national parks by  voting in favor of the bill.
