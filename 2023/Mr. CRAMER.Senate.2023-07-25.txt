 Mr. President, tomorrow, thousands of people will gather  at Scheels Arena in Fargo, ND, to pay a final tribute to a hero. I wish  I could be there to celebrate his life as well. It was a life that was  well lived while being far too short. Fargo Police Officer Jake Wallin  was laid to rest on Saturday in the small Midwest town of Pequot Lakes,  MN.   Eleven days ago, on July 14, Officer Wallin was killed as he and  fellow officers Andrew Dotas, Tyler Hawes, and Zachary Robinson  responded to, really, a routine fender bender, where they were ambushed  by an uninvolved assailant who was armed with several weapons, 1,800  rounds of ammunition, and multiple homemade explosive devices--clearly  intent on going on a murder spree. Officer Robinson, the last cop  standing, swiftly responded to neutralize the threat, fatally shooting  the hate-filled killer.   Officer Wallin was murdered for simply being a cop, a peace officer,  helping ordinary people in need of assistance--a life-long public  servant gunned down simply because of the uniform and badge that he  wore. He has been, is, and will forever be a hero to our community.   Jake grew up in St. Michael, MN, and enlisted in the Minnesota  National Guard after graduating from high school. He served our country  on deployment to Iraq and Afghanistan before returning home and joining  the Fargo Police Department in April of this year--3 months on the job.   Like so many boys and girls, Jake wanted to be a police officer more  than anything. In fact, his father Jeff said in an interview that he  ``could never have stopped him'' from joining the force. He always  wanted a job with purpose behind it and said he didn't want to work  behind a desk.   He said, in fact:         I want to be doing something I can tell myself at the end       of the day that I made a difference somehow.    That, colleagues, is the quote of an American hero. We need more  heroes like Jake who are ready to answer the call.   In the time since Officer Wallin's passing, Fargo hardware stores  have experienced a phenomenon that many outside Minnesota would find  baffling. Across the city, stores are almost completely sold out of  blue light bulbs as people have rushed out to purchase them and light  their porches and their homes blue in support of Jake and the Fargo  Police Department's officers.   I wish every State were like North Dakota and every American had the  same respect and admiration for our law enforcement officers. In our  neck of the woods, we pass these values down to our children as we  teach them the importance of law and order and as we hope to inspire  them to, one day, be police officers like Officer Wallin--protecting  and serving their communities.   Our actions matter whether we want to acknowledge it or not. The end  result of ruthless attacks on the men and women in uniform, whether  with our words or actions or calls to defund the police, have never  been clearer than in what transpired in Fargo just 11 days ago.   We do not know the assailant's motives, but it is abundantly clear  that he singled out the officers in his pursuit of a sick, twisted plan  to wreak havoc in our community. He sought them out because of the job  that they were doing.   While we are slowly learning the details of this senseless, tragic  day, we know Officer Wallin is a hero who died while serving his  community. Heroes like Jake bravely respond to the call and serve  without hesitating, without knowing what might be around the corner or  at the end of the parking lot.   Kris and I are praying for the recovery of fellow officers Andrew  Dotas and Tyler Hawes, as well as bystander Karlee Koswick, the entire  Fargo Police Department, and fellow officers  [[Page S3506]]  throughout our community, our State, and our country.   We also pray that God's peace--the peace that Scripture tells us  ``passes all understanding''--will come to Jake's fiancee Winter, to  his parents Jeff and Amy, to his brother Brady, and to his brothers and  sisters in blue as they mourn this terrible loss.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Jake Wallin's obituary be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                  Obituary         Jake Ryan Wallin, 23, died in the line of duty as a Fargo       Police Officer on July 14, 2023.        He was born November 23, 1999, in South Carolina, the son       of Jeff Wallin and Amy (Shuler) Wallin.        Jake grew up in St. Michael and graduated from St. Michael-      Albertville High School and Alexandria Technical and       Community College. He attended the American Military       University. He served in the Minnesota National Guard and was       deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq before returning stateside       to make his home in Fargo, ND. He became a Fargo Police       officer in April of 2023 and was on duty at the time of his       death.        Jake wanted to live a life of purpose, where what he did       meant something at the end of the day. His short adult years       were spent in service to others. Not only to his country and       his community, he was also dedicated to and loved dearly, his       friends, family, fiancee, and his dog, Thor. His smile       brightened any room. His laughter was contagious. He enjoyed       life and all it had to offer. A life that was cut short doing       a job he loved.        Jake is survived by his loving parents, Jeff and Amy       (Shuler) Wallin, his beloved brother Brady, all of Saint       Michael; his fiancee, Winter Malone, of Fargo; his       grandparents John and Carolee Wallin of Pequot Lakes, Minn.,       and grandparents Jerry and Deborah Shuler, of Rock Hill,       South Carolina, along with his aunts, uncles, and cousins.        A funeral service will take place at Pequot Lakes High       School at 10:30 a.m. on Saturday, July 22, at 30805 Olson       Street, Pequot Lakes, MN 56472.        A private service will be held graveside at Greenwood       Cemetery in Nisswa following the service.        In lieu of flowers, please make donations to the Soldier's       6 at Soldiers6.com.        Arrangements by Kline Funeral Home, Pequot Lakes, MN.     I yield the floor.
