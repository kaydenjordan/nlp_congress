 Madam President, I thank you.   Over the course of this trial, we have heard nothing less than a  blistering, scalding indictment of President Trump's conduct. The House  managers put forward a compelling--indeed, overwhelming--case that  Donald Trump engaged in impeachable conduct. He withheld both  congressionally approved aid to our ally Ukraine and an Oval Office  meeting desperately sought by Ukraine's new President--two official  acts--in exchange for personal favors that would benefit him  politically.   Trump sought an announcement by Ukraine of baseless investigations  into bogus corruption allegations against Joe Biden, whom Donald Trump  most feared as an opponent in the 2020 Presidential election. He also  wanted Ukraine to announce an investigation into the discredited and  debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the  2016 Presidential election.   At every turn, Donald Trump refused to cooperate with and actively  obstructed Congress's investigation into his wrongdoing. His  obstruction was, in the words of the Articles of Impeachment,  ``unprecedented, categorical, and indiscriminate.''   I listened carefully to the President's lawyers as they presented  their defense case. Like my colleagues, I took pages of notes. My  colleagues were very patiently trying to hear each argument that was  being made by the defense counsel. I took notes. They took notes.   As I sat at this desk, with the seriousness and sanctity of the  proceedings thick in the air, I waited for the President's lawyers to  rebut the avalanche of evidence against their client, and I waited and  I waited. At the end of the case, I was still waiting. And that is  because the President's lawyers did nothing to rebut any of the facts  in this case--nothing. They knew what we all knew after we heard the  House managers' case. Donald Trump did it. He did it. He did exactly  what he was alleged to have done. He abused his power. He committed  impeachable crimes. He is guilty. There is no question about it--no  question at all.    There is no doubt that President Trump used his personal attorney,  Rudy Giuliani, to solicit Ukraine's interference in the 2020 election.  There is no doubt that President Trump froze the $391 million of  taxpayer dollars in Ukraine military aid and security assistance that  Congress authorized and appropriated. There is no doubt that President  Trump conditioned the release of that aid on the Ukrainian Government's  announcement of politically motivated investigations.   There is no doubt that in a July 25, 2019, telephone call, President  Trump directly solicited investigations from President Zelensky, as the  partial transcript memorialized and as Acting White House Chief of  Staff Mick Mulvaney admitted. There is no doubt that President Trump  released the aid to Ukraine only after a patriot within the  intelligence community blew the whistle on him and after several House  committees announced a joint investigation into the President's  coercive scheme. There is no doubt that the President directed and  orchestrated a coverup and the wholesale obstruction of Congress's  investigation into his wrongdoing.   Donald Trump has shown no remorse, no contrition, no recognition  whatsoever that his conduct was wrong. Instead, he has doubled down on  his abuses, gaslighting us repeatedly with the assertion that his call  with President Zelensky was ``perfect'' and by publicly urging Ukraine  and China to investigate his political rivals.   The question now before the U.S. Senate is not, What are the facts?  We know the facts. No reasonable person can dispute them. No, the  question for the Senate is, What in the pursuit of impartial justice,  as our oaths require, must we do with these facts?   To me, the answer is clear. We must vote to convict Donald Trump and  remove him from office. All the evidence shows that he has committed  impeachable offenses and is a clear and present danger to our democracy  and our national security.   But if we fail to remove Donald Trump from office, we are left with  an equally consequential question: What would prevent an acquitted  Donald Trump from abusing his power again? We all know that the answer  is nothing--nothing will. That is the answer I received from the House  managers when I asked this question during the trial. In fact, we know  that an acquittal will only embolden him.   We know that Donald Trump's phone call with Ukrainian President  Zelensky took place the day after Special Counsel Mueller testified in  the House of Representatives. The special counsel found and explained  in his House testimony that there was evidence of a criminal conspiracy  between members of the Trump campaign and Russia, but the evidence was  not sufficient to bring charges. Robert Mueller never said there was no  evidence of such a conspiracy. There was evidence. It was merely  insufficient for a prosecution.   We know that Donald Trump took this as a green light to invite  further foreign interference in our elections, which he did the very  next day.   Donald Trump has no shame. He cannot help himself. If we acquit  President Trump, he will believe himself to be accountable to no one,  and when--not if, but when--he is again faced with a choice between the  public interest and his personal interest, he will choose his personal  interest, and it will, in part, be a reckoning of our own making. A  majority in this Chamber will have made President Trump a dictator.   Then, what will we tell the American people? How will we convince  them that we still have a democracy that they should have faith in, a  system of  [[Page S830]]  checks and balances that ensures accountability, that no one is above  the law?   This weekend I asked some of my constituents what they would say on  the floor of the Senate if they could make remarks in this trial.   Jennifer Baker Jones of Woburn said it perfectly:         Wednesday's vote won't be a vindication of Trump, but an       end to the right of Congress to push back on the President.       They are giving up their balance of power.    It will be difficult because we have already ceded much of our  authority and, indeed, betrayed the public's faith in us by the conduct  of this trial.   Hope Anderson in Lowell, MA, told me:         We need to not only hold our leaders and ourselves       accountable, but seek to maintain and repair the public's       trust.    We are not here simply to protect one election in 2020. We are here  to protect all elections.   At the beginning of this trial, we each took an oath to do impartial  justice, but then we held the trial without witnesses and without  documents. We moved to vote on the Articles of Impeachment without  hearing from John Bolton, a witness whose firsthand knowledge directly  cuts the heart out of the President's case; without hearing from Mick  Mulvaney, whose fingerprints are all over this scheme; without the  emails, texts, and other documents we know exist, writings that  memorialize communications about the actions at issue here.   A trial is a search for the truth, the full truth, the whole truth.  That search for the truth requires hearing from relevant witnesses and  seeing relevant documents so that the fact finders understand the  entire story. By not pursuing this evidence, the Senate--the fact  finders--have told the American people that the truth does not matter.   They deserve better from us. Our Constitution demands it, our  democracy demands it, and I believe the vast majority of my Republican  colleagues do understand what Donald Trump did here and know that it is  very, very wrong. They know the House managers proved their case. Some  are even saying that out loud.   I believe the vast majority of my Republican colleagues recognizes  that abuse of power is an impeachable offense and that the President is  not above the law. But, unfortunately, I also believe that they are  simply too afraid of Donald Trump to do what they know is right.   Every Senator needs to consider this question. If what Donald Trump  did here is not impeachable--extorting foreign interference in our free  and fair elections and then covering it up--then, what is impeachable?   We have to have accountability. That is our duty. We cannot give  future Presidents carte blanche to tear down our Constitution and  interfere with free and fair elections, period. That has to be our  standard.   I will end my remarks with the answer I got from my constituent  Matthew Murray in Gloucester to what he would say if he were here. He  said:         I urge you, my fellow Senators, to deliberate in accordance       to your conscience and the oath you took when you were       elected, and vote to remove this dangerous President from       office.    This is the choice we must make: duty to this President or duty to  democracy. For this reason, I will be voting to remove President Trump  from office. This is an historic moment. I do not think that this body  has a choice.   Thank you, Madam President. I yield back.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
