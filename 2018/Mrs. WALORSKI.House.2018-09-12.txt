 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6561) to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services  to finalize certain proposed provisions relating to the Programs of  All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) under the Medicare and  Medicaid programs, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6561         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,  [[Page H8122]]            SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Comprehensive Care for       Seniors Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. DIRECTING THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES                     TO ISSUE A FINAL REGULATION BASED ON THE                     PROPOSED REGULATION RELATING TO THE PROGRAMS OF                     ALL-INCLUSIVE CARE FOR THE ELDERLY (PACE) UNDER                     THE MEDICARE AND MEDICAID PROGRAMS.         Not later than December 31, 2018, the Secretary of Health       and Human Services shall issue a final regulation based on       the provisions of the proposed regulation titled ``Medicare       and Medicaid Programs; Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the       Elderly (PACE)'' (81 Fed. Reg. 54666).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 6561, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6561, the Comprehensive  Care for Seniors Act of 2018. This bipartisan legislation would require  the Secretary of HHS to finalize updated regulations for the Programs  of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly, commonly known as PACE, while  still giving the Secretary the flexibility to make updates and changes  to the proposed regulation.   The PACE program is a proven model for delivering high-quality,  comprehensive, community-based healthcare for seniors. It helps seniors  whose health conditions would otherwise land them in a nursing home to  remain in their homes for as long as possible by allowing them to see  health professionals and social service providers at local PACE  centers.   There are currently 123 PACE organizations in 31 States that serve  over 45,000 Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, enabling them to live  safely in the community through the fully integrated services and  support provided. This allows beneficiaries to live longer, experience  better health, and have fewer hospital visits. Seniors facing health  challenges should have the option to receive high-quality healthcare  while continuing to live at home, and programs like St. Joseph PACE in  Mishawaka, in my district, allow them to do just that.   In 2016, CMS released a proposed rule to update the original  guidelines from 2006. A bipartisan group of Members of Congress sent  letters in November of 2017 and June of 2018 urging CMS to prioritize  updating the existing regulatory framework, which is more than a decade  old. The agency has, unfortunately, not taken any action.   This much-needed update would allow PACE programs to customize their  interdisciplinary team around the needs of each enrollee, provide more  services in the community, and give greater flexibility to partner with  community providers.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues, Representatives Jenkins,  Blumenauer, Chu, Kind, Bilirakis, Dingell, and Chris Smith, for their  hard work getting this bill to this point and their previous work on  this issue.   The PACE program is long overdue for an update. This bipartisan,  commonsense legislation will ensure improvements are made quickly so  more seniors can live in their communities longer.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleague to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time
