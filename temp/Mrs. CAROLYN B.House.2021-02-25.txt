 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  strong support of the Equality Act, long overdue legislation to  continue the progress made under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Fair  Housing Act, the Equal Opportunity Act, and other vital laws that  prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or  national origin.   These civil rights laws were passed to provide critical protections  for people who unnecessarily live in fear and were unfairly persecuted  simply because of who they were. They were passed because the promise  of America--equal treatment under the law--was nonnegotiable. It is  still nonnegotiable.   So with the Equality Act, we must take the next step to guarantee  equal protection and rights under the law for all, no matter who you  love or your gender identity. The Equality Act seeks to stamp out  discrimination against the LGBTQIA community--something that we,  unfortunately, see far too often.   Mr. Speaker, no one should face discrimination in employment,  housing, education, public space, or federally funded programs because  of who they are or who they love. I am proud to be an ally of the  LGBTQIA community and have worked to advance these rights and  protections with groups and individuals throughout my career in public  service, including hiring an out, HIV positive, gay man to serve as my  first Congressional chief of staff.   In 1986, while serving on the New York City Council, I introduced the  first bill to legally recognize same-sex partnerships in New York State  history, and I had to threaten the city of New York to even get the  bill printed. City officials said the bill was unconstitutional and  could not even be printed. And while we have made great progress--the  bill was printed and passed since then--we still have work to do.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud that New York State recently enacted  legislation to repeal the ``walking while trans'' ban, but we must  ensure that the LGBTQIA community has these protections and equal  rights all throughout the country. Access to equal rights should not  depend on your ZIP Code.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to join me today in voting to  pass the Equality Act so that every American, regardless of who they  love has equal protection under the law.                            ____________________     MALONEY of New York (for herself,               Ms. Barragan, Mr. Bishop of Georgia, Mr. Carson, Ms.               Clarke of New York, Mr. Connolly, Mr. Cuellar, Ms.               Dean, Mr. DeSaulnier, Ms. Eshoo, Mr. Espaillat, Mr.               Gomez, Mrs. Hayes, Mr. Hastings, Ms. Norton, Ms.               Jackson Lee, Mr. Jones, Ms. Kaptur, Mr. Keating, Mr.               Khanna, Mrs. Lawrence, Mr. Lynch, Ms. Meng, Ms.               Ocasio-Cortez, Mr. Payne, Ms. Pressley, Mr. Raskin,               Miss Rice of New York, Ms. Sherrill, Mr. Sires, Mr.               Soto, Mr. Suozzi, Mr. Tonko, Mr. Thompson of               Mississippi, Mr. Vela, Ms. Velazquez, Ms. Waters,               Mrs. Watson Coleman, Mr. Welch, and Mr. San Nicolas):        H.R. 1357.
