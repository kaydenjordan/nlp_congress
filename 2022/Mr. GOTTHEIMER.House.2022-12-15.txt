 Mr. Speaker, the House voted this week on the  bipartisan Sami's Law, which I am proud to have co-led, to enhance  safety for rideshare passengers.   Sami's Law has been named to honor Samantha Josephson, a senior at  the University of South Carolina, originally from New Jersey, who was  kidnapped and brutally murdered by a man pretending to be her Uber  driver.   Under Sami's Law, all rideshare services will be required to adopt  digital systems that allow passengers to verify the vehicle before they  get into the car, make it illegal to sell ridesharing signs without  authorization, and create a U.S. Department of Transportation council  to ensure safety measures stay current.   The bill also mandates State-issued front license plates for  rideshare vehicles and illuminated windshield signs visible day and  night. It will examine the prevalence of assault and abuse perpetrated  by rideshare drivers and passengers.   We must ensure our residents in New Jersey's Fifth District and  nationwide are safe when using rideshare.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support  commonsense measures like these to ensure the terrible tragedy that  befell Samantha Josephson never happens again.                            ____________________
