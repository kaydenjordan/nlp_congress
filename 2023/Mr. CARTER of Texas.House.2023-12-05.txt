 Mr. Speaker, as Christmas approaches, I rise  again to share the history behind one of the most beloved carols,  ``Away in a Manger.''   People still call this delightful song ``Luther's Cradle Hymn'' and  believe that Martin Luther sang his own children to sleep with it in  the 15th century.   None other than the song's composer, James Murray, promoted this  charming fable. We really don't know who wrote the words, only that  they appeared anonymously in a Lutheran publication titled, ``Little  Children's Book for School and Family'' in 1885.   When the music first appeared in a children's hymnal 2 years later,  it was titled, ``Luther's Cradle Hymn.'' James Murray, the editor of  the hymnal, wrote that the song was composed by Martin Luther for his  children and still sung by German mothers to their little ones.   Murray, who was a student of Lowell Mason, composer of ``Joy to the  World,'' then added his own initials at the end of the song, thereby  ensuring over a century of confusion.   The words of the hymn are as follows:       Away in a manger      No crib for a bed      The little Lord Jesus      Laid down His sweet head      The stars in the sky      Look down where He lay      The little Lord Jesus      Asleep on the hay      The cattle are lowing      The poor baby wakes      The little Lord Jesus      No crying He makes      I love Thee, Lord Jesus      Look down from the sky      And stay by my side      'Til morning is nigh      Be near me, Lord Jesus      I ask Thee to stay      Close by me forever      And love me I pray      Bless all the dear children      In Thy tender care      Take us to heaven      To live with Thee there.    Mr. Speaker, I hope we keep the history behind this beautiful song in  mind as we celebrate the holiday season. On behalf of us in central  Texas, I wish you a merry Christmas, happy Hanukkah, and a delightful  Christmas season.                            ____________________
