 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr.  Paul Grassey, who received the French Legion of Honor by the Consul  General of France on January 28 for his role in liberating France  during World War II.   During the war, Paul flew B-24 bombers for the Eighth Air Force in 13  missions. After the war, Mr. Grassey returned to Savannah and became  heavily involved with the Mighty Eighth Air Force Museum, helping to  educate people in the area about the Eighth Air Force's role in the  war.   Paul gives tours at the museum and often goes into local schools to  talk about the importance of World War II and freeing Europe from Nazi  Germany.   In 2013, Paul wrote a book outlining his story before, during, and  after the war while discussing the six pillars of having good  character: trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring,  and citizenship.   The French Legion of Honor is the highest military honor in France,  and I could not be more proud that the Consul General has awarded it to  Mr. Grassey of the First Congressional District of Georgia.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Mr. Grassey on his award. I thank him for  [[Page H981]]  his experience, knowledge, and passion with people of all ages in  Savannah.                            ____________________
