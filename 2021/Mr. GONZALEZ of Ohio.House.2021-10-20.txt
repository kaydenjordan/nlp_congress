 Madam Speaker, I missed a vote on H.R. 654, The  Drug Free Communities Pandemic Relief Act, due to a timing conflict, as  I was questioning witnesses at a Select Committee on the Climate Crisis  hearing during the time of the vote. Had I been present, I would have  voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 321.
