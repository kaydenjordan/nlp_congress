 Madam Speaker, House Democrats have been obsessed with  impeaching President Trump since he was elected.   He wasn't supposed to win. ``How could the voters support him?'' they  asked.   The American people were told the only way the Speaker would move  forward with impeachment was if the case was compelling, overwhelming,  and bipartisan, yet the case for impeachment that has been rushed  forward by House Democrats is anything but that.   To be clear, neither of these Articles of Impeachment prove any  wrongdoing or impeachable offense has actually taken place. Instead,  House Democrats' case rests solely on hearsay testimony and  presumptions from cherry-picked witnesses.   The Framers of the Constitution never intended impeachment to be used  as a tool to settle political and policy differences. That is what  elections are for.   This is a sad and dangerous moment in our history, as impeachment is  being used to undo the will of the American people and silence the  voices of millions of Americans in the process. Alexander Hamilton  would be ashamed.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this partisan impeachment  sham.
