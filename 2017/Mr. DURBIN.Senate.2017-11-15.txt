On this vote, the yeas are 54, the nays are  44.   The motion is agreed to.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I came to the floor yesterday to speak on  the devastating impact the Republican tax plan would have on working  families in my home State of Illinois and other States across the  Nation.   It is no secret that the Republican plan would finance massive tax  cuts for the wealthiest people in America. They just can't help  themselves. Every time they look at the Tax Code, they think there has  to be a way to help the wealthiest people in our country. They usually  look at the estate tax, which is paid for by 1 out of every 1,000  Americans, and say: We have just got to spare these poor people who  have a net worth of over $11 million from paying any taxes to the  government. We have to spare them from paying this government for the  benefit that this great Nation has brought to them and their families  and businesses. That is where they start.   Then they do the alternative minimum tax, which is a tax that was  created so that if your accountants and bookkeepers and lawyers are the  sharpest on Earth and ended up finding that you had no tax liability,  you still paid a fair share for sustaining this great Nation that you  call home. They want to get rid of that, too, or at least dramatically  modify it.   They start off with the premise of making these tax cuts for the  wealthiest people in America the beginning point of tax reform, these  giveaways to people who are not even asking for them. They can't help  themselves. They always start there, and the American people know it.   When you ask the American people, what is this tax reform all about,  they say it is tax cuts for wealthy people. That is where it always  starts, and it does when the Republicans are the authors. That is what  we face again.   They try to argue that it is going to help working families. It will  help some--let me be honest about that--and yet you are going to find  many working families who are going to pay more instead of less because  of this so-called tax reform. Why would we ever do that?   Why would we give tax breaks to the wealthiest people in America-- permanent tax breaks--and then turn around and say to working families:  Sorry. Some of you will get help, but many of you will not.   In my home State of Illinois, the elimination of the State and local  tax exemption is going to be devastating to our State. We are in the  top five of States where the people in my State who pay income tax,  sales tax, and property tax can deduct those taxes from their Federal  income that is subject to taxation.   That is not a new idea. It has been around for decades. It really is  premised on the following: Americans should not have to pay tax on a  tax. If I pay $100 a month, and I pay my local property taxes, I  shouldn't be taxed on that $100. It is a double hit. It is not fair,  but the Republican plan believes that is what we should do.   I will tell the seven Republican Congressmen in my State, they ought  to go home and ask the people whom they represent what they think about  this one, the idea of double taxation that they would vote for and go  home and try to defend. I think it is going to be tough, very tough.   It is no secret that these tax cuts for the wealthy and large  corporations will end up raising taxes on a lot of Americans and  blowing a massive hole in the deficit.   I am going to quote a fellow who has been retired a few years from  Congress. His name is Dave Obey. He was a Congressman from Wisconsin.  Dave Obey used to say over and over again--and I am going to repeat it,  and I have credited him with it: Too many times politicians are posing  for holy pictures, but when it comes to the deficit and the debt, many  of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle pose for holy pictures  about the national debt whenever there is a Democratic President and  then get a swift case of amnesia whenever there is a Republican  President.  [[Page S7246]]    Here we go again. They are ignoring the reality that the tax cuts  they are promoting for the wealthiest and biggest corporations are  going to end up blowing a hole in the deficit--a hole in the deficit,  which is going to have to be paid for by future generations.   I used to watch as my Republican colleagues would get red in the face  talking about our national debt, but that, of course, was under a  Democratic President. Under a Republican President, it doesn't seem to  be a major issue. Incidentally, there is a way to plug that hole, and  somewhere along the way someone slipped and told us what it was.   If you want to plug the hole of $1.5 trillion in tax cuts to the  wealthy and big corporations, they propose cutting Medicare benefits  and Medicaid benefits, cutting the basic health insurance plans that  seniors and people in low-income categories use. Is that a sound  policy, to try to patch a hole in the deficit by taking healthcare  protection away from senior citizens in America--the 40-plus million  who count on it--or those who are under Medicaid? I think it is not.   It turns out that Chairman Hatch had a new surprise for us this week.  At 10:30 p.m. last night, Chairman Orrin Hatch released additional  changes to this bill, which is evolving before our eyes. It is a bill  which was not publicly announced until last Friday and is currently  being debated in the hopes that when we return a week after our  Thanksgiving recess, we will take it up and vote on it.   Does it seem like it is a hurried operation? Of course, it is. They  know that if these bills sit out long enough and people read them and  consider them, there will be a lot of questions asked that they can't  answer.   Chairman Hatch released additional changes to the bill, and they  decided to fund permanent tax cuts for some corporations. That is a  high priority for the Republicans--wealthy people, big corporations. So  how do they pay for permanent tax cuts for the biggest corporations? It  turns out that in addition to raising taxes on working families, the  Senate Republican tax bill would also raise health insurance premiums  on middle-income families. That is right. The Republicans propose that  their tax bill would also repeal parts of the Affordable Care Act. As a  result, the Congressional Budget Office tells us that an estimated 13  to 14 million Americans will lose their health insurance protection  because of the Republican tax giveaway plan. I thought that plan was  supposed to help working families. It ends up taking away their health  insurance.   For those who can still remain in the market buying health insurance,  they can anticipate their premiums for health insurance going up 10  percent. What kind of tax cut is this that ends up raising the cost of  health insurance for working families and ends up eliminating health  insurance for many middle-income families?   I find it hard to believe the satisfaction so many Republicans take  to be able to boast and brag that they passed a bill that took away  health insurance for Americans. You are proud of that? I wouldn't be.  We should be doing the opposite--expanding the reach of health  insurance, making sure every American has the peace of mind and health  insurance they need for them and their families.   Remember when Republicans campaigned on the promise of increasing the  number of people with insurance and decreasing premiums? This tax bill  does just the opposite.   Haven't my Republican colleagues learned the lessons of the ACA-- Affordable Care Act--repeal by now? We spent the whole year in a vain  effort by the Republicans to repeal and barely replace. The American  people don't want it. Overwhelmingly, they are against it.   My hospitals in Illinois and across this Nation don't want what the  Republicans are proposing in their bill. Patients don't want it. Nurses  don't want it. Clinics don't want it. The disabled community doesn't  want it. The Republicans are determined to do it anyway.   Senior leaders are against it, faith leaders are against it, the  American people are against it, but this is going to be the feather in  the cap for the Republican majority; that by the end of this year, they  hope to pass a tax reform bill that is going to give tax breaks to the  wealthiest, give a permanent tax break to the biggest corporations,  make the middle-income families pay for it, eliminate 13 to 14 million  Americans' health insurance, and raise their premiums. What a package.  You have to work overtime to put together a package that damaging to  working families in America, but that is what they are pushing. That is  what they are determined to do.    Mr. President, last week my home State of Illinois took a  major step forward in protecting student loan borrowers.   On November 7, the Illinois House of Representatives voted 98 to 16  to override Governor Rauner's veto of the Illinois Student Loan Bill of  Rights, which was designed to protect student loan borrowers from the  well documented abuses of Federal student loan servicers. The Illinois  Senate previously voted 37 to 19 to override. With the house's action,  the bill became law.   I would like to thank all of those in the general assembly who voted  for this bill, including Senator Daniel Biss and Representative Will  Guzzardi, who sponsored the legislation. I would also like to thank the  legislation's author, Attorney General Lisa Madigan, for her leadership  and tireless efforts to investigate and hold Federal student loan  servicers accountable.   Federal student loan servicers are contracted by the U.S. Department  of Education to handle the billing and other services related to the  repayment of a Federal student loan. Too often, these contractors make  it more difficult for students to repay their loans by giving them  incorrect or incomplete information and guidance, refusing to provide  benefits to which students are entitled under Federal law, or  incorrectly processing payments. I have heard complaints about  servicers from countless of the 1.5 million Illinoisans holding a  cumulative total of $51 billion in Federal student loan debt.   Attorney General Madigan has heard those complaints too. In response,  she initiated an investigation which resulted in an ongoing lawsuit  against the Nation's largest student loan servicer, Navient. Navient  has become the poster child for poor customer service and abusive  practices that make it more difficult for struggling borrowers to repay  their Federal student loans.   The Illinois Student Loan Bill of Rights will help to protect  Illinois borrowers from these practices. Among other things, the law  requires servicers to inform borrowers about their eligibility for  income-driven repayment plans and other affordable repayment options.  It also prohibits servicers from misleading borrowers, requires them to  correctly process payments, and requires servicers to inform borrowers  about their eligibility for loan forgiveness due to a disability or  harmful actions by the school.   I have worked at the Federal level to provide similar protections for  all student loan borrowers. I authored the Federal Student Loan  Borrower Bill of Rights, which I will reintroduce in the coming months.  This bill was the basis for reforms to student loan servicing contracts  initiated by President Obama. Unfortunately, much of that work has been  rolled back by Secretary Betsy DeVos.   Thanks to Attorney General Madigan and the bipartisan actions of the  Illinois General Assembly, borrowers in our State will now have new  rights and protections that neither Governor Rauner nor Secretary DeVos  can take away.                            ____________________
