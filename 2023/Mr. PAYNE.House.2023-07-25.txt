 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards, or  CFATS, program is a vital national security program whereby DHS works  with the Nation's highest risk chemical facilities to make sure they  are secure against an attack by a terrorist or other bad actor.   Since 2007, CFATS has helped thousands of facilities strengthen their  security posture and reduce on-site risks, sometimes lowering their  risk profile so much that they are no longer subject to regulation.   This program has been so effective that in the 15 years since it was  established, the number of high-risk facilities has dropped by half,  from more than 7,000 to fewer than 3,500.   Once more, CFATS-regulated facilities are some of the program's most  avid supporters. That is because the regulations are flexible,  nonprescriptive, and focused on outcomes rather than micromanaging  security decisions or imposing one-size-fits-all requirements.   Still, the CFATS statutory authority will lapse a few days from now  if Congress does not act. We cannot let that happen. CFATS is far from  perfect. The program suffers from longstanding, well-documented issues  that need to be fixed in legislation. However, H.R. 4470 makes no  effort to address them.   In committee, I joined with my Democratic colleagues to offer 10  modest, targeted amendments that sought to improve information sharing  with first responders, training for inspectors, and our understanding  of potential weaknesses in the program.   We had hoped that our Republican colleagues might have adopted at  least a few of these modest measures. Unfortunately, they did not, but  not because they disagreed with the substance. They did so, they said,  out of fear that any change might complicate reauthorization in the  Senate.   It is a shame that it took so long for the committee to act on a  reauthorization, especially since it is just a date-change bill.   When Democrats took the gavel in 2019, CFATS was just a few weeks  away from sunsetting. We had a short-term extension bill on the floor  within a few days and immediately got to work on legislation to improve  the program, not just extend it.   I was, however, heartened to hear many of my Republican colleagues  acknowledge the longstanding issues with the program and express  support for many of the amendments that we offered. We also appreciate  that at the markup the chairman committed to standing up a bipartisan  working group within the committee to get these changes enacted into  law.   I hope that once we get this date-change bill done, our committee  will get to work on making the program better in short order.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, while H.R. 4470 is not the CFATS reauthorization bill  I had hoped for, it is absolutely necessary that we pass it for one  simple reason: It will prevent CFATS' statutory authority from lapsing  and will allow the program to keep working to protect chemical  facilities from terrorist attacks.   I am pleased that, in the course of debate in committee, the chairman  has committed to work with the committee Democrats on a more fulsome  reauthorization bill. I look forward to starting that work in short  order.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, to help carry out its many missions, the Department of  [[Page H3938]]  Homeland Security has increasingly come to rely on unmanned aircraft  systems, or drones.   DHS utilizes these eyes in the sky to make timely assessments about  the extent of damage caused by hurricanes, tornadoes, and other natural  disasters in instances where the Federal Emergency Management Agency  cannot easily deploy personnel to affected areas.   The Coast Guard uses drones to enhance its ability to collect and  disseminate information on maritime hazards and threats. In remote  parts of the land border, DHS uses them to detect and prevent illicit  smuggling activities.   Many unmanned aircraft systems in the marketplace today are  manufactured in nations considered foreign adversaries. As such, there  are legitimate security concerns about the integrity of the data drones  collect.   Recent reports suggest that Chinese-manufactured drones might be  compromised and used to send sensitive information to the Chinese  Government.   In response to security concerns, the Departments of the Interior and  Defense have taken steps to limit their use of foreign-made drones.   H.R. 1501, the Unmanned Aerial Security Act, would direct the  Department of Homeland Security to take similar protective measures.   It would prohibit DHS from purchasing or using drone systems  manufactured in a foreign country that is deemed to be an adversary by  either the intelligence community's annual threat assessment or the  Secretary of Homeland Security.   Importantly, H.R. 1501 allows the Secretary of Homeland Security to  waive the prohibition in certain circumstances, such as the national  interest of the United States or for research or intelligence purposes.   Finally, the bill requires DHS to report to Congress on information  related to drones, including the results of any threat assessments  conducted.   H.R. 1501 has bipartisan support and was reported out of the Homeland  Security Committee by voice vote.   Madam Speaker, I commend my colleague from Mississippi (Mr. Guest)  for introducing this bill that seeks to ensure the integrity and  security of the drone systems that the Department of Homeland Security  operates.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, our communities look to our first responders to keep  us safe. They are our hometown heroes, and it is a local and national  tragedy whenever a first responder loses their life in the line of  duty.   Earlier this month, two brave Newark firefighters, Augusto Acabou and  Wayne Brooks, Jr., lost their lives fighting a shipboard fire in the  Port of Newark.   That blaze also injured five of their courageous colleagues.   I believe it is critical for first responders to be prepared by  having the  [[Page H3939]]  tools and equipment necessary to execute their mission safely and  efficiently.   Congress supports first responders through DHS homeland security  grant programs. However, communities cannot use such funding to  purchase novel, state-of-the-art equipment because it is not on FEMA's  authorized equipment list.   This equipment is rendered ineligible not because it is inferior. It  is ineligible because it is so innovative that it does not meet or  exceed the consensus standards that FEMA relies upon.   I first introduced this bill in the 114th Congress to require FEMA to  establish an accessible and transparent process for such equipment to  be evaluated. The House approved this legislation three times already.  Each time it stalled in the Senate. Nevertheless, today I feel very  confident that the fourth time is the charm. With the support of the  International Association of Fire Chiefs, I am hopeful that this bill  will get action in the Senate.   With that, Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in  sending a strong message to the Senate with a decisive ``yea'' vote on  this bill.   Our first responders are always there to help us. Now it is time to  help them with the most modern equipment available to do their jobs.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting  H.R. 3254, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, in closing, we owe it to our hometown heroes to give  them access to the necessary tools to carry out their missions safely  and effectively.   H.R. 3254 would allow communities to use DHS grant funding to  purchase advanced lifesaving technology such as systems to track  firefighters in burning buildings or wildland fires.   It was cosponsored by the gentleman from Alabama, Representative  Strong, and endorsed by the International Association of Fire Chiefs.  The House approved the First Responder Access to Innovative  Technologies Act in the 114th, 115th, and 116th Congresses. It is time  for us to come together to get this bill enacted.   Madam Speaker, this is very timely legislation. I am sure that people  saw the tragedy that we had in Newark, New Jersey, in my district where  we lost two firefighters fighting a fire on a ship in the Port of  Newark. They needed this type of equipment.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Trevor Baptiste,  an all-star, two-time world champion lacrosse player.   Trevor is a professional lacrosse player for the Philadelphia Wings  of the National Lacrosse League and the Atlas Lacrosse Club of the  Premier Lacrosse League.   He was born and grew up in Newark, New Jersey, before becoming a  lacrosse star at the University of Denver.   In his 4 years there, Trevor was a four-time, first-team all-American  and a national champion. After college, Trevor won two world  championships with the United States men's national team, and he has  been an all-star every year as a professional.   His specialty is winning face-offs. In college, he owns the national  record for face-offs won and the highest winning percentage. For Team  USA, he has the highest face-off winning percentage in team history.   Trevor Baptiste is an exceptional lacrosse player, and I am proud to  highlight him on the House floor today.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Illinois for the  opportunity to speak tonight on an issue that paralyzes this Nation.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss and address our country's gun  violence epidemic and promote the commonsense solutions from House  Democrats that would save lives nationwide.   This year, our country has suffered more than 400 mass shootings and  mass murders--400--and gun violence has killed or injured more than  40,000 Americans. This number includes more than 3,500 children or  teens. In America, gun violence happens in grocery stores, elementary  schools, college campuses, and private homes. That is a national  tragedy that demands immediate action.   My bill, the Safer Neighborhoods Gun Buyback Act, would use Federal  grants to get guns out of the hands of criminals. It would reduce gun  violence and make communities safer, and it is one solution of many in  Congress that we have offered to date.   House Democrats have introduced or will introduce at least 54 bills  to reduce gun violence across the country. If passed, they would make  gun owners and dealers accountable for their weapons. They would keep  weapons out of the hands of criminals, and they would help law  enforcement officials catch criminals who use guns to commit crimes.   For example, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2023 would  require that every sale of a firearm include a background check. It is  supported by 90 percent of Democrats and Republicans in Congress.   The Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2023 would provide the time  necessary to conduct an effective background check on gun owners.   The Assault Weapons Ban of 2023 would stop the sale, manufacture,  transfer, or possession of assault weapons. These are weapons of war  and need to be removed from our streets.   The Closing the Bump Stock Loophole Act of 2023 would ban bump stocks  in the same manner as assault weapons. Bump stocks are designed to  increase the firing rate of guns. It makes dangerous guns more lethal.  They have no place in a civil society, Madam Speaker.   Ethan's Law is a bill that would set Federal standards for safe gun  storage. It would decrease the chance of a family member dying from the  use of an unsecured firearm.   The Pause for Gun Safety Act would require a 7-day waiting period  before gun purchasers can possess their weapons.   The Stop Online Ammunition Sales Act of 2023 would require photo  identification before the purchase of gun ammunition online.   The Office of Gun Violence Prevention Act of 2023 would establish an  Office of Gun Violence Prevention in the Department of Justice's Office  of Legal Policy. This bill would allow the country to finally create a  national gun violence prevention strategy.   The Equal Access to Justice for Victims of Gun Violence Act would  remove the dubious legal protections for gun manufacturers and possibly  make  [[Page H3942]]  them liable for the harms and damage they inflict on communities across  this country.   The Ammunition Identification Act would require ammunition to have  serial numbers. Then law enforcement officials could use those numbers  to catch possible criminals based on gun ownership.   The Untraceable Firearms Act of 2023 would regulate the production  and sale of ghost guns. These guns are made in secret and cannot be  traced, and they are a threat to every community in America.   These bills represent commonsense solutions that Americans want to  protect their families and loved ones from gun violence. We need to act  on my bill and the others like it to create a safer country. The longer  we wait, the more lives we lose, and one day it could come to your  door.
