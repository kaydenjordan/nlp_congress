 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from Missouri (Mr.  Luetkemeyer), who has been a wonderful person to work with, and the  many members of the committee on our side of the aisle, particularly  Ranking Member Waters and Mr. Heck from Washington.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Washington (Mr. Heck).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. Again, I would  like to repeat what has already been said: this is a classic example of  how this place is supposed to work. It takes a little time, but it  works out in a bipartisan manner and in a thoughtful manner and deals  with an issue that, though not important to some people, is very  important to a handful of people in this country to simply level the  playing field.  [[Page H9773]]    I want to, again, thank all of the people involved in this. It is  nice to be involved in a piece of legislation that I can be proud of  and that went through the process the right way and worked out the  right way.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I believe the gentleman from Missouri has stated  everything that needs to be said. This is a simple bill that is a  technical amendment to the Volcker rule that I strongly support. I know  that many others have opposition to that. This is a minor change.   When you do a bill like Dodd-Frank, or any major bill, there are  always things you make a mistake on and that you didn't see coming.  This is one of them.   It is very simple. This simply allows a company to use names that  they have been using forever. That is really all it is. I appreciate  the gentleman's willingness and the committee's willingness to hear  this simple bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
