 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this  resolution and the State of Israel.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On July 18, 2023, page H3671, in the third column, the following  appeared:   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this resolution and  the State of Israel.    ========================= END NOTE =========================     [[Page H3672]]     I compliment both the chair for leading this, Mr. McCaul, as well as  my colleague, Representative Pfluger, for being brave enough to stand  forward and call out Israel not only as an ally, but as standing in  that steely breach as a force for democracy, as a force for freedom,  and a voice for free people in a world too often tried time and time  again by tyrants and terrorists.   Our support for Israel is critical during times of global uncertainty  and continued aggression by adversaries around both the region and the  world.   When I worked with the Israeli Defense Forces, I saw the threats  firsthand from the Golan Heights to the north to the kibbutzes in the  south.   Across the world, we must reject anti-Semitism in all its forms and  stand with Israel and the people of Israel against these threats. We  cannot let our strongest ally in the Middle East be left alone.   Mr. Speaker, I will continue in my unwavering support of Israel and  encourage my colleagues to join me.
