 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of ending the  cap on State and Local Tax deductions--better known as the SALT  deduction.   For more than 100 years, an idea dating back to Abraham Lincoln, the  SALT deduction has allowed families to deduct taxes already paid to  state and local government from their federal tax returns.   Many middle-class Americans benefit from this commonsense tax policy  every year. In past years, almost a third of Rhode Islanders have  claimed the SALT deductions, including almost 60 percent of people in  my district who make between $75-100,000 per year.   The destructive 2017 Trump tax cuts, however, imposed a $10,000 cap  on SALT deductions, meaning that if a family pays more than $10,000 in  state and local taxes, the taxes paid in excess of that $10,000 can no  longer be deducted from federal returns raising those families' tax  liability significantly.   It just doesn't make sense to have Americans, especially middle-class  families living in states with high tax rates, pay extra taxes on the  taxes they have already paid.   Most middle-class Americans living in high tax areas are there so  their children can go to high caliber public schools or receive better  programs.   Many of them made 10, 20, and 30-year investments in home ownership  in these high tax areas, relying on the SALT deduction that had been in  place for more than 100 years when budgeting for this big expense.   Then they had the rug pulled out from under them and were told they  were suddenly liable for thousands of dollars more in taxes per year.  For many of these people, that extra tax is a significant portion of  their annual income.   These Americans are working hard to give their families the best life  possible. Putting a secondary tax on the taxes they have already paid  will force many middle-class Americans to struggle.   In fact, middle-class Americans have said that the SALT Cap will,  quote: ``wipe them out'' by forcing them to pay those extra federal  taxes in addition to state and local.   This is why I cosponsored H.R. 613, the SALT Deductibility Act, this  Congress.   This bipartisan bill would reverse the 2017 law and allow Americans  to use the SALT deductions when paying federal taxes without a $10,000  cap, keeping money in the hands of American working families.   I applaud Congressman Suozzi for introducing this important  legislation. It will have a significant impact to help American  families, which is especially important after the devastating economic  effect of COVID-19 that has left so many middle-class Americans  struggling financially, including many Rhode Islanders.   The 2017 law was more than a mistake, it was bad policy, and I hope  that this body does the right thing by taking action to correct it.                            ____________________
