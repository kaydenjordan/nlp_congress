 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3564, the so- called Middle Class Borrowers Protection Act of 2023. The reason for my  position is because this legislation does the exact opposite of what it  purports.   The reality is this: The Financial Services Committee held a  subcommittee hearing on this legislation on May 17, titled:  ``Undermining Housing Affordability With Politics.''   My uncle used to say: ``I would kill for a Nobel Peace Prize.'' It is  called irony, but that irony did not match the irony of the hearing on  housing issues that had been hyper-politicized.   In my remarks, I mentioned that stations like FOX News have been  providing a narrative of FHFA changes that almost all the experts in  the field, and all that I have personally talked to, will tell you is  untrue, but the complexity of housing finance lends itself to a lack of  understanding.    Referring to FHFA pricing changes, which were largely required due to  changes in GSE capital requirements and had not been addressed in many  years as a socialist scheme, is simply wrong and is transparently  political.   The committee then marked up legislation in a partisan way, and what  was most surprising to me was the number of industry groups who have  expressed issues with the politicization of FHFA loan-level price  adjustment changes.   The FHFA in this process has been willing to provide information to  Congress and much more information than would have been received by  private entities before conservatorship.   I was pleased when FHFA listened to the concerns of Congress and  outside organizations in rescinding a debt-to-income-based loan-level  price adjustment that would have led to several problems. The bill we  are debating today affirms that decision.   However, the bill we are debating today, if we look at what the CBO  has said about the bill, is potentially expensive and not in the best  interest of the American people. Given the politics of the issue, the  American public should have no confidence that the end result would be  any less politicized.   For example, requiring notice and comment process in all pricing  matters and adjustments would reduce the GSE's ability to quickly  respond to changing market conditions, thereby undermining safety and  soundness objectives in times of market issues.   This would require the agency to delay implementation of pricing  changes for an extended period. There are several alternatives that  could be required that would complement the annual guarantee fee report  FHFA is already required to publish.    Mr. Chair, I missed something because I didn't know that  the Biden administration was involved in this debate or had any  involvement at all with this discussion.   At the appropriate time, I will offer a motion to recommit this bill  back to committee. If House rules permitted, I would have offered the  motion with an important amendment to the bill.   My amendment would make the $3.2 billion surplus this bill generates  available for Federal programs to assist homeless individuals and  families. Instead of making housing more expensive for our  constituents, we should be ensuring that every single American is able  to live with dignity and comfort.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record the text of the amendment.        At the end, add the following new section:       SEC. 8. USE OF EXCESS AMOUNTS.         Any amount of budget authority resulting from the enactment       of section 7 (relating to enterprise guarantee fees) in       excess of the amount necessary to offset mandatory spending       increases under the other provisions of this Act so as to       comply with clause 10.(a)(1) of rule XXI of the Rules of the       House of Representatives of the 118th Congress are hereby       made available for assistance under Federal programs to       assist homeless individuals and families.     Mr. Chair, I hope my colleagues will join me in voting  for the motion to recommit and opposing this sham bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
