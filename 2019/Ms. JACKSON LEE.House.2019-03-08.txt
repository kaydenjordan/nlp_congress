 Mr. Speaker, I first want to acknowledge the passing  of a dear friend, Congressman Ralph Hall, who was a great leader and a  great Texan.   But I also rise today, Mr. Speaker, to ensure that the American  people know what we did this week; and that is condemning anti-Semitism  as hateful expressions of intolerance that are contradictory to the  values and aspirations that define the United States of America. This  is the strongest, most definitive denouncing of anti-Semitism that the  United States Congress has ever voted on--407 votes.   This summer I will be in my almost 30th year of sending young people  to Israel in a kibbutz program named after former Congressman Mickey  Leland.   We understand the value of applauding all people, and, yes, we don't  want Americans who happen to be Muslims to be discriminated against or  associated with the burning towers, Muslims who have served in the  United States military or white nationalists who will be willing to  talk about the hatefulness against African Americans, Latinos, Native  Americans, Asians, and Pacific Islanders.   Mr. Speaker, this is an important statement, and I am glad to have  been associated with it. We should applaud all those who voted for it.                            ____________________
