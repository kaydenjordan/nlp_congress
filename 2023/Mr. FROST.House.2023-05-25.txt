 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because after weeks of pointing  fingers on the debt ceiling negotiations, House Republicans have  finally shown their true colors.   It is Republican leadership that controls this Chamber. It is Speaker  McCarthy who controls the floor. Yet, instead of working overtime to  make sure that we don't default on our Nation's debt and send the  economy into a tailspin and stop the benefits of millions of Americans,  Members of Congress are going home this weekend.   The interesting thing is that many of these folks, my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle, are the same people that clowned me on  Twitter for not having the best credit after my campaign and being  denied an apartment here in D.C.   Imagine the hypocrisy of poor-shaming working people for trying to  pay off their debts, and then turn around and refuse to pay the  country's debt to pay for tax cuts for billionaires. It is distasteful,  disgraceful, and we have to do better.                            ____________________
