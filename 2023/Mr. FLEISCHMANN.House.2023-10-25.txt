 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 4394, and that I may  include tabular material on the same.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, it is my distinct honor to bring the fiscal year 2024  Energy and Water bill before you today. Before I go into the details, I  recognize the hard work of Chairwoman Granger and Ranking Member  DeLauro on this bill and the entire appropriations process.   I also specifically thank my ranking member, Ms. Kaptur, for being a  tremendous partner throughout this year's process.   At a total of $56.958 billion, the Energy and Water bill advances our  national security, our energy security, and our economic  competitiveness in a fiscally responsible manner.   The bill includes $24 billion for the National Nuclear Security  Administration. Within that, the bill fully funds all major weapons  programs and infrastructure modernization activities, including the W93  warhead, the nuclear sea-launched cruise missile, the B83-1 sustainment  efforts, and the restart of plutonium pit production capability. NNSA  funding also supports naval reactors and defense nuclear  nonproliferation.   Remaining a leader in nuclear energy technologies will ensure  reliable energy here at home and will help allies across the globe.   The bill sustains the Department of Energy's nuclear energy base  program and also redirects previously appropriated funds to higher  priorities, specifically:   $2.4 billion to develop a domestic capability for producing low- enriched uranium, including high-assay low-enriched uranium that will  be necessary for upcoming advanced reactors; and   $1.2 billion to support the ongoing advanced small modular reactor  demonstration project.   To reduce our reliance on foreign sources of critical minerals, the  bill provides more than $200 million for the full spectrum of  production technologies.   The Army Corps of Engineers is funded at $9.57 billion, including  full funding of the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund activities and  ongoing Inland Waterways Trust Fund construction projects. These  investments will help ensure goods can be moved safely to and from  global markets.   Funding for the Bureau of Reclamation totals $1.8 billion and  prioritizes projects that increase water supply and support drought  resiliency.   The bill continues strong funding for the Department of Energy Office  of Science, including fusion energy science, to enhance America's role  as the global leader of scientific discovery and to lay the foundation  for future scientific breakthroughs.   In closing, I thank the staff on both sides of the aisle for their  hard work throughout this process. On the majority staff, Angie, Perry,  Nora, Richie, Scott, and Janet. In my personal office, Ian and Daniel.  On the minority staff, Scott, Jocelyn, and Adam.   This is a strong bill, and I urge Members to support it. I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson), my friend.    Mr. Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Idaho (Mr. Simpson), the chair of the Interior, Environment, and  Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Murphy), my friend and also my  colleague on the congressional baseball team.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. LaMalfa), my very good friend and fellow member of the  Italian caucus.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, pursuant to House Resolution 756, I offer  amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chair, this bipartisan en bloc amendment was  developed in coordination with the minority. It contains  noncontroversial amendments addressing important issues at the agency's  funded in this bill that have been agreed to by both sides. I support  its adoption, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman of  Louisiana (Mr. Graves).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition,  although I am not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, the Upper Colorado River and San Juan  River Endangered Species Program enjoys bipartisan support in the  region, providing for a collaborative approach to species management,  avoiding a heavy-handed ESA listing.   This program enables robust power production at Glen Canyon Dam, and  I support the gentleman's amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to claim time in opposition,  although I do not oppose the amendment.    Mr. Chair, similar to my colleague's previous  amendment, this program enjoys broad bipartisan support and enables  robust hydropower production that provides electricity to benefit the  entire region.   Mr. Chair, I support the gentleman's amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I share some of my colleagues'  concerns about the excess spending at EERE, particularly in light of  the billions in increased spending provided in past appropriations  bills, the Inflation Reduction Act, and the Infrastructure Investment  and Jobs Act.   EERE still has billions in unobligated funds, and that is exactly why  this bill, the bill that we have before the House, includes a large  reduction to this account.   However, in my view, respectfully, my colleague's amendment would go  too far to practically eliminate the EERE account. This would impact  the important work performed by the national labs and universities to  implement the research and development goals of EERE. These goals  include advancing energy efficiency solutions for the manufacturing of  cement, steel, and iron; creating and improving battery technologies;  and developing critical mineral alternatives.   While I am a supporter of EERE, I also recognize fossil fuels are  going to be an important resource for many years to come. However, I  don't believe these two accounts need to be at odds with each other.   I personally favor an all-of-the-above approach to meet the Nation's  future  [[Page H5088]]  energy needs. That approach includes strategic reductions to EERE that  prioritize research activities like the goals I mentioned earlier.   My distinguished colleague's amendment, in my view, upends that  strategy and goes too far, respectfully. For these reasons, I must  oppose the amendment and urge my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio  (Ms. Kaptur).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I thank the distinguished gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Roy) for filing this amendment, but I respectfully oppose  the same.   I do share some of my colleague's concerns about the excess spending  at EERE. I would also like to emphasize that EERE received over $16  billion from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and many of  these dollars are still unobligated.   These reasons are exactly why the original bill reduced EERE by $466  million below the fiscal year 2023 level and why I offered further  reductions in this bill of $1 billion.   In total, these reductions would bring EERE below the fiscal year  2016 level. However, my colleague's amendment goes too far in  eliminating EERE.   I am a supporter of the EERE program and the work they do to advance  research and development on renewable technologies, advanced  manufacturing, and battery improvements. That includes essential work  on critical minerals that will help lay the groundwork for technologies  that will reduce our reliance on foreign supplies.   I think this is an issue that we all can support. I support strategic  reduction to EERE, but I am not in favor of eliminating the account and  walking away from its ongoing work.   For these reasons, I must respectfully oppose the amendment, and I  urge my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1915     Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio  (Ms. Kaptur), the ranking member.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I thank my good friend from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Perry) for filing this, but I must respectfully oppose the  amendment.   The Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations is primarily responsible  for implementing and managing over $21 billion provided by the  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.   I am keenly aware of the scale of that sum of money and the  importance of our oversight responsibility to ensure taxpayer funds are  correctly administered.   That is exactly why the House bill includes no funding--and I repeat  no funding--for the office to conduct new demonstrations and instead,  only includes funding for program direction for staff to provide  project management oversight.   My colleague's amendment would eliminate that function, preventing  the office from ensuring that our taxpayer dollars are being used  effectively and efficiently.   That would directly impact the success of important programs within  the office's jurisdiction like the Advanced Reactor Demonstration  Program.   The Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program enjoys strong bipartisan  support. The program is essential to the deployment of advanced  reactors, ensuring our Nation's energy security and regaining U.S.  leadership in nuclear energy.   We can't abandon our oversight responsibilities and risk the success  of programs like these. For these reasons, I must respectfully oppose  the amendment, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I thank my dear friend and colleague from  South Carolina (Mr. Norman) for filing this, but I must respectfully  rise in strong opposition to the amendment.   My colleague's amendment would eliminate the Advanced Research  Projects Agency, or ARPA-E. ARPA-E's mission is to fund projects that  are not yet addressed in the private sector but can bring about  transformational shifts in current energy technologies.   Nearly 75 percent of ARPA-E awards go to small businesses and  academia. ARPA-E projects have led to over 1,000 patents being issued  and have attracted more than $11.5 billion in follow-on funding from  the private sector.   These projects push the envelope on what is possible in the energy  sector and will continue to play an important role in maintaining U.S.  leadership to develop the next generation of energy technologies. I  believe these are goals that all of us can support.   I, therefore, must respectfully oppose the amendment and urge my  colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms.  Kaptur).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I thank my distinguished friend from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry) for filing the amendment.   My great State of Tennessee, which I represent the Third District of  Tennessee, our State and other States greatly benefit from the  Appalachian Regional Commission.   This amendment would eliminate the Appalachian Regional Commission  which provides funding for hundreds of cost-shared projects, partnering  with private industry to bring needed jobs to this depressed region.   The energy and water bill maintains funding for the ARC at the fiscal  year 2023 level of $200 million. These communities, and many of which I  represent, cannot afford to lose millions of dollars in private  investment this Commission leverages.   Mr. Chair, I respectfully urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio  (Ms. Kaptur).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose the amendment.    Mr. Chair, once again, I thank the gentleman from  Pennsylvania for filing this amendment, but I must strongly oppose it.   This bill provides $31.1 million for the Delta Regional Authority.  This small investment targets hundreds of depressed communities in the  Mississippi River Delta region. These communities cannot afford to lose  the millions of dollars in private investments this commission  leverages.   Mr. Chair, I respectfully urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Louisiana (Ms. Letlow). I congratulate the great State of  Louisiana on the election of our Speaker. They also have our great  majority leader, as well.   Ms. Letlow has been just a wonderful member of the Appropriations  Committee, and it has been great to have her on the committee  representing Louisiana.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, once again, my distinguished friend  and colleague from Pennsylvania has been consistent in his opposition  to these regional commissions, and I do appreciate the gentleman's  positions on this. However, I respectfully disagree.   The amendment would reduce funding for the Denali Commission, which  is funded at $17 million in this bill, the same as fiscal 2023. The  regional commission helps distressed communities across Alaska with  basic infrastructure, like water and sewage systems and power  generation.   Mr. Chair, I respectfully urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, again, I thank the gentleman from  Pennsylvania for bringing this motion on behalf of my distinguished  friend from South Carolina.   Like the previous amendment, although this one is a bit more  draconian, I respectfully rise in opposition to it for the reasons I  alluded to earlier, and I urge a ``no'' vote.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, this bill provides $40 million for the  Northern Border Regional Commission, the same as last year.   This commission seeks to create jobs in distressed communities of the  four-State northern region.   While the impact to overall spending in this bill would be small, the  impact felt by these communities would be large.   Mr. Chair, I respectfully urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, once again, I thank my distinguished  colleague and friend from Pennsylvania for being consistent and very  thorough in all of his investigations, and I do really appreciate this.   This has been insightful, but once again, I must respectfully rise to  oppose the amendment. The energy and water bill includes flat funding  for the Southeast Crescent Regional Commission.   The amendment would reduce this amount by 99 percent, leaving only  $250,000, not even enough to cover all administrative costs. This  commission seeks to create jobs in some of the most poverty stricken  areas of our Nation, and funding should not be decimated.   Mr. Chair, I respectfully urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, my friend and colleague from  Pennsylvania once again has been consistent in his opposition to these  regional commissions.   This amendment seeks to cut funding for the Southwest Border Regional  Commission in half. This Commission seeks to create jobs in some of the  most poverty-stricken areas of our Nation. This bill provides $5  million equal to fiscal year 2023. This amount ensures this Commission  can continue its work and cutting it in half would virtually do nothing  compared to the overall spending in the bill.   Mr. Chair, I respectfully urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Ciscomani), my dear friend and also a  fellow member of the Committee on Appropriations.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, once again, I thank my distinguished  friend from Pennsylvania and colleague for his very thoughtful work on  this entire project. He has covered all of these regions.   Mr. Chair, this amendment seeks to cut funding for the Great Lakes  Authority in half, and I strongly oppose it. This is a newly authorized  regional commission intended to create jobs in communities that need it  most.   As we crafted this bill, Mr. Chairman, we actually listened to  Members and got Members' requests. This Commission, the Great Lakes  Commission received a tremendous amount of bipartisan support for it.  It is newly created, and that is one of the reasons that it has not had  its funding. It has never had funding because it is brand-new.   Mr. Chair, in that regard, especially in terms of the strong  bipartisan support for this bill and for this Commission, I urge a  ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Fallon) having assumed the chair, Mr. Moran, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 4394)  making appropriations for energy and water development and related  agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2024, and for other  purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________
