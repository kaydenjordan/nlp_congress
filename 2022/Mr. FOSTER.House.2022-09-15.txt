 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the importance of  the International Atomic Energy Agency, commonly known as the IAEA, and  to urge Congress to continue its support so it can continue its mission  to promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy.   The primary task of the IAEA is to verify that countries comply with  their commitments to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty by monitoring  and upholding standards for nuclear safety and security.   But it is more than that. Earlier this month, we witnessed shelling  and damage to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station in Ukraine, the  largest nuclear power plant in Europe. The persistent fighting in the  area and the occupation of the nuclear plant by Russian forces have  raised concerns about the safety and the dangerous conditions that  plant workers face.   So, who are you going to call? The IAEA. Its response to the  situation in Ukraine demonstrates the crucial importance of its  mission.   The IAEA stands as a trusted and stabilizing influence and reduces  the danger of potential nuclear disasters worldwide.                            ____________________
