 Madam Speaker, my friends on the other side of the  aisle must have amnesia. You know why we are on this floor today?  Because of the Dobbs case from a runaway Supreme Court, dominated by  Members who answered that they understood precedent in Roe v. Wade and  ignored it.   I thank Congresswoman Manning and all of the cosponsors who recognize  that we have to methodically protect women. Do you know what is  happening to doctors? Every news station will have doctors on,  frightened about what they should do about women's healthcare.   This is important legislation, Right to Contraception, because it  does deal with menstrual regulation, endometriosis, or hormonal  imbalance.   Teenagers are given this because of menstrual problems, but those who  don't understand this, they are standing on the floor talking about  this is a runaway bill.   If it is coronavirus, the monkey pox, or any other health matter, it  is Democrats who are saving America. This legislation is definitely  needed because the Supreme Court has trampled on the Constitution,  trampled on the Ninth Amendment, trampled on equal protection under the  law.   I support H.R. 8373. The women who are in need, who are vulnerable,  who are individuals, who are minority women need this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to rise in strong support of H.R. 8373, the  ``Right to Contraception Act.''   H.R. 8373 would expressly assert the right of an individual to obtain  and utilize contraception.   This would include any FDA approved device or medication used to  prevent pregnancy, whether specifically used for that goal, or for  other health needs like menstrual regulation, endometriosis, or  hormonal imbalance.   Additionally, the ``Right to Contraception Act'' would outline the  rights of healthcare providers to prescribe and dispense contraceptives  and relevant information to patients.   This bill would require lawmakers who attempt to place additional  requirements on providers or access to contraception to prove that the  requirement significantly advances access to contraceptives and that  access could not be better achieved by other methods.   Birth control pills, IUDs, and other forms of contraception are all  forms of safe and essential healthcare.   They are central to women's ability to participate equally in the  workplace, in academia, and in society.   The right to contraceptives has long been an expectation held by the  American people.   In 1965, the United States Supreme Court's decision in Griswald v.  Connecticut affirmed a married couple's right to birth control. In  1972, Eisenstadt v. Baird protected that right for single people. Then  in 1977, the right to contraception for minors was secured in Carey v.  Population Services International.   For more than 50 years, the right to contraception has been settled  law.   That is, until the Supreme Court's recent ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson  Women's Health Organization, when five conservative Justices chose to  let their personal opinions and beliefs supersede decades of  established precedent by overturning women's right to abortion.   Since then, the American people have witnessed the abhorrent  consequences of Republicans' radical agenda to criminalize women's  reproductive health decisions.   In his concurring opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas made it very clear  that the extremist ruling that ended Roe v. Wade could be used to chop  away at other rights--including the right to access contraception.  [[Page H6935]]    Reproductive rights opponents are now including emergency  contraception, IUDs, and other forms of birth control in their anti- abortion legislation.   These anti-abortion laws shackle women to unwanted pregnancies.   Conservative lawmakers now seek to stop women from exerting agency  over the prevention of pregnancy, as well.   If a woman is not permitted to end a pregnancy, and she is not  permitted to prevent a pregnancy, I ask you, what rights to her body  does she have left?   The ability to make personal choices about one's own body is the most  basic of fundamental human rights.   That right is engraved into the very foundation of our Nation and  inked into the hallowed lines of the U.S. Constitution.   Do we not uphold our Constitution for its promise of life, liberty,  and pursuit of happiness?   How then, can we withhold those rights from half of our population by  robbing women of agency over their bodies?   In 1965, the United States Supreme Court made the 7-2 Griswold v.  Connecticut ruling that established the right for married couples to  utilize contraception.   This decision was not determined by the personal belief systems of  those Justices nor their approval or disapproval of contraception.   No, the right to access contraception was upheld by the promise of  unenumerated rights and due process for all American people--as  outlined in the United States Bill of Rights.   As my colleagues know, the 9th Amendment states that the federal  government does not retain final authority over the rights that are not  listed in the Constitution.   The Bill of Rights does not exhaust all the rights retained by the  people.   Instead, those undocumented rights belong to the people, as does the  right to contraception.   Also, as a hallmark of democracy, the 14th Amendment ensures that no  right afforded to the American people can be taken away without due  process of law, while also guaranteeing all Americans that they shall  have equal protection under the law.   The assurances of the 14th Amendment became part of our national  governing documents as a protection against those who would use their  power to wipe away the freedoms of others without restraint or consent  of the governed.   Unfortunately, it is just as necessary and relevant today as it was  when it was ratified in 1868.   Even before the barbaric Dobbs ruling, conservative lawmakers across  the country have been moving to limit women's ability to make decisions  about their own healthcare and bodies.   In 2021 alone, at least 4 states attempted to ban access to some or  all contraceptives by restricting public funding for these products and  services.   Those laws work in conjunction with actions conservative legislators  in red states have taken to curtail funding for family planning  services at reproductive health centers like Planned Parenthood.   Such actions would limit access to birth control, particularly for  Black and Brown low-income women.   A 2010 study found that access to contraceptive care resulted in  approximately one million fewer unplanned conceptions per year.   That is one million fewer children born into families who are  unprepared to support them.   When access to contraceptives is limited, more children are born into  lives of difficulty and hardship.   After Texas Republicans excluded Planned Parenthood from its public  family planning program for low-income women, there was a 35 percent  drop in prescriptions for long-acting, reversible contraceptives and a  31 percent drop in the use of injectable contraceptives.   This caused a more than 25 percent increase in unintended births-- largely among Black and Brown low-income women.   H.R. 8373, the ``Right to Contraception Act,'' would help ensure that  children are born into families who are eager, equipped, and prepared  for their arrival.   We cannot allow human rights to be so callously stripped away from  the American people.   We must fight back and codify these rights into law.   Contraception allows individuals, couples, and families to be in  control of their own futures.   Contraception can allow a young woman to achieve her dreams of  earning a college degree.   It can allow a young couple to prioritize their careers before  raising a child.   It can allow parents to focus their financial and emotional resources  on the care of a special needs son or daughter.   It is a tool that allows those who wish to become parents, and those  who do not, the agency to make the decision that is best for them.   The Right to Contraception Act asserts that we will no longer allow  the human rights of women to be infringed.   If conservative legislators and conservative Justices intend to  continue to attempt to limit access to reproductive rights, we will  fight back.   We will not allow women to be regulated like reproductive chattel.   American women deserve to have the final authority over their own  bodies and their own lives, including whether or not to become pregnant  and become a parent.   Contraception is on the front lines of this battle.   That is why I support H.R. 8373, the ``Right to Contraception Act'',  and encourage my colleagues to do so as well.    Mr. Speaker, over this past week, we have had to  raise concerns about whether the Constitution still stood strong. I am  glad that we have worked hard to ensure the Ninth Amendment and the  equal protection of the law are viable parts of American society and  constitutional rights.   I rise today to promote H.R. 40, the Commission to Study Slavery and  Develop Reparation Proposals, as a way of redress, repair, and  restoration for the 246 years of slavery.   I think it is important and an important moment for the country to  pause and understand this historic moment in our history, the  contributions that slaves made, including building this very place, the  United States Capitol and the White House, and, as well, the economic  engine that they created when making cotton king--never to be  compensated, never to be provided for, but still turned into patriots  that fought in every world war.   It is crucial that we move expeditiously to establish this commission  to tell their story and to work on the restoration of the disparities  that are found in the African-American community from east to west and  north to south.   I cannot think of a reason why this House and this administration  would not want to move on something as embracing as H.R. 40. Let's move  it now.                            ____________________
