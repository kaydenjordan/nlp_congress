 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  the University of Houston men's basketball team on their remarkable  performance in the 2018 NCAA Tournament.   The Cougars entered the tournament as the number six seed from the  American Athletic Conference, led by the 2018 AAC Coach of the Year  Kelvin Sampson. This was the Cougars' first NCAA tournament appearance  since 2010, and their spectacular win in the first round against San  Diego State was the Cougars' first NCAA Tournament win since 1984.  Their loss against Michigan in the second round was hard fought and  truly a heartbreaker.   As an alumnus of the University of Houston and on behalf of the city  and the fans, we are proud at what they accomplished this season. I  wish the team the best of luck for next season.   I would also like to give special congratulations to seniors Devin  Davis, Wes VanBeck, Nura Zanna, and Rob Gray for an exciting season.   Go Cougars.                            ____________________
