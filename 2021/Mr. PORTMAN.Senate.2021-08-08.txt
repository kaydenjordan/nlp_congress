 Madam President, I appreciate my colleague from  Delaware. He is the chair of the committee that produced a lot of the  work that went into this package. Roads, bridges, the highway bill, and  the surface transportation bill comes through his committee. He and  Senator Capito from West Virginia worked together, on a bipartisan  basis. And my recollection is the underlying bill that we pick up in  this broader bill that has to do with roads and bridges and so on  passed with a vote of 22 to nothing out of this committee, and that is  because they did good work in finding out where there was common  ground. And, frankly, you know, the American people deserve to have  good roads and bridges and infrastructure to drive on and travel on. So  it is a big part of this bill, and I thank him for his work on that.   We have now voted twice to proceed to this very important  legislation, to finally, after a lot of years of talking about it,  making major improvements to our Nation's roads and bridges and  railroads and ports and waterways and water infrastructure, electrical  grids, our broadband networks, and more. It is overdue.   And I am delighted to say that twice now we have voted to proceed to  final passage. One was a vote of 66 to 28, and the other was a vote of  67 to 27. And, frankly, there were a couple of people on our side of  the aisle who were not able to come vote, one of whom has COVID and the  other, in both cases, somebody had travel difficulties. So we would  have had two more votes on our side that were positive votes as well.   So this is a supermajority, and it is because the legislation makes  sense for the States represented here in this Chamber and for the  American people. It will improve the lives of all Americans. It will  make life better. So the mom who is stuck commuting, who would rather  be spending time with her family every day, you know, is going to have  the ability, through better transportation infrastructure, to have  fewer minutes and hours every day in gridlock.   The truck driver who leaves the home, you know, and says goodbye to  his family and goes on a long haul and thinks, ``You know, am I going  to be safe?'' it will be safer, thanks to this legislation.   We had two trucks collide on a bridge in Ohio recently. It is not  safe. There is no shoulder on the bridge anymore because the traffic is  bearing twice the number of vehicles that it was designed for.   The mom who has been taking her daughter to the public library  parking lot 30, 40 miles from their home to get internet access in  order for her daughter to do her homework will now be able to have  internet and be able to have broadband in her community right up to her  home because of this historic investment in ensuring that the digital  infrastructure is put in place. So you don't have this divide.   We have got counties in Ohio that just don't have internet, period,  and others have very slow internet. We have got about 30 counties that  are a part of Appalachia. We have got about 18 of those counties that  are unserved and another large group that are underserved.   And that digital divide makes a huge difference because, again, those  kids are going to fall behind, certainly during the pandemic, when they  had to be accessing the internet to just stay up with school. But even  postpandemic, you know, we want to be sure that that learning  opportunity is there.   And then in terms of telehealth, you know, there are veterans in  southeast Ohio who aren't able to make the drive to the VA clinic in  Columbus or elsewhere, but they can take advantage of telehealth; and  they have, to the extent they have access to it during the pandemic,  and it has been actually quite helpful. But if they don't have access  to the internet and high enough speed internet, they can't get the  healthcare at home that they need for appointments.   It is also important for business. If you are a small business owner  in these parts of the country that don't have internet access, it is  really tough to get off the ground. And these are the very areas of the  country where we want to have more economic development, so that is in  this legislation as well.   And in terms of water infrastructure, Ohio has got a lot of aging  water infrastructure. I saw someone wrote a story recently, saying that  only about a quarter of this bill goes into hard assets. That is just  not accurate. In fact, a quarter of it goes to roads and bridges and  even more, I guess. But water infrastructure is a hard asset.   Ask the communities in Ohio that have been told by the EPA, in  Republican and Democrat administrations: You got to fix your sewer  system; you got to fix your drinking water system; you can't have  combined sewer overflow.   And they just can't afford it, particularly in these mid-size cities.  They are really excited about water infrastructure   Our ports, that is hard infrastructure too. So ships are lined up at  some ports right now, including out West. And so if you are a consumer,  you are trying to buy something and you are wondering why you can't get  it, including, you know, maybe an electronic device you want, or maybe  it is a part to an automobile that you want, a lot of it is it is  stuck. Stuff is stuck right now because our ports are not efficient  enough and capable enough to handle what they should be able to do.   Our land ports, if you are concerned about the southern border and  the ability to screen trucks and cars coming in to try to keep some of  this deadly fentanyl and other drugs from coming over our southern  border, you should want this legislation because it is going to provide  more infrastructure for our ports.   So there is a lot in here that will make people's lives better, and  that is obviously one reason that this is so popular, because people do  expect it here in America. This great economy we have, we should be  able to also lead  [[Page S6039]]  the road in infrastructure, and we don't. There is a study out saying,  in fact, we are not even in the top 10 in terms of infrastructure  around the world.   It also will make our infrastructure more resilient to natural  disasters and other crises. It will make our Nation safer and more  secure. It will grow our economy in a million small but meaningful  ways. What the economists say when they look at this legislation--and  by the way, again, every President in modern times has proposed this  big infrastructure package for this reason. They say it will make your  economy more efficient.   So we have fallen behind on infrastructure, and if we can catch up,  the economy is more efficient; therefore, we are more productive;  therefore, the economy grows; therefore, more tax revenue comes in from  infrastructure. So it is a good long-term investment. It is not money  that is going to be spent next year. Think of the projects in your  community that might be helped. That project may last for 10, 15 years,  even before it is finally completed.   So this money goes out over time for hard infrastructure. That is one  reason it doesn't affect inflation in a negative way. In fact, it is  counterinflationary because it invests in hard assets and in jobs over  time. If you are in business, think about your capital expenditures.  Your capex budget is going to be different than your day-to-day  spending than you probably thought of from your capex.   It is going to also take some important steps to repair, replace, and  build assets that will last for decades. Again, that makes life better  for people. It makes the economy more efficient. It also is something  that, as economists look at it, they believe will be  counterinflationary.   It has been made clear in poll after poll this is something that  brings this country together. So, unbelievably, there is a poll by CNBC  showing 87 percent of the American people think it is important that  we, here in Congress, invest in improving our roads and our bridges.   Within a couple of months, another poll by CBS found exactly the same  number, that 87 percent of the American people support more Federal  spending on repairing roads and bridges.   An Associated Press poll found that 8 in 10 Americans favor plans to  increase funding for roads, bridges, and ports, and for pipes that  supply drinking water. That is what the bill does.   And we need the investment. Let's be honest. The American Society of  Civil Engineers gives our infrastructure in America a grade of C-minus.  That is not very high. And they project our economy stands to lose more  than $10 trillion in GDP--$10 trillion in our economy--by 2039, if we  fail to invest in these repairs. We have fallen to 13th in the world in  infrastructure while key foreign competitors, like China, spend now  four times more on infrastructure than we do.   China is spending four times more as a percent of their economy on  infrastructure than we do. Why? Because they want their economy to be  more efficient. They want to compete with us and win. We want to  compete with them and have American workers win.   Thirteenth in the world is based on a study that is done  periodically. To ensure that we are comparing apples to apples, they  look at all kinds of things. America has a very strong, competitive  economy, generally, but infrastructure is a weakness for us.   So this is the World Economic Forum. They put this study out  periodically. I follow it. I look at it because it has a lot of  different things in it--not just infrastructure--as to how our economy  is working.   How are we doing on permitting?   Not so good. Guess what. We have permitting reform in this package,  and the permitting reform will allow the Federal dollar to go further.   So think about it: If it takes 6, 8, 10 years to permit a project,  the enormous cost involved in that. But if you can do it in 2 years,  which is the goal of our permitting reform, that makes a huge  difference. And a lot of it is because you have a lot of different  Federal Agencies that are requiring permits. If you have an energy  project, whether it is a fossil fuel project or whether it is a  renewable energy project, you can have as many as 30--I am told, in 1  case, 35 different permits. By the time you finish the first 30, you  have to go back to the first one again to get fit in. It is crazy.    We had a project in Ohio actually shut down because they just  couldn't handle the permitting. It was actually a hydropower along the  Ohio River.   So that is in this legislation, too--historic permitting reform--and  that should make sense to every taxpayer. Yet we want to go through the  environmental studies. That is fine, but let's do it quickly and  efficiently and require one Agency to be in charge and accountable.  That is what this does. It requires that there be a dashboard that  anybody can look up and find out where that project is. That keeps it  moving, very transparent. That is in this proposal.   So there are some good things in here that ensure that the money that  is spent is spent more wisely than it has been in the past.   Let's be sure people can't come back and sue after the fact. We take  the amount of time that someone can come back after the fact and sue on  a project from 6 years to 2 years. That is very important to  developers. That is very important to our workforce. That is very  important to the building trades in this country.   You look at the list of supporters of this project, and, I mean, it  is unbelievable. The American Farm Bureau and over 30 farm groups have  now come out for this proposal. So for those in Big Ag States, I would  say, listen to your Farm Bureau--you usually do--and they will tell you  this is very good for the farmer who wants to get his crops to the  market.   In Ohio, we have a lot of soybeans. We want to get them to the  elevator in order to be efficient, but we also send them all over the  world. So we want our ports to be efficient.   But it is not just the Farm Bureau. You have the National Association  of Manufacturers supporting this, the American Chamber of Commerce, the  Business Roundtable, and the AFL-CIO Building Trades Council. The men  and women who do the work strongly support this legislation. So it is  going to help in terms of jobs, competitiveness.   And, again, it is no wonder that so many people over the years have  said: We need to fix our infrastructure.   Every President in modern times, by the way, has had a proposal to do  so. The joke here in Washington is, ``Oh, it is infrastructure week  again'' because, frankly, administrations over time have had  infrastructure week--``We are going to get infrastructure done this  week''--and nothing has happened. Congress has been stuck.   We have been in gridlock on this, kind of like the gridlock during  rush hour in so many of our cities today that we want to fix with this  bill. Well, that gridlock here has kept us from doing what we are  trying to do in this legislation.   Five hundred and fifty billion dollars in additional funding over the  next 5 years is what this is. Others have said it is a trillion. I  don't--it is $550 billion. It is actually a little less: $548 billion  is what the final number was over 5 years, as a shot in the arm to help  get these projects going, not just in the next year or 5 years but over  the next 20 or 30 years. This money will be spread out over time.   But this is part of how we get America on a track where we have good- paying jobs and more efficiency in our economy long term.   Every President, as I said, has tried to get the infrastructure bill  done. One of those Presidents is our most recent President, President  Donald Trump, who pushed to pass a $1.5 trillion infrastructure bill  during his time in office in his budget. As a developer, he gets it. He  understands the importance of infrastructure, and I applaud him for  that.   And, honestly, I think he changed the discussion a little bit on my  side of the aisle. I think he got more Republicans thinking. One of my  colleagues told me recently the two things government ought to do and  do well is national defense and infrastructure. I think there are other  things that government does as well, but that is not a bad list for  what the priorities ought to be for the Federal Government. Look at the  Interstate Highway System as an example of what needs help now.   So I appreciate the fact that President Trump got the discussion  going  [[Page S6040]]  among Republicans who might not previously have focused on that.   Here are just a few highlights of what we secured in this  legislation.   We are going to provide billions in funding for some of our most  pressing hard infrastructure needs: $110 billion in new spending over  the next 5 years to construct, rebuild, and maintain our Interstate  Highway System, our roads, and our bridges.   That is going to make a big difference for us in Ohio. We have  123,000 miles of roads. And where traffic congestion occurs in Ohio, we  have an estimated $4.7 billion lost each year--lost time, wasted fuel,  according to the American Society of Civil Engineers--$4.7 billion  because of traffic congestion in Ohio alone.   They also say there are currently more than 46,000 bridges in our  country that are considered structurally deficient and in poor  condition. Think about that: 46,000 bridges considered structurally  deficient and in poor condition--46,000. And yet, 178 million trips are  taken across these deficient bridges every single day. One hundred and  seventy-eight million cars or trucks go over these same structurally  deficient bridges.   Ohio, by the way, is No. 2 in the Nation for bridges. We like bridges  in Ohio. We have lots of creeks and rivers and railroad tracks to go  over. We have over 40,000 bridges, but nearly half of those are not in  good condition. That is the reason I am pleased this bill provides  $12.5 billion to fund the bipartisan Bridge Investment Act that will  award competitive grants to improve our Nation's bridges based on  whether they are major bridges of commercial activity, based on their  condition, based on their safety.   We have $60 billion total to help State and local government fund  major construction projects, like the long-awaited Brent Spence Bridge  Corridor in my hometown of Cincinnati, OH. We have been talking about  replacing the Brent Spence Bridge as long as I have been in elected  office, and that has been a while. It has been probably 25 years of  talking about this. Let's get it done.   We are going to make immediate reforms to the permitting process, as  I said, because that will help with regard to that bridge and others to  do it more quickly, more efficiently, with less cost to the taxpayer  dollars   Again, I want to commend the Trump administration because they  prioritized that issue. But the legislation that we had passed here to  help with speeding up permitting sunsets. So this legislation that we  are voting on here actually ends that sunset and, therefore, ensures we  can continue that permitting going forward.   If we don't do it in this bill and don't do it soon, we are not going  to have projects signing up for this interagency council on permitting  because they will have the sunset. They know that they are not going to  be able to take advantage of it. So that is really important.   We also strengthen the provision, make it cover more projects, and  ensure that, again, we are going to get these permitting reforms to  make this dollar--this Federal dollar--go further.   And we are going to make a necessary investment in the future of our  economy by providing $65 billion to increase access to broadband  services to connect more Americans to the internet.   In Ohio, it is estimated that about 300,000 households lack access to  the high-speed broadband that many of us just take for granted. We  assume everybody has it. People don't. It is holding folks back from  being able to get the schooling they need, the healthcare they need, or  to have the economic opportunities that come with being connected to  the internet.   These are just a few highlights, and I can go on. But the bottom line  is that we are dedicating almost $550 billion to new infrastructure  spending over the next 5 years to go toward a wide range of priorities  that will collectively have a positive impact on the people I represent  and all Americans.   Importantly, we have funded our bill through a number of responsible  pay-fors without any new taxes on working families, on small  businesses, on large businesses, on anybody. This is being done without  tax hikes.   That is significant because, remember, when we first started talking  about infrastructure, it was in the context of a proposal from the  Biden administration for a huge increase in taxes. It was a $2.65  trillion package and included incredibly steep tax increases. In fact,  taxes increased to much more than taxes were cut back in 2017 in that  proposal, about four times more. Some say five times more.   But we decided: No, let's not do that. Let's pull infrastructure from  this package--really core infrastructure, because infrastructure is  being defined in ways that it had never been defined before, including  so-called soft infrastructure: social spending for nursing homes or for  healthcare or for electric car companies outside of infrastructure.   We said: No, let's just pull the core infrastructure out of it, and  let's take the taxes off. And that is how we got down to, again, $548  billion and without taxes.   So from the start, we have said some of our pay-fors will not be  fully reflected in the formal CBO score that came out on Thursday. But,  instead, it will be reflected in CBO estimates.   What is CBO? CBO is the Congressional Budget Office. It is the group  up here that we have to rely on in terms of our legislation to say how  much something costs.   Republicans and Democrats alike love to complain about CBO. In fact,  often, it is my Republicans complaining about them on my side of the  aisle because they don't give enough credit to the feedback effect from  tax cuts.   Democrats are kind of just the opposite. They think there should be  more feedback effect--in other words, a dynamic score as relates to  spending.   And we disagree on their calculation of scoring. But that is who we  have to rely on.   So the CBO estimate that just came out, including what they said  about their official score, was disappointing to me because they didn't  follow what we wrote in the law. We have had this discussion, and, you  know, they are the arbiter. So my same Republican colleagues who have  complained about CBO over the years in other contexts are now saying:  Well, look, the CBO score isn't high enough. You know, you said about  half of it would be paid for by official CBO scores. Well, it is, but  they didn't give us credit for it.   One example is CBO's limitation that they can't account for States  returning to the Federal Treasury the money that we dictated they had  to return in our bill. They just won't do it.   Fifty-three billion dollars was in our legislation for unused funds  from the enhanced COVID UI supplemental put in place during COVID-19.  Recouping this outdated supplement is a win for the American taxpayers,  and everyone should support sending it back toward projects like  infrastructure that help move our economy forward rather than for other  purposes. And yet CBO gives us no credit for that.   CBO is not fully able to reflect the funding streams that will help  pay for our legislation in other ways as well. I will give you,  perhaps, the two most striking examples of this.   One is that working with the White House, working with the Office of  Management and Budget, working with the individual Agencies, we were  able to determine that some of the COVID-19 funds that this Congress  had sent back to the States through Agencies was not being spent, and  so we wanted to repurpose that money through this purpose. Remember, we  spent a lot of money, including $1.9 trillion recently. But even before  that, four different pieces of legislation were sending money out to  the States for COVID-19 purposes.   And so we said: Well, if it is unused COVID funds, let's return it to  the Treasury and apply it to this. And it makes sense. Infrastructure  is something States and localities are eager to have--better  infrastructure--and it is appropriate to use some of that funding.   So we said in our proposal that $41.8 billion would be rescinded  based on what we got from OMB, from the individual Agencies on their  unobligated funds. The White House signed off on it. We all signed off  on it, Republican and Democrat. Unfortunately, CBO chose to give us  credit for just $13.4 billion rather than $41.8 billion. It is  frustrating. It is a difference of $28.4 billion in savings.   Now, what they say is that we are not convinced that even though  these  [[Page S6041]]  are unobligated balances--which we have been able to prove, by the way,  and we have documents from the White House, now, after the fact,  showing this again. But they have said: Well, we don't believe that  these Agencies that have extra money are going to spend the money. That  is one of the reasons they gave. We think they will just keep the  money.   When has an Agency not spent the money that Congress provides them, I  would ask my colleagues?   I will give you a real-world example of this. As we started to look  for these unused COVID funds, it turns out that the U.S. Department of  Agriculture, USDA, had some extra funds that they had not sent out to  anybody and weren't planning to. When they heard that we were nosing  around with the Office of Management and Budget and with the White  House to pull back some of those funds for this purpose, for a good  purpose, for infrastructure--guess what--they came up with another  program. They had the discretion to send the money out under another  program. So they came up with one and said: Oh, now we have got this  money covered. You are not allowed to touch it.    So I am just telling you that is one of the challenges with these CBO  scores. They took $28.4 billion in savings and just decided, because  they knew best, that this was not going to be available because the  Agencies were going to spend it, even though they haven't spent it,  they had no reasons to spend it, they had no plans to spend it. And,  again, the Office of Management and Budget at the White House had  confirmed that.   Another example: We went from a savings of $65 billion from the next  auction for spectrum down to $20 billion in response to concerns by  colleagues on our side of the aisle that this might affect our national  security. So $65 billion in savings, CBO-scored savings, in this  legislation, went to $20 billion--working with the Department of  Defense, carefully; working with the Office of Management and Budget;  working with the Armed Services Committee here, ensuring that we  weren't going to touch any spectrum in that future sale that had a  national security implication.   So that reduced our CBO score. We understood that, but we wanted to  be sure that we weren't taking any risks by having any issue with  regard to DOD spectrum that they didn't want to provide.   CBO then, in their report on Thursday, decided that they weren't  going to give us credit for that $20 billion. They took it down to  about $10 billion. We lost $9.8 billion on a CBO score there.   And, again, when we pushed on that, they said: Well, we just need to  know that the White House is going to move ahead with a spectrum  auction.   Well, they are, and they have sent us a letter saying they are.   So, again, this is a little arbitrary, don't you think? How can CBO  decide?   So just as they took $30 billion away from the CBO score with regard  to repurposing COVID money, which is based on the unobligated balances  that the White House agreed to, that OMB agreed to--but CBO is saying  somehow the Agencies aren't going to spend that money. I mean, all the  records, if you look at what happens, is that they will spend the  money.   So we are saving the money. We are pulling it back and applying it to  a good purpose: infrastructure.   So I would just caution my colleagues who, again, traditionally are  skeptical of CBO and somehow, in this case, think CBO is perfect, to  look a little closer at these scores and look at the fact that they are  not necessarily accurate.   What this legislation does not do--the Infrastructure Investment and  Jobs Act--is it does not include the grab bag of massive new social  spending that Democrats included in their first package and certainly  that they are now including in their $3.5 trillion spending proposal  they unveiled earlier this month.   And this is an important point that my colleagues shouldn't miss. The  President has said that the package--the $3.5 trillion--will not  include more core infrastructure spending. Now, remember, that was  pulled out of his original package, the $2.65 trillion. We took about  half of the core infrastructure out of there and took out all the  taxes, so we are at $548 billion.   And he made a commitment, both privately and publicly, as have  Democrats up here, that that is the negotiation on the core  infrastructure. So the roads and bridges we have talked about earlier,  the water infrastructure, the rail, the ports--that can't be double  dipped in terms of also including that in the $3.5 trillion.   Now, they will have a lot of other spending in there that is social  spending, that is not this capital expenditure spending we talked  about. Many of my colleagues know what capex means, that you typically  borrow for your capex, and it is long-term spending for hard assets.  But that is not what the $3.5 trillion is about, and that is why I  strongly oppose it, as do my colleagues on this side of the aisle.   The President having said that the package will not double dip, that  we won't have that in there, is very important to remember because we  have saved taxpayers not only huge tax increases by finding a  bipartisan solution here, but we saved taxpayers from a lot of  additional spending that otherwise would have occurred.   This investment in repairing and upgrading our Nation's  infrastructure will have real, lasting benefit for our country through  building out hard assets that improve productivity and improve  efficiency without adding to inflation. It will create hundreds of  thousands of good-paying jobs in industries ranging from construction  and plumbing to electrical engineering and software development, with  one recent study from the Association of Equipment Manufacturers  finding that the legislation could create around half a million jobs by  2024.   This is why every business group in America is supporting this  legislation, as well as all the ag groups--over 30 ag groups--including  the American Farm Bureau. It is why the AFL-CIO Building & Construction  Trades Council is supporting it, because they are going to provide a  lot of the workers for this.   Even more importantly, given the recent economic news we have seen,  is this proposal will not cause inflation to increase. As Democratic  economist Larry Summers on the other side of the aisle and many of us  here on the Republican side of the aisle had been warning about for  months, including me, inflation is here, with prices for consumers up  5.4 percent over this time last year.   And this rate of inflation, in my view, could well go up even  further. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former CBO Director, now head of the  American Action Forum, a conservative economist; Michael Strain,  director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise  Institute, AEI, also a conservative scholar, has said that our  bipartisan infrastructure package will slow down inflation.   They said: ``Improving roads, bridges, and ports would make it less  costly for businesses to operate, allowing them to increase their  output per hour, and putting downward pressure on consumer prices.''   So I know some of my colleagues want to conflate these two, the $3.5  trillion extravaganza with huge tax increases and immediate social  spending and this long-term spending we have talked about here, where  very little money is going to go out the door even in the next year or  two. But they are not the same, and I think it is irresponsible to say  they are the same.   The bottom line is that the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act  will provide a historic investment in hard infrastructure, with input  from a bipartisan group of Senators, while avoiding the tax hikes that  would hurt our economy, destroy jobs, and undermine our competitiveness  around the world.    And importantly, for the sake of future bipartisanship here in  Congress, it is an infrastructure plan that allows us to avoid the  repeat of the COVID-19 spending bill, the $1.9 trillion that passed  under this partisan process of reconciliation.   It is also the alternative way that we ought to operate around here  instead of the $3.5 trillion reconciliation package that is coming  next. It demonstrates to the American people that we can, in fact, work  together to get big things done in a responsible way.   President Biden promised to govern in a bipartisan manner, in his  inaugural address and in his campaign. Unfortunately, he hasn't done  that with  [[Page S6042]]  regard to the COVID package, the $1.9 trillion under reconciliation,  the $3.5 trillion that they are now going to attempt to pass here in  this Chamber. But this bipartisan package is an opportunity for all of  us to fulfill that pledge, to figure out how to work together to get  big things done.   It is a genuine compromise. It is not the bill I would write. It is  not the bill my colleague Kyrsten Sinema would write on the Democratic  side of the aisle. But it is good for the country. It builds our core  infrastructure. It doesn't raise taxes on the American people. It will  grow the economy. It will lead to more tax revenue coming in to the  Treasury, and yet it includes responsible pay-fors.   Soon, I hope we will all be able to vote on final passage of this  legislation. As I indicated, we have already had two votes to proceed  to final passage. One was 66 to 28; the other was 67 to 27. I think it  is time for us to come together and to enact this bipartisan  achievement for our Nation, for our economy, and for the people we  represent.                                Cryptocurrency    Madam President, I want to address a specific part of the legislation  that is before us. It relates to cryptocurrency. As we know,  cryptocurrency is a digital asset that more and more people are  investing in, and we should want that to continue and continue in a  healthy and sustainable way.   There is consensus here in Washington and around the country that  there should be better and more consistent reporting on cryptocurrency  transactions. By the way, this would be a good thing for honest,  taxpaying holders of cryptocurrency, which is the vast majority of them  who, today, have to figure out their basis and sometimes their gross  proceeds when filing taxes because they don't get a 1099.   The form 1099 that a financial institution would give you if you  invested in stocks or bonds or other financial instruments often is not  available for holders of cryptocurrency, which creates problems.   Standardizing this basic information reporting by crypto brokers for  tax purposes is going to help provide more certainty for everyday  Americans looking to invest in these digital assets.   The experts at the nonpartisan Congressional Joint Committee on  Taxation and the Department of the Treasury say that this would lead to  better tax compliance as well. So the information reporting would lead  to better compliance with the Tax Code.   The question is who should issue that 1099 in a cryptocurrency  context. Again, the consensus is that it should be the brokers of  cryptocurrency, just as it is for stocks and bonds and other financial  instruments.   In the underlying bill, a broker is defined as any person responsible  for regularly providing any service effectuating transfers of digital  assets by cryptocurrency--which, for tax purposes, means a sale--on  behalf of someone else.   Some crypto brokers already comply with these standard information- reporting obligations, but for those who have not yet adopted these  practices, this rule change is going to make it easier for their  customers to pay their taxes due.   The concern has been expressed that some in the cryptocurrency  industry who are not brokers could be inadvertently caught up in this  definition. The Department of the Treasury, the nonpartisan  Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, and others believe that the  current language is clear and that the reporting requirements only  covers brokers.   But my view is that we should work to clarify this, given the  potential for confusion on an extremely important issue. In particular,  we want to be sure miners and stakers and others, now or in the future,  who play a key role by validating transactions, or sellers of hardware  or software for digital wallets, or node operators, or others who are  not brokers are clearly exempted.   While it is not the intent of the underlying bill to include them, I  believe we can do more to make this clear, which is why I will continue  to work with colleagues to clarify the intent of the information- reporting language.   There have been a number of amendments that have been filed to try  and make this provision more clear, and I have been working with my  colleagues Senator Warner, Senator Wyden, Senator Toomey, Senator  Lummis, Senator Ossoff, and Senator Sinema on a potential solution that  I believe will help reassure stakeholders that these individuals will  not be considered brokers, while maintaining the information reporting  in this bipartisan legislation.   Today, we will continue these important discussions, and I am hopeful  we can come to a solution that will provide certainty for taxpayers and  avoid any potential loopholes for bad actors.   With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.
