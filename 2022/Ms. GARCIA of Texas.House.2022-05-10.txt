 Mr. Speaker, I rise with outrage at the recent  cruel attack on women's reproductive rights.   Through a leak, we have learned about the Supreme Court draft opinion  that would terrifyingly overturn Roe v. Wade if finalized. This is  shocking.   You see, I know what happens when Republicans strip reproductive  rights away from women. I have seen it in my home State of Texas, which  has the strictest reproductive healthcare laws in the country, S.B. 8.   Each month, nearly 1,500 Texans are forced into such desperation  where they travel to surrounding States for a chance to receive their  healthcare. Many times these Texans are forced to travel in unsafe  conditions, putting themselves in harm's way.   Mr. Speaker, we will not go back. We must not go back. I urge my  Senate colleagues to codify Roe v. Wade into law. We must protect a  woman's right to reproductive healthcare.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my  colleague from New Jersey Mr. Gottheimer's bill, H.R. 5914, the  Empowering States to Protect Seniors from Bad Actors Act, of which I am  a proud cosponsor.   Increasingly, senior investors and consumers have become the target  of financial exploitation. Sadly, one in five older Americans have been  victimized by financial fraud.   Madam Speaker, in today's world of technology and telemarketing calls  and robocalls, it is only getting worse.   I can tell you, Madam Speaker, that I have had many lives in my life.  I am like a cat. The first life I had was as a geriatric social worker.  I saw it back then, but it was a little bit different. Now, with  technology and all the high-tech things that one can do, it gets worse  and worse. The numbers are getting higher, and the dollar values are  getting higher.   Protecting seniors from financial exploitation is critical to  ensuring that seniors can maintain a secure retirement.   This bill will help do that. It creates a senior investor protection  grant program to be implemented by the Securities and Exchange  Commission, which will work closely with State securities regulators to  protect older investors and educate seniors about financial matters and  financial scams.   Madam Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Waters and Representative  Gottheimer for bringing this bipartisan bill before us today. I urge my  colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill, and I look forward to seeing  it come to fruition.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for bringing  this bill forward, a bill that is literally very important, not just to  the Guillen family but to so many constituents in my district.   I also recognize that we are in the midst of celebrating the 1-year  anniversary of Vanessa Guillen's death.   Vanessa was one of my constituents before she was transferred to Fort  Hood military base for her Army training. She was a rising star before  her life was tragically cut short.   As Members of Congress, we have the moral obligation to honor  Vanessa's memory and enact change that will end violence in our  military installations.   Her story has captivated Americans of all backgrounds. It brought  much-needed attention to sexual assault in the military, and it has led  to changes being implemented at Fort Hood and at military bases  throughout the Nation and, in fact, the world.   I will not rest until there is justice for Vanessa Guillen and her  family. There is still much work that will need to be done. But the  naming of a post office in her memory this year of her first  anniversary would be but a small gesture on the part of this Congress  in naming a post office after her to memorialize her work and her  legacy.
