 Thank you very much.   Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from Colorado for his  leadership in bringing us, the class of 2014, to the floor to talk  about the commonsense tax reform measure that we have, the opportunity  of decades to make a difference--a big difference--in many of the lives  of the people we represent. I would even say most lives.   This is about the sixth time I have been to the floor to talk about  what I think is the best tax reform package I have seen in my time here  and also the different aspects of tax reform that I think are great for  the country and great for my State. I represent a small State, the  small State of West Virginia.   I have talked about small businesses and families and what it means  for them--simplification and creating a competitive environment. But  there is nothing like going home and talking to people, whether we are  at the grocery store or, as in this past week, when we were all in  Veterans Day parades. People are generally so respectful and very happy  at a Veterans Day parade. I can't say the same for every parade, but I  will say that for the Veterans Day parade, they are generally pretty  happy. I was really surprised because I had several constituents--not  just one or two but several--say to me: Pass this bill; we want tax  relief.   It was totally unsolicited. So West Virginians are paying attention  to what we are doing in the Senate.   Right now, our colleagues on the Finance Committee are working to  advance this bill as early as tomorrow. We are very hopeful that we  will be able to consider this bill on the floor of the Senate the week  we get back from Thanksgiving, as our colleagues in the House are  passing their bill this week. Do you know what? It has been  disappointing to me and really to everybody, I think, involved in this,  as tax reform has become a partisan issue, an exercise. We have shared  goals. We all want to go to the same place in this country--a  prosperous place where everybody can thrive and succeed--but to turn  your back on what I think is a well-thought-out, much studied plan on  tax relief, I think, is to turn a blind eye to every working American,  every American business, and every American family, and, personally, I  don't think it is fair.   Our goals are shared by many Americans, regardless of their party,  because we want to grow small businesses. I am in a State where 95  percent of our businesses are small businesses. We want to allow those  small businesses to make the decisions to grow employment opportunities  or raise wages. We want to make our bigger companies competitive  globally.   People say: You know, what is a big company really going to do for  me, working and living here in West Virginia?   I think if we looked at the major companies that are invested in our  State, we know that making those companies more competitive will result  in those companies creating more jobs, investing more capital, buying  more products, and raising wages for workers. So making our companies  competitive globally is exceedingly important.   I have heard many of my colleagues say that statistics show that many  American families can't even come up with $400 for an emergency  expenditure in their family. That is almost a flat tire and the towing  expense to get your car fixed so you can go to work or take your kids  to school or get to your job and get to your church. I think the tax  reform bill in the Senate meets many of these objectives.   The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation has found that the bill  would provide tax relief to Americans in every single income category,  with the largest percent--and this was after working the bill over  several months--going where it should go, which is to the middle-income  earner.   The Tax Foundation has also found that with the Senate bill, as many  as 925,000 new jobs can be created. That is significant. That is  significant because, I believe, some of those jobs--and I would hope a  great deal of them--would land in the great State of West Virginia.   In West Virginia, the studies showed that the average middle-income  family would gain $1,952 in after-tax income, and the job creation for  the State of West Virginia would be 4,784 jobs in our State. For some  people, that might not sound like very much, but in our State, that is  significant. It is almost 5,000 more jobs. I will take them. We will  take them, and we will provide good workers for them, too. And $1,900  more from your taxes is a major infusion of cash into a family, to make  the decisions they want, which they make around their kitchen tables,  not the decisions that we are making here on the floor.   Yesterday I heard from members of the West Virginia Chamber of  Commerce. Steve Roberts, who is the president of that group, said that  the current system is full of ``negative consequences'' and reduces a  business's ability to hire new workers, invest in inventory and  equipment, and boost employee pay.   These are the hallmarks. What he is saying here is that the  ``negative consequences'' are the hallmarks of what we are fixing and  what we are reforming in this bill. He noted:         Employers are eager to grow, reinvest and reward employees       with better wages. We hope Congress will act quickly to       reduce and simplify taxes ensuring a stronger [and] more       economically vigorous nation.    This is something I don't think we talk about, either. If we had  economic security in our families and economic security in this  country, we would be stronger in a lot of ways that go beyond being  stronger economically. In your family, if you have a decision that you  have to make and you have to come up with some emergency funds, if you  have to borrow or try to figure out a way to make ends meet, it makes  you feel weaker. If you can do it yourself, you are stronger. That is  what we are doing in this bill.   Also, I want to talk about the transparency here. We are hearing  criticisms that this is coming in the dead of night, that nobody has  ever heard of it. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Finance  Committee alone has held 70 hearings on this since the year 2011.  Senators from both parties have had the opportunity to weigh in,  experts from both inside the Capitol and outside the Capitol. Right  now, it is undergoing a full markup in committee, and the House has  gone through the same procedure. This has been done in the total light  of day. This is how legislation is made. So I am very pleased that  these tax reform principles in this bill are moving through our Senate.    We know that the President is very enthusiastic about this. He will  sign a bill that will grow our economy and benefit whom he wants it to  benefit and whom we all want it to--middle-income families.   Each Senator has a choice here. We all have our choices. My friends  from South Dakota and Oklahoma and Louisiana and Colorado, who are on  the floor with me, as well as the Presiding Officer, who is from  Arkansas, have choices every day. You can either cling to the status  quo and say that, yes, everything is working well or you could really  grab this and say that this is good--this is good policy; this is good  politics; it will make our country stronger and our families stronger.  This will help our small businesses thrive, create more jobs, and raise  wages. Above all else, this will benefit our families. I think that it  allows for more growth and more opportunity.   The people whom I represent want this. They want to have more of  their money at the end of the day to be able to make their own  decisions. They want their good, hard work rewarded. They want to see a  country that grows and is optimistic and is strong and powerful.  Economic strength can give us that.   I just heard from a 70-year-old postal worker from Wheeling, WV. He  wrote to me: ``The Senate needs to get these tax cuts and tax reform  done.'' That is the simple way that most people communicate in this  country. I understand that. I hope our friends on the other side of the  aisle understand that.  [[Page S7239]]    It would be great to have us join together as a Senate, as a country,  to do something we know is going to have the right consequences and the  right results of growing this country and providing the relief that  people want with a well-studied process, with well-researched data, and  with the power of the American people behind us.   Thank you.   I now yield to my colleague from Colorado and thank him again for  leading this.
