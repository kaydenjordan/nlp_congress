 Madam Speaker, there is an old country saying: You can  put all the perfume and lipstick you want on a pig, and it is still  pork, and it still stinks.   H.R. 1319 is filled to the brim with bad policies and partisan  priorities that is disguised as ``COVID relief.''   This bill: Pays people more to be on unemployment than to go to work.   Slaps small businesses with job-killing wage mandates.   Gives a $350 billion windfall to States who were mismanaged and broke  before COVID.   Hands a blank check to union bosses and greedy corporate executives  who ran their pensions into the ground and stuck taxpayers with the  tab.   It rewards temper tantrums from teacher unions by doling out billions  of dollars to schools who refuse to open their doors to their students.   This bill is chock full of bad policies, barriers to recovery, and  bailouts galore.   Madam Speaker, let's open the country up, get our kids back into the  classroom, and get America back to work.
