 Mr. President, I stand here today to recognize  the veterans of High Plains Honor Flight who have made their inaugural  trip to Washington, DC. Distinguished veterans from World War II, the  Korean war, and the Vietnam war have made the journey to visit the  national memorials dedicated to their service.   Military service is an exceptional duty to the country. Few words can  describe the gratitude we all share for sacrifice that these men and  women have made to preserve our rights to life, liberty, and the  pursuit of happiness. When the United States has been threatened, our  veterans have bravely answered our countries call without reservation.  Twice a year, the Honor Flight welcomes veterans from across the  country to fly to Washington, DC, free of charge, so that they can  visit the national memorials dedicated to their service.   Please join me in honoring Charles Assmus, Clarence Carlson, John  Dutton, Gordon Norton, Willis Sibley, Michael Abramovich, George  Edinger, James Forrest, Alan Gates, Charles Hall, Jason Laguna, Richard  Lindemann, Richard McCown, James McWilliams, Gerald Mitchell, Erlis  Morse, John Oliver, Bernard Pisciola, Donald Price, Earle Ridgway,  Richard Stoltzfus, Wayne Tobey, Johnny West, Benjamin Zimmerman, Robert  Davison, Gerald McDuffee, Jed Pancoast, Ronald Adam, Ronald Albers,  Leon Bartholomay, Richard Belt, Hal Bennett, Kenneth Blum, Clyde  Bullard Jr., Kenneth Butcher, Jan Carlson, Allan Cazer, Terry Chandler,  Spencer Chapin, Daniel Crego, James Crowell, James Davies, Robert  Delva, William Dowling, Gerald Ecker, Carl England, Thomas Evans, Ricky  Farrier, Markton Gadbury, Roy George, Don Gooding, Jack Hall, Calvin  Hamilton, Robert Jacobson, Charles Jett, Larry Johnson, Daniel Katze,  James Keeler, Gene Keys, Daniel King, Raymond Kirchner Jr., Damian  Kisner, Richard Knight, Terrence Kullbom, Dale Langholf, Noel LaRose  II, Harvey Lawson, Richard Lawson, Robert Loner, Jerald Lucas Antonio  Luna, Thomas Mason, Tony Mathias, Bobby Matthews, Charles McConnell,  Timothy McGinnis, Allen Meyer, Blythe Miley, Richard Miller, Thomas  Mitchell, Robert Montgomery, James Morgan, Richard Morris, Paul Niebel,  Larry Odegard, Carol Jean Padilla, Theron Parlin, David Patterson, Mark  Patterson, Robert Pennington, Randall Peonio, Arturo Perez, Floyd  Peterson, Christopher Petroff, Linda Pickett, Gary Pitt, Donald  Posselt, Richard Ranabargar, John Rasmussen, Robert Righi, Gary  Schuler, Curtis Shaffer, John Shaffner, Lee Sherbenou, Donald Simmons,  Jerry Skelton, Richard Smith, Richard Smith Jr., Jimmy Spence, Donald  Spotanski, Roger Stocker, Thomas Tedesco, Virgil Treadway, Ted Turner,  Thomas Wartella, Arthur Weidner, Mark Williamson, Garry Wilson, William  Woolman, Darell Zimbelman.                            ____________________
