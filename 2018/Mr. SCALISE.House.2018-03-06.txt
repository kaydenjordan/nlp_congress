 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding and for  his leadership working together in a very bipartisan way to bring  forward RAY BAUM'S Act. Not only is this piece of legislation important  to reauthorize the FCC and the important work that they do, but it also  is a fitting tribute  [[Page H1413]]  to Ray Baum himself and, in so many ways, to all of the work that our  great staffs do to allow this Capitol to work properly and to allow  Congress to work for the American people.   It doesn't just take Members of Congress, but an incredibly dedicated  and talented staff, and each of us are blessed to have wonderful  staffs--I am surely no exception--who allow us to do our jobs so well.  The fact that we are using this legislation to pay tribute to Ray Baum  and all of the staff of the Capitol, I think, is equally important that  we do just this.   Mr. Speaker, President Trump challenged Congress to make the Federal  Government more accountable to the American people and to eliminate red  tape that hurts job creation and economic growth. The RAY BAUM'S Act  does just that.   First of all, we meet those two goals by doing a number of things.  The legislation will reauthorize the Federal Communications Commission  for the first time in 28 years.   The FCC does important work for our country, especially in the  telecommunications arena. I am proud to continue to serve on the  Communications and Technology Subcommittee, which is one of the great  examples of United States dominance--America is the dominant force in  technology--and it is important that we have fair rules of the game.  The FCC is that arbiter. The fact that they haven't been reauthorized  for 28 years, I think, it is long past due that we get this done. We  also make critical reforms that will modernize the agencies with tools  that it needs to meet the demands of consumers for the 21st century.    This legislation creates an important backstop for our local radio  and TV broadcasters who have been completing the final stage of the  incentive auction. This keeps America on track to be the global leader  on 5G communications by implementing new spectrum policy.   This is something our committee has led on. The country needs more  spectrum. We have been able to find creative ways to free up more  spectrum so that billions of dollars of private sector investment can  be used to build out these great networks in 3G, 4G, and, now, 5G so  that we can continue to advance technology.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to also thank Chairwoman  Blackburn for including the FCC Consolidated Reporting Act that I  worked so closely on with Senator Heller for years to try to get this  legislation passed. This is included as part of this legislation. This  will provide relief to so many job creators and to the FCC by  consolidating and eliminating so many outdated reporting requirements.   What do I mean by eliminating outdated reporting requirements, Mr.  Speaker?   How often do we hear about things that are on the books, laws that  are on the books that are so outdated and so unnecessary? This is one  of the reports that we are outdating in this bill.   Right now, there is still, on the books, a requirement that the FCC  report on the annual competition within the telegraph industry. Mr.  Speaker, that is right.   Since Samuel Morse invented the telegraph back in the 1830s, that  might have been important in the 1800s, even in the early 1900s; but  the fact that today, in 2018, there is still a requirement that the FCC  issue a report on competition within the telegraph industry is a  glaring example of why it is so important for us to update our laws and  eliminate outdated laws.   We are getting rid of this ridiculous requirement and a number of  other unnecessary and ridiculous requirements like that so that we can  free the FCC up to do the important work they need to do.                                time  1515    So, again, I commend the chairman for the work that he has done in a  very bipartisan way to bring forth the RAY BAUM'S Act, and I urge all  of my colleagues to support this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 94 and ``yea'' on  rollcall No. 95.                            ____________________
