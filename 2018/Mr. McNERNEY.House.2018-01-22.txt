 Mr. Speaker, I rise to ask both sides of this Chamber  to stop bickering and finger-pointing and start listening to each  other. Let's come to a compromise.   This government shutdown is a disgrace to this Congress and hurtful  to this country. Both sides are blaming each other, and the American  people are shaking their heads in disgust and disbelief.   Both sides have valid points, but, in this case, partial rights  actually make a wrong. The government needs continuous funding. The  military needs funding. Domestic programs, such as homeland security,  children's health, and the opioid epidemic, need proper funding. DACA  needs a solution. The southern border needs securing.   Mr. Speaker, I ask Members of the House, let's work together and find  reasonable compromises for these important issues. Let's look at each  other as honorable people.                            ____________________
