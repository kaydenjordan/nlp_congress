[[Page S1564]]                                ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.              Calling for an Independent, Bipartisan Commission     Mr. President, the highlight of the week, of course, is  President Trump's speech to the joint session of Congress, the first  major public speech he has given since his inauguration. The Chamber of  the House of Representatives was filled with Members of both the House  and Senate, the Supreme Court Justices, the Cabinet, and many other  dignitaries for the speech. It went for about 60 minutes, which is  reasonable under Presidential standards. Many have gone much longer,  and I listened carefully to the statement by the new President to  really glean his priorities, in terms of his administration and what he  hopes to see happen in this country.   There were many issues that he touched on, but there was one he  didn't. He didn't say a word--not one word--about the Russian  intervention in our last Presidential campaign. This is not  speculation. It is a reality that 17 different U.S. intelligence  agencies have told us that Vladimir Putin and the Russian Government  were attempting to subvert and undermine our Presidential election. To  our knowledge, that has never happened at any time in the history of  the United States. It is the first time a sovereign nation has tried to  literally launch a cyber invasion of the United States of America to  try to change the outcome of the most important electoral choice under  the Constitution--the choice of President of the United States. It is a  major issue. It is one President Trump cannot ignore.   During the course of that speech, he never once mentioned the word  ``Russia.'' He never raised this issue as to whether it was worthy of  investigation. He described it as a ruse. He has dismissed it and  basically has paid no attention to it whatsoever and wants the rest of  America to forget it as well.   That is not going to happen because the investigation about this  Russian cyber invasion continues. We know the Federal Bureau of  Investigation is deep into an investigation. I don't know what it will  find. I don't know if they will find any complicity with anyone in the  United States, anyone in the Trump campaign. It is only after we have  an independent, complete, and credible investigation that we may know  the facts.   We also have an investigation underway by many of our intelligence  agencies, which are looking at the involvement of the Russians trying  to change the outcome of our election. Those investigations are  underway.   One element came up last night that has changed the conversation in  Washington about this whole issue. Even before last night's news, we  knew Attorney General Jeff Sessions needed to recuse himself from any  Justice Department investigation into Russia's efforts to influence the  2016 election in support of the Trump campaign.   The Department of Justice standard for recusal--that is, the removal  of the Attorney General from an investigation--is pretty clear. It  requires recusal by someone who has ``a personal or political  relationship with any person or organization substantially involved in  the conduct that is the subject of the investigation.''   The Department of Justice regulations define ``political  relationship'' to include service as a principal adviser to a candidate  or campaign organization. Well, that certainly covers Attorney General  Jeff Sessions and the Trump campaign. Attorney General Sessions was  named in March 2016 as chairman of then-Candidate Trump's National  Security Advisory Committee. Steve Bannon, formerly of Breitbart News  and now a close adviser to the President, described Jeff Sessions to  the Washington Post as follows: ``Throughout the campaign, Sessions has  been the fiercest, most dedicated, and most loyal promoter in Congress  of Trump's agenda, and has played a critical role as the clearinghouse  for policy and philosophy to undergird the implementation of that  agenda.''   Attorney General Sessions close relationship with the Trump campaign  creates a compelling basis for his recusal from any investigation of  Russian involvement in that campaign.  [[Page S1570]]    So far, to this day, to this moment, Jeff Sessions has refused to  recuse himself from this investigation. He refused when I asked him  about it during the course of the hearing, and he has refused since he  was named Attorney General. Now it is clear that his unwillingness to  recuse himself is no longer tenable or acceptable or even explainable.   Last night, the Washington Post reported that then-Senator Jeff  Sessions spoke with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak twice during the  Presidential campaign--in July at a Heritage Foundation event near the  Republican National Convention and in September in a private  conversation in the Senator's office. These communications came as a  great surprise because until last night, Attorney General Sessions did  not disclose them.   During his hearing in January, in preparation to become Attorney  General, Jeff Sessions, then Senator, was asked by Senator Al Franken  of Minnesota: ``If there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with  the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the  course of this campaign, what would you do?''   Jeff Sessions' answer under oath included this statement: ``I did not  have communications with the Russians.''   Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont also asked Attorney General Sessions  in writing: ``Have you been in contact with anyone connected to any  part of the Russian government about the 2016 election, either before  or after election day?'' Attorney General Sessions' response was  ``No.''   It is hard to understand why Attorney General Sessions has not been  more forthcoming and upfront with Congress and the American people  about communications which we now know in fact did take place. If he  thinks there was nothing wrong with these communications, why would he  conceal them? It is deeply troubling.   The reality is, the Attorney General has compromised his credibility  when it comes to investigating Russia's cyber invasion of America's  election. His recusal is no longer an option, it is a necessity.   People say: Oh, of course, a Democratic Senator is saying that the  Republican Attorney General should recuse himself. This morning, it has  been reported that a number of top Republicans in Congress have called  for the Attorney General's recusal, including House Majority Leader  Kevin McCarthy and House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz.   It is imperative that career Justice Department professionals be  allowed to follow the facts in this investigation to discover the  truth. We may need a special counsel, but these steps alone are not  sufficient. I believe we need an independent, bipartisan commission,  led by Americans of unimpeachable integrity, to get to the bottom and  get to the facts on this attack on our democracy.   I know the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence is also conducting  an investigation. The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence,  which, incidentally, is chaired by Representative Devin Nunes, who  served on the executive committee of President Trump's transition team,  agreed to the parameters of an investigation yesterday.   The Intelligence Committees cannot, by their very nature, provide the  transparency and accountability that an independent commission would  bring to this issue, and the chairmen of those two committees--House  and Senate--have already raised serious questions about their own  impartiality by calling on the media organizations at the behest of the  White House to challenge news stories on this issue.   How could you possibly maintain objectivity if the elements of an  investigation are compromised before the investigation even starts?   I am particularly concerned that Chairman Nunes has already publicly  expressed views of the outcome of his committee's investigation before  it has even started. That is not a professional, honest, or credible  way to approach this.   We need an independent, bipartisan commission to get to the truth,  and that may include taking a hard look at the Attorney General's  communications with the Russians and at his refusal to disclose those  communications. We also need to point out the obvious, which is that  when it comes to investigating Russia's involvement in helping the  Trump campaign, we have to follow the money, and that includes  reviewing President Trump's tax returns, which, unlike any other  Presidential candidate in modern times, he has refused to share with  the American people.   Yesterday, Senators Stabenow, Wyden, and a number of my colleagues  sent a letter to the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Orrin  Hatch, of Utah, urging him to allow committee members to review the  President's tax returns in a closed executive session. That is  something the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee has the  authority to do. The letter pointed out that this oversight is  essential given the media reports about Russia as well as the possible  unconstitutional emoluments being accepted by President Trump's vast  business empire.   I support this request from my colleagues. It is imperative that  President Trump level with the American people about his business's  foreign entanglements, especially those involving Russia.   This issue is not going away. I urge my colleagues on both sides of  the aisle to join me in pursuing all of the facts about last year's  Russian attack on our democracy.   It was just a few weeks ago that the President's National Security  Advisor, General Flynn, resigned. Do you remember why? He  misrepresented to the Vice President and the American people  conversations which he had had with the Russians. He ended up giving up  his position as the No. 1 person in national security in the White  House.   Now questions have been raised about the credibility of the Attorney  General--the No. 1 person in the Trump administration when it comes to  the administration of justice. What is the issue? It is the same issue  as with General Flynn--conversations with the Russians which were not  disclosed to the American public.   This is an issue that is going to continue to be in the forefront, as  it should be, until we can bring the facts to the American people. The  only way to reach that point is by having the Attorney General recuse  himself from any investigation, appointing as a special prosecutor--or  someone in that capacity--someone who is credible who can pursue this  matter and then initiating an independent, bipartisan investigation by  a national commission with credible chairs who have no political agenda  and care enough for the United States to view this invasion by Russia  as absolutely unacceptable.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
