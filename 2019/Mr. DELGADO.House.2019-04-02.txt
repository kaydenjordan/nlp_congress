 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to highlight the need for  our country to finally achieve universal healthcare coverage.   As the wealthiest country in the world, there is simply no excuse for  us to be the only developed country left without universal healthcare.  There are a lot of different ways to achieve universal healthcare, and  I believe that a public option is the best way for us to get there.  That is why I was pleased yesterday to introduce the Medicare-X Choice  Act, which will finally bring our country to universal healthcare  coverage.   My bill will combine Medicare physician networks and reimbursement  rates with ACA coverage standards to create a new public option  available to all Americans. My bill would allow those who are happy  with their employer-provided insurance to keep it, while offering  another more affordable coverage option to those in need.   With this bill, we are introducing more choice and more competition  to the marketplace, starting in the places that need it most, like  rural areas with provider shortages. This much-needed competition will  drive down costs for everyone.   Our constituents expect us to take on the big issues impacting their  lives. This should not be a partisan issue. We must roll up our sleeves  and get to work so we can lower the cost of coverage for all Americans.  [[Page H2948]]                                ____________________
