 Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of  legislation that I introduced today along with Senators Alex Padilla  and John Hickenlooper. This is a companion to the bipartisan bill that  Representative Mike Thompson has introduced in the House of  Representatives.   In 2020, the Fire Victim Trust was established after Pacific Gas &  Electric, PG&E, was found legally responsible for major California  wildfires in 2015, 2017, and 2018. PG&E contributed about $13 billion  to this fund to pay victims of these wildfires to cover losses they  suffered.   Unfortunately, the specific situations of each of these victims is  different, and it is unclear to many whether they will need to pay  Federal income tax on the amounts they receive. Moreover, it is unfair  that these victims should have to worry about paying taxes on amounts  that are simply intended to make them whole.   In addition, about 30 percent of settlement payouts are devoted to  attorney fees, for attorneys whom the victims did not hire. It appears  that victims will even owe taxes on the full amount of the settlement,  including these attorney fees.   This is a problem now for wildfire victims in California. However, as  the frequency and severity of wildfires grows across the Western United  States due to climate change, it is more likely that this is a problem  that California and other States will face again.   Our legislation would do two things. First, it would clarify that  such wildfire settlement fees are not taxable. Second, it would create  an above-the-line tax deduction for relevant attorney fees. This would  provide tax certainty and fairness to wildfire settlement victims now  and into the future.   With the incidence of wildfires rising, this is an important issue  for Congress to address now to avoid victims having to worry about  paying taxes on settlement payments that are meant to make them whole  from devastating losses that many of them have suffered.   I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this bill.                                  ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. Padilla):   S. 4669. A bill to establish the Western Riverside National Wildlife  Refuge, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and  Public Works.    Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Western  Riverside County National Wildlife Refuge Act, along with my California  colleague, Senator Alex Padilla.   As our country's population grows, so does the need for  infrastructure like housing and highways. However, we must find a way  to balance the needs of growth with the preservation of our natural  resources, including endangered species habitat and green space for the  health and safety of our communities.   Senator Padilla and I are proud this legislation would accomplish  those goals by creating a Federal wildlife refuge in western Riverside  County as part of a collaborative land management plan created by  Riverside County.   The newly created wildlife refuge would provide expanded recreation,  conservation, and educational opportunities for the local community-- one of the fastest growing in the Nation.  [[Page S3785]]    This legislation builds off Riverside County's multiple species  habitat conservation plan, allowing land that has already been acquired  by the Western Riverside County Regional Conservation Authority to be  included in the new Federal wildlife refuge this bill would create.   Our bill would establish a new unit of the National Wildlife Refuge  System--the Western Riverside County National Wildlife Refuge. The  refuge would be comprised of donated lands from Western Riverside  County Regional Conservation Authority, as well as any additional lands  deemed appropriate by the Interior Department acquired from willing  sellers or donors, including Federal, State, or local agencies, Tribes,  or private land owners.   This refuge would not only create increased recreation, outdoor  access, and educational opportunities in Southern California but also  work to protect endangered species in the region like the arroyo toad,  the southwestern willow flycatcher, and the quino checkerspot  butterfly. These protections would in turn help streamline  infrastructure projects and support smart growth and land management  planning.   As temperatures continue to rise and California experiences another  historic drought and wildfire season, it is more important than ever to  ensure that we conserve green spaces. As I stated earlier, Riverside  County's population is one of the fastest growing in the country, and  it is well documented that human development can have damaging effects  on the health of endangered and threatened species. Additionally,  overdevelopment results in poor community health and well-being.   That is why smart, collaborative land management planning is our best  option on how to move forward with a growing population and economy,  while safeguarding the resources that keep our communities and wildlife  populations healthy.   This bill would support the conservation of habitat for 146 different  species in the region, including 33 species that are listed as  threatened or endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the  California Department of Fish and Wildlife. The acquisition boundary  for the refuge was created in collaboration with the county,  environmental groups and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The  boundary area expands on local conservation efforts and increase access  to green spaces, especially to underserved communities.   The coronavirus pandemic and recent extreme heat waves in our State  have served to underscore the importance of ensuring access and  preservation of open spaces, especially as our Nation's population  grows and its cities expand.   This bill also meets the Biden administration's call to conserve 30  percent of U.S. lands and waters by 2030, an initiative known as  America the Beautiful. We are proud the creation of this refuge would  contribute to that important goal.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.                                  ______                                         By Mr. PADILLA (for himself and Mr. Cramer):   S. 4672. A bill to modify the authority of the Secretary of Defense  to transfer excess aircraft to other departments of the Federal  Government and to authorize the Secretary to transfer excess aircraft  to the Governor of a State, and for other purposes; to the Committee on  Armed Services.   Mr. PADILLA, Mr. President, I rise to introduce the bipartisan  Emergency Aircraft Act of 2022.   Currently, DOD has a program to transfer excess aircraft to Federal  Agencies for wildfire suppression purposes. However, under current law,  DOD is limited to providing only seven aircraft total to each Agency.   After years of increasingly catastrophic wildfires, it has become  clear that the Federal Government must do more to support suppression  efforts to get fires under control quickly, as well as support search  and rescue to keep communities safe. If there are excess aircraft  available, they should be put to use suppressing fires and protecting  communities.   Furthermore, as fire activity has exploded in the past few years,  States have stepped up and greatly increased their own suppression  efforts. They should also be allowed to utilize these excess aircraft  to increase suppression capabilities and put fires out faster. However,  under current law, States do not have access to these excess aircraft.   This bill would remove the arbitrary cap on how many excess aircraft  DOD can transfer to Federal Agencies for wildfire suppression efforts;  allow States to receive excess aircraft; expand the purposes for which  these aircraft could be used from just ``wildfire suppression  purposes'' to include purposes of ``wildfire suppression, search and  rescue, or emergency operations pertaining to wildfires''; and mandate  an annual report from DOD to the Committees on Armed Services of the  Senate and the House of Representatives on aircraft transferred during  the previous fiscal year.   This bill represents a commonsense step forward to expand fire  suppression and search and rescue operations across the Federal  Government and State governments.   I want to thank Senator Cramer for joining me in this bipartisan  effort, and I urge my colleagues to join us in working to pass this  bill as quickly as possible in light of the extreme wildfire danger  facing States across the country.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of  legislation that I introduced today along with Senators Alex Padilla  and John Hickenlooper.
