 Madam President, the Constitution charges Congress with  the authority and the responsibility to raise and support armies and  provide and maintain a navy. It is a responsibility this body takes  very seriously. That is why for over 50 years the National Defense  Authorization Act has been signed into law each and every year. It is  the only piece of legislation with this long history of consistently  being passed by Congress and signed into law by the President. This  history is a reflection of the importance of the policies and funding  authorizations within the bill.   I am particularly proud of what this bill includes to support  Michigan's important contributions to our national defense. For  example, the 127th Wing at Selfridge Air National Guard Base flies the  A-10 and in 2015 deployed in the fight against ISIS. As a result of  their outstanding performance, the 127th Wing won the Spaatz Trophy as  the top flying unit in the Air National Guard,  [[Page S3939]]  as well as the Meritorious Unit Award following their deployment.   The A-10 is without question a great airplane, but it is also getting  old. The A-10 fleet will require wing replacements in order to continue  to fly those important missions. That is why I worked to include an  authorization for an additional $65 million for A-10 wing replacement,  bringing the bill's total investment in new A-10 wings to over $144  million. These funds will help pay for new wings for a full squadron's  worth of A-10 aircraft, which are vital for close air support and  combat search and rescue missions. Our troops on the ground know that  when they hear the iconic roar of an A-10, help is on the way. A-10  pilots and maintainers are proud of their mission, as they should be.  This bill works to ensure that these aircraft will keep flying.   The legislation also includes an additional $70 million for the next- generation combat vehicle prototype. The Detroit Arsenal in Warren will  be the home of the Army's cross-functional team for the next-generation  combat vehicle, reporting to the Army Futures Command.   This important work on developing the future of the Army's ground  vehicles will continue to occur in Southeast Michigan, taking advantage  of many of the automotive manufacturers and suppliers that are shaping  the future of mobility.   Just as the commercial automotive industry is developing connected  and autonomous vehicles that will change the future of transportation  forever, the next-generation combat vehicle and other concepts  developed by the Army's Tank Automotive Research, Development and  Engineer Center, TARDEC, will change the future of warfare.   All self-driving vehicles, whether they are developed for the  military or for the auto industry, rely on artificial intelligence and  machine learning. Artificial intelligence powers autonomous systems but  can also reform the business practices of the Pentagon. AI can help  with personnel management and purchasing practices and find insights  and efficiencies that are difficult to find unless you can manipulate  and analyze the Department's massive amounts of data.   Artificial intelligence will have an enormous impact on our economy,  and that is why it is essential that the United States make significant  investments in AI development and that we lead the world in developing  this capability. We know that our competitors are taking AI very  seriously. China has developed a national strategy to develop its AI  capabilities, and Vladimir Putin has said that whoever leads in AI will  rule the world. The United States must lead the way on artificial  intelligence to best shape the future economy and our country, to  strengthen our national security, and to address the moral and ethical  questions that arise with any new technology.   Without question, the United States needs our own coordinated  strategy on AI. That is why I wrote a provision in the bill that  designates a senior official for artificial intelligence at the  Department of Defense and cuts redtape, letting that person utilize all  of the flexibilities Congress has provided to the Pentagon.   It is also important that we take steps to protect American ingenuity  and innovation generally. That is why I also authored a provision in  the bill that will allow the Department of Defense to require that  companies and researchers receiving defense contracts not share new  technologies and capabilities developed with any foreign entity, and if  they do, they will lose the rights to that intellectual property. This  will help ensure that investments made by DARPA and the DOD labs are  not shared with our competitors.   Additionally, this bill also includes reform to the Committee on  Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS. CFIUS works to  ensure that investments in U.S. companies made by foreign investors do  not threaten national security by providing other countries with access  to the crown jewels of U.S. technology.   In closing, Madam President, I wish to point out that this bill is  named for Chairman John McCain. We all know his presence is missed on  the Armed Services Committee, as well as throughout the entire Senate.  I wish him a speedy recovery. I am keeping him and his family in my  prayers.   Madam President, I yield the floor.                              amendment no. 2276     I suggest the absence of a quorum.
