 Madam Speaker, the memorial service for  former Vice President Walter Mondale was held last week.   Unbeknownst to him, Mondale had a major impact on my life and on the  lives of other refugees fleeing violence and oppression in Southeast  Asia. The moral courage he displayed then should influence and inspire  world leaders now as we confront a new refugee crisis spawned by  Russia's invasion of Ukraine.   The Carter-Mondale administration took office in 1977 in the  aftermath of the end of the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam war.  Because my parents had worked with American and South Vietnamese forces  during the war, they faced persecution by the communist government that  had taken over.   In 1979, we were finally able to escape by boat. Unfortunately for  us, we ran out of fuel in international waters. But, fortunately, a  U.S. Navy ship responded to our distress call, and the sailors gave us  the fuel and supplies we needed to reach a Malaysian refugee camp. We  were the beneficiaries of American power and generosity.   My family's physical journey from Vietnam to America and our  emotional journey from darkness to light was only possible because of  policy decisions made by this Nation's leaders.   After Saigon fell to communist forces in 1975, President Ford  permitted about 130,000 South Vietnamese citizens into the United  States. But after that, America's gates were essentially closed to  refugees from Southeast Asia, even though the situation on the ground  continued to deteriorate.   Former U.S. allies were being sent to what was called reeducation  camps. They were essentially hard labor camps, and many of them didn't  survive.   When Carter and Mondale entered the White House, many Vietnamese  families, including mine, were taking their chances on the high seas.  We were collectively known as the Vietnamese boat people. There was  debate within the U.S. Government about what to do. Some policymakers  thought America had done enough. Others believed this country could do  more. Carter and Mondale ultimately sided with the advocates for  additional action, even though the weight of public opinion was against  them.   Mondale chaired a meeting during which he grew impatient with  officials from the Defense and State departments. ``Are you telling me  that we have thousands of people drowning in the open sea, and we have  the 7th Fleet right there, and we can't help them?'' he asked.   Although some Navy officials were reluctant to use American ships to  rescue refugees, Mondale overruled them, and the Navy soon came to  cherish their humanitarian role. As one ship commander involved in a  rescue operation told Mondale: ``I thought it would demoralize my  sailors, but I was dead wrong. It's going to make a difference to the  way those people think about America. Because when their life was at  risk, they saw this ship with an American flag come up and these young  guys go down and pick them up . . . It's hard to stay mad at a policy  like that.''   Of course, saving refugees was only half the battle. Refugees also  needed to find countries willing to accept them. Again, Mondale led the  country and the world.   In July 1979, Carter sent Mondale to Geneva to address a U.N.  conference where Mondale delivered an eloquent and effective speech. He  invoked the inadequate efforts taken by the international community to  assist European Jews fleeing Nazi Germany. In that case, the  consequences of inaction were the death camps.  [[Page H4871]]    ``Let us not re-enact their error,'' he told the delegates. ``Let us  not be the heirs to their shame. . . .   ``We face a world problem. Let us fashion a world solution.   ``History will not forgive us if we fail. History will not forget us  if we succeed.''   Mondale's speech prompted a standing ovation. More importantly, it  prompted many nations to increase the number of refugees they accepted.   The record is clear. The only reason my family and families like ours  were given sanctuary and opportunity in America was because of leaders  like Mondale, who chose to do what was morally right over what was  politically popular.   While history does not repeat itself, it does rhyme. Today, a new  refugee crisis has emerged. Millions of families have fled Ukraine in  the face of Russian savagery. To date, the response from the  international community has mostly been in the mold of Mondale. World  leaders have spent political and financial capital to help their fellow  human beings.   We must continue to meet the moral moment. We must follow the Mondale  model.   Thank God for Walter Mondale. Rest in peace, Mr. Vice President.                            ____________________
