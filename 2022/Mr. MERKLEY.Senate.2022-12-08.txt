 Mr. President, I join my colleague and fellow Oregonian,  Senator Wyden, in recognizing all of the great work that Duncan Wyse  has done throughout his 20 years organizing the annual Oregon Business  Plan Summit.   Every year, even virtually during the COVID-19 pandemic, the summit  brings together business, government, and nonprofit leaders to engage  in a robust dialogue focused on how we can all work together to grow  Oregon's economy and improve the lives of those who call our State  home. Its mission can be easily summed up by two words, which happen to  be the same two words of the Oregon Business Plan's strategic vision:  ``Shared Prosperity.''   The idea for the summit was born from Duncan's work with other  business associations to craft an economic recovery plan that would  help bring Oregon out of the 2002 recession. Senator Wyden found out  about the plan, called Duncan, and together, they came up with the idea  of having an event to share it publicly. Two decades later, the summit  is still going strong--attracting thousands of leaders from every  corner of our State. And Duncan has been at the head of it every step  of the way, making sure that it continues to grow and evolve along with  the challenges and opportunities facing Oregonians whether issues of  sustainability and transportation, education and tax policy, or, more  recently, how to get our State moving again coming out of the pandemic.   Oregon has come a very long way since the first Business Plan Summit  in 2002. We have seen tremendous growth in industries like mass timber  and continue to lead the country in manufacturing semiconductors. And  so much of that success is due to Duncan Wyse and his leadership of the  Oregon Business Plan Summit. So on behalf of Oregonians everywhere, I  just want to join Senator Wyden in thanking Duncan for all of his great  work these past 20 years.                            ____________________
