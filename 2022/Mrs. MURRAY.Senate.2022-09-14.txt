 Madam President, I ask to speak as if in morning  business.    Madam President, yesterday, my Republican colleagues  introduced a national abortion ban and made it clear that they are  coming after the rights of my constituents and they are coming after  the rights of people across the country.   This atrocious bill threatens the people of Kansas who just voted  overwhelmingly to protect abortion rights. It threatens the hundreds of  thousands of people in Michigan who just signed a petition for a  referendum vote to protect abortion and States like mine which already  have strong abortion protections on our books.   Up to now, Republicans have tried to play down their abortion  extremism. They have tried to run away from the consequences of their  extreme agenda, even as patients have been denied prescriptions that  they need, even as doctors have been forced to wait until patients'  lives are in danger before they can take action, even as healthcare  crises they have caused spill across State lines to disastrous effect.   But despite their empty rhetoric about leaving it to States, the  truth has been painfully clear: They think they know better than women  when it comes to reproductive healthcare decisions. They have shown,  again and again, they do not trust women to have full control over  their own bodies, and they are also willing to go after doctors.   They have blocked the most basic bills like Senator Cortez Masto's  bill that would have made sure people can still travel to other States  for legally available care or my bill making sure that doctors in  States where abortion is legal cannot be punished for doing their job.   Over and over, they have stood in the way of Democrats' efforts to  protect women's abortion rights, and it is crystal clear why. This bill  shows the true Republican position. They want to ban abortion for  everyone, in every single State, and they want to punish doctors. They  want to put them in prison for doing their jobs.   So, to anyone who lives in a blue State like mine, anyone who thinks  they are safe from these attacks, here is the painful reality:  Republicans are coming after your rights, and you don't have to take my  word for it. The Senator from South Carolina said yesterday:         If we take back the House and the Senate, I can assure you       we'll have a vote on our bill.    There it is. It couldn't be clearer. That is the MAGA agenda for all  50 States: rights stripped away and doctors in prison.   Regardless of your circumstances, regardless of what is best for your  health, regardless of your family plans--of your hopes or your fears or  your dreams for your future--Republicans want to control your personal  decisions. They don't trust you to have full control over your own  body. This is horrifying.   When he unveiled the bill yesterday, the Senator from South Carolina  also said   [[Page S4594]]              I'll make a prediction: we stay on this and we keep talking       about it, maybe less than a decade from now, this will be       law.    ``This will be law.'' This is the future that they want--a national  abortion ban.   Well, let me tell you something. The Senator from South Carolina may  not have been paying attention, but Democrats are already talking about  this issue every week, every day, every opportunity. And women across  the country have been with us, fighting for the right to abortion and  fighting back against Republicans' harmful attacks. We saw it in  Kansas. We are seeing it in Michigan. And I am seeing it everywhere I  go in Washington State.   I have been talking to doctors and patients and women and men across  our country, and they are outraged--outraged--that Republicans want to  take away their rights, that Republicans want to put doctors in prison.  And I am too. I have never been madder.   So here is my message to Republicans: If you want to go after my  constituents' rights, if you want to go after women's bodies and  futures, if you want to pass a national abortion ban like this extreme  bill, you are going to have to go through me because Democrats are  going to keep standing up for women and men across the country who do  not want their rights taken away.   I yield the floor.
