 A question of Parliamentary order here. The time  during the colloquy will continue to be charged to the Senator from  Hawaii, correct?   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.    Through the Chair, I would inquire of the  distinguished Senator from Hawaii whether, in addition to the concern  about pollution that crosses borders when it flows down rivers or that  crosses borders when it comes out of smokestacks and floats across  State borders into other States, is there not also a supremacy clause  in the U.S. Constitution that puts Federal law ahead of State law where  there is a conflict?   Are there not means and manners by which a Federal official could  either pretend or actually believe or try to impose a Federal rule in a  way that interferes with the rights of States that wish to protect  themselves more than the fossil fuel-friendly Administrator and inhibit  their ability to do so?    Will the Senator yield for another question?    Will the Senator yield for another question?    Will the Senator yield for another question?    The Senator from Hawaii is a very kind as well as a  very distinguished individual, and he is willing to spot Mr. Pruitt's  sincerity in the way he goes about his business. I am a skeptical New  Englander, and I think Mr. Pruitt looks a little bit too bought and  paid for to spot him that same degree of sincerity.   But to the question of the Federal and the State role, to the extent  that it was Mr. Pruitt's position that the EPA should not be on the  front line, that it is actually up to the States to bear the bulk of  this burden and to be on the front line and enforce environmental laws  and protect their Senators, what about the conduct of the Oklahoma  attorney general's office might give us some pause as to his sincerity  in this being a federalist question in which the power to regulate  should be enforced at the State level by strong attorney general  enforcement as former attorneys general like myself know?    If I recall the facts of this correctly, not only did  he shut down the environmental unit of the department of the attorney  general, but in subsequent reporting you could not find a dollar  allocated to environmental activities in the Oklahoma attorney  general's budget. And he abandoned what his predecessor, Drew  Edmondson, had been running, which was not just to have an  environmental enforcement unit within the department of the attorney  general, but also to have an environmental enforcement team that  brought together Federal folks, State regulators, water officials, and  put together the multiagency task force that prosecuted environmental  cases--gone also.   Finally, Drew Edmondson used to do an annual report, as I recall, on  the successes of his environmental enforcement and his environmental  task force, the multiagency group. That was gone too.    In addition to all of those facts, what worries me a little bit--you  know, one of the things we have to assess in this process is the  credibility of the nominee. Are they going to tell you the truth in the  nomination process? If they are not going to tell you the truth in the  nomination process, you are probably going to get a lot of malarkey out  of them down the road as well.   He took the position that he actually had not gotten rid of the  environmental unit. He said he had moved it into a new unit--the  federalism unit--which, if you go to their own website and read about  the federalism unit, it says it is an appellate. You don't do  environmental enforcement at the appellate level; you do environmental  enforcement at the trial level, and you do it at the investigative  level.   Further, if you read down, the word ``environment'' never appears in  the general description of that unit. So it is not as if there is just  one little wrinkle of the environmental unit kind of magically  disappearing under this guy. Wherever there was any activity by the  department of the attorney general with respect to the environment, he  shut it down, zeroed it out, silenced it, finished it.   I believe that is a pretty fair description of the status in  Oklahoma.    Well, on the subject of respect for and obedience to  statute, I thought we might want to discuss for a minute the Oklahoma  open records law which the attorney general of Oklahoma not only needs  to obey, but he needs to enforce it. He is not just subject to that  law. He is the agency responsible for policing compliance with it.   What we have just seen is 750 days of noncompliance by his office  with an Open Records Act request where he refused to provide anything  to us in the EPW Committee. And, by the way, shame on the Environment  and Public Works Committee for allowing that to happen. Shame on the  Environment and Public Works Committee for--on a purely partisan  basis--not allowing us to get those emails that this office had covered  up and suppressed for 2 years.   Finally, they got before a judge and the judge said: Release that  first set Tuesday--Tuesday. So he is sitting on several thousand emails  between his office and the big energy companies and the big energy  organizations, and he stonewalls everybody for 2 years.   When a judge finally gets a look at this misbehavior, first she says:  That is an abject failure. Second, she says: That is unreasonable under  the statute. And third, she says: Produce them Tuesday.   This was a guy who didn't think he could produce them Tuesday. He  couldn't produce them for 2 years, and now the judge says Tuesday.   So when you are looking at his adherence to law, his respect for law,  it seems to me that this is yet another example in which off he goes.  The beneficiaries are himself and all the big fossil fuel companies  that he was engaged with. That is who the beneficiaries were.   The people who lost were the ones who were supposedly the  beneficiaries of the law--the public, the right to know, transparency.   So it makes for an interesting comparison to his version of  compliance with the law. And if that is the best he can do complying  with an Oklahoma statute that he is obliged not only to comply with but  to enforce, what reasonable conclusion would my colleagues draw about  his willingness to follow Federal law, which he also despises?    Well, I wanted to go back to lawyering for a minute  in response to the Senator's comments about the predicament that the  other side is being put into--being asked to vote on the nominee,  knowing that the disclosure of thousands of emails between the nominee  and the industry and companies that he is going to supposed to regulate  is imminent--is imminent. As the distinguished Senator from Hawaii  said, maybe there is nothing in those; maybe this is just an empty  concern. But over and over and over, emails have been really important  at breaking investigations open. Certainly, our friends on the other  side--until the election in November--had a fascination with emails, a  fixation with emails. They couldn't get enough of other people's  emails. And now suddenly everybody is looking at the ceiling, examining  the ceiling tiles when it is time to wonder about these emails.    There is a doctrine, if I recall successfully back in the days when I  was a more active lawyer, called willful blindness, which is the  wrongful act of intentionally keeping oneself unaware of something--the  wrongful act of intentionally keeping oneself unaware of something. If  that doesn't describe what is being done right now to the Republican  Senators about these emails with this vote, I don't know what does, but  what I do know is that willful blindness under the law is a culpable  state of mind. It is a culpable state of mind in civil cases, where you  can be held liable because of deliberate willful blindness, and it is a  culpable state of mind in criminal cases, where you can be found guilty  of a criminal offense based on a finding of willful blindness.   So this is no small predicament that the majority leader is creating  for his Republican Members in the mad rush to get this fossil fuel tool  voted on before this stuff all comes out, and it is either going to be  good or it is going to be bad, and if it is bad, there will be a price  to pay for having ignored this emerging avalanche of emails. If they  are good, fine, no harm done, but who really gets hurt if it is bad?   We are going to be examining Pruitt over this, when they come out. If  these are bad things, there could be investigations that ensue and an  enormous amount of stuff can take place, but there will be ownership on  the other side of the aisle for the willful blindness they are  displaying toward this package of emails that we now know are on their  way and that we know were wrongfully withheld because the judge said  so. The judge said it was an ``abject failure'' under the law. The  judge said it was unreasonable. So we know it is wrong, and still,  still, comes the vote.   You have to wonder what the power force is here that makes that  happen. In astronomy, there are dark stars, black holes. Because they  are dark and because they are black, you can't see them in the sky. You  have to deduce their presence when light bends around them and when  their gravitational pull affects the behavior of other heavenly bodies.  When you look for those weird, anomalous behaviors in space, that is a  signal that some dark star is out there operating. This is a lot of  weird and anomalous behavior. And what is the dark star that is causing  the majority leader to put all the Republican Senators, other than  Susan Collins, in peril, in terms of willful blindness to this release  of emails, which everybody knows now is coming and which everybody  knows now was wrongfully delayed--wrongfully and deliberately delayed-- by this attorney general as the enforcer of the disclosure of his own  emails.  [[Page S1280]]         If there was a question in there.    There you go.    There you go.    There you go.    There you go.    Will the Senator yield for a question?    Will the Senator yield for a question?    With respect to delay for delay's sake, when a judge  finds that the emails can be made available and the judge finds today  that the emails can be made available by Tuesday and the attorney  general has kept them bottled up for more than 750 days, it would seem  that the accusation that delay for delay's sake does not belong with  the Democratic minority on this issue. Would it not be a badge that  would fit rather well on the attorney general from Oklahoma?    I thank the Senator from Oregon.   Mr. President, I note the diagram that I am showing beside me here on  the floor, which is the work of an academic professor. He is one of a  considerable number of professors and researchers who are looking at  the fossil fuel-funded climate-denial operation as a socioeconomic  creature. They are studying it. It is rather new. This is a diagram  done by Professor Robert Brulle of Drexel University, one of the many  academics and researchers who are looking into what I call the denial  beast, because obviously if you are ExxonMobil, if you are the Koch  brothers, you don't want to be out front yourself. You want to put  outfits with names that sound much more benign out there--the Heartland  Institute, the George C. Marshall Institute. These groups get thrown up  by the fossil fuel company, stuffed with their money, filled with their  employees, and they all run around saying more or less the same thing,  which is, don't worry about climate change; don't worry about our  carbon emissions.   When the Senator from Oregon refers to a complex matrix that this  individual serves, this is just one visual description of that complex  matrix of fossil fuel interests with which he has been so closely  involved.   Here is one other example. This is Mr. Pruitt's fundraising from all  of these energy companies and then the different ways he raised money.  Liberty 2.0 was his super PAC. We still don't know a single thing about  it. We haven't talked about the dark money life of Scott Pruitt  because--why?--our colleagues on the other side won't require those  questions to be answered. They are perfectly willing to scoot him  through without knowing a single thing about his dark money operation-- his attorney general reelection, which was chaired by a fossil fuel  billionaire; the Oklahoma Strong Leadership PAC, which was his  leadership PAC that took constant fossil fuel money; the Rule of Law  Defense Fund, which was the laundering operation for bringing money to  the Republican Attorneys General Association.   If you were one of these big companies and if you could drop money  into the Rule of Law Defense Fund, it would wash your identity clean of  the money, and then the money could go over to the Republican Attorneys  General Association as if it were a gift from the Rule of Law Defense  Fund, when all they did was launder the identity off of the fossil fuel  donor. Then you had, of course, the Republican Attorneys General  Association, which was so loaded up with fossil fuel interests that  they had special, secret, private meetings with these big donors at  their retreats. It was right on the secret agenda of the retreats,  which we have been able to get our hands on.   I add that to the equation because when the Senator from Oregon talks  about a complex matrix of fossil fuel interests, he is not kidding.  This is a very, very significant matrix of fossil fuel interests, and  that is what Scott Pruitt has been serving, not the public and not his  duties.  [[Page S1282]]         Will the Senator yield for a question?    Will the Senator yield for a question?    I draw the Senator's attention to this graphic my  office has prepared which reflects certainly my recollection. When I  came to the Senate, I want to say there were at least five Republican- sponsored climate change bills floating around. Senator John Warner, a  Republican of Virginia, had one; Senator Susan Collins, a Republican of  Maine, had one; Senator John McCain, a Republican of Arizona actually  ran for President on a strong climate change platform; Senator Lindsey  Graham, a Republican of South Carolina, was working with Senator Kerry  on one; Senator Lamar Alexander, a Republican of Tennessee, had one.   So there was a regular heartbeat of activity in this body on climate  change, a bipartisan heartbeat of activity. Then, pow, came Citizens  United 2010, and it has been flatlined since. It is the power of money  unleashed into our politics, and nobody plays harder and nobody plays  rougher and nobody plays meaner with the power of money than the fossil  fuel industry that Scott Pruitt serves.    Will the Senator yield for a question?    Will the Senator yield for a question?    One of the points I think could be made here with  respect to the emails is that the first tranche of emails--the ones the  judge instructed be released on Tuesday--are communications with Scott  Pruitt's donors, with Devon Energy right here, with Peabody coal--which  I don't see on the list--and with API, the American Petroleum  Institute, which is right here. That funding has gone into his  political operation.   It is worth understanding how that pays off. I don't know if we can  see this, but this says ``confidential.'' I don't know if that is clear  on the screen. This is the confidential agenda for a Republican  Attorneys General Association meeting, at a nice place--the Greenbrier  in West Virginia. It is pretty swish. Look here on the agenda: Private  meeting with Murray Energy. There is Murray Energy, right in the energy  donors. He is attorney general. Look at what they get--a private  meeting with the Republican attorneys general on the confidential  agenda. If you go to the next day, the morning meeting is an issue  briefing on the dangerous consequences of the Clean Power Plan and  other EPA rules, and guess who the lead panelist is--Attorney General  Scott Pruitt of Oklahoma.    What you have is this link between a big political donor, Murray  Energy, and a private meeting for Murray Energy on the confidential  agenda and a followup meeting at the same retreat on attacking the  Clean Power Plan. And guess who a lead plaintiff with Scott Pruitt is  in the lawsuit against the Clean Power Plan? Boom--Murray Energy.   There is a little machine here that turns between money in from the  fossil fuel industry and litigation out on behalf of the fossil fuel  industry. These emails aren't just matters of general interest. These  emails may provide some good connection, some good evidence into what  exactly that little feedback loop entails, because there are plenty of  circumstances, and, as somebody who spent years as an attorney general  and years as the U.S. Attorney, those little feedback loops is  sometimes called corruption.   Depending on what those emails say, that could easily be prosecutable  corruption. Rather than answer that question, of whether this link  between big donors and action on cases using the badge of the State of  Oklahoma as a shield to protect the fossil fuel interests, which were  the donors, and talking about it in confidential meetings, in private  meetings on confidential agendas--to me, that smells pretty high all by  itself, before you have actually dug into it and seen what the emails  say and gotten to the potentially really stinky part.   The fact that this is being jammed through is not without consequence  for the Republicans on the other side who are not being given the  chance by their leadership to say: Hold it. Whistle. Let's give this a  couple of weeks. Let's see if there is something beyond how bad it is  already--that perhaps might even make this chargeable stuff--before we  are forced to vote on this guy.   Once again, the fact that they are being forced to vote on this guy  in this circumstance is very, very unusual behavior. And unusual  behavior, to me, signals powerful forces.   I could not agree more with the Senator from Oregon about the  importance of these emails and their potential significance. I agree  with my friend from Hawaii that I hope there isn't anything really bad  here, but the likelihood that there is is very strong. The dogs are  hunting.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Thank you, Mr. President.   There is a lot we don't know about Scott Pruitt. We know that  thousands of emails between this man and the industry that he is  supposed to be regulating as EPA Administrator have been suppressed by  him for years. We know that just yesterday a court found that  suppression of his emails unreasonable, an abject failure of his duties  under the law to disclose. Those ought to be alarm bells for the side  of the aisle that is forcing, jamming this nomination through.   He told us he couldn't get these emails released for more than 2  years, and the court ordered him to release the first chunk Tuesday,  just days from now; the second big chunk, 10  [[Page S1333]]  days from now. So clearly there has been some mischief here, when on  the one hand this office pretends that it can't get the emails out for  more than 2 years, and a court looks at the situation and says: No. You  make them available Tuesday. That is not a sign of good things.   No. 2, this is a guy who, as part of his political money operation--a  political money operation that is heavily funded by big fossil fuel  industry players about whose carbon emissions he will be making vital  decisions as EPA Administrator. So far, his relationship with them has  been to take their money and to be their lawyer. That is not a good  start, either, for an EPA Administrator.   Here is the other thing we don't know: We don't know about his dark  money operation. The Rule of Law Defense Fund--the whole reason you set  up something like that is to hide the source of money that you use in  politics. That is why the entity exists. It is to take groups like this  and launder their identities right off of them so that, when money  shows up, for instance, at the Republican Attorneys General  Association, it is not attached to Devon Energy; it is not attached to  ExxonMobil; it is not attached to Murray Energy; it is not attached to  the Koch brothers or to their front groups--Freedom Partners and  Americans for Prosperity--it is not attached to the company whose  billionaire president was his finance chairman for his campaign,  Continental Resources; it is not attached to the Southern Company and  to other big energy companies. It just comes out of the Rule of Law  Defense Fund. The identity of the donor has been scrubbed away. It is  an identity laundering machine.    These are the relationships that are forged when you are asking  people for hundreds of thousands of dollars, and $1 million a year was  the budget for the Rule of Law Defense Fund. If you are asking for that  kind of money from these people, it is elementary that the Senate  should know about that, but our colleagues on the other side of the  aisle have completely stonewalled this--zero inquiry into the dark  money operation that this individual was allowed.   Why is that? That is pretty unusual. Why were we not allowed to get  these emails? Why were we told: Oh, you will have to line up behind  everybody else in this FOIA line that I have maintained for 2 years.  That was an adequate answer to the majority on the EPW Committee, but  the judge who took a look at that same situation said: No, you get them  Tuesday. If the chairman had said: No, you get them Tuesday, we  wouldn't be having this problem. We would have seen them weeks and  weeks and weeks ago.   All of the pressure from the majority on this nominee has been to  cover up this stuff. Don't let it in. Nothing to see here, folks. Move  along. Move along.   That is not right. That is not the way the Senate should behave. That  is not consistent with our advice and consent responsibilities, and,  frankly, it sets up Republican Senators. If and when it ultimately does  come out that there is significant mischief exposed in those emails or  if there are significant conflicts of interest created by that dark  money operation, the Senate does not look great for having used its  energy and effort in this nomination to cover that stuff up.   There is a doctrine called willful blindness, which is the wrongful  intention to keep oneself deliberately unaware of something. It is a  culpable state of mind in criminal and civil law. That is the state of  mind that is being maintained by the majority with respect to this  individual, and one has to wonder why. Why are there these big things  that we don't know about Scott Pruitt?   It is not that we didn't ask. It is that we got told by the majority:  Run along; it doesn't matter. You will have no support from us. We are  going to clear this guy anyway. It doesn't matter if his answers to you  make no sense. It doesn't matter if his answers aren't truthful. It  doesn't matter if his answers put you at the end of a long FOIA line  when this is the Senate's advice and consent process. None of that  matters.   Just by one point of evaluation, the difference is that, when the  Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works looked at this, they  said: Run along; nothing here. We are not interested. Don't show us a  single email.   And the judge looking at it said to get them out Tuesday--a local  State judge.   Since when is the double standard in which Senators are deprived of  seeing highly relevant evidence? What is being covered up and why? Who  is pulling the strings around here so that these obvious questions  don't get answered when you put it side by side with a State court  proceeding that asks the same question and the questions get answered  like that. Something is rotten in Denmark.   It hasn't fooled Rhode Islanders. My correspondence is running about  50 to 1 against Scott Pruitt. Over 1,000 Rhode Islanders have written  in against him. Let me just read a couple of their communications with  me.   This is from Amanda Tarzwell:         As a member of the Committee on Environment and Public       Works, I urge you to do all you can--    ``All you can,'' she says--       to block Mr. Pruitt's nomination as the head of the EPA. My       grandfather, Clarence Tarzwell, worked for the EPA and opened       the EPA lab in Narragansett.    Narragansett is a Rhode Island town.         It is located on Tarzwell Drive in his honor. He is now       deceased, but I believe in the work he did and the necessity       to protect our environment and continue to work on climate       change. Please do everything you can to urge your fellow       committee members on both sides of the aisle to do the same.       Thank you.    On the next, her name is right in the letter. So I will read it:         I am a 23-year-old woman with a bachelor of science degree       in wildlife and conservation biology from the University of       Rhode Island.        I am writing to respectfully demand you vote ``no'' on the       approval of Scott Pruitt for Administrator of the       Environmental Protection Agency. It is extremely clear that       Pruitt is the WRONG choice to head the EPA.        As someone with an extensive education in environmental       sciences, conservation, wildlife and plant biology,       chemistry, and physics, I am deeply concerned with Pruitt's       capabilities. A climate change skeptic, with no formal       science-based education, Pruitt has zero concept of what it       takes to make informed decisions about the current and future       stakes of our environment.        Rhode Island is leading the country in many environmental       fields, such as renewable energy, environmental protection,       and sustainable agriculture and aquaculture. We cannot allow       a climate change skeptic, with a love affair with fossil       fuels, to make important decisions regarding our precious       environment and those working hard to protect it.        I urge you to vote no on the approval of Scott Pruitt for       Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.    Catherine Hoyt wrote in:         I have a special concern for the upcoming vote on the EPA       Director, Scott Pruitt. I know you are on the Committee for       Environment and Public Works so you are more informed than       most people--    Although, as I just explained, we are deliberately underinformed in  some very telling ways--       and I trust that you are unlikely to vote contrary to the       interests of our beautiful and environmentally unique coastal       State.        Among other things I do, I am a sailing instructor in       Edgewood, in Cranston.    Cranston is another one of our municipalities.         I have been sailing in the Upper Bay for about 10 years.       Even in that amount of time, the bay is noticeably cleaner.       The water is clearer, and there are more birds and fish and       crabs and other creatures that signify, through my direct       experience, that the environment is healthier in the Upper       Bay.        My anecdotal evidence is also confirmed by scientific       reports from URI--    The University of Rhode Island--       over the summer that Narragansett Bay is cleaner now than it       has been in 150 years. Wonderful. I would be very sorry to       see that trend reverse. I am old enough to remember what it       was like before the EPA, and I do not want to go back to       smog-filled skies, polluted waters, and tragedies like Love       Canal and Woburn's poisoned well water.        I am sure that, if it were not for the EPA and groups like       Save the Bay--which is a local environmental organization--      that the Upper Bay would have become more toxic and polluted       due to industrial use, sewage, rainwater runoff, pesticides,       and road salt. What is more, I believe that the EPA       regulations have been good for business. Because pollution       is, ultimately, wasteful and counterproductive, and clean       businesses often are efficient and, therefore, more       successful businesses. Look at the careful reutilization of       materials by companies like Apple, who are investing in the       future and their profitability by going further than       required. They are nearly cash neutral at this point.    Some of that is through buying carbon credit, but, clearly, they are  not  [[Page S1334]]  afraid of being environmentally responsible.         As a concerned citizen of Rhode Island and America,       regarding President Trump's nomination for head of the       Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, I believe       deeply that this is not the person for the job, that there is       nothing in his background that suggests he has any interest       in protecting American citizens and their health and       environment from harm. I have never written any of my       congressional Representatives in my many, many years on this       planet until today.        I remember the air quality in Rhode Island in the late       sixties and through the seventies-plus. Those visible brown       clouds, especially in the summer, as pollution and smog       drifted from New York or Connecticut towards Rhode Island. I       remember the pollution in our beautiful Narragansett Bay. I       see the changes ocean rise has already effected.        Climate change is real, and it is scientifically accepted       across the world. I am deeply troubled by Mr. Pruitt's       statements and legal actions he has instigated against this       Agency. I am asking you to take a stand for the health of the       citizens of Rhode Island and the American people. Please vote       no when the votes are called for Mr. Scott Pruitt's       nomination.    Here is the last one I will read:         As a retired Federal scientist, meteorologist, I am deeply       concerned that the EPA continue to be an agency that makes       decisions about our environment that are based on the best       science available.        Scott Pruitt has a record of supporting policies that are       pro-business at the expense of the environment despite what       the science shows. How can he possibly be considered as the       voice that will fight for clean air and clean water? Despite       excellent progress over my lifetime, pollution continues to       be a major problem for the air we breathe and the water that       sustains us.        Please join the voices on the Hill that block the       appointment of Scott Pruitt as EPA Administrator. Thank you.    I wish we could block the appointment of Scott Pruitt as EPA  Administrator. It is really rare to see a nominee for a Federal agency  who is as unqualified--indeed, as disqualified by conflict of  interest--as this individual. As for the idea that he is being jammed  through just as thousands of emails are going to be released about  him--between him and his big funders and the groups that they funded  him through--something is wrong. This is not the way the Senate should  behave.   The people on that side--in taking all of this mystery, all of this  mischief, all of the emails, all of the dark money--who are being asked  to vote are being told: Don't even look at that.   I can promise you that if the shoe were on the other foot,  Republicans would be clamoring for emails.   This is a grim day for this Chamber--what we are doing here, knowing  of this man's record, knowing of his record of shutting down the  environmental agency in his home State while attacking the  environmental agency of the Federal Government while pretending that  his concern is federalism; right? He has pretended that he thinks that  the enforcement responsibility shouldn't be at the Federal level, that  it should be down at the State level. But if that were even remotely  sincere, he wouldn't have shut down his own office's environmental  enforcement unit as the attorney general of Oklahoma.   The common thread here is that he doesn't want any environmental  enforcement at the Federal level and he doesn't want any environmental  enforcement at the State level. He shut down the unit. He zeroed out  the budget. He gave us a bunch of soft soap about how actually he moved  the environmental unit into something called a federalism unit. But if  you look at his own website for the federalism unit, the word  ``environmentalism'' or ``environment'' doesn't appear. It is news that  that is his environmental enforcement section, because it doesn't say  so on his own website. That was an invention just for the hearing.    When you look at his own budget, the amount he budgets for  environmental enforcement disappears. It has gone to zero. When you  look at the Environmental Enforcement Task Force that his office's  environmental unit had participated in under the previous attorney  general, Drew Edmondson, that has disappeared too. He has gotten rid of  every element of environmental enforcement that he controlled at the  State level, while taking money from all of the big polluters, while  having the CEO of Continental Resources--a billionaire--as his  fundraising chair.   He took money from the fossil fuel industry through all of these  different entities--through his leadership PAC, Liberty 2.0; through  his campaign, Pruitt for Attorney General; through his super PAC,  Oklahoma Strong PAC--sorry, that is his leadership PAC, and Liberty 2.0  is his super PAC--through the Rule of Law Defense Fund, which is his  dark money operation. By the way, whatever the attorney general needs  is a dark money operation. Really? Through the Republican Attorneys  General Association, which he raised money for, and who knows what  else.   This guy is fully fossil fuel funded. And in his entire career, he  has dedicated himself to getting rid of and attacking environmental  enforcement wherever he finds it--at the State or Federal level. You  can't beat shutting down the environmental unit in your own office.   So that is what we are looking at. When you look at that combination  and throw in the secrecy about the dark money operation and this mad  rush to get this guy through before the week is out in which these  emails come out, it stinks.   What we are doing here is a deliberate act of sabotage of the orderly  and honest operation of an agency of our government. We are putting in  a person who can demonstrably be shown to be incapable of and  disqualified for those duties. I think that is actually not a bug in  this program; that is the feature. That is the feature because these  same forces that have been behind Scott Pruitt all his life, as he has  fought all environmental enforcement--State and Federal--are awfully  powerful in this Chamber as well, and they are obviously calling the  shots at the White House, where a nominee like this would come from.   We are in the process of deliberately sabotaging the orderly and  honest operation of an agency of the U.S. Government, not at the behest  of a foreign power but after a special interest--the biggest and, in my  view, the foulest special interest in the world today--the fossil fuel  industry.   The fossil fuel industry has become so big and so powerful and so  mercenary that it has decided its best investment is no longer in oil  fields or coal seams or fossil fuel processing plants, but in acquiring  a controlling interest in the Government of the United States. And it  turns out we come pretty cheap.   According to the International Monetary Fund, we give the fossil fuel  industry a subsidy every year in the United States alone of $700  billion. That is a more valuable prize than any drilling rights or any  mining lease. To protect it--to protect $700 billion a year--acquiring  a controlling interest in the U.S. Government is a bargain. One fossil  fuel front group spent $750 million in the last election. That is a 1- to-1,000 payback--a 1,000 times ROI--each year that they keep the $700  billion subsidy if they keep plowing $700 million a year into politics  to produce results like this nominee for EPA.   You get benefits once you have acquired that controlling interest.   Only one Republican has publicly taken a stand against Scott Pruitt,  the most compromised and corrupted nominee in memory, with huge holes  of secrecy still around his relationship with the industry he is  supposed to regulate--nobody else, just the one. No Senators from  States whose big cities are flooded by rising seas on sunny days, no  Senator from States whose historic native villages are washing into the  sea, no Senators from States who are losing ancient forests to pine  beetles and wildfires, nor from States whose farmers see unprecedented  extremes of flood and drought, and whose home State universities assign  responsibility for those new extremes to climate change caused by  carbon emissions from companies like these--none from the States whose  fisheries are imperiled by warming and acidifying seas--no one. There  is just that one Senator. How well this industry is succeeding.   This EPA nominee may be compromised and corrupted, but he is  compromised and corrupted by the fossil fuel industry. So there is no  talking about it on that side. Everybody just studies the ceiling tiles  when the subject comes up. Nobody will help us find out about the  thousands of stonewalled emails with his fossil fuel industry patrons.  Nobody will help us inquire into the nominee's fossil-fuel-funded dark  money operation. Nobody challenges  [[Page S1335]]  his nonsense answers in the confirmation process. He answered, he  answered; let's move along, let's move along.    The dark hand of the fossil fuel industry is all over this  nomination. This is the wolf being deliberately inserted into the lamb  fold. It is from the fossil fuel money that fueled his politics-- unknown fully because we refuse to shine the Senate's light into his  dark money operation--to the thousands of emails between him and his  fossil fuel industry patrons, only a fraction of which have been  brought to light throughout our confirmation process, and which were  only uncorked after his office was sued--not because of any effort on  the other side in the confirmation process--to the fossil fuel front  groups that have come out supporting this nominee and are spending  millions to push him through. Think about that. These groups are  funding ad campaigns to push this guy through. Obviously, they have  expectations about how well they are going to be treated by him.  Through all of that, the sting of this industry's influence is  profound.   Just reflect on that last point. A dark money operation is being  cranked up by polluters to ram the EPA nominee through.   Here is a headline:         Energy executives, secretive nonprofit raise money to back       Pruitt.        New group warns that EPA nominee's confirmation ``is not a       certainty'' and millions of dollars are needed for the fight.    There would have been a time when it would have been disqualifying  when polluters were raising millions of dollars needed for a fight to  ram through an EPA nominee. This is conflict of interest in plain day,  but it is a conflict of interest with the right folks around here, I  guess, and so we don't consider it conflict of interest any longer.   Whom do you suppose most of the dark money is? Well, we don't know,  because it is dark money. But who is it usually? Well, the fossil fuel  industry, the Koch brothers, and their front groups. And what do you  suppose they want to spend millions of dollars for? What could be  better for them, the biggest polluters on the planet, than a little  minion to run the EPA as Every Polluter's Ally.''   In any sane world, the fact that all this dark and dirty money is  being spent to ram through an EPA nominee would be disqualifying all by  itself--but not here, not now, not in a Congress that is so compliant  to the fossil fuel industry that this alarm bell doesn't even register.   Fossil fuel front groups sent a joint letter of support for their  little minion Pruitt. Here is the letter with all of these various  groups who I think are united in their dependence on fossil fuel money.   Here is the legendary Heartland Institute. They are that classy group  that compared climate scientists to the Unibomber. That has been their  contribution to the discussion about climate change.   Competitive Enterprise Institute, Americans For Tax Reform, groups  from the State Policy Network--why don't these folks turn up somewhere  else? They turn up in the research of academics who are actually  studying the climate denial operation--because it is an operation. You  can follow the money from the fossil fuel industry out into an array of  front groups--front groups by the dozen--whose whole purpose in life is  to make them look like they are not fossil fuel industry front groups.  So they have names like the Heartland Institute or the George C.  Marshall Institute, which, by the way, has nothing to do with George C.  Marshall or his family. They just took the name because everybody knows  what a respected individual George C. Marshall was. They just took the  name and went to work phonying up the climate change debate under the  name of George C. Marshall.   That is a pretty shameful act when you think what George C. Marshall  did for this country, but these are not people for whom shame has much  effect.   If you look at Dr. Brulle's analysis--he is one of the academics who  looks at this array of front groups that are fossil fuel funded--this  group of people, of entities that signed the letter for this guy--they  show up here too--small world.   Well, I wonder whom they thought that letter would convince? I don't  think they expected it would convince many Democrats. Many of us on the  Democratic side have gone to the floor of the Senate to call out these  fossil-fuel-funded, dark-money-driven front groups, as the fossil-fuel- funded, dark-money front groups that they are.   So I don't think Democrats are very plausible targets for that  letter. So why the letter? Well, my view is that this was done because  everyone in this building knows that the Koch brothers' political  operation is behind all of these groups--many wiggly tentacles of the  same fossil fuel polluter Hydra. Behind this letter is the same Koch  brothers political operation that warned Republicans of the political  peril--not my word, their word--that Republicans would be in if they  crossed this industry, of ``how severely disadvantaged''--another quote  from the industry books--``they would be if they dared to do anything  on climate change.''   That is what this letter is. It is a signal. It is the political  mailed fist of the Koch brothers in a front-group glove giving its  marching orders. In any sane and normal world, this letter by itself  from all these polluter front groups would be disqualifying, but it  appears this body will obediently turn the Environmental Protection  Agency of our government over to the minion of the polluters to join an  administration dead-set to destroy science with politics. It is like  everyone on the other side has been sworn to secrecy while this happens  in plain view.   This is a heartbreaking speech for me. I perhaps need to start with a  little personal background to explain.   Last year, we commemorated the 75th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor  attack. After Pearl Harbor was attacked, boys across America rushed to  sign up for the service of their country. My father and my uncle were  two of those boys. Both became pilots in the Pacific theater. My dad  was a Marine Corps dive bomber pilot; my uncle was a carrier-based Navy  fighter pilot. My uncle was killed over the Philippines. Actually, he  was under John McCain's grandfather's command--small world--but I doubt  that Admiral McCain knew who Ensign Whitehouse was.   My father came home from the war, and he served our country all his  life, first as a CIA officer and then as a decorated career diplomat. I  believe he won every award the State Department has to offer, and he  served in difficult, challenging, poor, and war-torn countries his  whole life. At the end, he came out of retirement to set up Special  Operations Command in the Pentagon for President Ronald Reagan.   I was raised in that life. We were often in dangerous and war-torn  places, and we were surrounded by American families who faced the  discomforts, the diseases, and the dangers of those far-away postings  because to them something mattered. Something mattered to take your  family to a place where, if your child was sick, there was no decent  hospital. Something mattered to take your family to a place that if  your child was bit by a dog, there was a good chance the dog was rabid.  Something mattered to take your family to places where the electricity  wasn't reliable, the water wasn't clean, the people weren't friendly,  and diseases abounded.   These folks didn't talk about it a lot. Today, a lot of people wear  their patriotism on their sleeve. It was not really a topic of  conversation, but it was a thread through their lives that showed that  in their choices something mattered. They didn't wear their patriotism  on their sleeves; they lived it.   The American Government that they served and that my uncle died  serving was, to them, an ideal. Did America sometimes fall short of  that ideal? Sure. But I will tell you what: Every other country in the  world knew the difference between America and everybody else. We stood  out for what we stood for. Across our agencies of government, for  decades, many Americans have worked quietly and honorably to advance  that American ideal.   At the heart of that ideal is a duty, and the duty is to put country  first, to put the American people first, even before your own  families's comfort and safety. That honor and that duty running through  the lives and service of millions of public servants are the core  heartstrings of American democracy.   Into that government, this Trump administration has nominated as  Administrator of the EPA, a tool of the  [[Page S1336]]  fossil fuel industry, a man who demonstrably will not take his  government responsibilities seriously because he never has. He has  never taken EPA's responsibility seriously. He has done nothing but sue  them. He has never taken his State's environmental responsibility  seriously. He has shut down the enforcement arm that his office had. He  will represent with the biggest conflict of interest in history a  polluting industry whose regulation is actually now the EPA's primary  public duty. This isn't some fringe question of conflict of interest  about some question that may emerge. This is the biggest stinking  conflict of interest I think we have ever seen in this body about the  issue that is at the center of the Environmental Protection Agency's  responsibilities. With the most important task before the EPA being to  control carbon emissions before we push this planet over the climate  cliff, the industry in question will now rule the regulator.   Well, this hits home. I have fishermen in Rhode Island who need  honest environmental policy to protect our seas. ``It is not my  grandfather's ocean,'' they have told me. ``Things are getting weird  out there,'' people who have fished since childhood have told me.   Moreover, Rhode Island is a downwind State from the midwestern smoke  stacks and a downstream State from out-of-state water pollution. Rhode  Island needs a strong EPA to enforce clean air and clean water laws  from harm starting outside our boundaries. My attorney general has not  shut down his environmental unit, and my department of environmental  management is doing our best to keep Rhode Island clean and livable.  But they can't do much about out-of-state polluters. That is where the  EPA comes in. For a man who so plainly disbelieves in and deprecates  the EPA's mission, it is an alarming picture for Rhode Island.    We are a coastal State, and a small one. We don't have a lot to give  back to rising seas. I have to say, I am sick of having to comfort  people whose homes have been washed away into the sea.   This is a picture I took not too long ago. Colleagues who have been  here for a while might remember this individual. He was the Governor at  the time, but he was my predecessor in my seat in the Senate, Lincoln  Chafee. His father served here with enormous distinction for many, many  years and was actually a Republican chairman of the Environmental and  Public Works Committee who cared about the environment. He was an  environmental Republican leader.   These are houses that have washed into the sea as the result of a  storm. Sea level rise has raised the level of the ocean so that storms  throw their water farther in, and they take little houses like these  that have been beachfront houses for many years and they just pull them  into the ocean.   I spoke to the lady who I think owned that house. She was, I would  say, in her seventies. She had childhood memories of that house. It had  been her grandparents', and she would come to visit as a little girl.  What she remembers as a little girl is that she would come out of that  house, and in front of the house was a little lawn big enough to put up  a net and play volleyball or badminton. Across from their lawn was a  little road, just a sand-and-gravel road, but it allowed cars to come  down and park near the beach. On the other side of the road was a  little parking area where the cars could pull in. Beyond the lawn and  the road and the parking area was the beach. Her memories of the beach  were of sunny days with the sun beating down on the sand, and she would  get across the lawn and across the road and across the parking lot, and  then she would just have to scamper as fast as she could on her little  feet across the hot sand. She described to me remembering what a long  run that felt like for her to rush down to the ocean where she could  put her feet into the cool Atlantic waters and swim. That beach, that  parking area, that road, that lawn, and now her house are all gone.  These are the things that are happening in my State that the  Republicans in this building could not care less about--could not care  less about.   The math is obvious: When you add heat into the atmosphere, the ocean  absorbs the heat. Indeed, the ocean has absorbed almost all of the heat  of climate change. God bless the oceans because if it weren't for them,  we wouldn't be worried about hitting 2 degrees' increase in  temperature. We would be worried about hitting 30 degrees' increase in  global temperature. Because of all the heat that has been piled up, it  has gone into the oceans 93.4 percent. That is like setting off more  than two Hiroshima nuclear bombs in the ocean every second. Every  second.   Think of the heat of a nuclear explosion of the level that destroyed  Hiroshima. Think of the--whatever it would be--terajoule of heat energy  that gets set off by a nuclear explosion. Our oceans are absorbing  heat. If we measure over the last 20 years how much heat they have  absorbed, they are absorbing heat at the rate of multiple Hiroshima  nuclear explosions happening in the ocean every second for 20 years.   We wonder why Senator Cantwell was talking about strange things going  on in the oceans. We wonder why my fishermen are saying it is getting  weird out there. But when all that heat goes into the oceans, there is  a law called the law of thermal expansion. That is not the kind of law  we debate around here. That is one of nature's laws. That is one of  God's laws. That is one of the laws of physics and chemistry that we so  ignore around here because we are paying attention to the laws of  politics and the ``golden rule'': Who has the gold, rules.   But these are laws that we don't get to repeal or amend. What they  are doing is swelling the seas with that heat. On top of that, in comes  the water from melting glaciers and there is your sea level rise, 10  inches of sea level rise that we have measured at Naval Station  Newport, to the point where we face scenes like this: a man in a kayak  going down in front of the Seamen's Church Institute in Newport, RI.  This is not water in the ordinary course. This is a place where  tourists walk. That is a storefront with water coming through the  doorway. This was the storm surge, the tide, that came in with Sandy-- which missed us, by the way.   We have a Coastal Resources Management Council that defends our  shores, and our University of Rhode Island and Coastal Resources  Management Council work together to see what is coming. They have  developed new computer tools to determine which houses are going to be  lost in what kind of storms, how often this scene is going to have to  repeat itself in Rhode Island. We are anticipating 9 feet of sea level  rise by the end of this century.   My colleagues may think that is funny, that this is all sort of an  amusing hoax we can talk about, but any State whose coasts are  threatened with 9 feet of sea level rise, any representative of that  State has a responsibility to come here and fight to try to defend that  State.   When the adversary is the big special interests that is causing that  and that has mounted the vast campaign of lies I talked about earlier  to try to cover it--it is $700 billion in subsidies every year--then  that is an adversary worth going after because that is a dirty and  wrongful adversary.   When their representative is going to run the EPA, that is a  disgusting state of affairs. If Rhode Island had to suffer this to save  our country for some great goal, if Rhode Islanders had to go off to  war again like my father and uncle and Rhode Islanders have since the  first battles in Portsmouth, RI, the Revolutionary War, we would saddle  up--sign us up--to take on whatever we need to defend this great  country, but don't ask us to take a hit like this to protect a big  special interest.   The arrogance and the greed of the fossil fuel industry and the dirty  things it is willing to do to advance its interests knows no bounds. It  lobbies Congress mercilessly against any action on climate change, and  it has for years.   It runs a massive political electioneering operation of dark money  and false attacks to prevent any action on climate change, and it has  for years. It operates that giant array of front groups, a multi- tentacled, science-denial apparatus to put out streams of calculated  misinformation. It does this all to protect what that International  Monetary Fund report identified as a $700 billion annual subsidy.   What would big corporations do to protect $700 billion? Well, we are  finding out. For years, the fossil fuel industry has been deliberately  sabotaging  [[Page S1337]]  the honest and orderly operation of the legislative branch of America's  government to protect its subsidy. With this appointment, it would be  able to corrupt and sabotage the EPA.   I use the word ``corrupt'' because this is indeed the very definition  of corruption in government. This is government corruption in plain  view. In the Supreme Court decision Austin v. Michigan State Chamber of  Commerce, here is how the U.S. Supreme Court described corruption. The  Court described it as ``the corrosive and distorting effects of immense  aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the  corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public's  support for the corporation's political ideas.''   Back we go to this network of false front operations, established by  immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of a  corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public  support for the corporation's ideas.   We got some interesting polling recently. The George Mason University  went out recently and conducted a poll of Trump voters. What did Trump  voters think? It turns out that more than 6 in 10 Trump voters support  taxing and/or regulating the pollution that causes global warming. In  general, Trump voters were asked: Which of these two approaches to  reducing the pollution that causes global warming do you prefer? Well,  16 percent said: I don't know; 21 percent said: Do nothing; but 13  percent of Trump voters said: Tax pollution; 18 percent said: Regulate  pollution; and 31 percent said: Tax pollution and regulate pollution.   That adds up to more than 6 out of 10 Trump voters thinking that the  pollution that causes climate change should be taxed or should be  regulated or should be taxed and regulated.   When you go back to the Austin v. Michigan State Chamber of Commerce  definition of corruption and look at the section that says that the  policies pushed by the massive aggregations of wealth accumulated with  the help of the corporate form want to go one way and the public wants  to go another way and the corporate powers' views have little or no  correlation to the public support for the corporation's political  ideas, well, heck, we know Democrats support doing stuff about climate  change.   It turns out Trump voters do too. The public is actually happy to get  something done. It is this mess that is stopping us. It is groups that  spend $700 million in a single election to influence Congress that is  the problem, not the American public.   Teddy Roosevelt described corruption this way. He described  corruption as a sinister alliance between crooked politics and crooked  business, which he said has done more than anything else for the  corruption of American life against the genuine rule of the people  themselves.    If you look at the influence of Big Business--particularly the fossil  fuel business--it has been something else around here. I was elected in  2006. I was sworn in, in the Senate, in 2007. When I was first here in  those early years, there was a Republican climate bill floating around  the Senate virtually all the time.   My recollection is that there were five Republican cosponsored  climate bills during my time there. Susan Collins did a climate bill  with Senator Cantwell; Senator John Warner of Virginia, Republican, did  a bill with Senator Lieberman; Senator Graham worked on a bill with  Senator Kerry; Senator Lamar Alexander had a bill of his own; and  Senator McCain supported climate legislation and ran for President of  the United States on a strong climate change platform. And then came  2010. Then came a decision called Citizens United, which the fossil  fuel industry asked for, expected, and immediately acted on when it  came out, and it said to the big special interests: Go for it, boys;  spend all you want in politics. We five Republican appointees to the  Supreme Court are going to make the comically false finding that  nothing you can do with unlimited money could possibly ever corrupt  American democracy or could possibly even be seen as corrupting by the  American public.   Of course, that is such hogwash that right now the Supreme Court is  viewed by people who have been polled on this question as not likely to  give a human being a fair shake against a corporation.   If I remember correctly, the numbers were 54 to 6. In a polling group  of 100, 6 Americans believe they could get a fair shot in the Supreme  Court against corporations and 54 believed they could not get, as human  beings, a fair shot in the U.S. Supreme Court against a big  corporation, but with the big corporations at the Supreme Court, the  fix was in--not a great place for the Court to be when by 9-to-1  American human beings think they can't get a fair shot in front of that  Court against a corporation.   They did deliver, and they delivered Citizens United and opened the  floodgates. The next thing out there was groups like Americans for  Prosperity, the front group for the Koch brothers, Donors Trust, which  launders away the identity of big corporations like ExxonMobil, and all  of these other front groups we looked at earlier, and they are spending  immense amounts of money. The result is, if there was a heartbeat of  activity on climate change with Republicans before Citizens United, it  has been a flat line since. That has been the story behind this.   Not only has dark money poisoned our conversation about climate  change, this guy actually ran his own dark money operation. His Rule of  Law Defense Fund, a 501(c)4 organization that does not disclose its  donors have been linked to the Koch brothers, who run one of the  biggest polluting operations in the country, but we don't really know.  We don't really know. It has been kept absolutely quiet.   There is a black hole of secrecy around this nominee's dark money  operation; whom he raised it from, what the quid pro quo was, what he  did with it. Not allowed to know. Move along. Move along. It doesn't  matter.   This is a test. This is a test of the Senate. Will this nominee ever  tell us exactly what his relationship with the fossil fuel industry is?  Will we get these emails in time to make an informed decision before  his nomination is rammed through one step ahead of the emails that the  judge said had to be released?   I can't get over the fact that this guy covered up the emails for  750-plus days for more than 2 years and a judge said: No, get them out  Tuesday. And they are going to get them out Tuesday. The second chunk,  you have 10 days to get them out. He sat there in our committee and  acted as if this was some huge terrible task that he couldn't possibly  get done; that with 2 years to do it, he couldn't get a single email  out. By the time of our hearing, zero of those thousands of emails had  come out. A judge took a look the same situation and said: Do it  Tuesday. And they are doing it.   We have been so deliberately stonewalled, and it has been so  painfully and plainly made clear by what the judge has ordered. We are  not passing this test of how a Senate should act.   President-Elect Trump promised to restore genuine rule of the people  themselves. Remember, Teddy Roosevelt's quote that the sinister  alliance between crooked politics and crooked business has done more  than anything else for the corruption of American life against the  genuine rule of the people themselves. President Trump promised to  restore genuine rule to people and themselves, and yet it is looking  more and more like shadowy and industry-funded groups will really run  our government.   This is a test also for the rest of corporate America. A lot of  corporate America has good climate policy. Most of corporate America  has good climate policy, but when are they going to stand up about an  EPA Administrator who is the minion of the fossil fuel industry? What  will Coca-Cola say to the Georgia Senators? What will Walmart ask of  its Arkansas Senators? What will VF Corporation urge its North Carolina  Senators to do? How will Rio Tinto advise its Senators from Arizona?  All these companies have taken important stands on global warming. Why  not now?    Let's talk about the due diligence that a nomination like this should  get, particularly the due diligence about climate change that the  present urgency demands. I wondered what due diligence my colleagues  have done to  [[Page S1338]]  assess the reality of climate change before making this fateful and  foul vote. The fossil fuel fox is on its way to the henhouse now, and I  challenge the colleagues who will have put him there: Have you gone to  your home State university for a briefing on climate science to  understand what your own universities are teaching?   This nominee, Mr. Pruitt, never had. When we met in my office, he  didn't even know who Berrien Moore was. Berrien Moore is the dean of  the College of Atmospheric and Geographic Sciences at the University of  Oklahoma. He is a nationally renowned climate scientist. Before this  nominee and I met in my office, for all this nominee's years of  litigation against doing anything about climate change, he had never  bothered to go to his own University of Oklahoma and find out from  there, his home State expert, what climate change was, how it worked,  and what it meant. Why not? The most logical answer is because he  didn't care to know. He had already chosen sides and had been richly  rewarded for doing so, although we don't know exactly how richly, since  his dark money operation is still a secret, protected by the Senate  Republicans who are shoving this nomination through.   Here is what Mr. Pruitt would have found out if he had bothered to go  to the University of Oklahoma to ask the dean about climate change. The  dean of the University of Oklahoma's College of Atmospheric and  Geographic Sciences has said: ``On the increasing strength of earth  sciences, we can now state that global warming is `unequivocal.' ''   The fact that the planet's warming and the fact that CO2  is a greenhouse gas and the fact that it is increasing in the  atmosphere and that increases in the atmosphere due to humans--about  those things? There is no debate.   He has said:         We know precisely how fast CO2 is going up in       the atmosphere. We have made a daily measurement of it since       1957. We have ice-core data before that.    He continued:         We know without any question, that it has increased almost       40 percent since the industrial revolution, and that increase       is due to human activity primarily fossil-fuel burning.    Those are the words of the dean at the University of Oklahoma, who is  the expert in this subject. And Mr. Pruitt had never bothered to  actually ever ask him. The fossil fuel industry had told him all he  needed to know, and that is going to be a continuing problem with him  as EPA Administrator.   I thought to myself, have any of the Senators on the Environment and  Public Works Committee, who voted for this nominee out of committee,  done any better? Which Senator on that committee has been troubled to  go for, say, half a day, to their own home State university and get a  briefing on climate science? As I have said, this matters to Rhode  Island because we are a downwind State. We have had bad air days where  little kids and seniors and people with breathing difficulties are  supposed to stay indoors in the air conditioning, not go outside. We  are seeing warming rising, acidifying seas along our shores, hurting  our fishermen, causing those families to lose those coastal homes I  showed.   And the hits are just going to keep on coming. A child born today at  Women & Infants Hospital in Providence, RI, can expect to see upward of  9 feet of sea level rise raging on Rhode Island shores in her lifetime,  according to the University of Rhode Island and our State agencies.   Well, it seems to me the least a downwind State like Rhode Island  might expect is some modicum of due diligence by colleagues who are  blocking action on this subject. At the University of Rhode Island, the  due diligence is very clear. URI is working with Rhode Island fishermen  to help predict the harm from warming and acidifying seas and figure  out what that means for our fisheries and our agriculture.   The Senator is from a State that has very distinguished fishing and  agriculture himself, and I am sure his home State universities are  doing similar research.   URI and our State agencies are drilling down to generate fine local  data on sea level rise and storm surge, and we are starting to be able  to predict, with specificity, which homes are likely to be lost in  storms, which roads will become inaccessible in coming decades, what  plan B is necessary to get emergency services to communities when  flooding bars the way, and what water and sewer and other public  infrastructure is at risk. These are all now the daily questions of  Rhode Island coastal life, thanks to climate change, and our University  of Rhode Island is at the forefront of studying that.   Of course, URI is not alone. You can go to every State university and  find climate change concerns. They just understand this stuff. They are  not actually just learning climate science, they are teaching about  climate change. It is astonishing that Senators from those States will  not listen to what their own universities teach.   Let's call the Republican roll of the Environment and Public Works  Committee, all of whom voted to suspend the committee rules to jam this  fossil fuel industry minion through to the Senate floor as  Administrator of the EPA, notwithstanding the black hole of secrecy  around his dark money dealings with the polluting fossil fuel industry,  and notwithstanding his years of stonewalling dozens of Open Records  Act requests, including the one that has just been ordered to be  disclosed by the judge today--thousands of emails.   Let's see what our Environment and Public Works Committee colleagues,  who cleared the way in committee for this nominee, would find at their  home State universities, if they looked.   Chairman Barrasso could go to the University of Wyoming, where he  would find the University of Wyoming Center for Environmental Hydrology  and Geophysics reporting: ``Many of the most pressing issues facing the  western United States hinge on the fate and transport of water and its  response to diverse disturbances, including climate change.''   He would find University of Wyoming scientists publishing articles on  ``The effects of projected climate change on forest fires'  sustainability'' and the University of Wyoming awarding university  grants to study the effects of climate change on pollinators, on water  flow, on beaver habitat, and on whitebark pine growth, all work being  done sincerely at the University of Wyoming on climate change.   Next down the line, we come to Senator Inhofe of Oklahoma. The senior  Senator from Oklahoma could also go, of course, and consult Dean Moore  of the College of Atmospheric and Geographic Sciences at the University  of Oklahoma. But if he really wanted to dig in, he could also go over  to Oklahoma State and get an update from Oklahoma State Professor Riley  Dunlap, who has written in a peer review and scientific journal:  ``Climate science has now firmly established that global warming is  occurring, that human activities contribute to this warming, and that  current and future warming portend negative impacts on both ecological  and social systems.''   ``Portend negative impacts on both ecological and social systems''-- that is science-ese for it is going to hurt people, as we Rhode  Islanders already see all too plainly.   Oklahoma State's Professor Dunlap goes on to write something more.  However, he goes on to say:         There has been an organized ``disinformation'' campaign . .       . to generate skepticism and denial . . . to ``manufacture       uncertainty,'' . . . especially by attacking climate science       and scientists.    Wow. Huh?   And he goes on:         This campaign has been waged by a loose coalition of       industrial (especially fossil fuels) interests and       conservative foundations and think tanks--    Look at that. He seems to be agreeing with Dr. Brulle at Drexel  University--       that utilize a range of front groups and Astroturf operations       [to manufacture that uncertainty].    That is the research that Senator Inhofe would find at Oklahoma  State. That organized disinformation campaign that Professor Dunlap  reports on and the massive political muscle operation that supports it  explains a lot of what goes on around here. And if you cross-reference  the entities that Professor Dunlap puts into that organized  disinformation campaign, you will find them on the record supporting  this nominee. He is the nominee of the organized disinformation  campaign. And that is because, behind this whole mess  [[Page S1339]]  of a nomination, is the fossil fuel industry.   Let's go back to the Environment and Public Works Committee and  continue down the row on the majority side. We come next to Senator  Capito. Senator Capito from West Virginia could go to West Virginia  University, where the Mountaineers could show her their mountain  hydrology laboratory, which tells us, ``Climate change has important  implications for management of fresh water resources.'' These include,  ``that the highlands region in the central Appalachian Mtns. is  expected to wet up.'' As warmer air, which carries more moisture, leads  to what West Virginia University is calling ``intensification of the  water cycle,'' the laboratory warns that, ``the implications of this  intensification are immense.''   West Virginia University's Wildlife Conservation Lab publishes  regularly on climate change effects, and one of West Virginia  University's climate scientists, Professor Hessl, has been recognized  by West Virginia University as West Virginia University's Benedum  Distinguished Scholar. West Virginia University even sends people all  the way to China to study climate change. Some hoax.   Onward. My friend, Senator Boozman, is next in the line. His home  State University of Arkansas has actually signed onto both the first  and second university president's climate commitments. And the  University of Arkansas has undertaken what it calls an aggressive and  innovative Climate Action Plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and  help prevent climate change. The University of Arkansas explains the  need to reduce greenhouse gases, particularly including carbon dioxide  and methane. It is because these gases' ``absorption of solar radiation  is responsible for the greenhouse effect.''   Explaining further, the University of Arkansas describes that the  greenhouse effect ``occurs as these gases are trapped and held in the  Earth's atmosphere, gradually increasing the temperature of the Earth's  surface and air in the lower atmosphere.''   A University of Arkansas scientist predicts ``that the spread of  plant species in nearly half the world's land areas could be affected  by global warming by the end of the century.''   On down the EPW row is my friend Roger Wicker from Mississippi. Down  in Mississippi, the University of Mississippi, Ole Miss, actually has  an Office of Sustainability. The Ole Miss Office of Sustainability is  there ``to further the university's efforts to combat global climate  change.''   Believe it or not, Ole Miss is another signatory to that University  Presidents' Climate Commitment just like Arkansas. It is moving toward  net zero greenhouse gas emissions. By the way, so is the University of  Southern Mississippi. The director of the University of Mississippi's  Center for Hydroscience and Engineering explains why this matters.         Human influence and greenhouse gasses are the dominant       causes of the increase in global average temperature of the       earth. The impacts are observed in rising sea levels,       precipitation patterns, hydrologic regimes, floods and       droughts, and environmental processes.    He continues.         We must reduce our carbon footprint and take the necessary       steps to reduce our vulnerability to future climate change       impacts.    From the University of Mississippi. Also, at Ole Miss, anthropology  professor Marcos Mendoza warns that ``climate change is the greatest  environmental threat facing global society in the 21st century.'' Let  me say that again--from Ole Miss. ``Climate change is the greatest  environmental threat facing global society in the 21st century.'' But  the fossil fuel machine is going to see to it that we put a climate  denier into the EPA Administrator's seat.   So let's stay in Mississippi and go over to Mississippi State  University, where several professors contributed to the American  Society of Agronomy's report, ``Climate Change and Agriculture:  Analysis of Potential International Impacts.'' The forward to that  volume states that ``the threat of global climate change due to  anthropogenic modification of the atmosphere--the so-called greenhouse  effect--could potentially be one of the major environmental problems of  our time.''   Down on the gulf, all three Mississippi universities are working  together with Sea Grant, on what they call a climate team to assess  ``the risk of environmental, economic, and societal impacts from rising  sea levels and storm surges.'' My friend who is presiding knows well  the effects in the gulf. When you are looking at the risk of  environmental, economic, and societal impacts from rising sea levels  and storm surges, you have something in common with Rhode Island as  well.   Let's go on to Nebraska from where Senator Fischer hails. The  University of Nebraska has published extensive reports on what they  call ``Climate Change Implications for Nebraska.'' One University of  Nebraska report leads with this blunt sentence: ``Climate change poses  significant risks to Nebraska's economy, environment, and citizens.''  Well, Nebraskans, it turns out, agree. The University of Nebraska has  published research that ``most rural Nebraskans believe the state  should develop a plan for adopting to climate change, as do 58 percent  of Nebraskans 65 and older.''   So even the elder Nebraskans by 58 percent believe it, and nearly 70  percent of young Nebraskans, from 19 to 29 years old. On the science,  the University of Nebraska reports the following:         Is there debate within the scientific community with regard       to observed changes in climate and human activities as the       principal causal factor? The short answer here is no, at       least certainly not among climate scientists; that is,       scientists who have actual expertise in the study of climate       and climate change.    Let me repeat that again from the University of Nebraska.         Is there debate within the scientific community with regard       to observed changes in climate and human activities as the       principal causal factor? The short answer here is no, at       least certainly not among climate scientists; that is,       scientists who have actual expertise in the study of climate       and climate change.    The University of Nebraska goes on.         For more than a decade, there has been broad and       overwhelming consensus within the climate science community       that human-induced effects on climate change are both very       real and very large.    As to scope of those effects, the University of Nebraska warns:         The magnitude and rapidity of the projected changes in       climate are unprecedented. The implications of these changes       for the health of our planet and the legacy we will leave to       our children, our grandchildren, and future generations are       of vital concern.    The University of Nebraska has even published what it calls ``Key  Climate Change Data for Nebraska.'' This is the list:   Temperatures have risen about 1 degree Fahrenheit since 1895; frost- free season has increased 5 to 25 days since 1895; very heavy  precipitation events have increased 16 percent in the Great Plains  Region; projected temperature increase of 4 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit,  low-emissions scenario, or 8 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit, high-emissions  scenario, by 2100; projected summer of 2100 will have 13 to 25 days  over 100 degrees Fahrenheit; number of nights over 70 degrees  Fahrenheit will increase by 20 to 40 by 2100; soil moisture is  projected to decrease 5 to 10 percent by 2100; reduced snowpack in  Rocky Mountains equals reduced streamflow in our rivers; increasing  heavy precipitation events; increasing flood magnitude; increasing  drought frequency and severity.   That is the University of Nebraska's list of coming attractions to  Nebraska from climate change.   On to Kansas, where Senator Moran would learn from Kansas State  University about climate change's effects on agriculture in his home  State. Kansas State University Professor Charles Rice, Distinguished  Professor of Agronomy, working with the National Science Foundation is  using ``climate modeling tactics to predict the effects of climate  change in the Great Plains, and to develop adaptation and mitigation  strategies for agriculture in the region,'' to help meet what Kansas  State calls ``one of the grand challenges of the 21st century:  evaluating and predicting the biological and ecological consequences of  accelerating global climate change.''   Kansas State brought the executive director of agricultural giant  Cargill to talk about climate change. News reports describe what the  Cargill executive stated; that ``climate change is real and must be  addressed head-on to prevent future food shortages.'' Specifically, the  Cargill executive said that ``U.S. production of corn, soybeans, wheat,  and cotton could decline  [[Page S1340]]  by 14 percent by mid-century and by as much as 42 percent by late  century.'' This is a senior corporate executive in one of our leading  agricultural companies, warning of a 14-percent decrease in these  essential crops by midcentury, and as much as a 42-percent decrease by  late century.   From an agricultural standpoint, the executive said, ``We have to  prepare ourselves for a different climate than we have today.'' Maybe  that is why Kansas State calls evaluating and predicting the biological  and ecological consequences of accelerating global climate change one  of the grand challenges of the 21st century.   Let's head out to South Dakota, where Senator Mike Rounds would hear  from South Dakota State University about climate change on the Dakota  Plains. South Dakota State's Leffler Lab calls climate change ``the  signature challenge of the 21st century.'' So let's bear in mind, we  have the Kansas State University calling climate change ``one of the  grand challenges of the 21st century.'' We have South Dakota State's  Leffler Lab calling climate change the ``signature challenge of the  21st century.'' We have an EPA nominee who is a climate change denier,  wrapped so tight with the fossil fuel industry, you can't tell where  one ends and the other begins, and he has the support of the Senators  from Kansas and South Dakota.   It is a riddle. South Dakota State scientists are not just saying  that climate change is the signature challenge of the 21st century,  they are out studying climate change around the globe. From the Upper  Ghanaian forests of West Africa to the West Antarctica ice sheet. South  Dakota State University Professor Mark Cochrane is working with the  U.S. Forest Service to determine ``how a changing climate impacts  forest ecosystems'' and reported that ``forest fire seasons worldwide  increased by 18.7 percent due to more rain-free days and hotter  temperatures.''   The South Dakota State University News Center has reported that  season-shifting climate changes ``are all being affected by warming  from an increase in greenhouse gases due to human activity''--``all  being affected by warming from an increase in greenhouse gases due to  human activity.''   South Dakota State University even brought in Harvard Professor and  ``Merchants of Doubt'' author Naomi Oreskes, saying that her work ``has  laid to rest the idea that there is significant disagreement in the  scientific community about global warming.'' Somebody needs to  translate between South Dakota State University and this EPA nominee.   So on we go to Iowa, continuing down the Environment and Public Works  Republican roster, where Senator Joni Ernst could hear from an Iowa  State University professor who told a United Nations conference not  long ago that ``climate change was already affecting Iowa farmers. This  is not just about the distant future,'' he said. Iowa State has  published extensive reach and I will just quote the title of it.  ``Global Warming: Impact of climate change on global agriculture.''  Iowa State's prestigious Leopold Center views climate change not merely  as warming, but as a ``worsening destabilization of the planet's  environmental systems.''   Climate change is not just warming, it is a ``worsening  destabilization of the planet's environmental systems'' and yet the  good Senator voted to move this climate-denying industry tool forward  to be our EPA Administrator.   A worsening destabilization of the planet's environmental systems,  they call it, that will create ``an aggravated and unpredictable risk  that will challenge the security of our agricultural and biological  systems''--``aggravated and unpredictable risk that will challenge the  security of our agricultural and biological systems.''   That is Iowa State talking. They conclude: ``The scientific evidence  is clear that the magnitude of the changes ahead are greater, the rate  much faster, and [the] duration of climatic destabilization will last  much longer than once thought.''   Now we come to the end of the row of the Republicans on the  Environment and Public Works Committee.   As an Alaskan, Senator Dan Sullivan would get double barrels from the  University of Alaska, first about climate change and second about ocean  acidification.   ``Alaska is already facing the impacts of climate change,'' the  University of Alaska reports.   This question of ``facing the impacts of climate change'' matters  enough to the University of Alaska that, on global warming, the  university has stood up the Alaska Climate Science Center. The Alaska  Climate Science Center has been established to help understand ``the  response of Alaska's ecosystems to a changing climate.''   The Alaska Climate Science Center of the University of Alaska is  charting the recordbreaking, year-over-year warming in Alaska,  analyzing temperature trends, and receiving awards for ``modeling and  evaluating climate change impacts in the Arctic.''   ``One thing for sure,'' the center says, is that the climate ``will  continue to change as a result of various natural and anthropogenic  forcing mechanisms.''   Then there is the other climate change punch coming at Alaska, from  the sea. In addition to its Alaska Climate Science Center, the  University of Alaska is serious enough about this to have also stood up  an Ocean Acidification Research Center to address what it calls  ``growing concerns over increased acidity in the ocean and the impacts  this phenomenon will have on Alaska's marine ecosystems''--``growing  concerns over increased acidity in the ocean and the impacts this  phenomenon will have on Alaska's marine ecosystems.''   Alaska's seafood industry is an enormous asset to Alaska's economy,  and it depends on Alaska's marine ecosystems. Well, the University of  Alaska's Ocean Acidification Research Center warns that ocean  acidification ``has the potential to disrupt this industry from top to  bottom''--``to disrupt this industry from top to bottom.''   The Ocean Acidification Research Center identifies the culprit of  this phenomenon as ``the transport of CO2 from the  atmosphere into the ocean.''   Indeed, as we have loaded up the atmosphere with more and more  CO2 emissions from the burning of fossil fuels, the ocean  has actually absorbed chemically about a third of that CO2.   In addition to all that heat I mentioned earlier that the ocean had  absorbed--more than 90 percent of the added heat--it actually absorbed  one-third of the carbon dioxide. Of course, when carbon dioxide  interacts with seawater, there is a change that takes place.   Indeed, why don't we see about doing a demonstration of that change.  It will take a minute to get that organized. While we are getting that  organized, let me continue.   Here is a description--thank you to the University of Maryland for  the graphic--of how atmospheric carbon dioxide turns the ocean acidic.   When you add additional CO2 to the atmosphere, at the  surface, where it meets the sea, there is a chemical exchange, and the  CO2 can be absorbed by the ocean. As I said, one-third of it  has been. That dissolved carbon dioxide joins with the water  chemically, and it creates carbonic acid. The carbonic acid, in turn,  creates bicarbonate ions, hydrogen ions, and carbonate ions, and those  ions interfere with the makeup of marine creatures, which make their  shells out of free carbon in the oceans, and some of those effects are  pretty apparent.   This is the shell of an ocean creature called a pteropod. It is at  the base of a great deal of the ocean food chain. There are studies off  the northwest coast that show that more than 50 percent of this  creature have experienced what the scientists who them caught them and  studied them called severe shell damage. Here is what happens when you  expose them to high concentrations of acidified seawater, higher than  usual. That is what it looks like day 1. That is a healthy shell.  Fifteen days later, it is starting to gray. Thirty days later, beyond  just starting to gray, it is starting to actually come apart. And by 45  days, the shell is a wreck. That is not an animal that is capable of  surviving.   So let's see how this works. This is a glass of water, and I have  just put 20 drops of a pH test into it. That shows what the acidity is  of the water. As you can see, it has turned the water rather blue,  which matches roughly this level of pH.  [[Page S1341]]    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to  continue with this little demonstration.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kennedy). Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Mr. President, this is a very simple bubbler that  anybody with an aquarium will recognize. All you simply do is you put  the bubbler in. I produce carbon dioxide as I exhale. So I am exhaling  one breath into this same glass. I will do one more. It was not even a  full breath, but there it is.    It used to match that color; do you remember? Now look at what color  it matches. Just breathing carbon dioxide through the water has changed  its pH and has made it more acidic.   I can do that right here with a breath. It is happening on a global  scale, as the interaction between the atmosphere and the oceans  transports CO2 into the oceans. When that happens, the same  chemical effect that we modeled here takes place, and the oceans become  more acidic, and the effects continue to be damaging.   The previous shell that I showed was the pteropod, a humble creature,  but an important creature in the food chain. It is actually called the  ocean butterfly by some because its snail foot has been transformed by  God's law of evolution into an oceanic wing that allows it to fly in  the seas.   This is an oyster. The Senator's State of Louisiana does a lot of  work with oysters, as does Rhode Island. Again, exposing oyster larvae  to ocean water with heightened levels of acidity--day 1, day 2, day 4,  and then we see exposure to acidity. Here is what a healthy larva looks  like; here is what one exposed looks like. Here is what the healthy one  looks like; here is what the exposed one looks like. Here is a healthy  one; here is one exposed.   You will see that the healthy larva is growing day after day. It is  getting bigger. It is going to become an oyster. Somebody is going to  have a great oyster stew some day with that oyster with any luck.   This one is shrinking and deforming, and the reason is that the  little creature is trying to take the carbon out of the ocean to make  its shell--the calcium. And because of those ions that I pointed out,  it is bound up, and they can't get it. So they deform this way.   When you are at a point where more than 50 percent of ocean pteropods  are experiencing severe shell damage, if you are not paying attention,  you are going to take a big punch.   Now I know around here we don't give a darn about God's creatures as  being God's creatures. I probably sound funny to some people talking  about a funny little creature in the ocean called a pteropod. The  things we care about here are things that we can monetize because this  is Mammon Hall. This is the temple where gold rules.   These little creatures are a little bit away from the gold. But who  cares about the pteropod? I will tell you who cares about the pteropod.  Salmon care about the pteropod, and people care about the salmon, and  Alaska has a pretty good salmon fishery. The Pacific Northwest has a  pretty good salmon fishery. If you drop out the pteropod from the  bottom of the oceanic food chain because it can't grow because the  ocean has acidified, there is a big collapse to take place.   As scientists would say, the upper trophic levels fall as the lower  trophic levels collapse. So this is serious.   As I went through all these different Republican Environment and  Public Works Committee Senators' home State universities, maybe you  could say that all those home State universities are part of the  climate change hoax that our President is so pleased to tweet about.   If so, my colleagues really ought to call their home State  universities out about that. If they think their home State  universities are in on a hoax, I think it wouldn't be right, and they  ought to call out their home State universities. If the home State  universities are part of a big old hoax, say so. Say so. But if all of  my Republican colleagues' home State universities right down the line  on the Environment and Public Works committee aren't in on a hoax, if  what they are doing is good science, why not listen to them? Why not  listen to them? What is the dark star in this firmament that causes the  real science from the home State universities of these Senators to warp  and twist around as it comes to this body? What is the power? What is  the force that is causing every single one of these home State  universities to be ignored by their home State Senators?    Let me go back and review very briefly what they said. Home State  universities of the Republican Senators on the Environment and Public  Works Committee warn of ``pressing issues'' related to climate change.  That is Wyoming--pressing issues.   Assert that the science of climate change is ``unequivocal,''  ``without any question.'' That is from Oklahoma.   Foresee ``immense'' implications related to climate change. That is  West Virginia.   Making anti-greenhouse gas ``climate commitments'' to fight climate  change. That is the University of Arkansas.   Warn that ``climate change is the greatest environmental threat  facing global society.'' That is Mississippi.   Find the ``significant risks'' from climate change to be ``of vital  concern.'' That is Nebraska. That is the one that had the hit list of  coming attractions from Nebraska of climate change   Describe climate change as ``one of the grand challenges of the 21st  century.'' That is Kansas.   Call climate change ``the signature challenge of the 21st century.''  South Dakota.   Predict ``aggravated and unpredictable risk'' from climate  disruption. That is Iowa.   Prepare for fisheries risk that could shake the State's seafood  industry ``from top to bottom.'' That is Alaska.   Right down the row of Republican Senators who voted for this climate  denying nominee, you have home State universities that say the  opposite, that say that it is real, that it is beyond scientific debate  at this point, that its effects are here, that its effects are  worsening, and that it is going to shake industries like the fishing  industry from top to bottom and create significant risk and  disturbances in agriculture. But not one of those Senators stood up  against the nominee who is the shameless tool of the industry that is  causing all that harm.   So I have to ask, how does that end? If you listen to what all your  home State universities are saying, this is a pressing and immense  grand challenge. This greatest environmental threat--it doesn't go  away. This is truth measured by science, God's and nature's truth, and  truth always demands a reckoning.   If we listen only to the fossil fuel industry as it lies and  prevaricates and propagandizes and disassembles and does all its  nonsense to protect its all-important right to pollute for free, how do  we expect this turns out in the end? Do you think these acidifying  shells give a red hot damn what a fossil fuel industry lobbyist says?  They are responding to laws of chemistry and nature that we don't get  to repeal or amend.   Let me make one last point in closing, as I saw Senator Carper here,  our distinguished ranking member, and I am sure he wants to speak.   Our Republican friends claim to support market economics. They are  big on how you have to trust the market. You shouldn't regulate.  Markets are the way to go. Market economics is the most efficient tool  for allocating resources. Market economics are how we create wealth.  Actually, I agree. So let's look at market economics.   What I believe and what economists say on all sides of the political  spectrum is that it is market economics 101 that for the market to  work, the harm of a product has to be built into the price of a  product.   The fossil fuel industry, the dark star of our politics, absorbing  and bending all of this home State information, absorbs and bends even  conservative market principles so that they disappear here in Congress,  at least wherever those principles conflict with what appears to be our  first principle: the well-being and the power of the fossil fuel  industry.   The fact that Senators do not hear or do not care about this science  from their home State universities tells you all you need to know about  the brute political force of the fossil fuel industry here in Congress.   (Mrs. ERNST assumed the Chair.)   Let me go back just a moment to something I said earlier, since we  have been joined by the Senator from Iowa  [[Page S1342]]  at this fine early hour in the morning. Just before she arrived, I was  talking about Iowa State. Since she is here, I will go back to those  remarks and to the Iowa State University professor who told a United  Nations conference not long ago that climate change is already  affecting Iowa farmers. ``This isn't just about the distant future,''  the Iowa State scientist said.   I noted that Iowa State has published extensive research on, and I  quote Iowa State University here, ``global warming, the impact of  climate change on global agriculture.''   Iowa State has a center called the Leopold Center, which perhaps the  Presiding Officer can confirm is a fairly prestigious institution  within the University of Iowa. Iowa State's Leopold Center ``views  climate change not merely as warming, but as a worsening  destabilization of the planet's environmental system.''   I hope the distinguished Senator from Iowa will review Iowa State's  view that this worsening destabilization of the planet's environmental  system will create, and I quote Iowa State University again,  ``aggravated and unpredictable risks that will challenge the security  of our agricultural and biological systems'' and consider their  conclusion: ``The scientific evidence is clear that the magnitude of  the changes ahead are greater, the rate much faster, and the duration  of the climatic destabilization will last much longer than once  thought.''   Let me close, while we wait for Senator Carper, who is nearby, with  my final exhibit.   This is a page from the New York Times in 2009. It is a full-page ad  that was taken out in the New York Times in 2009, and it reads:         Dear President Obama and the United States Congress,       tomorrow leaders from 192 countries will gather at the U.N.       Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen to determine the fate       of our planet. As business leaders, we are optimistic that       President Obama is attending Copenhagen with emissions       targets. Additionally, we urge you, our government, to       strengthen and pass U.S. legislation and lead the world by       example. We support your effort to ensure meaningful and       effective measures to control climate change, an immediate       challenge facing the United States and the world today.       Please don't postpone the earth. If we fail to act now, it is       scientifically irrefutable that there will be catastrophic       and irreversible consequences for humanity and our planet.        Please allow us, the United States of America, to serve in       modeling the change necessary to protect humanity and our       planet.    That is the text of this advertisement in the New York Times in 2009.  And guess who signed it. Donald J. Trump, chairman and president;  Donald J. Trump, Jr., executive vice president; Eric F. Trump,  executive vice president; Ivanka M. Trump, executive vice president;  and the Trump Organization.   I will close with the sentence from this New York Times  advertisement, signed by Donald J. Trump, that ``the science of climate  change is irrefutable and our failure to act will have consequences  that are catastrophic and irreversible.'' President Trump's words, not  mine.   I yield the floor.
