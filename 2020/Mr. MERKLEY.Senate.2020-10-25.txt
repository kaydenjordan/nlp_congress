 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, two powerful phrases we often hear in  America: one is ``We the People,'' another is ``equal justice under  law.''   ``We the People,'' the first three words of the Constitution, written  in supersized script so that everyone could have no doubt that that is  what that Constitution--our Constitution--was all about. You can see  those words from across the room. They echo so often, how can we  possibly forget the soul of our Constitution is, as President Lincoln  described, ``of, by, and for the people''--``of, by, and for the  people.''   That second phrase, ``equal justice under law''--a phrase so  important to our system that it is carved above the doors of the  Supreme Court. Just the across the hallway here from the Chamber in  which I now stand, the Senate Chamber, you can go into the Johnson  Room. It served, when Johnson was the majority leader of this Chamber,  as his office. And you look out the window, you can see the Supreme  Court Building with that phrase carved into it: ``Equal Justice Under  Law''--two powerful phrases that, taken together, lay out the  foundation for our democratic Republic.   They also represent a vision that is aspirational--one that we had  not achieved when our Constitution was first written, one that we have  not achieved yet today but that we work toward, we strive toward,  generation after generation, knowing that, in our hearts, that is what  we wish to achieve--a nation where everyone is created equal, in which  everyone is afforded the same rights and privileges, they are all  treated equally, have the full measure of opportunity to pursue their  life ambitions.   Today, this evening, we are considering, in this final 30 hours of  debate, a nomination for the U.S. Supreme Court for a person who will  wear one of those nine black robes and sit in that Supreme Court  Chamber across the plaza from where we now stand, a person who will sit  in a Chamber behind the doors with ``Equal Justice Under Law''  inscribed.   But instead of making a stride toward that vision of ``equal justice  under law,'' instead of making a stride toward that vision of  government of, by, and for the people, this nomination imperils that  vision. This nominee, if confirmed, will damage that vision.   We have a decades-long scheme by a powerful and privileged minority  to destroy the ``we the people'' vision of equality and opportunity in  our Constitution, to erode the foundation of our institutions so that  they can rig the system in their favor.   This has always been a dynamic of republics--those who love that  vision of a government ``of, by, and for the people'' and those who  fear that vision of government ``of, by, and for the people'' because  they want to rig the rules in their favor. They want to rig the rules  with a vision that would never have a chance at the ballot box, that  would never be embraced by the majority. They want to pull the levers  of power from behind the scenes in their own favor, to accentuate  income inequality, to accentuate wealth inequality, to prevent those  people from voting who disagree with them with every type of  contrivance to suppress and intimidate voters.   If there is anything in which freedom of speech has meaning, isn't it  that speech that you make when you mark your ballot for whom you wish  to be your representative--perhaps the most powerful moment of  expression in a republic.   Judge Amy Coney Barrett, the nominee, is certainly not the architect  of this scheme, but she is certainly a full-fledged partner,  enthusiastically embracing The Federalist Society and its mission to  thwart the will of the people of the United States of America.   She doesn't read those first three words of the Constitution--``We  the People''--as meaning government of, by, and for the people; she  reads it as we, the powerful, will decide what is best for ourselves  and everyone else; thank you very much. Boy, talk about a philosophy  that undermines the integrity of our Constitution. That is it.   And she is just one of a stream of jurists rushed through in the last  4 years, organized by the Federalist Society, to  [[Page S6486]]  further undermine the rights of the worker, to undermine the civil  rights of Americans, to undermine healthcare rights, to undermine  environmental laws. It is an agenda that is the exact opposite of the  vision of our Constitution.   And here we have the Members of the majority of this Chamber,  facilitating this scheme. They stand determined to shatter any norm, to  destroy any precedent, to break any rule that stands in the way, to  abandon any principle they so recently passionately proclaimed in their  single-minded grab for power, this single-minded mission of stacking  the court with extreme rightwing jurists for the powerful over the  people--jurists who, rather than standing firm in defense of the  Constitution, will use those black robes for the dark, dark deed of  destroying any pretense of government of, by, and for the people.   Just 4 years ago the majority of this Chamber, the same majority, the  Republican majority, said they had discovered a new principle that they  felt with all their hearts was the right thing to do; that never, under  any condition, under any set of circumstances should this Chamber ever  debate or vote on a nominee for the Supreme Court during an election  year.   They made that argument though the election was far away. The vacancy  occurred early in the year. The nominee was named by the President,  President Obama, in March. But that distant election on the horizon, we  have to protect it, and we should hear from the people before we decide  to debate and vote.   You know, it is disturbing to see a so-called deeply held principle  vaporize like light rain on hot summer asphalt. It is disturbing to see  a so-called deeply held principle be so easily acquired when it  violates the precedents of this Nation and so easily abandoned when it  is convenient to do so.   There is just one principle here. It is the principle of power. It is  the principle of ``we will because we can.'' It is the principle that  we have no principle; we will toss our integrity to the winds; we will  trash our arguments of yesteryear; we will forget the speeches in which  we so passionately proclaimed our positions because we have a moment of  opportunity to advance power for the powerful, and we will seize it.   What is different between this year and 4 years ago when the majority  said there should never, under any circumstances, ever be a debate on a  Presidential nominee during an election year? What is different?   Well, 4 years ago there was a vacancy. This year there is a vacancy.  Four years ago it was an election year, a Presidential election year.  This year it is a Presidential election year.   It is the same choice of whether to debate or whether to hear from  the voice of the people before deciding how to fill this vacancy. It is  the same choice, with one difference. That difference is that 4 years  ago the vacancy occurred 10 months before the election and this year it  occurred just a few weeks before the election.   We all recognize that, if one was really disturbed that this was a  conflict, that disturbance would be much greater this year when there  is no time, so little time--just weeks. In fact, it is not really weeks  before the election because the election is underway. Fifty million  Americans have already voted. So it is not just a year of an election;  it is during an election.   I would love to see an outbreak of integrity in this Chamber, an  outbreak of principle in defense of our Constitution. It is so often  that we admire character. We admire it when someone says ``That person  is as good as their word.''   I would like to be able to say that, when I heard my colleagues say  they had a passionately, deeply held principle 4 years ago that there  should be no debate in an election year, they were as good as their  word.   That is what we admire: character, principle. We all have heard the  quote: ``I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death  your right to say it.'' It is a quote attributed to Voltaire by  Beatrice Evelyn Hall. It was actually more a description of Voltaire's  character, that he believed in a principle so firmly that, even when it  disadvantaged him, to his point of death, he would defend it.   Who in this Chamber argued 4 years ago that during an election year  there should be no debate or vote on a nominee and has that Voltairean  character to defend it when it is inconvenient today--not even  inconvenient to the point of death, just inconvenient because of some  pressure you might receive politically? Who will stand up and be that  voice of character in this Chamber?   We all await to see just a few people stand up and be a voice of  principle in this Chamber. We all stand here and wait for just a few  people to be a voice of integrity in this Chamber. The country waits  for a position that can be admired, of principle, of character, and of  integrity.   It is not just that passionate argument 4 years ago; it is also about  breaking the rules. Just the other day, the chairman of the Judiciary  Committee broke the committee rule that at least 2 members of the  minority needed to be present for a quorum to advance Judge Barrett's  nomination. And he broke another rule to close debate that says there  has to be a minority member present   Well, why don't you just stand up and tear up the rules of the  committee? The Parliamentarian of this body said that is OK--that is  OK. So apparently there are no real rules to what happens here under  this majority.   What is the end goal of this effort to break the norms, break the  rules, break the passionate principles pronounced 4 years ago?  Certainly not to ensure equal justice under law, certainly not to  embody ``We the People'' governments, certainly not because there is a  precedent for this action.   Oh, wait. I was standing here the other day, and I heard a Member  say: We stand on precedent.   Well, we are under our 45th President, although some say it is the  44th because Cleveland was elected twice--in 1884 and then out of  office and back in 1892. But anyway, we are under--we say it is our  45th President--President Trump.   Under our first 43 Presidents, this Senate never once--never once-- not a single time, refused to debate and vote on a nominee from the  President of the United States for the Supreme Court--not once. But 4  years ago, under our 44th President, the Republican majority said: We  are breaking that precedent, and for the first time in U.S. history, we  are refusing to debate and vote.   Now, I would have had some respect for saying that we will debate and  we will vote, because that is our responsibility under the  Constitution. In fact, many times in our history we have debated here  in the Senate, and we have voted, and we have struck down the nominee.   I was surprised to see that almost a quarter of the time--almost one  out of four nominees has been turned down by this Chamber for the  Supreme Court. That would have involved actually being here on the  floor and making arguments. That would involve actually taking a vote  so you could be evaluated, so your position could be evaluated by your  constituents. That would have involved fulfilling your responsibilities  and having the accountability that goes with fulfillment of those  responsibilities.   But there was no fulfillment of responsibilities 4 years ago. There  was no accountability because there was no vote taken--the first time  in U.S. history. So don't tell me--don't tell me, colleagues--that you  stand on precedent.   Or we can look back in history to a Republican President, President  Lincoln. President Lincoln was concerned about filling a Supreme Court  position during an election, so what did President Lincoln do? He  delayed the nomination until after the election. How about that  precedent? How about the Republican majority follow the precedent from  President Lincoln?   And then there is the McConnell precedent. What is the McConnell  precedent that he put forward 4 years ago? We never vote or debate a  nominee during an election year. How about that precedent?   So precedent after precedent after precedent: The historical,  centuries-long precedent of never failing to debate and vote--broken.  The Lincoln precedent of not asking the Senate to do a nominee's  hearing, debate, and vote during an election--broken. The McConnell  precedent put forward with great passion 4 years ago--broken.  [[Page S6487]]    The goal is to transform the Supreme Court into a supermajority, a  superlegislature for the superelite--a 6-to-3 supermajority and a nine- member superlegislature operating for the superelite.   That whole vision in our Constitution of having a Supreme Court that  defends the rights of Americans from the excesses of law written by  Congress or the excesses of the executive branch not following the  laws, that is gone. This is not about nine referees in black robes.  This is about having a supermajority in Republican robes for the  superelite of this country.   Why is that such an important strategy for my Republican colleagues?  Because the superelite understands something fundamental, which is that  sometimes the people of the United States have a grassroots movement,  and they, holding the Constitution near and dear in their heart,  holding their freedoms near and dear to their heart, rise up against  this manipulation by the superelite, and they pass laws to protect  civil rights. They put forward a vision of protecting the environment.  They say workers have to be treated fairly--a fair day's wage for a  fair day's work. And the superelite doesn't like that.   But do you know what? If they can turn the Supreme Court into a  superlegislature they control, they don't have to worry about it  because they can have the laws written by that nine-member Court. They  can pull the levers of power through the Court. And the Court doesn't  have to stand for election ever--lifetime. It is done. It is locked in.  That is the strategy, the very successful strategy, to undermine the  vision of our Constitution.   That superelite, with their supermajority of the nine-member  superlegislature, they can stand in the way of efforts to save our  planet from climate chaos. They can stand in the way of tackling  rampant economic inequality. They can stand in the way of taking on  systemic racism and opportunity for everyone, regardless of the color  of their skin. They can stand in the way of equality of opportunity for  LGBTQ communities. They can stand in the way of security and integrity  for our elections.   They can tear down the work done. When these two Chambers, the House  and the Senate, are mobilized to fight for the vision of our  Constitution--pursuit of happiness, fair opportunity--they can strike  it down. They can strike down healthcare. They can strike down  reproductive rights.   Perhaps the most diabolical part is their effort to destroy the  integrity of our election system. Now, one form of assault on the  integrity is gerrymandering, where States draw the lines in order to  favor a particular party. This has been done in States controlled by  Democrats as well as States controlled by Republicans.   When the analysis is done across the country, when it comes to  Representatives in the Chamber down the hall, the House of  Representatives, political scientists estimate that it creates a 15- to  20-seat bias in favor of the Republicans--15 to 20 seats. That is a big  deal in the House of Representatives.   It certainly, in terms of equal representation, is simply wrong  because it is unequal representation. But the Supreme Court decided it  was OK. They decided it was all right.   Or we can talk about the Voting Rights Act, designed specifically to  stop tactics to suppress voting or to intimidate voters, because isn't  voting the foundation of our electoral system? Isn't it the foundation  of our democratic republic?   But in 2013, in a 5-to-4 decision, the five Justices in red robes  gutted the Voting Rights Act to unleash voting suppression and  intimidation across our country, and we see the results in county after  county after county.   We see it in State after State after State. Here is the thing: Before  the Supreme Court struck down the protection of the integrity of  voting, we had a bipartisan majority--a large, extensive, huge  bipartisan majority--in defense of election integrity in this Chamber.  But once the Court struck it down and it massively favored one party  over the other, the Republicans abandoned their principles on this and  have blocked every effort to restore protection of voting integrity in  our Nation.   We can look at the impact of money from corporations on elections. In  Citizens United, 10 years ago, the Court decided that we need to give  the ultimate source of massive power, ultimate influence on elections  by freeing them up to put as much money into campaigns as they should  like. So if a corporation--if I offend them, and I offend them all the  time--chooses that they can put $100 million into campaigning against  me in my State, it is like a stadium sound system designed to drown out  the voice of the people.   Imagine you are at a ball game. You are there in the stadium, with  all your community members, and you are trying to make your voice  heard. Everyone should get a fair chance to have their voice heard. But  the big speakers above you drown you out. That is Citizens United. It  doesn't facilitate speech in the town square; it suppresses speech in  the town square. It drowns out speech in the town square.   It is as if our Founders had said: We want everyone to have a chance  to stand up and take their position, make it known in the town square,  before the election is held for the mayor but thought it would be OK if  a corporation bought the town square and prevented anyone else from  speaking. That is Citizens United. That is the grotesque violation of  free speech in America done by five jurists in red robes for the  superelite.   That is a pretty good deal for the fossil fuel megapolluters. Our  entire planet is at risk. They want to eliminate all the restrictions,  regulations--the freedom to pollute--even though they know the people  of this country really value clean air and clean water. So control the  courts so they can strike down those rules to protect our air and our  water.   There are many challenges involved in the revenue to support our  country. I mention this because it is another reason the superelite  want a supermajority in the nine-member superlegislature. It is because  the rich don't want to pay for the infrastructure of this country.   Leona Helmsley once said that only the little people pay taxes.  President Trump has said things very close to that. Very wealthy people  have a lot of enterprises going on. Corporations have a lot of  enterprises going on. They are using our legal system continuously, but  they don't want to pay for it. They are using our transportation system  continuously, but they don't want to pay for it. They are benefiting by  hiring the products of our education system, but they don't want to pay  for it.   Leona Helmsley said it well: For the superelite, only the little  people pay taxes. That is the philosophy supported in this effort to  control the courts.   Big banks like this. They want to make sure that there is not an  uprising in the people that says you have to shut down that Wall Street  casino that prevents us from putting the entire American economy at  risk. They want to keep that casino in place. Companies that are trying  to maximize profits and stock values certainly don't like laws that  protect workers' rights and protections.   There are many ways the superelite can pull the levers of power from  behind the scene. Hundreds of lawyers--that is very valuable. Hundreds  of lobbyists work on Capitol Hill. There are far more lobbyists for the  drug industry up here than there are Members of Congress. Media  campaigns to influence public opinion cost a lot of money; that is  another power. Think tanks generate ideas that can move the  conversation in their direction. Of course, the money in elections is  absolutely key. But the courts--the courts are the final defense  against the people. If you can control the courts--who aren't elected,  who are invulnerable to the people--that is your final defense.   At the heart of this court strategy is the Federalist Society,  organized in the 1980s. They put high ideals on their website, saying  they are ``founded on the principles that the state exists to preserve  freedom, that the separation of governmental powers is central to our  Constitution.''   It sounds pretty good. ``Preserve freedom.'' It is innocuous. But it  is not about preserving freedom. That is the media strategy. It is  about crushing the freedom of ordinary people to participate in our  elections. It is about crushing the ability of ordinary people to get a  fair day's pay. It is not about  [[Page S6488]]  the separation of powers. They want the majority in the Senate to work  to create a majority in the Court, closely connected to each other in  this web of the powerful pulling the levers behind the scenes--the  opposite of separation of powers.   As described in the book, ``The Lie that Binds,'' the Federalist  Society sprang up to implement an anti-democratic policy agenda and  political philosophy--a court system impervious to the will of the  voters. That superelite--they realized long ago the powers and  initiatives they wanted were not going to be popular--and thus this  strategy, this strategy relevant to this confirmation.   The Federalist Society has been funded by that same group and  expanded into a behemoth, with some 70,000 attorneys. It started in no  small part by a grant received from the Olin Foundation, a conservative  grant-making foundation that was the force behind business friendly law  and economics at law schools throughout the country.   I have heard people say: Do you know what? I joined because they had  the money to buy us dinner, and I was a poor law student   According to the New York Observer, the Olin Foundation gave out  hundreds of millions of dollars in grants ``to conservative think tanks  and intellectuals--the architects of today's sprawling right-wing  movement--for a quarter century.''   The crown jewel of the Olin Foundation's work? The Federalist  Society. The Olin Foundation wrote to its trustees in 2003: ``All in  all, the Federalist Society has been one of the best investments the  foundation ever made.''   Since its founding, the Federalist Society has put forward extreme,  rightwing legal theories. And as their influence and power have grown,  they have worked hard to bring those theories into the mainstream-- mainstream arguments, like originalism, which Judge Barrett, the late  Justice Antonin Scalia, Justices Kavanaugh and Gorsuch all claim to  hold.   This is how Judge Barrett explained her philosophy during her  confirmation hearings: ``I interpret the Constitution as a law, that I  interpret its text as text, and I understand it to have the meaning  that it had at the time people ratified it. So that meaning doesn't  change over time.''   It is a great cover story. It is a great cover story, but it is a  cover story. It is a cover story for the superelite to manipulate  America. And it dissolves upon any detailed examination. We know, if we  bother to read history, that virtually every clause of the Constitution  had Founders who disagreed on what it meant. Yes, you had a pretty  homogenous group--39 White, educated, wealthy men, signing that piece  of parchment in Philadelphia, but they had multitudinous views of the  clauses. There is a lot of ambiguity in those clauses that enabled them  to come together and say: I can accept that. We will argue later over  what it meant.   This originalist philosophy is saying: Well, here is the secret.  There were a bunch of people who had different views at the time it was  written, but I will choose the one meaning that benefits the powerful  in America, that fits the ``we the powerful'' vision of our  Constitution, not the ``We the People.''   That is pretty clever--pretty clever and pretty diabolical if, in  your heart, you care about this Nation, you care about the beautiful,  extraordinary vision that we will be a government not dedicated to  those who are the elite, like the kingdoms of Europe, but will draw its  power from the opinion of the people. That is the view I hold. That is  the view our Founders aspired to. That is the view that is being  undermined day in and day out by the Federalist Society.   Madison wrote: ``No language is so copious as to supply words and  phrases for every complex idea, or so correct as to not include many  equivocally denoting different ideas.''   He is speaking directly to my point: The Founders had many different  ideas about what each clause of the Constitution meant and what it  would mean to be applied.   He went on to write: ``All new laws, though penned with the greatest  technical skill . . . are considered as more or less obscure and  equivocal, until their meaning be liquidated and ascertained by a  series of particular discussions.''   The words are ``more or less obscure and equivocal, until their  meaning be . . . ascertained by a series of particular discussions''-- again, noting that the right philosophy is to seek to understand the  motivation, the principle in which those ideas were infused, not to  cherry-pick one of the many conflicting positions in order to sustain  power by the powerful.   We can see this in one of the early fights in the history of our  United States, of our Constitution. The year was 1791, just 4 years  after the Constitution was written. Treasury Secretary Alexander  Hamilton was working on his financial plan to build up the country's  credit, and he wanted Congress to charter a national bank. Hamilton had  that goal in position. Madison and Jefferson did not like the idea of a  national bank. They argued about the Constitution.   Hamilton said that as long as the Constitution didn't specifically  say that the government couldn't do something, it then could do  something. And the opposite position held by Jefferson and Madison was,  no, the Constitution only allows something to be done if it is  absolutely necessary to implement the enumerated power.   This argument is over a clause of the Constitution called the  Necessary and Proper Clause. It says that government has the ability to  enact laws for the necessary and proper fulfillment of the enumerated  responsibilities.   But Hamilton read that as allowing something that is relevant and  useful to facilitate an enumerated power. It would serve the purpose of  that enumerated power. And Madison and Jefferson said: No, no, no, it  only means something can be done if it is absolutely essential--not  that it is relevant, not that it is useful, but it is absolutely  essential to implement the enumerated power.   So one is a very expansive view of what is allowed by the  Constitution, and one is a very constricted view. All these men were  involved in writing the Constitution, all to my point about the  differing views that were held about each clause of the Constitution.   We have the greatest minds of the age, including two who had worked  together to not only write the Constitution but also the Federalist  Papers that had completely different interpretations.   It takes a lot of chutzpah to say: I know exactly what the universal  view was of a clause in the Constitution and to do so to get the end  result you want, which is government for the powerful. That is a  powerfully corruptive assault on the core vision of our Constitution.   Let's take a look at another piece of the so-called Federalist pro- business viewpoint, which is that corporations are people, and they  have full freedom of speech. The originalists say: Isn't that obvious  from the Constitution? Well, no, actually, it is not at all obvious  because corporations in their current form did not exist when the  Constitution was written. So it is not only not obvious; it is  completely wrong. Corporations were created for very specific purposes  in our early years.   Professor Brian Murphy, a history professor at Baruch College in New  York, wrote the following: ``Americans inherited the legal form of the  corporation from Britain, where it was bestowed as a royal privilege on  certain institutions . . . used to organize municipal governments.''   Well, that is quite different from the corporations we have.  Americans wondered if they should abolish them entirely or find a way  to democratize them and make them compatible with the spirit of  independence. They chose the latter, so the first American corporations  ended up being cities and schools and charitable organizations. We  don't really begin to see economic enterprises chartered as  corporations until the 1790s.   The work being done on our current Constitution was being done when  we were under the Articles of Confederation. They were in place from  1781 to 1787, a 6-year period. And during that period, corporations  were not economic enterprises. As the professor points out, they became  economic enterprises in the 1790s. Yet, somehow, these Justices of the  Supreme Court and their red robes of the superelite  [[Page S6489]]  say that the Constitution makes it absolutely clear that these massive  business corporations have the same freedom of speech and the ability  to participate in elections as if they are people, because they are  people. But they are not people. And these economic enterprises did not  exist when our Constitution was written.   If you want a single example of the complete corruption of the basic  argument made by the Federalists, this is certainly an example to put  forward.   Murphy continues:         The Founders did not confuse Boston's Sons of Liberty with       the British East India Company. They could distinguish among       different varieties of association--and they understood that       corporate personhood was a legal fiction that was limited to       a courtroom.    Corporations could not vote. Corporations could not hold office.  Early Americans had a far, more comprehensive understanding of  corporations than the Court gives credit for.   Well, this is indeed the challenge that we have because we have a  powerful elite that has created a system completely alien to the core  philosophy of our Constitution of government of, by, and for the  people. They have the money to create those hundreds of lawyers working  day and night for their vision. They have the money to create the  hundreds of lobbyists up here on Capitol Hill working for their vision.  They have the money to create the media campaigns that flood the  airwaves for their vision. They have the money to create the Federalist  Society chapters to recruit people when they first start law school and  indoctrinate them in this particular vision, promising them great  support and reward in their careers to support this mission of  government by and for the powerful.   The network is extensive in ways that need to be completely  understood across the country, a network of affiliated groups. Take the  case of the Freedom and Opportunity Fund, a nonprofit that Mr. Leo, who  was very involved in the Federalist Society, launched in 2016. For over  2 years, the Freedom and Opportunity Fund gave $4 million to another  group, the Independent Women's Voice. In fact, about half of that  group's revenue came in that manner. In an indepth report from the  Washington Post, when Kavanaugh's confirmation was running into  trouble, leaders from the Independent Women's Voice sprang into action,  mobilized to speak at rallies, wrote online commentaries, and appeared  on FOX News. They went to extraordinary lengths to make sure the  Federalist Society's nominee did not get the full examination by the  people of this country.   Now, Mr. Leo is listed as president of three other groups: The BH  Fund, Freedom and Opportunity Fund, and America Engaged. These aren't  groups that have employees. They don't have office space. They don't  have a website. And yet the BH Fund received $24 million from a single  anonymous donor. It gave $3 million to two other groups, one of which,  America Engaged, passed on $1 million of that money to the lobbying arm  of the NRA that went on to carry on a $1 million ad campaign in  supporting Neil Gorsuch. This is vast money in a vast web being  deployed to influence Americans in every possible way because these  folks hate the vision of government of, by, and for the people.   The Federalists don't just carry out public relations campaigns. They  don't just recruit law students. They proceed to be in the very center  of things presenting oral arguments. They presented every oral argument  on every single abortion case that has come before the Supreme Court  since 1992. They are involved in issue after issue after issue. They  have been invested in litigation efforts against the ACA, the  Affordable Care Act, by trying to strike down healthcare for millions  of Americans well before the act was even signed into law and before  there was even anything to litigate against. A Federalist Society  member, Randy Barnett, coauthored a 16-page legal memo against the law,  which became a source of talking points during congressional debate and  laid the framework for subsequent court challenges.   Is it any wonder that so many of us across the Nation are terrified  of Judge Barrett's confirmation and what it could mean for the health  of our citizens? I was interested to hear a colleague on this floor--a  Republican colleague say these are scare tactics. These are scare  tactics to say that the Court might strike down healthcare. These are  scare tactics.   Does that colleague not believe the President of the United States  when he said he will nominate someone who will strike down the ACA and  its healthcare bill of rights? It is not a scare tactic to say the  individual who chose the nominee said he intended to strike down Roe v.  Wade and pick somebody who would strike down the Affordable Care Act.   Now, the Affordable Care Act, in my home State, has meant 400,000  people gained access to Medicaid under the expansion of Medicaid. One  of the ironies is, the largest percentage of beneficiaries are in the  reddest parts of the State, and the biggest beneficiaries in terms of  providing healthcare are rural hospitals and rural clinics because the  people who previously came couldn't pay the bill, so they didn't have  the resources to expand their operation, but now they do.   When I do my townhalls and people say: ``I just don't like this ACA''  because they have been hearing that from the rightwing media, I say:  Well, let's have a vote of everyone here. You can step forward or step  backward. Do you like the idea of children being on your policy until  age 26 because that is in the bill of rights--the healthcare bill of  rights of the ACA. No, no, no. We like that. Overwhelmingly, we like  that. How about tax credits to enable middle-class Americans to be able  to buy healthcare? No, no, no. We like that. How about comparing  policies on the website so you can pick a policy that is right for your  family? No, no, no. That is a step forward   But the Federalist Society, the President, and the Republicans in  this Chamber have decided that they are going to tear down healthcare  for 20 million Americans. So it is hardly a scare tactic because there  are very powerful forces at work on that mission.   One of the healthcare bill of rights that people really love in my  State, and actually in all States across this country, is the  protection to get a policy at the same price, even if you have a  preexisting condition.   I was at a fundraiser--a walkathon for multiple sclerosis, for MS,  when a woman came up to me, and she said: Things are so much different  this year.   I said: What do you mean? The weather is different? The turnout is  different?   She said: No, no, no. A year ago, if someone was diagnosed with MS,  we knew they would have a very hard time, if they didn't have good  healthcare, getting the help they needed and then they might face  lifetime limits or annual limits that would prevent them from actually  getting care, even though they had insurance. But now we can get the  care we need.   So that is the goal. That is the goal of the Federalist Society: tear  down healthcare for millions of Americans.   You may wonder if when I noted that the Court was against the  foundation of our democracy--the former five Justices, soon to be six  Justices in red robes want to tear down the basic foundation of our  democratic Republic. Well, let's look a little more closely at that.   Perhaps I can persuade you because the Court decided that  corporations are people and that they can spend their unlimited  concentrated assets in campaigns--the case, Citizens United. And why do  we call it dark money? Well, because corporations can give their money  to a 501(c)(4), so-called nonprofit, and the nonprofit gives their  money to a super PAC, which runs an independent campaign, and the super  PAC discloses the nonprofit as the donor but not the original donor, so  it is laundered. Nobody knows who funded that super PAC that is  attacking you with millions of dollars of ads.   So that certainly is the Court weighing in for the absolute  suppression of the voice of the people and a voice drowned out by  unlimited corporations from the largest, most powerful financial  organizations that exist in the world.   Let's take a closer look at Shelby County. Shelby County, which  gutted the Voting Rights Act, protecting the foundations for the  citizens to fully participate, but the Court strikes it down--strikes  it down. And, last year,  [[Page S6490]]  in Rucho v. Common Cause, the Court said that gerrymandering is just  fine. They knew that it violates the very premise of equal  representation, and they decided that unequal representation was just  fine. Instead of defending the vision of our Constitution, they  supported it being struck down.   And we know the courts have a huge ability to legislate from the  bench for the powerful. We see it time and time and time again. And, by  the way, on that decision, Elena Kagan and Ginsburg and Breyer and  Sotomayor noted: ``[T]he most fundamental of . . . constitutional  rights: the rights to participate equally in the political process, to  join with others to advance political beliefs, and to choose their  political representatives,'' is assaulted by this decision.   Colleagues, we are in dark and dangerous, tumultuous times. It is  exactly those times that require us to stand on principle, with  integrity, to defend our institutions. This process, which has violated  precedent after precedent after precedent--a 200-year precedent in  which always a nominee is debated and voted on, violated 4 years ago to  steal a Supreme Court seat; the Lincoln precedent of not putting  forward a nominee during election; the McConnell precedent of saying we  never debate and vote in an election year enunciated just 4 years ago;  and the rules broken in the Judiciary Committee--all of this about one  position, and that one position is power but not power for the vision  of government of, by, and for the people but power for the powerful to  undermine the ability of the people to have government of, by, and for  the people.   Let us honor our oath to the Constitution; let us defend the  integrity of the Court; and let us strike down this nominee to defend  the integrity of the Court   I yield the floor.
