 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   We pride ourselves on being the most deliberative body on the planet,  and all of us come here to contribute our best ideas to improve the  lives of the American people.   You wonder why this place doesn't work? It is the whole set of  exclusion of ideas from nearly half this body.   I am one of those people who has offered just about 25 amendments  that were blocked by the Republicans. What are they afraid of? Debate  your ideas. Make your arguments. Vote. Be held accountable.   Some of the things they blocked, the amendments I offered: an  amendment to increase student loan interest tax deductions in our tax  bill; a provision to end tax breaks for companies that ship American  jobs overseas; an amendment to increase funding to combat violent  extremism; and an amendment to increase funding for fire departments in  the SAFER grants. Those are just four examples.   Their practice, they marked an important moment in history, not a  good moment: the most closed Congress in the history of the United  States, excluding from consideration debate, argument, and  accountability.   Vote on these things so the American people know where you stand.  That is what we have here, over 1,000 ideas proffered by Democrats that  our Republican colleagues won't even bring to the floor for  consideration so the American people know where they stand on a range  of important issues.   This is a dark day for Congress, the most closed Congress in our  history. It means the voices of the American people as reflected in  nearly half of this body are not being considered, debated, and voted  upon by the Congress.   It is wrong. It is negatively impacting the lives of the American  people. There are real consequences. It is not just that we want our  own amendments considered. It is because we understand it will benefit  the American people.   I urge my colleagues to have some self-reflection on what they are  doing here.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I rise in strong support of the FIRST STEP Act. I supported this  bipartisan bill in committee because it will help more ex-offenders  reenter the workforce. It will reduce recidivism.   The FIRST STEP Act is just a first step in fixing our criminal  justice system. We all realize there is a lot more to do and a lot more  we must do, but this is an important start.   I would remind everyone that the bill allows prisoners to earn an  additional 7  [[Page H4312]]  days off their sentence each year they demonstrate good behavior. It  funds important job training, drug treatment, and education services.  It prohibits the shackling of pregnant women and improves compassionate  release.   These are all very good provisions. It will not only reduce  recidivism; it will enhance the safety of our communities by making  sure folks have the ability to enter drug treatment, enter job  training, and avail themselves of educational services. These are all  commonsense ideas. I hope that everyone will support this legislation.   I want to thank, particularly, my colleague Hakeem Jeffries for his  strong leadership in these difficult negotiations, and I urge my  colleagues to vote for the FIRST STEP and then commit themselves to  continuing to build on this, because there is much more work to do in  sentencing reform and criminal justice reform broadly.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the bank lobbyist act,  which reverses the progress we have made since Wall Street brought our  economy to the brink of collapse in 2008.   This is yet another giveaway from our friends on the other side of  the aisle to the wealthy donors who bankroll their campaigns, and, once  again, working people will get screwed.   Congress established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to  protect the middle class from the big banks and corporate special  interests. Since 2010, the CFPB has returned nearly $12 billion to  consumers in all 50 States.                                time  1500    It has been a big step forward for working people, but this bill  turns the clock back. Republicans are going to let the banks write the  same risky loans that got us into the Great Recession in the first  place. This is a bad deal for the American people. They deserve better.   Let's defeat this bill and put working families first.
