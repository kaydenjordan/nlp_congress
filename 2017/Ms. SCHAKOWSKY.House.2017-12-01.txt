 Mr. Speaker, I thank the lady for yielding to me and  for her continued advocacy for all consumers, particularly the low- income consumers who are affected by this legislation.   I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 1699, a bill that guts consumer  protections for buyers of manufactured homes.   For years, the manufactured housing industry has preyed on low-income  households, pushing them into high-interest mortgages. Under this bill,  buyers of manufactured homes would effectively get less protection than  any other home buyers.   On top of that, the bill would encourage higher interest rates on  loans for manufactured homes, taking a bigger bite out of families'  paychecks.   This manufactured housing bill is actually part of a multiprong  attack on safeguards implemented by the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau. President Trump has placed OMB Director Mick Mulvaney at the  CFPB to destroy it from within, while Republicans in Congress are  chipping away at consumer protections from the outside.   Americans deserve better. I really urge my colleagues to stand up for  consumers and vote ``no.''   You know, it is easy to go after those people who live in these  trailer parks who are trying to make their way, who are struggling to  make ends meet, and this bill adds another layer of problem for them by  allowing for higher interest rates. It is just wrong. We should be  voting ``no.''
