 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. It is good to be with  my good friend from New York and other Members of Congress here tonight  to talk about why we need a second special counsel.   Nobody likes him. I don't like him, but I don't know of any other  remedy. Is the FBI really going to be able to investigate themselves?  Is the Department of Justice really going to be able to investigate  themselves? And I understand Mr. Horowitz, the inspector general, is  going to do good work, and he has done good work, but it is not the  same. It is not the same.                                time  2015    The only way to get to the truth, I think, is to have a second  special counsel look at all of this; all the Clinton investigation, all  the Russia investigation, look at it all.   Understand a few things we have learned over the past few months and,  frankly, the past few days with the very top people at the FBI.   James Comey misled the American people on both investigations.   Now, think about this. Mr. Comey, at the urging of then-Attorney  General Loretta Lynch, calls the Clinton investigation a matter, not an  investigation, and misleads the American people.   We all know it was an investigation. As some of my colleagues have  said, the last time I checked, he was not running the Federal Bureau of  Matters; it is the Federal Bureau of Investigation. It was an  investigation, but in an attempt to play it down, he misleads the  American people and calls it a matter and not an investigation.   Then, when it came to our President, he allows the perception to  exist with the American people that President Trump is under  investigation when, in fact, he wasn't and had been told by James  Comey, himself, that he wasn't under investigation.   Then, of course, there is the number two guy at the FBI, Andrew  McCabe, who we have learned in the last few days actually misled the  Office of Professional Responsibility, misled his boss, and misled the  inspector general on two different occasions--four times, total. As  they say, he lacked candor. He didn't tell the truth.   So we need a special counsel to look into all this and a host of  other things. It was those guys, Mr. Comey and Mr. McCabe, who were  involved at the FBI when the whole dossier thing unfolded where they  took an opposition research document, dressed it all up, made it look  like it was legitimate intelligence, and took it to the secret court to  get a warrant to spy on a fellow American associated with the Trump  campaign.   They didn't tell the court two important things. They didn't tell the  court who paid for the document, namely, the Clinton campaign and the  DNC; and they didn't tell the court that the author of that salacious  and unverified document, Christopher Steele, had had his relationship  with the FBI terminated because Mr. Steele broke a cardinal rule: he  went and told the press he was working for the FBI.   Now, if you and I go to court, we have got to tell the truth. We have  got to tell the whole truth. But they didn't. They didn't.   Now, recently, there have been two appointments made at the  Department of Justice by the current Attorney General: Mr. Huber and  Mr. Lausch. Mr. Lausch has been named to help get the documents to  Congress that we are entitled as a separate and equal branch of  government to receive. Mr. Huber has been tasked with overseeing this  whole Russia investigation.   While these individuals appear to be fine individuals, again, it is  not the same because whom does Mr. Huber and Mr. Lausch answer to? They  answer to Rod Rosenstein, who was involved in all this throughout all  the Clinton investigation and throughout the Russia investigation. They  answer to Rod Rosenstein.   Now, how do employees investigate their boss? Someone tell me how  that works.   I have two final points.   When you think about probably the classic definition of the swamp,  think about this: Rod Rosenstein writes the memo for firing James  Comey. James Comey leaks a government document to The New York Times to  create momentum for a special counsel, Bob Mueller, whom Rod Rosenstein  appoints as the special counsel and oversees; and one of the elements  they are looking at is whether there was obstruction of justice in the  firing of James Comey.   You can't make this stuff up. You talk about the biggest roundabout I  have ever seen.   We need a special counsel. Think about this as well: the Attorney  General has said only in extraordinary circumstances do you name  special counsel.   It is pretty extraordinary when James Comey, the Director of the FBI,  has been fired; Andrew McCabe, the Deputy Director of the FBI, has been  fired; Jim Baker, the former general counsel, has been demoted and  reassigned; Peter Strzok, the deputy head of counterintelligence has  been demoted and reassigned; and Lisa Page, FBI counsel, has been  demoted and reassigned. Those are some of the top people at the FBI.  Now, if that is not extraordinary, then I don't what the heck is.   If it is not a little unusual when the new Deputy Attorney General  writes the memo to fire James Comey and then names Bob Mueller as  special counsel, and one of the things they are looking at is whether  there was obstruction of justice in the firing of James Comey, if those  aren't extraordinary and strange circumstances warranting a second  special counsel, then, again, I don't know what is.   So let's just do the right thing. Mr. Sessions and Mr. Rosenstein  should just do the right thing. The American people want this. If we  get a second special counsel, then we limit the amount of time that  they can look at this. We pick someone outside the swamp somewhere in  the middle of the country. Let him or her run this investigation, say:  Here is your time; go figure it out.   I believe, when they reach their conclusions, there is a much better  chance the American people will accept that result and accept their  findings. But if it is just the same old thing that we have been  seeing, I think that is much tougher.   So this is what is needed. No one likes it; no one really wants these  things to happen; but I see no other approach that will get the answers  and hopefully provide the closure that the country needs to move on.   So I would just say to Mr. Sessions and Mr. Rosenstein: Do what  everyone else in this country knows needs to happen. Name the second  special counsel. Let's get the facts for the American people, and let's  get moving.
