 Mr. President, I rise to oppose the resolution vacating  the OCC's final rule on the Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA.   Acting Comptroller of the Currency Brian Brooks has noted: ``The new  Community Reinvestment Act rule was finalized for one reason--to  promote more lending and investment in underserved areas--including  low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.''   The key changes the rule makes are these: It clarifies what counts  for CRA credit, updates where activity is evaluated, evaluates CRA  performance more objectively, and makes record-keeping and reporting  timelier and more transparent.   The OCC's efforts to improve the CRA framework began in 2017 with an  extensive and deliberate process, engaging numerous stakeholders along  the way. The OCC issued its advance notice of proposed rulemaking in  2018, and in December 2019, the OCC jointly issued a proposed rule with  the FDIC, which received 7,500 comments. The OCC says those comments  made it better and significantly different from the proposal.   The status quo was failing. The OCC found that the regulatory status  quo had failed to improve economic outcomes for underserved groups,  including minorities and low- and moderate-income communities.   The CRA regulatory process was broken. Acting Comptroller Brooks  stated:         In addition to not achieving the societal goals of the       statute, the regulatory process around CRA was broken. Banks       and stakeholders were uncertain of what activities would       qualify for CRA consideration from exam to exam. The       framework's lack of objectivity, transparency, consistency,       and fairness left the whole process open to sweetheart deals       and made it nearly impossible to assess the impact of       billions of dollars that were spent each year. Stakeholders       have voiced the need to update the CRA regulations now for       more than a decade.    What does the final rule do? The final rule establishes objective  criteria for determining and an illustrative list of what qualifies for  CRA credit, while also creating a preapproval process for banks. It  updates and expands assessment areas to better reflect how banks serve  customers today by adding deposit-based assessment areas. It also  incentivizes CRA activity in new areas of need, including Indian  Country and rural and distressed areas. The final rule establishes new  general performance standards to more objectively evaluate a bank's CRA  performance. Finally, the rule requires banks to report better data to  improve the transparency and accountability of banks and their  regulators to their communities.   Importantly, the rule does not change the OCC's authority or  obligation to fight discrimination and illegal practices.   Several organizations have praised the final rule, including the  Consumer Bankers Association, the National Disability Institute, the  National Congress of American Indians, and the National Diversity  Coalition.   FDIC Chairman McWilliams noted: ``There are many provisions in the  final rule that will greatly benefit low- and moderate-income  communities, and provide greater clarity to banks on CRA  expectations.''   Last month, the Federal Reserve issued its own advance notice of  proposed rulemaking, and Acting Comptroller Brooks observed that  ``there is a significant amount of overlap between what the Fed has  proposed and what the OCC has finalized.''   The OCC issued this rule in May. Senate Democrats have waited until  the end of the Congressional Review Act window to act, timing this vote  to be most disruptive to the Senate's floor schedule. More importantly,  this vote comes after the rule's effective date of October 1. Voiding  it would create confusion and uncertainty for communities, industry,  and other stakeholders, harming the very communities the CRA would  help.   Acting Comptroller Brooks said it well:         Overturning the OCC's new CRA rule would roll back benefits       to Native Americans, people with disabilities, American       farmers, and small business owners. It would preserve a       status quo that on its face has failed to make the progress       promised 43 years ago. It would force banks, communities       groups, and examiners to operate in the dark without the       transparency, objectivity, and regulatory certainty that the       new rule provides. It would also prevent future Comptrollers       from taking up the rule to improve how CRA works in the       future.    Additionally, former Comptroller Joseph Otting wrote:         The coronavirus pandemic has only made it more dire that       communities--particularly low- and moderate-income       communities--need more capital and better access to capital.       And they need it now.    I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against this resolution, to  preserve this important modernization of our CRA regulations.   Thank you.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote scheduled for  5:45 p.m. begin immediately.
