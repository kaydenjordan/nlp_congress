 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the distinguished chair and  ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Engel and Mr.  McCaul, for their leadership in crafting this joint resolution  condemning the administration's decision to withdraw and abandon our  Kurdish allies in Syria and leave them to an unlawful assault by  Turkish forces.   As a combat veteran, I know firsthand the strength of our Nation is  tied to our partnerships and alliances around the globe. During my  three deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, I counted on our local  partners for the safety of our soldiers. And those partners depended on  the U.S. commitment to them. That relationship forged in a combat zone  is built on trust and the belief that our word is our bond.   The administration's reckless decision to withdraw U.S. forces has  undermined the value of our commitment, not only to our Kurdish allies,  who are now isolated in fighting enemies on all sides, but also our  other allies around the world. The message that we are sending is that  the American handshake doesn't matter. Our withdrawal is an abdication  of our moral responsibility to the Kurds and undermines the belief that  America is a resolute partner. It has also led to our adversaries like  Russia, Iran, the Assad regime, and ISIS exerting greater influence in  the region.   Let me be clear, the President's decision makes us less safe and  further isolates us from the very allies from whom we have drawn so  much strength. The President must immediately reverse his decision to  withdraw U.S. personnel from Syria, recommit to our Kurdish allies, and  take a firm stance against any further aggression by Turkey against the  Kurdish people.
