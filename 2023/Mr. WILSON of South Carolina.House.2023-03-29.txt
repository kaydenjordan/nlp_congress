 Mr. Speaker, parents everywhere must  have the ability to make educational decisions for their children.  Though an obvious right, unfortunately, many school districts have been  influenced by extremist special interest groups ignoring parental  wishes.   In response, House Republicans, led by Chairwoman Virginia Foxx,  passed the Parents Bill of Rights Act. This legislation will make clear  to schools that parents have a right to know what is being taught to  their children, be heard by teachers and school boards, see the school  budget and spending, protect the privacy of children, and keep their  children safe.   As a parent of four sons, Roxanne and I appreciate local elected  school boards running schools. As a grandfather, I want my sons and  daughters-in-law to have the same level of oversight for our nine  grandchildren.   I am grateful for the leadership of Ellen Weaver, the South Carolina  Superintendent of Education, a champion for the rights of parents.   In conclusion, God bless our troops who successfully protected  America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from the safe haven of Afghanistan to America.   God bless our Vietnam veterans.                            ____________________
