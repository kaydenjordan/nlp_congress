 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 52 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                 H. Res. 52         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the joint resolution (H.J.       Res. 28) making further continuing appropriations for fiscal       year 2019, and for other purposes. All points of order       against consideration of the joint resolution are waived. The       joint resolution shall be considered as read. All points of       order against provisions in the joint resolution are waived.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       joint resolution and on any amendment thereto to final       passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of       debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations or       their respective designees; and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 2.  It shall be in order at any time through the       legislative day of January 25, 2019, for the Speaker to       entertain motions that the House suspend the rules as though       under clause 1 of rule XV. The Speaker or her designee shall       consult with the Minority Leader or his designee on the       designation of any matter for consideration pursuant to this       section.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, on Wednesday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 52, providing for consideration of  H.J. Res. 28, the Further Additional Continuing Appropriations Act of  2019 to fund the government until February 28.   The rule provides for consideration of the legislation under a closed  rule. The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled  by the chair and ranking member of the Committee on Appropriations.  Additionally, the rule provides suspension authority through the  legislative day of January 25, 2019.   Madam Speaker, we are in day 27 of this government shutdown, the  longest government shutdown in our Nation's history.   Nearly 800,000 Federal employees have now missed a paycheck since the  shutdown began. Some estimates say those employees have lost an average  of $5,000 each so far.   These hardworking Americans are law enforcement officers and National  Park Service, EPA, FDA, and IRS employees, and so many others in  dedicated Federal service whose families are needlessly suffering.  These employees are either furloughed or being forced to work without  pay. This is not an acceptable way to govern.   I may not have been a Member of this body as long as some people  here, but I don't think there is a single Member, Democrat or  Republican, who doesn't care about securing our border, but it is  foolish to think that keeping our government shut down will in any way  help secure the border.   You know what Border Patrol and Coast Guard members want more than a  wall? They want their paychecks to come on time.   Democrats have made it clear, we are more than willing to come to the  table to talk about sensible border security, but the first step has to  be to reopen the government and get our government back to functioning.   This majority has already voted to open the government seven times,  with support from across the aisle. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch  McConnell has yet to act on any of these bipartisan pieces of  legislation, the same legislation, I might add, that has already passed  the Senate.   There are more than 100 freshmen Members of this body, comprising  over 20 percent of the House, who have never worked in a functioning  Federal Government due to the Senate's inaction. All of our  constituents, both Republican and Democrat, are suffering because of  that failure to act.   Let me share with you the traumatic impact of the shutdown on my  constituents and Americans across the country.   Jennifer, the wife of a Coast Guard gunner's mate, wrote to my office  to detail the hardships her family is facing. Her husband has served in  the Coast Guard for 19 years. They are used to stressful deployments,  and her children are proud of their father's service. But now Jennifer  has new hardships to face: how to feed her family on only her income,  how she could make the holidays special while not knowing when her  husband's next paycheck would come, and how to shield her kids from her  constant worry over the absence of that income.   This is an embarrassment. Too many Federal workers were already  living paycheck to paycheck before those paychecks stopped. Having to  put a mortgage payment on a credit card, deal with an eviction notice,  or plead with a bank to delay a student loan payment should not be the  reality forced upon hardworking Federal employees.   The debts these workers incur during the shutdown will follow them  long after the government is reopened. The hits to their savings  accounts and marks on their credit scores will serve as painful  reminders that they are represented by a government that will put them  in harm's way over a policy dispute.   Fran, a newlywed with a premature baby who spent more than 3 weeks in  the NICU, has been without an income since her husband's paychecks  stopped coming. Their child requires an expensive special formula due  to his premature birth, and her husband is now being asked to work  overtime without pay.   The fear and anguish in these messages from our neighbors is  palpable. It should resonate with every Member of this body. These  stories should keep all of us up at night. If we didn't come to  Washington to serve these dedicated and hardworking Americans, then  just who are we here to serve?  [[Page H684]]    When the government does eventually reopen, fortunately, many of  these Federal employees will receive backpay, but the plight of Federal  contractors is worse. The term ``Federal contractors'' can conjure up  an image of highly paid executives or CEOs of private detention  facilities, but they are not the real ones harmed by the shutdown.   Federal contractors are generally small businesses, cleaners,  builders, food service workers, and tech support workers. They are our  neighbors who rely on these contracts to make their rent or pay their  employees or contribute to our local economies.   The callousness with which these Federal contractors are being  treated is repulsive. They and their families deserve so much better.  The American people deserve so much better.   The longer the Senate Republicans keep our government shut down, the  worse things will get.    The Small Business Administration has already stopped approving loan  assistance and guarantee applications from commercial banks and small  businesses, programs that are critical to the health of local  economies.   Security lines at the airports are long, and they will get longer.  TSA has already been forced to close security lanes at major airports  across the country. This is not because the hardworking men and women  of the TSA do not want to keep our skies and our passengers safe, but  because they have been forced to take second jobs to pay the rent or  look after their children at home because they cannot afford childcare.  Without a paycheck, some cannot afford gas or carfare to get to work at  all.   Just a few days ago, I met with the air traffic controllers from my  district. They shared that not only is the shutdown impacting their  current workforce, but it is drastically impacting their recruiting  efforts to hire and train new employees for this workforce. Can we  blame people for being fearful of taking a job that hinges on the  Federal Government's functionality, given what we have seen during this  shutdown?   A National Air Traffic Controllers Association official warned  recently that if the shutdown continues to drag on, there may not be  any air traffic controllers left working.   Let me pause to make those statements abundantly clear. This shutdown  is making us less safe. If it continues much longer, there will not be  enough employees on duty to make sure passengers are safe to board a  plane, not enough employees left to make sure planes are safe to land,  and not enough employees to direct air traffic in our skies.   If you think you are insulated from the effects of a government  shutdown because you are not a Federal employee, you are wrong.   What I fear this administration and Republican leadership in the  Senate have forgotten is that this is the people's House. We have an  obligation to work for them. Refusing to uphold that commitment, that  promise, is a slap in the face to the American people.   Before I conclude, let me share with you one final story of how the  shutdown is harming American families.   Jessica from my district is a mother of six with a special needs  child. Her husband is Active Duty Coast Guard. She has been forced to  tell her children they can't have seconds at dinner, because she  doesn't know if she will have enough food to last the week. Her  daughter has an ultrasound coming up, and she is unsure if she can  afford the specialist copay.   She writes that she and her husband supported President Trump, but  that after this, she does not see ``how we could support someone so out  of touch and willing to damage so many people in order to save his own  face.''   Jessica ended her message by saying that they are prepared to stand  strong, but she is also prepared to stand at the corner of an  intersection with a cardboard sign if that is what she has to do to  feed her children.   This is not the America I was raised in.   Let's end the shutdown today and get our country back on track.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I understand the frustration of the gentlewoman from  Arizona with the lack of progress in ending this shutdown, but I would  suggest that her frustration is misdirected.    The House has sent seven bills to end the shutdown to the Senate, and  the Senate leadership has refused to entertain any of them or bring  them to a vote: #whereismitch.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maine (Mr.  Golden).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  0945     Madam Speaker, I am surprised to hear my colleague talk  about political theater. We have a reality-show President in the White  House who is ignoring the real lives impacted by the shutdown, all to  try to make another made-for-TV moment to please his rightwing base and  radio pundits. Government isn't a game. Real lives are at stake, and we  need to reopen the government.   Madam Speaker, may I inquire if the gentlewoman has any remaining  speakers. If not, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of  my time.  [[Page H687]]     Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I don't know when this shutdown will end, but I know  that Democrats and all the Republicans who are serious about getting  Federal employees back to work will vote in favor of this rule and the  underlying resolution.   I am heartened by my colleagues from across the aisle who have  already voted to reopen the government, and I am hopeful that even more  will join us this time around.   No serious person can claim that any Member of this House is against  border security. Not only have we sworn an oath to protect and defend  this country, but we have voted repeatedly to fund billions of dollars  in border security appropriations.   The discussion about the best methods for protecting our border is a  valid policy question that should be debated thoughtfully and  deliberately by both sides of the aisle, not used as a vehicle for the  President to fulfill a campaign promise at the expense of American  families.   It cannot be overstated: this is the longest government shutdown in  history. The House has done its job. We have passed bills to reopen the  government on bipartisan votes and will continue to do so for as long  as it takes.   We have committed to working on solutions to border security once the  government is opened back up. The votes are there in the Senate. They  have already shown that. And given the chance, I am sure they would  show it again.   Why won't Senator McConnell bring to the floor any one of the House- passed bills to open the government?   I will end by saying this: Senator McConnell, do the right thing for  working families in your State, in my State, and across the country.  Hold a vote to open the government.   Let's end the pain American families and businesses are feeling from  the shutdown and get to work on making this country a better place for  all.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous  question.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the  previous question on the resolution.   The previous question was ordered.
