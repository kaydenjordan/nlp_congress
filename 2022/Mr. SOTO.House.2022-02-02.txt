 Madam Speaker, you are in luck. I heard a lot of complaints  but no solutions. That is why my colleagues across the aisle lost the  2020 election miserably.   We know what they are against. President Biden said it best. What are  the Republicans for? What are they for?   Some of them joined us in some of the bills I am about to outline.  The rest of them, it has been nothing.   Meanwhile, Democrats delivered the American Rescue Plan, shots in  arms, and money in pockets, and we stopped another Great Recession. Can  you imagine how we would be able to respond to delta or omicron without  passing future relief?   Now, unemployment is below 4 percent. We created nearly 7 million  jobs last year. In my district, we were devastated by the Great  Recession. Foreclosures devastated central Florida. In 2021, this time  around, foreclosures are down from 2020.   Americans in central Florida lost their homes last time around. This  time around, we put a stop to it.   House Republicans voted no, yet Republican Governors took the  American Rescue Plan money and responded to our Nation's crisis. That  is what we should all be doing.   Next, we go to the bipartisan infrastructure framework. There is huge  support among all Americans to upgrade America, our roads and bridges,  our ports and airports, our clean water, clean and resilient energy,  rural broadband. I have urban, suburban, and rural areas in the  district. Everyone in my district, regardless of their party  background, is excited about this infrastructure. We have had meetings  with local officials across the area, and they are looking to work with  us to upgrade America.   According to Republican Senator Rob Portman, it helps fix supply  chains and is counterinflationary. That is why 22 Senators from the  Republican side voted yes and why 10 Republicans colleagues here in the  House voted yes.   We applaud these 32 Republicans for joining all Democrats in voting  for the infrastructure bill. What did the radical House Republicans do?  They attacked their own over infrastructure. What a sad, sad legacy  that is.   It didn't stop a few of them from trying to take credit, though,  trying to take credit for projects, despite voting no. If you vote no  and you try to take credit now, the message is clear. America will  shame you every day, every time.   Now, we turn to the America COMPETES Act. Madam Speaker, 32  Republicans joined with Democrats to vote for the Senate's version of  this, boosting domestic microchip manufacturing, which we do in our  district, and I am going to go into that a little more in a moment;  improving supply chains for medical supplies like PPE, like vaccines,  telecom, solar, all these critical issues; and, yes, enabling us to  compete against economic rivals like China, like Russia, and others who  don't share our values.   In the Senate, the vast majority of them are able to come together.  In the House, I hope we are. I hope we have a few of our colleagues.   Then, there is going to be a conference. We are going to conference  this, make some deals between the House and the Senate, and we are  going to get something together. That bill is going to come back.   That is going to be the last shot, the last shot for both Democrats  and Republicans to come together to ensure we produce millions of new  jobs in domestic manufacturing.   Madam Speaker, I want to commend the America COMPETES Act for  including $52 billion to incentivize private-sector investments and  continued American leadership in semiconductor manufacturing and  microchip manufacturing to help address supply chain disruptions and to  ensure more microchips are produced here at home.   I have heard from my local auto dealers. I have heard from local  manufacturers. We need to make these microchips at home, and this bill  helps us do that.   Within our district in central Florida, we have the NeoCity  technological campus, which is recognized as an emerging microchips,  microelectronics, and advanced manufacturing hub. We have ready-made  synergies with institutions of higher education across Florida and key  partnerships with the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S.  Department of Commerce under both the Trump administration and now  under the Biden administration.   NeoCity is home to BRIDG, a nonprofit public-private partnership  specializing in domestic semiconductor research, development, and  manufacturing.   Imec, a world-renowned international research and development  organization active in the semiconductor design and architecture space,  also has a presence there.   SUSS MicroTec, a leading supplier of equipment and process solutions  for the semiconductor industry, is working at NeoCity.   Then there is SkyWater Technology, the only domestically owned and  operated pure play trusted foundry that  [[Page H906]]  works on leading-edge advanced packaging technology for microchips and  microelectronics. They are all working in collaboration at the Center  for Neovation at NeoCity, one of the most state-of-the-art, advanced  manufacturing facilities in the Western Hemisphere.   As envisioned by this important legislation, the facility and experts  at BRIDG, imec, SUSS MicroTec, and SkyWater Technology offer immediate  capability to accelerate U.S. production of critical semiconductor  chips, strengthen the domestic supply chain so chips are made right  here in America, and turbocharge our research capacity.   Equally as important, NeoCity Academy, a public STEM magnet high  school, is training the leaders of tomorrow's science and technology  workforce.   I am proud of the work being undertaken in our district to support  domestic semiconductor manufacturing technology development as they  work to address the supply chain. I look forward to working with the  administration and the U.S. Department of Commerce on implementation of  the America COMPETES Act and the CHIPS for America fund.    In this bill, we were able to get an amendment to clarify that chips  funding also includes nonprofits in places like NeoCity. We appreciate  the House for supporting this, adding nonprofits to the definition of  ``covered entities'' to expand the semiconductor incentive program to  include nonprofit entities, clarifying that nonprofit entities like  501(c)(3) facilities in NeoCity are also eligible for funding under the  semiconductor incentive program.   We are helping with aerospace there. We are starting to work with  commercial space like NASA and SpaceX and Blue Origin.   The bill also includes my second amendment. We know that we are  boosting forward on artificial intelligence. We need to make sure, as  we are doing that and seeing more autonomous vehicles and other  artificial intelligence uses, we are training our labor force ahead of  time for the jobs of today and tomorrow.   That is why I am proud that the AI JOBS Act passed as an amendment  and directs the Department of Labor to create a report analyzing the  future of our artificial intelligence and its impacts on the American  workforce.   Specifically, the report would collect data to analyze which  industries are projected to have the most growth through artificial  intelligence and the demographics which may experience expanded career  opportunities and those most vulnerable to job displacement. This is an  inclusion of our standalone bill, H.R. 6553, the AI JOBS Act.   Thirdly, we were able to include an amendment for the blockchain and  cryptocurrency specialists within the Office of Science and Technology  Policy. The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy is  required to establish a blockchain and cryptocurrency advisory  specialist position within the Office to advise the President on  matters related to blockchain and cryptocurrencies.   OSTP advises the President and others within the Executive Office of  the President on the scientific, engineering, and technological aspects  of the economy, national security, homeland security, health, foreign  relations, and the environment. It is critical to create such a  position within OSTP to ensure there is a policy expert capable of  advising the President and others within the Executive Office on these  issues of growing national importance.   Madam Speaker, there is more because we have the Restoring Resilient  Reefs Act, which passed through our Committee on Natural Resources to  reauthorize the Coral Reef Conservation Act, the CRCA, which expired  nearly 15 years ago. It maintains the NOAA coral reef program while  also introducing overdue improvements to coral management and  restoration efforts and giving new, innovative tools to States,  territories, Tribes, communities, and universities, partners who are  closest to this crisis.                                time  1845    We know that the Great Florida Reef is in danger, and we are doing  everything we can to restore it. This is critical to our recreation, to  clean water, to protect habitat, and to tourism.   A few of the provisions included in the Restoring Resilient Reefs  Act, a bipartisan bill that passed unanimously out of the Natural  Resources Committee, include a 5-year authorization, with the explicit  focus on restoration activities where natural disasters and human  activities have degraded reef ecosystems. This program is currently  funded at $33 million for 2021, but without further direction from  Congress.   It creates a block grant program where States and territories can  receive Federal matching funds for the prior year's coral expenditures  provided they have an action plan in place, so we are getting action  plans in place which will incentivize, increase State and local  investment in coral reef management capacity.   We are also helping intergovernmental partnerships that are key for  water infrastructure upgrades, pollution mitigation efforts, and  regrowing reefs. It allows for the formation of public-private  partnerships for coral management called Coral Reef Stewardship  Partnerships. Public-private partnerships are critical for sharing  research.   It also authorizes the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force to ensure States,  territories, and other stakeholders continue to have a voice in U.S.  coral reef management. Public feedback is essential.   It establishes a single streamlined set of guidelines for action  plans to implement the national strategy, with maximum flexibility  given to State and local authorities. These action plans will focus  restoration efforts more effectively. They also allow for emergency  grants and emergency funds for coral disasters. This is critical for  hurricane-prone areas like Florida and will assist with hurricanes,  typhoons, tsunamis, as well as oil spills, and other major pollution  events.   We thank all House Members who supported this for its inclusion,  along with these technological amendments, these coral reef provisions  in this essential piece of legislation that allows us to compete in the  21st century.   It is in the name, Madam Speaker, and together we are going to get  this done.
