 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the National Museum of the  American Latino Act.   The Latino community has and continues to play a pivotal role in the  growth and success of the United States. For hundreds of years, Latinos  have been at the forefront of the fight for justice, equality, and  opportunity, breaking barriers and advancing rights for all Americans.   In Orange County, in the 1940s, five Mexican-American families  challenged school segregation. In the landmark case of Mendez v.  Westminster, they paved the way for desegregating schools in  California. It influenced the historic Brown v. Board of Education  ruling 7 years later.   People should know this story. From education to science and politics  to art, Latinos and Latinas have been pioneers, leaders, innovators,  and game changers. Latino history is American history.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank Representative Serrano for championing  this cause. It deserves a place on The National Mall.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in support of the  National Museum of the American Latino Act.
