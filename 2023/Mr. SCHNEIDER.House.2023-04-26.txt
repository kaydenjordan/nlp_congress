 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this  unserious bill that cuts lifesaving and life-sustaining programs, hurts  our economy, guts historic action on climate change, and needlessly  adds to our deficit by carving out loopholes for the wealthy.   The Republicans' cut, slash, and shrink default on America bill will  devastate America. First, it guts the landmark Inflation Reduction Act,  which is not only addressing inflation but is the largest ever effort  in our Nation's history to combat climate change and lower the cost of  prescription drugs.   Second, it grows the already large tax gap and irresponsibly adds to  the deficit. The bill, seemingly with bad intention, guts tools at the  IRS to be both more responsive to responsible taxpayers and stronger in  the face of wealthy tax cheats.   Finally, this bill would make extreme cuts to discretionary spending,  cuts that could amount to as much as 59 percent by the year 2025.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record this report from the Center on  Budget and Policy Priorities titled: ``Roundup: Analyzing Speaker  McCarthy's Harmful Debt-Ceiling-and-Cuts Bill.''      [From the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Apr. 26, 2023]    Roundup: Analyzing Speaker McCarthy's Harmful Debt-Ceiling-and-Cuts                                    Bill                                 (By CBPP)         Last week, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy released a debt-      ceiling-and-cuts bill that would use the need to raise the       debt ceiling as a bargaining chip to force a set of       unpopular, harmful policies. We've collected our analyses of       the bill here:        McCarthy Bill Uses Debt Ceiling to Force Harmful Policies,       Deep Cuts. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's debt-ceiling-and-      cuts bill puts the U.S. economy at grave risk by using the       need to raise the debt ceiling as a bargaining chip to force       a set of unpopular, harmful policies--policies that would       make deep cuts in a host of national priorities; leave more       people hungry, homeless, and without health coverage; and       make it easier for wealthy people to cheat on their taxes.       The bill would also repeal the Inflation Reduction Act's       funding to address climate change and would undertake harmful       changes that would undermine how regulations are crafted . .       .        CBPP President Sharon Parrott tweeted about the ten years       of deep cuts that the bill would exact in exchange for       raising the debt ceiling. Parrott also detailed our cross-      cutting analysis of the bill.        Vital Government Services Would Take a $3.6 Trillion Hit in       McCarthy Bill. The bill containing House Republicans' demands       for raising the debt ceiling would impose severe cuts       amounting to $3.6 trillion over the next ten years, along       with the many other harmful changes it would make. The       funding cuts would hit a wide swath of vital programs and       would grow from bad to beyond extreme--reaching between 24       and 59 percent in 2033, depending on whether programs such as       defense and veterans' medical care are protected from cuts,       as many House Republicans propose . . .        David Reich tweeted about the cuts to annual appropriations       in the bill. Michael Leachman explained the bill would make       deep cuts to discretionary federal aid to  [[Page H2033]]       states, local governments, tribal nations, and U.S.       Territories, and his analysis included a state-by-state       table. And Zoe Neuberger pointed out that the bill includes       billions in cuts that would harm families with low incomes,       including WIC participants.        McCarthy Medicaid Proposal Puts Millions of People in       Expansion States at Risk of Losing Health Coverage. A       Republican proposal led by Speaker Kevin McCarthy would take       Medicaid coverage away from people who do not meet new work-      reporting requirements. The proposal would apply to all       states, but in practice it would heavily impact people       covered by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Medicaid expansion.       Of this group, more than 10 million people in Medicaid       expansion states would be at significant risk of losing       coverage under the McCarthy proposal. This group would be       subject to the new Medicaid requirement, and they are not       part of a group that states could readily identify in       existing data sources and exclude from burdensome reporting.       The McCarthy proposal could jeopardize coverage for millions       more, by prompting some states to drop the ACA Medicaid       expansion or dissuading states that have not yet taken the       expansion from adopting it . . .        Gideon Lukens tweeted state-by-state numbers of Medicaid       expansion enrollees whose coverage would be at risk under the       McCarthy proposal. Lukens also tweeted the Department of       Health and Human Services' estimates of Medicaid enrollees at       risk of losing coverage under the bill. Sarah Lueck tweeted       about the Congressional Budget Office's estimate of Medicaid       coverage loss.        Taking Medicaid Away for Not Meeting a Work-Reporting       Requirement Would Keep People From Health Care. Led by       Speaker Kevin McCarthy, congressional Republicans have       revived harmful proposals to cut federal spending on the       Medicaid program--the Nation's single largest source of       health coverage--by taking Medicaid away from people not       meeting new work-reporting requirements. Adding such       requirements to Medicaid would cause many low-income adults       to lose coverage due to bureaucratic hurdles that don't       reflect the complexity of people's circumstances, as failed       experiments in several states show. These requirements would       leave people without the health care they need, including       life-saving medications, treatment to manage chronic       conditions, and care for acute illnesses.        Laura Harker tweeted about how the bill would resurrect       this failed policy.        Speaker McCarthy's SNAP Proposal Would Take Food Away From       Older Adults for Not Meeting Work Requirements. Speaker       McCarthy's bill would expand SNAP's already harsh policy that       takes food assistance away from many people aged 18 through       49 who don't have children at home and can't secure an       exemption. Such individuals can receive SNAP for only three       months (in a 36-month period) if they don't document that       they meet a 20-hour-per-week work requirement. The bill would       expand that policy to include people aged 50 through 55.       About 1 million such individuals participate in SNAP and meet       those criteria in a typical month. (The figure was 900,000 in       2019, the most recent year for which a full year of data are       available. A larger number participate in SNAP over the       course of a year.)        Ty Jones Cox tweeted about how the bill would worsen SNAP's       work requirements.        TANF Provisions in McCarthy Bill Give States Incentives to       Take Cash Benefits Away From Families With the Most       Significant Needs. The Temporary Assistance for Needy       Families (TANF) provisions in Speaker McCarthy's bill double       down on TANF's already expansive, rigid, and ineffective work       requirements. The bill would so severely limit states'       flexibility in how they provide assistance and employment       services to families with children that some states could       decide to stop providing cash aid to large numbers of       families, with devastating results.        Aditi Shrivastava tweeted about how the bill would further       restrict TANF's reach.        Samantha Jacoby explained that the bill's proposal to       rescind the Inflation Reduction Act's IRS funding would add       to the deficit because it would let wealthy tax cheats off       the hook. Jacoby also noted that while giving billions to       high-income tax cheats, the bill would take health care,       food, and cash assistance away from people who need it.
