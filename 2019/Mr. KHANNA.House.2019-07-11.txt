 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, this amendment is an historic effort of  bipartisan spirit to finally have peace with North Korea after over 69  years of conflict.   Regardless of whoever is President, diplomacy is the key to the  region.   The Congressional Research Service tells us that, in the first few  minutes of any war in North Korea, as many as 500,000 civilians could  perish, many of them Americans. And, if the conflict went nuclear,  millions would perish.   No one has done more for peace in the subcontinent, in North Korea,  than President Carter. President Carter went and met with Kim Jong Un's  grandfather in 1994 and came up with a framework for denuclearization.  He recently had a constructive conversation with President Trump, and  President Trump has taken efforts to seek dialogue there.   I believe that we can have a three-part framework to reaching such an  agreement that President Carter had outlined with Kim Jong Un's  grandfather.   First, we need to have a nonaggression pact to assure the North  Koreans that we do not have any interest in regime change and have a  permanent peace. I believe, if we do that, Kim Jong Un will engage in  significant denuclearization.   And we should have no relaxation of any sanctions until there is at  least 90 percent denuclearization, which is achievable. And, after the  denuclearization, we can have flexible sanctions with clapback  provisions.   The point is, this doesn't have to be partisan. It is in our Nation's  interest to seek peace. I, for one, will support the administration's  efforts to seek peace, and I appreciate that this House, in a  bipartisan way, will go on record saying that we need a permanent peace  agreement with North Korea.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, this will be the most important foreign  policy vote in the United States Congress. This bipartisan amendment  makes it clear that the Congress appropriates zero funding for any  offensive war in Iran or another war by choice.   The Supreme Court has made it clear that when Congress limits funding  for a war, Congress' power, not the executive power, is at its peak.  And when this amendment passes, it will be a clear statement for  Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle that this country is  tired of endless wars; that we do not want another war in the Middle  East.   I will make one final point before I yield to my colleagues. The  other side, and people will argue, that this may limit our ability to  respond to an attack on the United States or our allies. That is a  patent lie.   Nothing in this amendment limits the President of the United States  from doing anything that he needs to do to defend the United States of  America or our allies as he is authorized under the War Powers Act.   What this will prevent is another trillion-dollar war in the Middle  East. Frankly, what it will prevent is what this President promised the  American people not to do, to get into another endless, costly war in  the Middle East.   Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Gaetz), the bipartisan cosponsor of the amendment.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, we are going to have eight more speakers  because this was such a collaborative effort, so I hope the speakers  will limit themselves to 1 minute or less so we can get everyone in.   I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Smith), our  distinguished chair, who did more to bring this amendment together than  anyone.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Brown), who is a colonel in the Army, was a colonel in  the Army, and was helpful from day one in crafting this.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Connecticut (Mr. Himes), who led 100-plus Members in a letter opposing  the war with Iran.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Eshoo), my good friend who has led this bill in the  House that prevents funding for a war with Iran.    Madam Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. Moulton), a veteran who was in four tours of duty and fought  against the Iranians in his second tour in Iraq.    Madam Chair, how much time do I have remaining?    Madam Chair, I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Crow), a leading veteran voice, who has been helpful in  getting many veterans groups on board with this.    Madam Chair, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Levin), who has an important bill clarifying the 2001- 2002 AUMF.                                time  2115     Madam Chair, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee), for her work on asserting Congress' authority  over war and peace.    Madam Chair, how much time do I have remaining?    Madam Chair, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from  New Mexico (Ms. Haaland), one of the new leaders on HASC who has been  very, very helpful on this amendment.    Madam Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) for a closing argument.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
