 Mr. Speaker, schools aren't battle zones, but Iranian  students are caught in the crossfire.   In recent months, a chain of chemical attacks have hit Iran's  schools. Although the motive is unclear, girls and young women have  been the clear target. Hundreds of schoolgirls have been poisoned, and  an 11-year-old was killed.   As a mother, I share the anger and frustration of every parent too  fearful to send their kids to class.   Iranians deserve answers and accountability, but their government  remains silent. The regime cares more about covering up these attacks  than stopping them. Iranian authorities have falsified medical reports  and spread disinformation. They have even intimidated parents of  victims to keep their stories from the press.   I stand with these parents demanding a full investigation and a quick  end to these attacks. The United States must stand with them and every  Iranian demanding a future free of violence.                            ____________________
