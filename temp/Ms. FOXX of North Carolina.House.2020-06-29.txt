 Madam Speaker, Smith Reynolds Airport,  located in North Carolina's Fifth District, is set to be designated as  North Carolina's first legacy airport.   Originally named Miller Municipal Field in 1927, the airport was soon  renamed in 1942 after the Z. Smith Reynolds Foundation made a donation  to the airport.   Madam Speaker, since its inception, the airport has served as an Army  Corps facility and was the birthplace for Piedmont Airlines, the legacy  carrier that merged with US Airways.   Madam Speaker, with this designation on the horizon, I am confident  that the airport will continue to be a vital component of the community  and that North Carolina's aviation sector will continue to grow and  contribute to our State's vibrant economy.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1425, the so-called  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement Act, the latest in a  series of attempts by House Democrats to score cheap political points  at the expense of hardworking taxpayers.   And speaking of scoring cheap political points, I think most of my  colleagues and I are tired of having words put in our mouths that  aren't there. We do not oppose reducing the cost of drugs. We want  that. We don't believe it is a bad thing.   At a time when Congress should be united in our continued fight  against the novel coronavirus and ensuring the country can reopen  safely, we are instead here today debating a bill that amounts to  nothing more than political posturing. Rather than solve any pressing  healthcare problems, including the Nation's response to the COVID-19  pandemic, this misguided legislation will limit healthcare options for  patients, contribute to already skyrocketing healthcare costs, and  double down on the many failures of the Affordable Care Act or the ACA.   As the Republican leader of the Committee on Education and Labor, I  am committed to improving and enhancing employer-sponsored healthcare  options for American workers and their families.   Yet today, we are debating legislation that would enlarge ObamaCare  even further by providing subsidies for some of the wealthiest  Americans, providing a blank check bailout for insurance companies,  strong-arming States into expanding Medicaid, and eliminating lower  cost healthcare options like short-term, limited-duration insurance  plans.   Short-term insurance plans offer healthcare options for Americans who  might find themselves between jobs or unable to afford rising premiums  in the already expensive individual market. What is astonishing to me  is that Democrats conveniently failed to mention that these short-term,  limited-duration plans were legal under the Obama administration and  that States still have the authority to regulate these plans.    As Republicans, we believe in federalism. If States choose to limit  or prohibit the sale of these plans, they are free to do so. Instead of  respecting the judgment of State lawmakers and local authorities to act  in their States' and constituents' best interest, House Democrats are  doubling down on a one-size-fits-all Federal mandate.   As we have seen over and over again, Washington-knows-best  requirements simply do not work. In the case of the ill-advised  legislation before us today, Federally dictated policies will only lead  to fewer choices and higher premiums.   Additionally, House Democrats have missed the mark with H.R. 1425  when it comes to COBRA notices for millions of workers.   While there is room for improvement in this area, such as increasing  transparency and allowing consumers to decide which plans work best for  them, Democrats are instead blocking consumer access to information  about other forms of valued coverage options outside of the ACA.                                time  1245    Just when you thought it couldn't get worse, the blatantly political  bill we are considering today incorporates Speaker Pelosi's socialist  drug-pricing scheme to cover up the hundreds of billions of dollars  this government healthcare expansion would cost American taxpayers.   The rising costs of prescription drugs is an issue that resonates  with everyone in this Chamber. Seventy percent of Americans consider  reducing the price of prescription drugs to be a top priority, and they  are looking to us, their elected representatives, to get the job done  to get drug prices under control.   That is why Congress started a collaborative effort and bipartisan  process last year to tackle this issue. Unfortunately, this bipartisan  collaboration was abruptly cut short by Speaker Pelosi's introduction  of H.R. 3, which was written in secret without Member input or the  regular committee process.   Lowering drug costs should not be a partisan issue, yet the  underlying partisan, socialist provisions in H.R. 3 are included in the  legislation before us today.   Democrats are well aware that H.R. 3 will never become law. Senate  Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said it will go nowhere in the  Senate, and President Trump has said he will veto the bill if it comes  to his desk.   Still, House Democrats continue to waste time during an unprecedented  health and economic crisis on legislation that will die after House  passage.   Their socialist drug-pricing scheme is nothing more than a leftwing  downpayment on a government-run healthcare system that would eliminate  private insurance and implement government-controlled rationing of  prescription drugs.   As I have said many times before, governments don't negotiate; they  dictate. The Democrats' radical drug-pricing scheme will eliminate  choice and competition and jeopardize innovation, investment, and  access to future cures. And we are considering this at a time when we  are in the process of developing treatments and a vaccine for COVID-19.   This type of unprecedented government interference in private market  negotiations and substantial increase in regulatory red tape proves one  thing: The Democrat Party is being held hostage by their most radical  leftwing Members.   The American people deserve better from Congress than the socialist  drug-pricing scheme in the bill before us today. They deserve a real  solution that will lower the cost of prescription drugs without  jeopardizing access to new treatments and cures.   That is why House Republicans have introduced H.R. 19, the Lower  Costs, More Cures Act. This bill contains bipartisan, bicameral  measures, and it can become law this year. Specifically, H.R. 19 will  help lower out-of-pocket costs, protect access to new medicines and  cures, strengthen transparency and accountability, and champion  competition.   Yet, House Democrats are ignoring this bipartisan, commonsense  legislation. Clearly, they prefer politics over progress.   Madam Speaker, I am deeply disappointed that we are here today  debating yet another partisan ploy from my colleagues on the other side  of the aisle. There are bipartisan solutions to many pressing issues at  our fingertips, including continuing to fight the COVID-19 pandemic,  but Speaker Pelosi and her Democrat colleagues continue to turn their  backs on bipartisan legislation to help the American people, and that  is truly shameful.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Keller).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Murphy).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Bishop).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Byrne).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg).    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  distinguished gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. David P. Roe).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Smucker).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of  time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of  time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   Madam Speaker, propagandists have said that if one repeats a lie  often enough, people will soon believe the lie and not the truth. My  colleagues are entitled to their own opinion but not to their own facts  or rewriting history.   I want to repeat some comments from my Texas colleague, Mr. Brady,  who spoke earlier in this debate.   Republicans support children, seniors, and patients with preexisting  conditions.   Republicans created the popular Children's Health Insurance Program  that millions of families rely on today.  [[Page H2641]]    Republicans created the prescription drug program in Medicare to help  seniors get the medicine they need.   Republicans created the first law that established protection for  patients with preexisting conditions. That law, passed in 1996, is the  Health Insurance and Portability Act of 1996.   We want people to have access to high-quality, affordable healthcare  that fits their needs and make their own choices, not what Speaker  Pelosi demands for them.   Madam Speaker, the devastating effects of COVID-19 are still being  felt across our Nation, yet today Democrats are spending time pushing a  deeply flawed, partisan bill that is being used to score cheap  political points instead of working on bipartisan solutions like  lowering drug costs, ending surprise billing, and getting our economy  back on its feet.   We are left with H.R. 1425, a radical bill which will limit  healthcare choices, increase costs, and double down on the failures of  the Affordable Care Act. No innovation, investment, or solutions, just  more of the failed status quo from House Democrats, which will go  nowhere after the vote today.   Contrary to what Speaker Pelosi said, Democrats do not and cannot, in  this bill, guarantee affordability of healthcare. What they do  guarantee is government control with rationing, fewer cures, and less  freedom for Americans. Republicans believe in just the opposite.   Madam Speaker, I strongly urge a ``no'' vote on H.R. 1425, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
