 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule and the  underlying bill, H.R. 5.   I look around this Chamber, and I think that arguably I have spent  more time in a classroom than anyone in this Chamber. I was a classroom  teacher for 15 years. I ran before and afterschool programs and summer  programs. I led programs for parent engagement. I am also the mother of  four children. One of them is a public school student right now. As a  teacher and a parent, I know that parent-teacher partnerships are  critical to student success.   I know that when a teacher can reach out to parents and discuss  challenging curriculum and come up with strategies to support their  child, students thrive. I know that when parents can reach out to their  child's teacher and ask questions and voice their concerns, or even  more, offer their personal perspectives, students benefit.  [[Page H1343]]    But this bill does not do that. It does not promote parent-teacher  partnerships. It just creates division in our schools at a time when  both parents and teachers need all the help they can get.   I have served on curriculum committees, and it is a requirement that  there be a parent representative on those committees. These are the  committees that select the books that will be read in classes. Teachers  don't arbitrarily do that. I have addressed my local board of  education. There was always time for public comment, and parents were  encouraged to join. Parents of varying opinions were asked to show up  and give their input on what we were doing in our schools.   I have gone to a student's home because their parents could not  attend a parent-teacher conference, but I knew that they cared deeply  about their child and wanted to have conversations with me. So after  school, on my own time, I reached out to connect with those parents.  That is what teachers do.   All of this misguided direction is from people on the floor who have  very little information about what actually happens on the ground  level. During COVID it wasn't that teachers were exposed and parents  got an inside look at what happens in classrooms. The best teachers are  always inviting parents into the classroom.    Mr. Speaker, in our 16-hour markup, committee Democrats  offered strategies for parent engagement. We offered amendments to  provide videoconferences so parents could be involved, and we offered  legislation to say that kids should have healthy meals in school so  that they would be ready to learn. Every single one of them was  rejected.   This politics over parents legislation creates unnecessary reporting  requirements in our schools and diverts resources.   I am a parent, and this bill actually removes my rights as a parent  at the local level and places them in the hands of Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill  and listen to what parents are saying. They are saying that they want  diverse curriculum, diverse books, teachers who are highly qualified  and prepared, and for all students, not just some, but all.    Madam Chair, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 5, the  politics over parents act.   One of the most dangerous provisions of this bill is the banning of  books. Across our Nation, books that illustrate our rich history and  our diversity are being pulled from library shelves. According to PEN  American's ``Index of School Book Bans,'' of the 2,500 books banned  last year, 41 percent of these books explicitly address LGBTQ themes,  and 40 percent contain prominent characters of color.   My colleagues across the aisle say that nothing in this legislation  will ban books or censor libraries. If this is true, I invite them to  support my amendment, which ensures this legislation will not go into  effect until the Comptroller General of the United States can confirm  that the bill will not lead to censorship or banning books for children  or affect learning outcomes for students.   Throughout history, the voices of women, persons of color, and  members of the LGBTQ community have been suppressed. Their voices,  experiences, and stories have been labeled controversial, oversexual,  and even un-American.   As a teacher, you do not get to pick the parts of history you deem  worthy to teach. When I was a teacher, I told the entire story  honestly, the good and the bad, and gave students the tools that they  needed to participate in their communities in a conscientious and  productive way.   I will tell you a personal story. My son is currently reading ``To  Kill a Mockingbird,'' one of the books on this list of banned books. In  his initial observation of this book, he said: ``Mom, they use the n- word a lot.'' I mean, a lot, and I don't like it, but it opened the  door to broader conversations between me and my son about segregation  and Jim Crow laws, and it led him to ask some very difficult questions  of me.   In his final observation of Harper Lee's novel, he said: ``But yet  and still, Atticus Finch defended Tom Robinson.'' Through this complex  story, his takeaway was not hateful, hurtful, or angry. It was that,  even then, good people existed.   That is what books do. That is how kids learn, not through  censorship.   Teachers do not have the autonomy to indoctrinate students.  Everything we are talking about here today is already published.  Budgets are public. Curriculums are public. Parents are marching in,  being a part of our classes.   When I was introduced by the ranking member, he mentioned that I was  the National Teacher of the Year. That doesn't happen without parent- teacher partnerships.   This bill will not improve educational outcomes. This bill caters to  a small group of individuals who seek to impose their world views on  entire school districts, on my child.   Madam Chair, I strongly encourage my colleagues to oppose this bill,  and I include in the Record the text of my amendment.        Mrs. Hayes of Connecticut moves to recommit the bill H.R. 5       to the Committee on Education and the Workforce with       instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith,       with the following amendment:        Add at the end the following:                         TITLE VII--EFFECTIVE DATE       SEC. 701. EFFECTIVE DATE.         This Act, and the amendments made by this Act, shall not       take effect until the Comptroller General of the United       States--        (1) makes a determination that this Act will not--        (A) result in the banning or censorship of books for       children attending public elementary and secondary schools;       or        (B) negatively affect learning outcomes for such children;       and        (2) submits notice of such determination to Congress.
