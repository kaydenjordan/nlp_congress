 Mr. Chair, I rise in support of en bloc  amendments No. 2.   I thank Chairman Rogers for including this proposal, and many others,  to amend the provision related to former military land in Culebra,  which is an island in the archipelago of Puerto Rico, an island  municipality to the east of the main island.   In the Military Construction Authorization Act of 1974, some of these  lands were transferred for recreational and nature reserve uses.  However, this amendment would allow agencies like the Army Corps of  Engineers the flexibility to determine and execute environmental  cleaning efforts on the island of Culebra to fulfill those recreational  and natural reserve uses when it is needed.   Mr. Chair, I urge the House to support the amendment and the en bloc  package.
