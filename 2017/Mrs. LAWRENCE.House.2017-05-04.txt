 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my opposition to  this horrible bill, and I include in the Record a letter in opposition  from the Children's Hospital Association.                                Children's Hospital Association,                                     Washington, DC, March 15, 2017.      Hon. Orrin Hatch,      Chairman, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Ron Wyden,      Ranking Member, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Frank Pallone,      Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairmen Hatch and Walden: On behalf of our nation's       children's hospitals and the patients and families they       serve, we believe the American Health Care Act (AHCA) in its       current form is a setback to child health on a national       level. Over 30 million children receive their health care       coverage through Medicaid. The legislation as written  [[Page H4147]]       cuts the budget, coverage, and benefits for the care for       children, many of whom have significant health care needs,       including children with disabilities.        Children's hospitals have identified several provisions in       the AHCA that create serious concerns about the bill as       passed by the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Foremost       among these concerns is that the bill would cut the health       care budget for children by converting the Medicaid program       to a per-capita cap system beginning in 2020. This limits       future funding for the states and risks significant       reductions in the Medicaid budgets providing care for over 30       million children. The current Medicaid entitlement financing       structure allows for greater certainty for children in the       Medicaid program and shifting to a capped environment risks       undermining the current health care available to children.        We are alarmed children's health care financing is not       considered and protected in the AHCA, and that children are       exposed to equal funding risk in the Congressional Budget       Office (CBO) estimates that AHCA will reduce overall Medicaid       funding by $880 billion or 25%. Medicaid is the largest payer       for children's health care in the nation and cuts of this       magnitude will have a severe negative impact on children's       health care. There are also discrete program changes       envisioned in the AHCA posing detrimental effects to       children's access to health care. Eligibility policy changes       in the bill risk reducing or delaying access to Medicaid       coverage. We are concerned by CBO's projections that Medicaid       enrollment will substantially decrease under the AHCA and the       absence of information on the impact on children specifically       suggests that additional examination of these issues is       needed.        We support maintaining Medicaid as an entitlement for       children as well as retaining essential elements of the       program. Every child in America should have access to high       quality health care and Medicaid is critical to this aim.       Research shows providing Medicaid coverage for children is a       smart investment for the nation, resulting in better health       outcomes for children into their adult lives and bringing       long-term returns for the country.        Children's hospitals cannot support any bill that does not       safeguard funding, coverage and benefits for children. With       respect to the AHCA, we call on lawmakers to protect kids and       recommend, at a minimum, the following:        We must not cut funding for children's care under a per       capita cap. Children are already funded at the lowest per       beneficiary levels, and ensuring sufficient funding for       children's health care into the future is absolutely       essential. Accomplishing this under the current proposal       requires clear identification of spending for all children,       including those eligible based on disability, and exempting       funds spent on children from a ``claw back'' on any spending       that exceeds per capita cap target expenditures. We believe       spending on all children should be protected from recoupment       in the following year. This is critical to ensuring states do       not have incentives to restrict children's access to       medically necessary care.        Ensure all funding for children, including blind and       disabled children, is clearly identified. Accurate       information on Medicaid spending is vital to evaluating the       program's effectiveness for children and holding states       accountable for the delivery of services. We believe all       children, including blind and disabled children, should be       included in a single children's 1903A enrollee category and       the per capita cap for children should be adjusted       accordingly to reflect the higher expenses of children with       disabilities. Children are a separate and distinct population       from adults. Funding dedicated to children must be       identifiable, allowing for an accurate picture of the federal       and state investment in kids. This is an important part of       ensuring accountability and the availability of sufficient       resources to address children's health care needs. We believe       it is important to consider protections preventing diversion       of resources specifically intended for children. As we work       with state governments to innovate and improve care delivery,       the nation's pediatric providers are in a better position to       help states achieve their goals if all kids are in a common       eligibility category.        Continue requirements that all children receive pediatric-      specific benefits providing medically necessary care       determined by their physicians. The current Medicaid       structure includes important protections for all children and       ensures they have access to medically-necessary care. It is       essential that Congress includes language guaranteeing       continued access to pediatric-specific services provided       under the Early and Periodic Screening Diagnostic and       Treatment (EPSDT) benefit.        Maintain Medicaid coverage levels for children and protect       them from potential loss of coverage or delays in       eligibility. Changes to eligibility, such as ending       hospitals' ability to make presumptive eligibility       determinations, limiting retroactive coverage, or reducing       children's Medicaid mandatory eligibility levels, directly       risk children's coverage and should not be included.        Remove the provision in the bill eliminating hospital       presumptive eligibility authority. Hospital presumptive       eligibility authority allows hospitals to temporarily enroll       children, pregnant women, and other individuals in Medicaid       until their full enrollment determination can be made. This       means earlier access to needed care for Medicaid eligible       children.        Remove the provision in the bill repealing the ability of       states to provide retroactive eligibility up to three months       prior to the month of application, as allowed under current       law. Ensuring retroactive coverage of benefits under Medicaid       is very important for children, especially children with       complex medical conditions. Without this provision, it will       be challenging for families who incur high levels of expense       prior to their Medicaid-eligible child being enrolled in the       program.        Remove the provision in the bill reducing mandatory       eligibility levels for children age 6-18 from 133 percent of       federal poverty level (FPL) to 100 percent of FPL. All other       children are required to be covered by Medicaid up to 133       percent of the FPL.        Thank you again for the opportunity to provide comment on       this legislation. We look forward to working with you in this       Congress to at least maintain the benefits children have       today, and to hopefully strengthen health care for children       into the future.            Very best regards,                                                  Mark Wietecha,                                                  President and CEO,                                   Children's Hospital Association.
