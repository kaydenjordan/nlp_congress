 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I am here because I am absolutely shocked  at what happened on this floor a little while ago, and I am going to  try to convey to my colleagues a sense of the urgency that, I think,  this moment demands and that they, apparently, don't understand because  our Democratic colleagues all voted to prevent us from considering this  legislation. So let me start with the context within which we are  operating because it is unbelievable. I wouldn't think I would need to  go through this.   Just to be clear, we have been invaded by a potentially lethal  species--a virus that is infecting Americans now by the tens of  thousands. It is growing in numbers every day. It is killing Americans,  including in my State. We have infected people in every single one of  our States, and the numbers are growing rapidly. In response to this  threat, we have been taking progressively more serious measures because  of the degree of the danger that we fear--the disaster, the illness,  the death--if we don't try to stop this virus. We have gone to an  extreme that I will just candidly acknowledge that I never could have  imagined.   What I am talking about is, among other things, the fact that my  State of Pennsylvania and many other States across America are closed.  I could never have imagined my even putting that sentence together. My  State is closed. What does that even mean? I will tell you what it  means. It means it is not legal to operate a business in Pennsylvania.  It is not legal to go to work in the morning. Tomorrow morning, at 8  o'clock, there will only be a very small percentage of Pennsylvanians  who will even be allowed to go to work. We have shut down the State. I  am not talking about restaurants and bars and nightclubs. I am talking  about all businesses except those deemed essential and a very small  handful of others. I am talking about  [[Page S1912]]  factories, distribution centers, warehouses--all kinds of producers,  manufacturers, and services. Across the board, it is closed.   What does that mean? It means an awful lot of things, but the most  important thing it means is that the guy who wakes up tomorrow morning  and can't go to work, what is he supposed to do? How is he going to  support his family? It is not that he doesn't want to get a paycheck.  It is not that he doesn't want to go to work--he is not allowed. He is  going to have no income pretty soon because--guess what--the company  that he works for is not allowed to have any sales. It is closed by  order of the government. It is not just in Pennsylvania. This is in, I  think, more than half of all of our States at this point--more than  half of the country--and the number is growing every day.   So this guy, like almost everybody across my State--men and women--is  beside himself. They are all terrified because they know that they  still have to put food on the table; that they still have to pay the  rent or a mortgage; that they still have to clothe their kids; that  they still have all of the ordinary expenses of living and are not  allowed to earn a living because of the extreme measures we are taking  to try to avoid an absolute catastrophe with this disease.   That is why so many of us in this body have worked so hard for  several weeks now--but very, very intensively in these last few days-- to try to deal with this fact that we have a potentially lethal threat  and an economy that is disappearing. I mean, literally, the bottom has  fallen out--it is going away--and that is enormously devastating to the  people we represent. So, quite sensibly, we have said we need to focus  on these individuals first--the men and women, the families--who are,  as I said, terrified and understandably.   So what did we do?   Last week, we passed a bill that went right at, first and foremost,  the people most directly affected by this. Paid medical leave at full  salary for a couple weeks, paid leave thereafter, paid family leave if  you are looking after someone who is affected by this, including if it  is your kids because they can't go to school because the schools are  also closed.   But that wasn't all we did. We also bumped up the Federal share of  our Medicaid Program--the program that pays for healthcare for low- income and poor people. We increased the share that the Federal  Government would pay for that.   We increased food stamps. We were trying to find ways, and we did,  and we passed it. It was an overwhelming bipartisan vote. That is done.  That was last week.   But we recognized that that is not enough under these circumstances  because things just keep getting worse. So we took up the bill that we  put on the Senate floor today. This had huge section sections designed  also to help these individuals, these families, these men and women who  just can't even go to work.   One of the things we did was we made the unemployment insurance  program much more generous. We dramatically increased the payments that  you are able to get if you are unemployed because we realize there are  going to be huge numbers of people who are not legally allowed to be  employed, in a way. So several hundred dollars a week or more above and  beyond what is already there is in this bill that our Democratic  colleagues voted against. Several hundred dollars of additional  payments every week to someone who is unemployed.   But that is not all we did for individuals. We recognize it is going  to take a little while for those changes to work their way through the  system. So we said, What is the fastest thing we can do to get money in  the hands of these poor folks who are wondering how they are going to  make the next car payment. What we did is we said we are going to send  a check in the mail, that is what we are going to do, to low- and  middle-income wage earners, a significant check. How significant?  Twelve hundred dollars per adult. So a married couple would get $2,400,  plus $500 for any children they have. A married couple with three kids  living anywhere in America who are wage earners who have middle or low  income, they get $3,900--$3,900. That is the check that would be  arriving in a couple of weeks. If the check doesn't get there, let me  just make it clear why. It is because our Democratic colleagues voted  no. They voted against sending that check. We thought that was  important to get that in the hands of the people who need it.   But that is not all we did. We also felt like we don't really solve  this problem until we defeat the virus. We have a healthcare issue at  the heart of this. We recognize that. So we have all kinds of  provisions in this bill, and many of the provisions were priorities of  our Democratic colleagues because this was a bipartisan process from  the beginning, they know that, like the plan to boost unemployment  insurance.   By the way, not just the payments were increased, but we expanded  eligibility. We allowed people to qualify for unemployment insurance  who, in the past, have not qualified--people like self-employed folks  who historically have never qualified for unemployment. Under this  bill, the one our Democratic colleagues voted against, they would have  qualified.   But as I say, we also focused on healthcare, and some of the things-- I mean, a 20-percent increase virtually across the board for Medicare  payments to hospitals. Do you know why? Hospitals are in trouble.   One of the reasons hospitals are in trouble is they had to decide to  discontinue elective procedures. So those surgeries that you would like  to have but they are not absolutely essential, they are not happening.   Well, that is how the hospitals pay the bills, those kinds of  procedures. They are not happening because they need to keep the beds  available for a potential surge, if it should happen, in coronavirus  victims.   So we recognized that with a 20-percent increase virtually across the  board for Medicare.   Big expansion in telehealth. Why is that important? So that you can  get the professional advice you need without having to show up in an  office and potentially infect a whole lot of other people. It is a no- brainer, right?   A lot of money for some of the materials that we need to do the  testing, tests themselves, money to create the swabs that are necessary  to get the sample to run the test, free tests--it is all in the bill,  the bill that our Democratic colleagues voted against.   And that is not all. We have $75 billion for hospitals in other forms  above and beyond the 20-percent increase in Medicare--$75 billion. I  can tell you for sure, every hospital in Pennsylvania wants that, needs  that. Actually, I know that is the case for hospitals all across  America, but our Democratic colleagues voted against sending $75  billion to our hospitals at a moment when they desperately need it.   Eleven billion dollars for vaccines and treatment. Look, this is the  ultimate solution, right? When we have an ability to treat this virus  so that if you are infected you are not really harmed because there is  a medicine that will take care of it, that is ultimately a really  important goal.   But we don't have that yet. We don't know what that is yet. We need  to fund the research and development of that medicine that will turn  this into a minor nuisance rather than a threat against our lives.   And how about vaccines? One day we will have a vaccine. I want that  day really, really soon. So we have got $11 billion in this bill to  accelerate the development of therapies and vaccines. That would be the  bill that our Democratic colleagues voted no on earlier today.   Five billion dollars for the FEMA Disaster Relief Fund because they  have all kinds of expenses they are incurring as they try to address  this.   Ten billion dollars to keep our airports open because they are not  getting the revenue that they normally get in the form of the taxes on  the ticket because nobody is flying. There are no flights; there are no  passengers; so there is no revenue. But we need to keep those airports  viable for the moment we can begin our restoration, our recovery. So we  have $10 billion there.   We have $20 billion for public transit. I have been hearing from the  folks who operate the public transit across Pennsylvania. They have the  same problem everyone else has in one form or another. They are  hemorrhaging cash because they are trying to pay their  [[Page S1913]]  workers, but they don't have the revenue coming in. So we have $20  billion to help out with the public transit, which is absolutely  essential in our big cities, but it is vital all across our country-- $20 billion. They voted against that.   So we focused on individuals and families, first and foremost. We  focused on what can we be doing, everything we can--many ideas from our  colleagues on the other side--about how we can improve our ability to  defeat this virus.    And yet there is another thing in this bill. The other thing in the  bill is to make sure there is a job to go back to for the men and women  who wake up tomorrow morning and don't have a job to go do. When this  finally passes, I think it would be a good idea if the company that has  been employing these folks still exists.   Now, how is that going to happen when they are not allowed to have  any revenue? They are closed. Well, we have developed a plan in this  bill to address this.   So it is really kind of two components. For small businesses, there  is a program that has the effect that, at the end of the day, the  Federal Government is going to pay for payroll for small business. That  is amazing when you think about that. Nobody has ever imagined this  before. The Federal Government is going to pay the payroll for small  businesses as long as they keep their employees on the payroll.   The mechanism is a loan, which they will use to make the payments,  and then they don't have to pay back the loan as long as they did, in  fact, keep their workers on the payroll.   So we have offered, in this bill, to pay to keep people on the  payroll of small business, and our Democratic friends voted no. No,  they didn't want that.   Now, for large businesses, we took a different approach. We said we  can't actually pay for the entire payroll of the entire American  workforce that is like 150 million people, but here is what we can do:  A big company, if it is solvent, if it is a viable business, but it is  in a cash crunch because--have I mentioned they are not allowed to have  sales; they are not allowed to have revenue; they have no customers, in  many cases, if they could. Think about the airlines; there is nobody  flying. Think of hotels; there is nobody staying in hotels. But it is  all across the entire economy. So what we did is we said: Look, if you  have a viable business, we are going to have a program where we are  going to lend you some short-term money because this should not last  long. You are going to have to pay it all back, but we want to keep you  alive--this employer--so that when this is behind us and when we no  longer have statewide shutdowns and when we are able to go back to work  and go back to producing and living normally, it would be really nice  if these employers still exist.   So that is what we created. The minority leader derisively called  that a bailout to explain his vote against this.   This is not a bailout. It is ridiculous to characterize it that way.  First of all, they have to pay back every dime that they borrow--every  dime. It is explicit in the bill, in the law, that there can be no  forgiveness. None of this can be written off. The companies that borrow  this money have to pay back every dime.   And let me stress, this is not their fault. OK? You are operating a  business somewhere in Pennsylvania, and the Governor says: By the way,  close your doors at 8 o'clock Monday morning, and you don't reopen them  until I say.   Now, look, I am not trying to attack my Governor. I understand why he  is doing this, but the point is, it is not possible for a business to  survive. And we are seeing this manifested, this sort of easy, visual  view on this that some of my colleagues have mentioned--our financial  markets because they reflect what the world thinks about the future of  our economy, and it is really, really grim.   Some have suggested maybe we shouldn't focus on that. That is not the  focus. That just gives us a reading of just how bad things have gotten,  and it is really bad. And when my Democratic colleagues came down here  and voted against all of these programs and all of these efforts to  rescue American workers and families, advance our fight against this  disease, and keep employers viable, I was just shocked. I just can't  believe that they would do that; that they would come down here--and I  can only conclude that they don't understand the urgency of this  moment.   I think they have to understand the nature of the disease, the  severity of the disease, what that is doing. Maybe there is a lack of  appreciation for the fact that at the same time our economy is being  destroyed--if they continue this obstruction, and they refuse to let us  pass this because they dismissively refer to keeping alive employers as  a ``bailout,'' then a lot of these companies will fail, and they will  not come back.   You don't just flip a switch and have a company that failed, that  went bankrupt, and think you are going to turn it back on. It doesn't  work that way. It could take years or decades to rebuild an economy,  and that means how many millions of Americans lose out on so much  opportunity, on so much of life.   That is what we can't let happen. We have to stop this as quickly as  we can, and that means, I am convinced, these three elements: focusing  on individuals who are adversely affected, and now that is virtually  everybody. We have done that. Done that massively. Unprecedented scale  in this bill. Focus on killing this virus, defeating this, developing  the therapies, the cures, the ability to treat, the hospital capacity-- it is in this bill. Look, there will be more to be done, but for now,  this is huge, and we got these ideas from Democrats and Republicans. We  put them in the bill. And then, finally, if it is a fundamentally  solvent business, just an extension of credit for a few months, a loan  that they have to pay back so that there is a reasonable chance they  will still be there.   This is exactly what this moment calls for. This is what we need to  do for our country. I am hoping our Democratic colleagues will,  frankly, come to their senses and conclude and understand that there is  no time for games here. This is getting worse by the day. We have to  act now. So I hope before the clock strikes midnight tonight, we will  vote in favor of cloture on the motion to proceed, the procedural vote  that allows us to pass this bill as soon as possible.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  stand in recess until 10 p.m. tonight.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 9 p.m., recessed until 10  p.m. and reassembled when called to order by the Presiding Officer (Mr.  Sasse).                            ____________________
