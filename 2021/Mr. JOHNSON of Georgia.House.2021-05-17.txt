 Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Torres for  anchoring this very important Special Order hour today.   I also want to extend my deepest condolences to the chair of the  Congressional Black Caucus and my friend, the Honorable Joyce Beatty,  who lost her dear husband a few days ago. He passed away. He was a fine  public servant and a fine civil rights champion, and he will be missed.  We are there in prayer and in spirit with our dear sister.   It has been said that sunlight is the best disinfectant, yet the  terrible atrocity that took place in Tulsa, Oklahoma, 100 years ago, on  May 31 and June 1 of 1921, has lived in the shadows for far too long.  It is time that the truth be told. We must know our past or we are  bound to repeat it.   In 1921, the Black community in Tulsa, Oklahoma, was prospering,  despite a racist system designed to marginalize and exclude it and its  residents from the fruits of those citizens' labor. It was a community  known as Greenwood, and it was also known as the Black Wall Street.   It was a thriving community. There were restaurants, grocery stores,  hotels, theaters, banks, insurance companies, all owned by Black  people. This community was self-sufficient. It was prospering, despite  the fact that segregation was the norm and the lynching of Black men  was as common as the white hoods of the KKK.   The simple fact is this: The Black community was succeeding in Tulsa,  so White people burned it down. White supremacy and Jim Crow were the  sparks that lit the fire. The massacre occurred over a 24-hour period,  from May 30 to June 1 of 1921. And it all began like so many other  racially motivated events: A false allegation against a Black man.   In response, a White mob of thousands shot, beat, and murdered Black  residents, and they did it with impunity.                                time  1945    They looted Black homes and businesses and set fires in their wake,  this White mob. They were aided and abetted by the National Guard and  also deputized killers, looters, and arsonists.   Twenty-four hours after the violence began, 35 city blocks lay in  ruins. Not a single dwelling or business or building was left standing.   Within months of the Greenwood massacre, the KKK's Tulsa chapter  became one of the Nation's largest, because what better recruiting tool  than plundering and killing Blacks with impunity?   No person has ever been held accountable on the State, local, or  Federal level, in the criminal courts, or in the civil courts for the  atrocities committed against the Black community and the Black people  of Greenwood in Tulsa, Oklahoma.   And here we are today, 100 years later, still challenged by state- sanctioned violence against Black people. Some things have changed, but  some things remain the same.   The events of January 6, when Confederate flags flew inside and out  of the Capitol, and where a hangman's noose was draped over a  functional gallows constructed on the Capitol Grounds to intimidate and  terrorize, that proves that not much has changed.   And I stand here today to tell you that we have had enough. It is  time to fix America and rid racism from its soil. We must fix our  country, and that starts with examining our past and looking at how we  can heal together as a Nation, and, yes, reparation. Justice delayed is  justice denied, and Black Americans in this country have been denied  justice for far too long. Enough is enough.   At this time, I would like to read from the Tulsa Historical Society  and Museum website. It is at TulsaHistory.org. I want to read the  following information that it publishes, which comes from the 2001  Tulsa Race Riot Commission report.   ``On the morning of May 30, 1921, a young Black man named Dick  Rowland riding in the elevator at the Drexel Building at Third and Main  with a White woman named Sarah Page. The details of what followed vary  from person to person. Accounts of an incident circulated among the  city's White community during the day and became more exaggerated with  each telling.   ``Tulsa police arrested Rowland the following day and began an  investigation. An inflammatory report in the May 31 edition of the  Tulsa Tribune spurred a confrontation between Black and White armed  mobs around the courthouse where the sheriff and his men had barricaded  the top floor to protect Rowland. Shots were fired, and the outnumbered  African Americans began retreating to the Greenwood district.   ``In the early morning hours of June 1, 1921, Greenwood was looted  and burned by White rioters,'' as they are called. ``Governor Robertson  declared martial law, and National Guard troops arrived in Tulsa.  Guardsmen assisted firemen in putting out fires, took African Americans  out of the hands of vigilantes and imprisoned,'' locked them up, ``all  Black Tulsans not already interned. Over 6,000 people were held at the  convention hall and the fairgrounds, some for as long as 8 days.   ``Twenty-four hours after the violence erupted, it ceased. In the  wake of the violence, 35 city blocks laid in charred ruins, more than  800 people were treated for injuries, and contemporary reports of  deaths began at 36. Historians now believe as many as 300 people may  have died.   ``In order to understand the Tulsa Race Massacre, it is important to  understand the complexities of the times. Dick Rowland, Sarah Page, and  an unknown gunman were the sparks that ignited a long-smoldering fire.  Jim Crow, jealousy, white supremacy, and land lust all played roles in  leading up to the destruction and loss of life on May 31 and June 1,  1921. . . .  [[Page H2409]]    ``Black Tulsans had every reason to believe that Dick Rowland would  be lynched after his arrest. His charges were later dismissed and  highly suspect from the start. They had cause to believe that his  personal safety, like the defense of themselves and their community,  depended on them alone. As hostile groups gathered and their  confrontation worsened, municipal and county authorities failed to take  actions to calm or contain the situation.   ``At the eruption of violence, civil officials selected many men, all  of them White and some of them participants in that violence, and made  those men their agents as deputies. In that capacity, deputies did not  stem the violence but added to it, often through overt acts that were  themselves illegal. Public officials provided firearms and ammunition  to individuals, again, all of them White. Units of the Oklahoma  National Guard participated in the mass arrests of all or nearly all of  Greenwood's residents.   ``They removed them to other parts of the city and detained them in  holding centers. Entering the Greenwood district, people stole,  damaged, or destroyed personal property left behind in homes and  businesses. People, some of them agents of government, also  deliberately burned or otherwise destroyed homes credibly estimated to  have numbered 1,256, along with virtually every other structure-- including churches, schools, businesses, even a hospital and library-- in the Greenwood district. Despite duties to preserve order and to  protect property, no government at any level offered adequate  resistance, if any at all, to what amounted to the destruction of the  Greenwood neighborhood. Although the exact total can never be  determined, credible evidence makes it probable that many people,  likely numbering between 100 to 300, were killed during the massacre.''   I am reading to you from the report of the Tulsa commission that was  set up by the city of Tulsa to report on the events that happened in  Greenwood 100 years ago.   ``Not one of these criminal acts was then or ever has been prosecuted  or punished by government at any level: municipal, county, State, or  Federal. Even after the restoration of order, it was official policy to  release a Black detainee only upon the application of a White person,  and then only if that White person agreed to accept responsibility for  that detainee's subsequent behavior. As private citizens, many Whites  in Tulsa and neighboring communities did extend invaluable assistance  to the massacre's victims,'' to their credit.    ``Despite being numerically at a disadvantage, Black Tulsans fought  valiantly to protect their homes, their businesses, and their  community. But in the end, the city's African-American population was  simply outnumbered by the White invaders. In the end, the restoration  of Greenwood after its systematic destruction was left to the victims  of that destruction. While Tulsa officials turned away some offers of  outside aid, a number of individual White Tulsans provided assistance  to the city's now virtually homeless Black population. . . .   ``In recent years, there has been ongoing discussion about what to  call the event that happened in 1921. Historically, it has been called  the Tulsa Race Riot. Some say it was given that name at the time for  insurance purposes. Designating it a riot prevented insurance companies  from having to pay benefits to the people of Greenwood whose homes and  businesses were destroyed.''   Now, this is not me talking. I am still reading from that report.   ``It also was common at the time for any large-scale clash between  different racial or ethnic groups to be categorized a race riot.   ``What do you think?'' the report asks.   ``Definition of `riot': a tumultuous disturbance of the public peace  by three or more persons assembled together and acting with common  intent.   ``Definition of `massacre': the act or an instance of killing a  number of usually helpless or unresisting human beings under  circumstances of atrocity or cruelty.''   So, that is why I personally refer to it as the Tulsa Greenwood  massacre, as opposed to a race riot.
