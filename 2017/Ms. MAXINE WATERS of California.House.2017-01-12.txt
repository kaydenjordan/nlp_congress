 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong  opposition to H.R. 238, a bill that would hamstring the ability of the  Commodity Futures Trading Commission to protect our Nation's farmers,  manufacturers, municipalities, and retirees. Indeed, the agency has  weighty responsibility to oversee our commodity, futures, and swaps  markets to ensure that they are not only fair to market participants,  but also that they are protected from manipulation, fraud, and abuse.   Such misconduct in these markets can impact everything from the price  of oil, natural gas, and bread, to the interest rates on mortgages,  credit cards, auto loans, and student loans.   As we saw in the financial crisis, fraud and abuse in the swaps  markets can lead to systemic risks. Recall that credit default swaps,  made famous by AIG, fueled the crisis, bankrupted millions of  homeowners, and cost taxpayers trillions of dollars. To prevent that  from happening again, Congress, in the Dodd-Frank Act, gave the CFTC  new authority over the swaps market and required it to adopt reforms  which, thanks to its hard work, are largely in place.   But rather than applaud the work of the CFTC and provide it with  funds it needs to do its job, Republicans continue to seek to undermine  its regulatory authority, impose new procedural hurdles, and ultimately  thwart its ability to protect the American people.   For example, H.R. 238 would impose onerous burdens and introduce new  litigation risks by requiring the CFTC to conduct what is known as  cost-benefit analysis slanted toward the industry, tying the CFTC's  hands and setting up roadblocks to prevent them from doing their job  and protect investors. This is a tactic used by opponents of financial  reform to prevent, delay, weaken, and now under a Trump administration,  repeal any rules implementing the Dodd-Frank Act.   This bill also would make it harder for the CFTC to police the  overseas derivatives operations of megabanks like Citigroup, J.P.  Morgan and Bank of America, even though the risk may still be borne by  U.S. taxpayers. It also creates an unreasonable and hard-to-overturn  presumption that the regulations of the largest eight foreign swaps  markets are equivalent to U.S. regulation, allowing global megabanks to  opt out of CFTC regulation.   H.R. 238 is simply a bad bill, but not leaving well-enough alone,  Republicans are attempting to make it worse through multiple  amendments. Troublingly, the Lucas amendment would create loopholes in  our swaps regime by exempting trades between affiliates. Therefore,  such trades would not have to comply with certain reporting, clearing,  or initial margin requirements, creating a dangerous blind spot in the  markets. What is more, the amendment is in direct contravention to  already-provided, targeted relief, including the inter-affiliate  clearing exemption that Congress passed in a bipartisan fashion in the  2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act, which contained numerous  safeguards to ensure appropriate CFTC oversight.   I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing that and other harmful  amendments, and oppose H.R. 238.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to my friend Mr. Lucas' amendment.  This amendment rejects the bipartisan compromise negotiated over 4  years to strike the right balance regarding interaffiliate swaps.  Indeed, Democrats like Ms. Moore and Republicans like Mr. Stivers  carefully negotiated a way to balance the needs of operating companies  like airlines and refineries. This amendment, however, would exempt  swaps between affiliates, including megabanks like Goldman Sachs and  J.P.Morgan, from the mandatory margin, clearing, trade execution,  capital, and every other protection under Title VII of the Dodd-Frank  Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010.   While we generally agree that swaps between affiliated corporate  entities do not pose a systemic threat, we are deeply troubled about  this desire to undermine all swaps rules and harm our economy.   During testimony on a similar version of this amendment, the CFTC's  former chairman, Gary Gensler, stated that such an exemption would  provide a big loophole around our derivatives rules and that it would  ``blow a hole in Dodd-Frank.''   Specifically, the amendment exempts affiliate swaps no matter where  the affiliate resides. So, an affiliate could reside in a foreign  jurisdiction that lacks any swaps regulation and share its risks with a  U.S. affiliate, but our regulators would be prohibited from imposing  any safeguards such as initial margin or capital requirements. Why  would we pass such a self-inflicted wound?   With that, Mr. Chairman, I urge all Members to vote ``no'' on this  amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, just as I opposed the bill before us today in the  previous three Congresses, I rise in opposition to it now. Republicans  have crafted H.R. 78 to tie the hands of the Securities and Exchange  Commission, the SEC, and to prevent it from issuing new rules to  address market failures and protect investors. At the same time, the  bill would enable the Trump administration to easily repeal important  Dodd-Frank rules by tilting the SEC's decisions toward what is best for  industry and, worse, what enriches the President-elect and his cronies.   Before I discuss H.R. 78, I think it is important to point out that  14 members of the Financial Services Committee, as well as the millions  of Americans they represent, are being denied the opportunity to  discuss this bill through hearings and markups. We are barely into the  second week of this Congress and the Republican leadership is  completely ignoring regular order--despite Speaker Ryan's declaration  less than a week ago of a return to regular order--by skipping the  committee process to bring this bill to the floor; but this is par for  the course.   In the other Chamber, Senate Republican leadership is similarly  jamming Donald Trump's conflicted nominees through the confirmation  process even before the FBI has completed background checks. And with  barely 10 days until his inauguration, Donald Trump has already given  up on ``draining the swamp'' and has broken his promise to hold Wall  Street accountable by nominating Wall Street insiders to nearly every  key economic and regulatory post.   Let me turn back to the problems with H.R. 78.  [[Page H429]]    During the past four Congresses, Republicans have sought to increase  the cost-benefit requirements that are related to SEC rulemakings even  though the Commission is already subject to stringent economic analysis  for which it is held accountable. Current law requires the SEC to  conduct the same economic analysis that is required of all agencies  under the Paperwork Reduction Act, the Congressional Review Act, and  the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Unlike other financial regulators, the  SEC has additional statutory requirements to study how its rules affect  market efficiency, competition, and capital formation.   Additionally, in 2012, the SEC voluntarily issued internal guidance  on economic analysis for rulemakings that closely follow Executive  Order No. 12866. Since adopting this guidance, the SEC has dramatically  expanded its economic analysis capabilities, including by increasing  the staff and the budget of its economics division by more than 300  percent over the last 5 years. In any other reality, the SEC would be  held up as a model of effective economic analysis.   When asked by Republicans in Congress to review the SEC's analysis,  the inspector general concluded:         We determined that the SEC's use of its current guidance       has been effective in incorporating economic analysis into       the rulemaking process.    H.R. 78, however, goes much, much further in radically directing the  SEC to no longer be concerned with the protection of investors. In  fact, the only reference to investors anywhere in the bill is in a  provision requiring the SEC to consider the impact these rules will  have on ``investor choice.''   The American public knows full well that ``investor choice'' is a  code for industry's wanting to offer a menu of predatory products, such  as subprime--toxic--mortgages or retirement products that are designed  to bankrupt low- and middle-income Americans and line the pockets of  Wall Street executives. Further suggestions that the bill is only  codifying the cost-benefit executive orders are false as the bill omits  one key provision from those orders: the prohibition of private rights  of action, which is simply the right to sue.   As a result, H.R. 78 provides industry with endless avenues to sue  the SEC and, thereby, puts pressure on the regulator to adopt the rules  it wants and to repeal everything else. What is worse, the bill is the  first signal to Wall Street that the SEC is leaving the enforcement  business. H.R. 78 provides no new funding for the SEC to address the  substantial, analytic, and potential litigation responsibilities the  bill would create even though the Congressional Budget Office estimates  that the analytical workload alone would cost $27 million.   Let's not fool ourselves that Republicans are going to increase the  SEC's funding. That is at the top of their agenda--kill the SEC by  taking away the funding that they need to be the cops on the block.   Members of Congress just finished debating a bill that caps the SEC's  sister agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, at a woefully  inadequate funding level for the next 5 years, denying the CFTC the  hundreds of millions of dollars it needs to adequately police the swaps  markets.   Further, Donald Trump has nominated a lifelong defender of Wall  Street's to lead the SEC, which I can only assume means that Trump's  SEC will equally pillage the Commission's overworked enforcement staff  to help pay for the Republicans' planned repeal of Dodd-Frank.                                time  1430    As President-elect Trump takes office next week, beginning what is  the most conflicted administration in U.S. history, I urge my  colleagues to join me, investor and consumer advocates, public pension  plans, civil rights groups, labor unions, and supporters of financial  reform in opposing H.R. 78 to ensure that the actions of Trump's SEC  are in the interest of America's economic stability and not in Russia's  or Wall Street's interests.   I am amazed that the Republicans can be so blatant, so noncaring to  come to us at this time with a bill that would basically take our cop  on the block, the SEC, and literally obliterate it. I am absolutely  amazed that they have the nerve and the gall to try this in face of  everything that we already know about what they have done to strip it  of its appropriate funding. But now with all of the debate and the  concern about Trump and Russia and everything that is going on, they  would come here with this bill today and try to pull this off.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gonzalez), a new member of the Financial  Services Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Let me point out how H.R. 78 tilts their decisionmaking process  toward Wall Street. First, let's go back and review everything the  President-elect said about Wall Street, and then we can understand  exactly what is being done here.   In August 2015, President-elect Trump told CBS: ``The hedge fund guys  didn't build this country. These are guys that shift paper around and  they get lucky. They make a fortune. They pay no tax. It's ridiculous,  okay?''   In January 2016, Trump told Iowans: ``I'm not going to let Wall  Street get away with murder. Wall Street has caused tremendous problems  for us.''   I repeat, he said: ``Wall Street has caused tremendous problems for  us.''   In February of 2016, Trump said: ``I know the guys at Goldman Sachs,  they have total control over Hillary Clinton.''   In July of 2016, Trump tweeted: ``Hillary will never reform Wall  Street. She is owned by Wall Street.''   He also told Iowans: ``I don't care about the Wall Street guys. I'm  not taking any of their money.''   Now, Trump has totally betrayed his promise to drain the swamp. He  has appointed Goldman Sachs bankers to the Treasury and the National  Economic Council, and his pick to head the Securities and Exchange  Commission is a lawyer whose career has been based upon defending Wall  Street, including Goldman Sachs. This legislation today is part and  parcel to that betrayal.   This is how you do it: cost-benefit analysis, you can attach this to  any and all monetary and financial services legislation. You can attach  it wherever you would like and, thus, cause the delays, cause the  undermining of legislation, put the SEC in the position where it has to  defend in court, costing them more money that they don't have because  they have denied them adequate funding.                                time  1445    This is what this is all about. How do we get our Wall Street friends  and cronies back into the business, because Dodd-Frank began to deal  with them and to reverse some of what had been happening for far too  long. Now they come with this attack and they talk about cost-benefit  analysis. Mr. Chairman, this is what they are going to use to ride  their way back into making  [[Page H431]]  sure that they give the protection and the advantages to all of their  friends on Wall Street.   Mr. Trump was not about draining the swamp. He is about making sure  that there is a swamp, digging it deeper and wider.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of  my time to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney).    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded  vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.    Mr. Speaker.    Yes, sir. I seek recognition to get  an explanation of what happened on C-SPAN today.   Did this House have anything to do with it?   I would like to explain that today while I spoke on the House floor  on H.R. 78----    Yes, I am.    Mr. Speaker, today while I spoke on  the House floor on H.R. 78, the state-owned Russian channel called  ``Russia Today'' suddenly interrupted my speech, and C-SPAN coverage  was replaced with Russian programming.   Can the Chair please explain the proper rules for coverage of House  floor proceedings? How did this happen?    Mr. Speaker, I would like to request  an investigation of this incident because it does not seem to be  coincidental. I was speaking about the SEC, and I was speaking about  President-elect Trump and how he could influence the SEC and his  relationship with Russia when I was interrupted.    Mr. Speaker, I am requesting an  investigation by the House.    Mr. Speaker, I am requesting an  investigation by the House.    I thank the Chair. I have made it  known. I have asked for the investigation. If there is no assistance  from the House, I would appreciate allowing other kinds of cooperation.   I must say this, Mr. Speaker, if we were sitting in on the House and  if we were streaming, then the House would know what to do since they  investigated our past actions when we were trying to bring attention to  gun violence in this country. So I don't really accept the fact that  the House has no role in this and that it should not be participating  in it.   The House participates when it wants to, and I am asking the House to  participate and investigate in this the same way you did when you  decided that somehow it was improper for us to stream from the House on  this issue.    No, I don't yield back.
