 Mr. Speaker, the opioid and heroin crisis  continues to hit Hoosiers hard. Sadly, we haven't turned the tide yet.   It is robbing the futures of Americans in every State in our Nation.  We must support those battling addiction.   I have met with so many Hoosiers battling addiction. I visited  treatment centers and recovery houses like the La Verna Lodge for men  and Ohana House Sober Living for women. I have talked with addicts and  those battling addiction about what is working and what is not working  with different recovery options.   Passing the strong bipartisan bill before us today is critically  important. It will help ensure that more people have better access to  treatments, and we can try to save more lives across this country.
