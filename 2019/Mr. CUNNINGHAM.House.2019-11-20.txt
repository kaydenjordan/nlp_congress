 Mr. Speaker, down in South Carolina's Lowcountry, we  all understand the importance of a healthy ocean and healthy  coastlines, and sharks are a part of that story. Unfortunately, many  populations of sharks have severely declined due to the demand for  their fins. In South Carolina, we have not imported or exported any  shark fins in recent years, and a large number of constituents have  contacted me in support of this legislation.   Support for this ban is growing across the country. Twelve U.S.  States already have shark fin bans. Private companies are also refusing  to ship or sell shark fin products.   Just earlier this year, Canada became the first G20 country to ban  the shark fin trade. The United States has already banned the act of  shark finning, but we continue to import fins from countries that don't  have their own finning bans.   Disturbingly, in the United States, our own government data shows  that less than 20 percent of our U.S. shark stocks are sustainably  managed. It is time for the United States to end its role in the shark  fin trade and stop contributing to the decline of our shark  populations.   I am grateful to Delegate Sablan and Chairman Grijalva from the  Natural Resources Committee for their leadership on this issue. Also, I  thank Foreign Affairs Committee Ranking Member McCaul for his  leadership.   Ending the shark fin trade will require a death by a thousand cuts,  and we have the opportunity to make a big cut right now. Let's pass the  Shark Fin Sales Elimination Act.
