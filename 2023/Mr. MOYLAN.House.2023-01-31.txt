 I would like to take this time to honor and wish Franklin  Gutierrez, Jr., a happy birthday.   Over the weekend, Frankie G., who is one of Guam's legendary  musicians, turned the big 5-0.   For decades, Mr. Gutierrez has not only entertained many with his  vocal gifts, but he has also nurtured a future generation of musicians  in Guam. His band, Rumblefish, is an island icon. Frankie G. is more  than just a musician. He is a proud husband, a father, a grandfather,  and a friend.   Frankie G. has also served his island as an officer with the Guam  Customs and Quarantine Agency. He has proudly protected our borders  while putting himself in harm's way. From the Halls of the United  States House of Representatives, I wish Frankie G. a happy 50th  birthday.                            ____________________
