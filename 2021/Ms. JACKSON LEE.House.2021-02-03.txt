 Mr. Speaker, let me thank the distinguished chairman  of the Budget Committee for the masterful way that he has led the  Budget Committee and the masterful way that he has led this debate.   In the next couple of months, close to 600,000 Americans will die;  loved ones will be forbidden from going to their bedside; and some of  them will find themselves lodged in refrigerator trucks.   Individuals in our districts, like the woman in my district, will  report that she has $8 in her bank account and the potential for being  evicted.   Mr. Speaker, what we are doing today is a rescue mission, like we  needed to do for the fires in California, or  [[Page H303]]  Hurricane Harvey, or like we needed to do when I fled the United States  Capitol as the planes were hitting the Pentagon in 9/11. This is a  rescue mission.   And I will not take a back seat all the years that I have known  President Biden to ever deny his sincerity about bipartisanship. I have  worked alongside of him. He is the leader who brought us out of the  depths of depression with the automobile collapse. He is the one that  led us in the recovery act after the debacle of the collapse of Wall  Street in 2007 and 2008.   I was here when the Secretary of the Treasury said, America will not  be the America that it was, we are going down. And so, we need to go  big. The Secretary of the Treasury says--a renowned economist--says we  need to go big.   This is a time for our friends to listen to Abraham Lincoln: ``The  dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The  occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the  occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew and act anew.''   Our case is new. We are needing the $1,400. We are needing the  eviction moratorium. We are needing unemployment extension.   And finally, let me say, Mr. Speaker, we are needing to ensure that  this work is done on behalf of the American people. We need a rescue  mission and we need it now.   Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees on the Judiciary,  on Homeland Security, on the Budget, and as the Member of Congress for  a congressional district that has experienced the worst of COVID-19 as  a public health emergency and economic catastrophe, I rise in strong  support of H. Con. Res. 11, which reorders budgetary priorities to  provide $1.9 trillion to allow Congress to take immediate and decisive  action to crush the virus and vaccinate our people, build the economy  back better, reopen schools, and provide needed support and assistance  to state and local governments that have been asked to do too much with  too little for far too long.   So if our Republican colleagues are amenable to reaching an agreement  on a legislative response that is commensurate to the challenge facing  Americans, nothing in the legislation before will preclude that from  happening.   But have no doubt, if they refuse to be part of the solution, the  unified and bicameral Democratic congressional majority, in  coordination with the new Democratic Administration, will take the lead  and act boldly to address and overcome the present crisis.   I would urge my Republican colleagues to heed the words of the  Republican Governor of West Virginia who said colorfully just a few  days ago, ``At this point in time in this nation, we need to go big. We  need to quit counting the egg-sucking legs on the cows and count the  cows and just move. And move forward and move right now.''   The same sentiment was expressed more eloquently by Abraham Lincoln  in 1862 when he memorably wrote:   The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present.  The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the  occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew and act anew.   Mr. Speaker, the bipartisan action we took last December was a step  in the right direction but only a long-delayed down payment; we cannot  afford any more delays, especially since Republican stalling already  caused a painful lapse in critical unemployment assistance last year,  and additional unemployment assistance is set to expire in March.   That why this resolution, which creates a failsafe alternative to  debating, voting, and passing the American Rescue Act, is absolutely  crucial and the right thing to do, right now.   The American Rescue Plan proposed by President Biden takes a  multiprong approach to tackling the public health and economic crises  stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.   Mr. Speaker, by an overwhelming margin (79 percent), the public wants  and is demanding that we act to provide more economic relief to address  the damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic.   Nearly two-thirds (65 percent) of Republicans and Republican-leaning  independents believe an additional relief package is necessary, while  more than nine in ten (92 percent) Democrats and Democratic leaners say  more coronavirus aid will be needed.   Even the most conservative Republicans favor more relief by a 56  percent-44 percent margin.   Nearly nine in ten of all adults (88 percent) in lower-income  households say an additional package is necessary, while 81 percent of  Republicans in lower-income households (81 percent) say additional aid  is needed now.   Let me make clear at the outset Mr. Speaker, that nothing in this  resolution precludes the reaching of a bipartisan and bicameral  agreement to pass and fund the President's America Rescue Plan, which  in nearly all material respects mirrors the Heroes Act passed by the  House Democratic majority on May 15, 2020, nearly nine months ago, only  to languish on the Republican Senate Majority Leader's desk while  hundreds of thousands of our fellow Americans succumbed to the virus  and millions of others lost their livelihoods and businesses, and  everyone faced an uncertain future.   It would send a powerful signal to the American people if our  colleagues across the aisle would join us in this effort because  nothing would better show them that elected representatives can put  partisanship aside and put America first.   And that bipartisan achievement would portend success for similar  initiatives in the area of infrastructure, energy, national and  homeland security, and criminal justice and immigration reform, all of  which I am ready and willing to reach across the aisle to find common  ground.   To beat the virus and safely reopen schools, the plan will mount a  national vaccination program that includes setting up community  vaccination sites nationwide and makes the investments necessary to  safely reopen schools.   It will also take complementary measures to combat the virus,  including scaling up testing and tracing, addressing shortages of  personal protective equipment and other critical supplies, investing in  high-quality treatments, and addressing health care disparities.   The American Rescue Plan delivers immediate relief to working  families bearing the brunt of the crisis by providing $1,400 per person  in direct cash assistance to households across America, bringing the  total (including the $600 down payment enacted in December) to $2,000.   Additionally, the plan will also provide direct housing and nutrition  assistance to families struggling to get by, expand access to safe and  reliable child care and affordable health care, extend and expand  unemployment insurance so American workers can pay their bills, and  give families with children as well as childless workers a boost  through enhanced tax credits.   Mr. Speaker, the American Rescue Plan provides much needed support  for communities struggling with the economic fallout, including hard- hit small businesses, especially those owned by entrepreneurs from  racial and ethnic backgrounds that have experienced systemic  discrimination.   Finally, the plan also provides crucial resources to protect the jobs  of first responders, frontline public health workers, teachers, transit  workers, and other essential workers that all Americans depend on.   The 2021 budget resolution is not a comprehensive fiscal blueprint  for the next 10 years; it is designed solely to provide the option of  using reconciliation to deliver critical relief and achieve the goals  of the American Rescue Plan.   As such, the total spending and revenue levels in the resolution  simply reflect current-law projections adjusted for the estimated costs  of the American Rescue Plan.   Once the American Rescue Plan becomes law, Congress will begin its  work on a forward-looking, comprehensive budget resolution for 2022  that will provide urgently needed economic support and address  longstanding deficits in our communities and underlying inequities in  our society, which have been so starkly revealed and exacerbated by  COVID-19.   I strongly support this legislation and urge all Members to join me  in voting for its passage.    Madam Speaker, today, earlier on the floor, I made  one important announcement of one important number. And I said that  what we were doing with the budget reconciliation resolution was we  were rescuing America. Because 594,000 Americans are expected to die  from COVID-19 by May 2021.   This is what is happening in Texas. Half of Texans face financial  hardship because of the coronavirus pandemic. The new strain of COVID- 19 has come to Harris County. We can't do it alone. We need assistance  for counties and cities. My mayor has been asking, and that is what  this budget reconciliation will do.   In addition, we must realize that roughly 22 percent of Texas  residents are facing severe hardship.   This is a catastrophe beyond our understanding. A pandemic. And my  DELIVER Act is ready to provide a distribution structure so that all  over America you can get vaccinated. That is why we voted on the budget  reconciliation resolution; to save lives.                            ____________________
