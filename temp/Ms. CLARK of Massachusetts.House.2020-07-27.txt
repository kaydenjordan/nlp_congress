 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in  support of two pieces of legislation coming to the floor this week, the  Child Care Is Essential Act, and the Child Care for Economic Recovery  Act.   This pandemic has exposed fault lines that exist just beneath the  surface of our society. Whether it is a broken healthcare system or the  consequences of our Nation's history of racial injustice, this pandemic  is exacerbating harms done by systems that fail our families. Our  system of childcare is no exception.   Childcare is a powerful tool for educating our children and for  fueling our economy. If we unite around its utility and take decisive  action to save the childcare sector, we can help rebuild and revitalize  our future.   Simply put, childcare is essential. But ignored, underappreciated,  and neglected for so long, our system of early care and education is  now at a breaking point.   Right now, 40 percent of our Nation's childcare centers and family  childcare homes will be forced to close permanently without immediate  financial support. Our children, moms, dads, doctors, nurses, teachers,  small business owners, and over 23 million families will have nowhere  to turn.   Think about that. Before this pandemic, it was difficult and  sometimes nearly impossible for working families to find quality,  affordable childcare. If the pandemic destroys 4 out of every 10  childcare spaces, how will parents return to work? How will businesses  reopen? How many children will be pushed out of their classrooms?   Great outcomes for an entire generation of children are at stake and  could be impacted for years if we don't invest now in early care and  education. With proper investment, childcare can combat the economic  and social inequities of our time, in addition to providing a  foundation for our children. What is more, with an investment in  childcare, we can stabilize and secure American families.   Before the pandemic, childcare costs often exceeded a family's rent  or mortgage payment, driving parents out of the labor market entirely.  Parents of color face even more hurdles and costs in finding  affordable, high-quality care.   Economists are predicting that losing access to childcare is not just  about losing 2 or 3 years of income. It is an entirely different  trajectory for the rest of a parent's life. This also  disproportionately impacts women in the workplace.   The rising costs of childcare are associated with a 13 percent  decline in employment of mothers with children under 5. Investing in  childcare is about ensuring moms can pay the bills and pursue their  dreams. It is also an investment in opportunity and in equality for our  Nation's mothers.   These bills will also honor our Nation's caregivers, who provide an  essential service to our children, economy, and community. In an  industry where 96 percent of childcare professionals are women, and 40  percent of them are women of color, over 325,000 have lost their jobs  since February. This workforce is already underpaid, many of them  barely making minimum wage.   Our failure to value the work of caregivers is one of the many  examples of how our society and how Congress fails to value women's  work and, especially, the work of women of color.   Finally, it is not just our families who rely on childcare. Childcare  is essential to our entire economy.   A survey from Northeastern University tells us that during the  pandemic, working parents lose, on average, a full day of work  productivity every week due to a lack of childcare. We know that has  repercussions for our businesses.   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation found that in one State  alone, a lack of childcare is estimated to cost employers almost as  much as $3 billion annually in lost productivity, absences, and  turnover rate.   The solution is not complicated. The problem we face is solvable. The  two bills before us are a critical first step. Our Nation needs to  seize this opportunity to provide equity in education, parity for  women, and stability in our economy.   That is why I urge my colleagues to pass the Child Care Is Essential  Act and the Child Care for Economic Recovery Act. It is time to invest  in our children, our women, and our economy.                            ____________________
