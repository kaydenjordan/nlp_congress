 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her  leadership.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is as much a criminal injustice bill as it is  immigration. Serving as the ranking member on the Crime, Terrorism,  Homeland Security, and Investigations Subcommittee, I am both a  believer in the dangers of MS-13 as many of my colleagues are. I offer  concern and recognition of their violence.   That is why this bill should be defeated because something as crucial  as this does not need to be litigated in the courts. You make a bill  with such insufferable frailties constitutionally without  bipartisanship, without any hearings, and without the ability to set a  legal standard of what is the definition or the understanding of a  criminal gang.   This is done in consultation with the Attorney General, who is an  opponent of any form of immigration, legal or undocumented, consulting  with the Homeland Security Secretary of which I am a member of that  committee, and the dominant factor will be the Attorney General talking  to the Homeland Security Secretary about criminal elements. Who do you  think will prevail? How many will be swept up in this expansive,  nonorganized, nonorderly, and non-due process legislation?   The frailties of this bill are the very number, if you will, five.  Five persons can be called a criminal gang. Mothers and fathers,  listen: innocent behavior of young people tattooed or having friends  could be called a criminal gang. Yes, individuals who have status could  be deported, an ongoing group, club, organizations, or associations.  They have expanded this, maybe high school kids who may gather to smoke  marijuana. Maybe this would cover sanctuary sites like churches that  aid undocumented immigrants.   All we are asking is let us work together to get a bill that fights  MS-13, not fights innocent people. The bill defines criminal gang, a  group that has been designated as a criminal gang, as I said, by the  DHS Secretary in consultation with the Attorney General. It is unwise  and irresponsible to not have the kind of organized framework.   That happens from not having committee hearings and markups. It  happens when you don't engage police officers in a wide breadth from  many different aspects.   I am disappointed that this bill did not have the opportunity to have  the  [[Page H7393]]  Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations  have input, and that would have been done if we had a full hearing or a  hearing in the Immigration and Border Security Subcommittee, or a  hearing in the Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations  Subcommittee, or a hearing in the full committee as I mentioned.   It lacks a constitutional construct. It begins to criminalize for  associations. We are heading down a terribly unsophisticated road.  According to the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency  Prevention's recent report, nationally, 48,000 juvenile offenders were  held in residential facilities. We don't need to add more, but here is  the outcome: they are not just held, they are deported.   Again, I emphasize to my colleagues that the ages could be very young  because there are no firewalls dealing with the ages that might be  swept up in this wide sweep of those who deserve to be responded to in  a way that is not this bill. This bill pretends to be wrapping up and  rounding up bad actors that are undocumented immigrants. That is the  big calling card. I would ask, Mr. Speaker, that my colleagues vote  against this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record ``Fact check: Immigration  doesn't bring crime into U.S.,'' by PBS NewsHour.                   [From the PBS Newshour, Feb. 3, 2017]       Fact Check: Immigration Doesn't Bring Crime Into U.S. Data Say                           (By The Conversation)         Editor's note: In his first week in office, President       Donald Trump showed he intends to follow through on his       immigration promises. A major focus of his campaign was on       removing immigrants who, he said, were increasing crime in       American communities.        In his acceptance speech at the Republican National       Convention, Trump named victims who were reportedly killed by       undocumented immigrants and said:        ``They are being released by the tens of thousands into our       communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or       resources . . . We are going to build a great border wall to       stop illegal immigration, to stop the gangs and the violence,       and to stop the drugs from pouring into our communities.''        Now as president, he has signed executive orders that       restrict entry of immigrants from seven countries into the       U.S. and authorize the construction of a wall along the U.S.       border with Mexico. He also signed an order to prioritize the       removal of ``criminal aliens'' and withhold federal funding       from ``sanctuary cities.''        But, what does research say about how immigration impacts       crime in U.S. communities? We turned to our experts for       answers.                        Across 200 metropolitan areas  (By Robert Adelman, University at Buffalo, and Lesley Reid, University                                of Alabama)         Research has shown virtually no support for the enduring       assumption that increases in immigration are associated with       increases in crime.        Immigration-crime research over the past 20 years has       widely corroborated the conclusions of a number of early       20th-century presidential commissions that found no backing       for the immigration-crime connection. Although there are       always individual exceptions, the literature demonstrates       that immigrants commit fewer crimes, on average, than native-      born Americans.        Also, large cities with substantial immigrant populations       have lower crime rates, on average, than those with minimal       immigrant populations.        In a paper published this year in the Journal of Ethnicity       in Criminal Justice, we, along with our colleagues Gail       Markle, Saskia Weiss and Charles Jaret, investigated the       immigration-crime relationship.        We analyzed census data spanning four decades from 1970 to       2010 for 200 randomly selected metropolitan areas, which       include center cities and surrounding suburbs. Examining data       over time allowed us to assess whether the relationship       between immigration and crime changed with the broader U.S.       economy and the origin and number of immigrants.        The most striking finding from our research is that for       murder, robbery, burglary and larceny, as immigration       increased, crime decreased, on average, in American       metropolitan areas. The only crime that immigration had no       impact on was aggravated assault. These associations are       strong and stable evidence that immigration does not cause       crime to increase in U.S. metropolitan areas, and may even       help reduce it.        There are a number of ideas among scholars that explain why       more immigration leads to less crime. The most common       explanation is that immigration reduces levels of crime by       revitalizing urban neighborhoods, creating vibrant       communities and generating economic growth.                           Across 20 years of data    (By Charis E. Kubrin, University of California, Irvine, and Graham                    Ousey, College of William and Mary)         For the last decade, we have been studying how immigration       to an area impacts crime.        Across our studies, one finding remains clear: Cities and       neighborhoods with greater concentrations of immigrants have       lower rates of crime and violence, all else being equal.        Our research also points to the importance of city context       for understanding the immigration-crime relationship. In one       study, for example, we found that cities with historically       high immigration levels are especially likely to enjoy       reduced crime rates as a result of their immigrant       populations.        Findings from our most recent study, forthcoming in the       inaugural issue of The Annual Review of Criminology, only       strengthen these conclusions.        We conducted a meta-analysis, meaning we systematically       evaluated available research on the immigration-crime       relationship in neighborhoods, cities and metropolitan areas       across the U.S. We examined findings from more than 50       studies published between 1994 and 2014, including studies       conducted by our copanelists, Adelman and Reid.        Our analysis of the literature reveals that immigration has       a weak crime-suppressing effect. In other words, more       immigration equals less crime.        There were some individual studies that found that with an       increase in immigration, there was an increase in crime.       However, there were 2.5 times as many findings that showed       immigration was actually correlated with less crime. And, the       most common finding was that immigration had no impact on       crime.        The upshot? We find no evidence to indicate that       immigration leads to more crime and it may, in fact, suppress       it.     Mr. Speaker, opposing this, in particular, I would  like to add this letter from The Leadership Conference on Civil and  Human Rights and a letter from the American Immigration Lawyers  Association.                                           The Leadership Conference                                       on Civil and Human Rights,                                 Washington, DC, September 13, 2017.         Oppose H.R. 3697, the ``Criminal Alien Gang Removal Act''         Dear Representative: On behalf of The Leadership Conference       on Civil and Human Rights, I am writing to express our       opposition to H.R. 3697, which creates new, sweeping grounds       for barring entry to or deporting immigrants based on the       mere suspicion of gang affiliation. We oppose H.R. 3697 for       the following reasons:        It would subject people who have never committed a crime to       deportation, creating a new definition of ``criminal gang''       that is unworkably vague and could cover a wide range of       organizations ranging from churches to fraternities to       political groups. It shifts the burden to individuals to       prove they did not know they were affiliated with a gang that       committed qualifying offenses, even though proving such a       negative is often impossible.        It would expand the use of mandatory, no-bond detention to       people facing removal under the bill, even if they have not       been convicted of any criminal offenses.        Deportations based on suspected gang membership or       affiliation would likely rely on flawed gang databases, which       are rife with inconsistent definitions, improper       documentation procedures, and inadequate safeguards.        Creating a new ground of deportability for suspected gang       members is also unnecessary, because the government already       has enough tools and resources to deport such individuals.       Most states and the federal government also have laws that       punish or enhance sentences for individuals suspected of       being gang members, recruiting gang members, or committing       crimes while in a gang. In addition, DHS has long prioritized       its resources to target suspected gang members for       deportation.        H.R. 3697 will disproportionately harm younger immigrants--      particularly unaccompanied minors, some of whom flee their       home countries to escape gang violence, forced drug       trafficking, and sexual violence, and who are at high risk of       being coerced to participate in criminal activity. It will       also indiscriminately bar these immigrants from asylum,       withholding of removal, or other forms of humanitarian       relief.        Only a week after the elimination of the Deferred Action       for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, we are deeply       disappointed that Congress's first legislative response is to       further erode due process protections for immigrants and put       them at an even greater risk of deportation. We urge you to       oppose H.R. 3697.            Sincerely,                                                      Vanita Gupta,      President & CEO.                                   ____                                                American Immigration                                             Lawyers Association.    AILA Recommends VOTE NO on H.R. 3697--Revised to Include Goodlatte      Amendment, 9/13/2017--``Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act''         As the national bar association of over 15,000 immigration       lawyers and law professors, AILA recommends that Members of       Congress oppose H.R. 3697, the ``Criminal Alien Gang Member       Removal Act.'' The bill is scheduled to come before the House       Rules Committee on September 12th and to the floor in the       days immediately thereafter.  [[Page H7394]]         While Judiciary Chairman Goodlatte claims that H.R. 3697 is       a ``common sense bill to protect our communities,'' in fact       the bill will do just the opposite: undermine due process and       enable the Trump Administration to deport massive numbers of       foreign nationals who pose no threat to our communities or       national security. The bill is overbroad and provides       government officials with new, expansive powers to detain,       deport, and block noncitizens from the United States       regardless of whether that individual is suspected of,       charged with, or convicted of any specific crime, or whether       the individual poses any risk to public safety. The bill does       not advance its purported public safety goals, and moreover       will place the lives of asylum seekers and other vulnerable       individuals at greater risk of harm.        At a time when our nation urgently needs Congress to reform       our immigration laws, its leadership has chosen instead to       scapegoat immigrants and grant far-reaching enforcement       powers to the government that will result in abuse and       overreach. More than four years have passed since the Senate       passed a comprehensive reform bill. During that time, the       House has refused, and still refuses, to address the needs of       families and businesses waiting in lengthy backlogs for visas       and green cards. The House has yet to bring to a vote a bill       that provides a solution for Dreamers and other unauthorized       persons. American families, businesses and communities need       reform that will strengthen America. H.R. 3697 takes our       country in the wrong direction and should be rejected.        Below is a list of the most harmful provisions in H.R.       3697.        H.R. 3697 creates a sweeping, overly-broad definition of       ``criminal gang'' in immigration law (Section 2(a)). The bill       defines ``criminal gang'' as a group, club or association of       five or more people who, within the last five years, had or       has as one of its primary purposes the commission of a wide       range of conduct including any federally defined felony drug       offense, harboring of immigrants (under INA Sec. 274), the       use of expired identification documents, or obstruction of       justice.        The bill's over-inclusive definition imposes criminal       liability on non-criminal associations, creating the illusion       of a gang where none in fact exists. Under this bill, many       groups could qualify as criminal gangs including a church       group which elects to offer ``sanctuary'' to an undocumented       immigrant or a fraternity whose members use expired       identification documents to purchase liquor.        This definition of ``criminal gang'' is broader than the       existing federal criminal law sentencing enhancement for       ``criminal street gang'' in 18 U.S.C Sec. 521(a). The gang       definition in H.R. 3697 is also far broader than most state       law definitions of criminal gangs. Moreover, INA Sec. 101(53)       permits the Secretary of DHS, in consultation with the       Attorney General, to use the above criteria to designate a       ``criminal gang.''        H.R. 3697 adds inadmissibility and deportability grounds       that violate due process (Sections 2(b) and 2(c)). H.R. 3697       enables an immigration official to deny admission to a       noncitizen if the official has ``reason to believe'' the       person is or has ever been a member of a ``criminal gang'' or       participated in activities associated with such group. The       ``reason to believe'' standard is a low evidentiary standard       and does not require a conviction or even an arrest        Under this low standard, the bill will heighten the risk       that non-dangerous people will be incorrectly and unfairly       classified as gang members. These provisions authorize       government officials to target people for their mere       association with groups considered to be dangerous rather       than for the person's own specific conduct. Authorizing guilt       by association has been shown to lead law enforcement to       engage in discriminatory enforcement and to depend on       unreliable factors as tattoos, style of dress, ethnic       background, or neighborhood associations. Under this bill, an       immigration official may wrongly label a minor as a gang       member for do nothing more than living in a neighborhood with       a large number of immigrants and spending time with a       suspected gang member or for displaying the flag of his home       country.        Goodlatte amendment: The original version of H.R. 3697       submitted to Rules Committee would have allowed this low       ``reason to believe'' standard to apply not only to       admissions but also to deportations of any noncitizen,       including lawful permanent residents. An amendment offered by       Chairman Goodlatte that is now included in the bill removes       ``the reason to believe'' standard with respect to       deportation. Even with this change, the bill would authorize       immigration officials to deport lawful permanent residents       that are associated with a group labeled a ``criminal gang,''       including a group that is wrongfully designated as a gang. As       revised by the Goodlatte Amendment, the bill still applies       the ``reason to believe'' standard to every individual who is       seeking admission--which constitutes the vast majority of       those who are targeted for enforcement.        H.R. 3697 imposes mandatory detention on anyone, including       lawful permanent residents, that an immigration official       deems a member of a criminal gang (Sections 2(e) and 2(i)).       This provision requires ICE to detain a person regardless of       whether that person actually poses a danger to the community       Moreover, H.R. 3697 provides no opportunity for the person to       appear before a judge to request a custody determination--      also known as a bond hearing. In this regard, the bill       completely eliminates an immigration Judge's review of the       officer's decision--a critical component of due process that       prevents unfair government deprivation of liberty.        Any of the people who could be wrongfully labeled as       criminal gang members, innocent youth on the street and       church members, will be subject to automatic unreviewable       detention under this bill. Ensuring that no one is wrongfully       detained by the government is a hallmark of American values       and the Constitution. This bill tramples upon those       principles.        H.R. 3697 threatens protection for vulnerable populations       (Sections 2(f), 2(g), 2(h)). H.R. 3697 not only gives broad       power to immigration officials to designate harmless people       as gang members, but it also renders people merely suspected       of gang association ineligible for humanitarian protection       such as asylum, Temporary Protected Status, and Special       Immigrant Juvenile Status. This bill will prevent bona fide       refugees from seeking legal protection in the United States,       including children fleeing forced gang recruitment and other       victims of abuse encountered by gang members in their home       country. This bill could be used to deny these children       protection and safe haven in the U.S., deporting them back to       their persecutors in violation of U.S. and international       legal protections.        America has always been a beacon of hope for those fleeing       persecution and oppression. H.R. 3697 will extinguish that       beacon by granting extensive powers to the government to       detain and deport people who seek protection. AILA urges       Congress not to pass legislation that undermines due process       protections and would further advance mass deportations of       immigrants and other foreign nationals.     This clearly says this is not a bill against crime,  it is a deportation bill.   Save our children, Mr. Speaker. Let's do something different and  defeat the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3697, the ``Criminal Alien  Gang Member Removal Act of 2017''.   This bill amends the INA to now include a definition for criminal  street gangs as:   An ongoing group, club, organization, or association of 5 or more  persons that has as one of its primary purposes the commission of  certain listed offenses, including: a felony drug offense, including  felony simple possession of marijuana (this would impact high school  kids who may gather to smoke marijuana); bringing in and harboring  certain aliens under INA 274 (this would cover sanctuary sites like  churches that aid undocumented immigrants); identity fraud offenses  (including knowingly possessing a false identity document); crimes  involving obstruction of justice; and burglary.   This bill also defines ``criminal gang'': a group that has been  designated as a criminal gang by the DHS Secretary in consultation with  the Attorney General.   I oppose this unwise and irresponsible legislation because the bill  contains several constitutional and procedural defects, and is an  unnecessary diversion and distraction from the real issues facing the  American people.   As Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Crime Subcommittee, I am  highly disappointed that this bill was rushed to the floor without any  thorough and thoughtful consideration by the Judiciary Committee.   In particular, there was no markup or hearing on this legislation  that has such wide ranging and profound effect on a mass scale.   This bill (1) is constitutionally unsound; (2) has a very low  standard of proof; and (3) will result in a sweeping effect among many  innocent individuals who have not committed any crime, and thus, raises  due process and racial profile concerns.   First, this bill lacks a constitutional construct for how Homeland  Security is to determine its designation of a ``criminal street gang''.   I offered an amendment that would have required a uniform legal  standard, which will govern the identification of Criminal Street gang  members for purposes of ICE enforcement.   According to this bill, `any' immigrant, including minors, such as a  13 or 14 year old juvenile, would be subject to the harsh penalties of  detention and deportation.   If we begin to criminalize for associations then we are heading down  a terribly dark road, particularly with youths. Statistics show that  the brain does not fully develop until the age of 25. To punish them  for mere association based on unsubstantiated evidence is bad  legislation.   According to the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency  Prevention recent report, nationally, 48,043 juvenile offenders were  held in residential placement facilities as of October 28, 2015.   Due to this bill's vague nature, we would add to that alarming  number, and further complicates mass incarceration.   Second, the government's mere belief that someone is associated with  a criminal gang is sufficient. Given the need for the Department of  Homeland Security to come in and deport  [[Page H7395]]  any individual, the bar must be higher than mere suspicion and/or  belief. There must be a clear and convincing standard under these  circumstances.   This bill would capture individuals, even those with permanent  residence status; so long as the government believes the individual is  associated with a criminal street gang.   Even 13 or 14 year old juveniles that the government may believe are  engaging in marijuana use, other drugs, or have association with  criminal gangs would be subject to this bill's penalty.   Third, this bill have a sweeping effect given its vague definition  and overbroad targets for those who may harbor certain aliens and/or  associate with criminal gang members.   This bill has a discriminatory effect in targeting the immigrant  community by criminalizing immigration, and thereby, raises due process  and racial profiling concerns.   Criminal gangs are very complex and are not exclusive to the  immigrant community.   The FBI reports some 33,000 violent street gangs, motorcycle gangs,  and prison gangs with about 1.4 million members that are criminally  active in the U.S. and Puerto Rico today.   Many are sophisticated and well organized; all use violence to  control neighborhoods and boost their illegal moneymaking activities,  which include robbery, drug and gun trafficking, prostitution and human  trafficking, and fraud.   Strikingly, for this conversation, in these 33,000 street gangs, a  significantly larger percentage was non illegal immigrants, unlike the  message purported in this bill.   Some of those street gangs include: 211 Crew, American Front, Aryan  Brotherhood of Texas, Aryan Circle, Aryan Nation, Aryan Republican  Army, Born to Kill, Dead Man Incorporated, European Kindred, just to  name a few here that are mainly white supremacist gang groups. We could  go on, as gangs are found everywhere, in almost every ethnic group.   As legislators on the Judiciary Committee, we argue vigorously on  behalf of the American people, as is the case in any other Committee;  and in doing so, we will sometimes disagree.   So to suggest that we would not have been able to debate the merits  of this bill, so instead bypass the regular process is disheartening.   Are we passionate about the issues that impact our legislative  process, governance, and the American people? Yes we are! And we will  continue to probe vigorously, as a legislative body having  jurisdiction, notwithstanding the subject matter.   We will not stay quiet as to not offend a few when so many issues  with catastrophic consequences may result if we don't speak up.   So Mr. Speaker, I make no apologies for doing my job and questioning  where necessary on behalf of the American people.   We should be having vigorous debate on matters such as jobs, schools,  health care, victims of Charlottesville, victims of climate change,  building bridges, healing broken communities, and bringing this country  together for ``all'' the American people, we are instead debating a  damaged bill in order to advance the President's campaign promise on  mass deportation, thus, distracting us from the people's business.   My amendments attempted to fix some of the glaring defects in this  bill. In its current form, it is bad for our country and does not keep  our communities safe, but instead does the opposite.   For all the reasons stated above, I oppose this bill.    Madam Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the  desk.    I am opposed to the bill in its current form.    Madam Speaker, this is a final amendment to the  bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If  adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as  amended.   While this amendment will not kill the bill, it will save lives. It  does this by transferring $2.4 billion to the FEMA Pre-Disaster  Mitigation account, offset by eliminating the funding for the  President's border wall and new funds for ICE to be used for an  additional 10,000 detention beds.   Mitigation is preplanning. Mitigation is helping to mitigate the  power outages all over the hurricane region. Mitigation is to minimize  losses.   When we listen to the better angels of our nature, we know in our  hearts that this is the right and just and American thing to do.   I along with my colleagues were eyewitnesses to the devastation  inflicted on southeast Texas and Louisiana when struck on August 25,  2017, by Hurricane Harvey.   Our colleagues from Florida and the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto  Rico and those neighbors in the Caribbean are bearing similar witness  to the terrible destruction caused earlier this week by Hurricane Irma.   Irma has taken the lives of at least 75 persons, to date, including  32 in Florida; 5 in the U.S. Virgin Islands, and may be counting  upwards; 37 in the Caribbean; and, as well, 8 seniors who died, and the  numbers may be going up because of those who are critical; and a family  of 6 in the State of Texas. 200,000 Floridians were housed in shelters  as of Monday, and 7.2 million homes and businesses are still without  power.   Our hearts and prayers are with the victims of Hurricane Irma, and  all Americans stand in solidarity with them and pledge to assist them  in the long and hard work of recovery and reconstruction.   Hurricane Harvey is a heartbreaking but, also, a heartwarming story  of horror and heroism. The epic storm dropped 21 trillion gallons of  rainfall on Texas and Louisiana, most of it on the Houston metroplex.  To put this in perspective, that is enough water to fill more than  24,000 Astrodomes or supply water to the power of the raging Niagara  Falls for 15 days.   More than 49,000 homes suffered flood damage. More than 1,000 homes  were completely destroyed in the storm.   But in the response to Hurricane Harvey, the world also saw the large  and small acts of courage and kindness that Americans are known for, by  our volunteers, our military, our Texas National Guard, and many  others.   More than 13,000 people were rescued in the Houston area by the U.S.  Coast Guard and the local first responders, police, fire, and civilian  volunteers risking danger to help their friends and neighbors and  persons they did not even know.   One of those who gave his life in service to others was Sergeant  Steve Perez, who was funeralized yesterday, a 34-year veteran of the  Houston Police Department. He left his home that morning and said: I  have got to go to work. There are things that have to be done.   And then there was the DREAMer, Alonso Guillen, who came to Texas  from Mexico as a teenager, who died  [[Page H7409]]  when his boat capsized while he was rescuing survivors of the flooding.  He was funeralized just a few days ago.   That is who Texans are, and this is what Americans do.   To date, Harvey has claimed the lives of more than 60 persons,  including, as I said, 6 members of the Saldivar family, who perished in  Greens Bayou while trying to evacuate their flooded home and community.   Madam Speaker, Hurricane Harvey was one of the worst, but not the  first, of natural disasters to befall our country; and, as Hurricane  Irma demonstrated, it is not the last. That is why we need to pass this  amendment, so that FEMA has the resources to assist States ahead of  time, U.S. territories, federally recognized Tribes, and local  communities in implementing sustained pre-disaster natural hazard  mitigation programs.   Pre-disaster mitigation funds help reduce overall risk to people and  structures from future disasters, raise public awareness, and reduce  future losses before disaster strikes. I might also mention, it may  deal with the issue of power loss ahead of time.   Mitigation planning is key to breaking the cycle of disaster damage  reconstruction and repeated damage. We needed it. We need more of it.   Madam Speaker, we do not need another 10,000 beds in ICE detention  centers, but we do need more than 10,000 beds in evacuation shelters.   We do not need to spend millions detaining law-abiding families. We  do need to invest in sheltering disaster victims.   This amendment will ensure we spend less on raids and roundups and  more on rescues.   Madam Speaker, we certainly do not need to spend $1.6 billion on a  wall to stem the hoard of bad hombres streaming across our southern  border that exists only in the imagination or paranoia. Those numbers  are down. Know the real immediate threat to the security of our  homeland.   Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill which will not  kill the bill or send it back to committee.   If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage as  amended.   While this amendment will not kill the bill, it will save lives.   It does this by transferring $2.4 billion to the FEMA Pre-Disaster  Mitigation account, offset by eliminating the funding for the  President's border wall and new funds for ICE to be used for an  additional 10,000 detention beds.   When we listen to the better angels of our nature, we know in our  hearts this is the right and just--and the American--thing to do.   I was an eyewitness to the devastation inflicted on Southeast Texas  and Louisiana when struck on August 25, 2017 by Hurricane Harvey.   Our colleagues from the great State of Florida and the U.S. Virgin  Islands are bearing similar witness to the terrible destruction caused  earlier this week by Hurricane Irma.   Hurricane Irma has taken the lives of at least 75 persons to date,  including 32 in Florida, 5 in the U.S. Virgin Islands, and 37 in the  Caribbean island nations of Barbuda, St. Maarten, Antigua, St. Kitts  and Nevis.   200,000 Floridians were housed in shelters as of Monday and 7.2  million homes and businesses are still without power.   Our hearts and prayers are with the victims of Hurricane Irma and all  Americans stand in solidarity with them and pledge to assist them in  the long and hard work of recovery and reconstruction.   Hurricane Harvey is a heart-breaking but also heartwarming story of  horror and heroism.

Another who gave his life in service to others was Sergeant Steve  Perez, a 34-year veteran of the Houston Police Department, who insisted  on reporting for duty early despite his beloved wife's pleas that he  stay home given the dangerous conditions outside.   That is who Texans are and this is what Americans do.   To date Hurricane Harvey has claimed the lives of more than 60  persons, including six members of the Saldivar family who perished in  Greens Bayou while trying to evacuate their flooded home and community.   Mr. Speaker, Hurricane Harvey was one of the worst, but not the  first, natural disasters to befall our country, and as Hurricane Irma  demonstrates, it is not the last.   And that is why we need to pass this amendment so that FEMA has the  resources needed to assist States, U.S. Territories, Federally- recognized tribes, and local communities in implementing sustained pre- disaster natural hazard mitigation programs.   Pre-Disaster Mitigation funds help reduce overall risk to people and  structures from future disasters and raise public awareness about  reducing future losses before disaster strikes.

And Mr. Speaker, we certainly do not need to spend $1.6 billion on a  wall to stem the horde of bad hombres streaming across our southern  border that exists only in imagination or paranoia.   No, the real and immediate threat to the security of our homeland is  the destructive power of the apocalyptic invading armies of wind and  water, appearing in the form of hurricanes and floods.   We do not need to waste money building a wall to prevent river  crossings on the southern border.   We do need more pre-Disaster funding to help people get across the  rivers running through the streets of our cities and towns when  hurricanes strike unleashing floods.   Mr. Speaker, the choice now before the House is whether we should  have more beds in detention centers or more beds in evacuation  shelters.   Instead of the closed and angry fist of walls, roundups, and  detention, we should choose instead to extend an open and loving hand  to help the hopeless, homeless, and helpless.   In doing so, we reveal the true character of our nation and earn the  blessings of our Creator.   I urge all Members to support this motion to recommit.   I ask for support of the Jackson Lee amendment to provide for the  safety and security of the American people.    Madam Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
