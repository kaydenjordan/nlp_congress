 Mr. Speaker, I supported this bill when it came out of  the Energy and Commerce Committee 2 or 3 weeks ago, and I want to thank  Chairman Walden for his excellent leadership.   As he knows, I had some concerns about the bill at the time. I didn't  think it addressed all the problems that we needed to address.   At the start of this week, I was a ``no'' vote--a friendly ``no''  vote, but I was a ``no'' vote. Our Republican leadership in the House  and the President and his senior advisers continued to involve  themselves in constructive discussions with people like myself.  Yesterday they agreed to put back in the repeal of the essential health  benefits provision, and that is a big win for conservative values, so I  am now a ``yes'' vote.   My friends on the left seem to think the only way to get a benefit is  to have the Federal Government mandate it and then have the Federal  Government pay for it. I am here to tell you, Mr. Speaker, that markets  work. If we create a healthcare market where people can choose their  insurance that fits their needs, there will be plans that provide for  every so-called essential health benefit. But there will also be plans  that provide for specific markets of young people without children or  elderly couples or whatever it is.   Mr. Speaker, markets work, and you don't have to mandate benefits for  those markets to work.    Mr. Speaker, we always want to score a touchdown.  Sometimes we take a field goal. What we don't want to do today is take  a safety.   Vote for this bill. Let's send it to the other body and continue to  work to improve it. It is a good bill. Please vote ``yes.''
