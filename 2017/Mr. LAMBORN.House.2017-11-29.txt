 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Gosar for his leadership  on this and other issues in the Congressional Western Caucus.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, mining in the Superior National Forest, where these  leases are located, has previously been authorized by Congress on  several occasions. First in 1950, and again in 1978.   With that bill--the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness Act-- Congress established a compromise in which mining was prohibited within  the 1.1 million acre Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, but  specifically authorized in the Superior National Forest.   Likewise, U.S. Forest Service plans for these areas have identified  mining in these Superior Forest locations as a ``desired condition.''   Despite this longstanding precedent, in December of 2016, the Obama  administration abruptly canceled mining leases that have been held and  renewed for decades in northern Minnesota. Then in January, the day  before leaving office, President Obama signed off on a mineral  withdrawal for an area spanning 425,000 acres, including 95,000 acres  of State school trust fund lands.   There is a torrent of misinformation surrounding this bill, with  alarmist groups begging that we ``save the Boundary Waters.''   Mr. Speaker, the Boundary Waters were saved in 1978. The low-impact  mining arrangements that these mining leases entail do not endanger the  Boundary Waters, which is itself protected by a significant buffer as  well.   The bill reiterates--redundantly, I will add, but in order to make it  crystal clear--that mining is prohibited in the Boundary Waters and the  surrounding buffer. To say otherwise is a blatant falsehood.   A few other facts that you won't hear from alarmists but that deserve  to be said: this bill retains the full protections enshrined across the  array of environmental laws and regulations which apply to mine  leasing, permitting, and operation. The most notable in this case are  the National Environmental Policy Act--NEPA--and the Clean Water Act,  which still apply, in full.   But the fact is that this bill is not about removing environmental  protections, as some may have said.   Rather, what about when you don't actually remove any?   Rather, what initiated this situation is an arbitrary overreach by  the Obama administration at the last minute. It was looking to score  political points on its way out the door by taking the near- unprecedented action of initiating a full mineral withdrawal. That was  undemocratic, and the huge support that this bill and mining in general  enjoys in Minnesota's Eighth Congressional District, where the Superior  Forest is located, is proof positive. But Article IV of the  Constitution vests Congress with authority over public lands, and it is  now up to us to act.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate this chance to clear the air on some of the  misconceptions and falsehoods that have been tarnishing this bill. It  really is unfortunate that commonsense, local issues like this one are  being dragged into a national partisan brawl. Nevertheless, I hope my  colleagues are able to see through the deception, recognize the clear  benefits of mining in Minnesota, and vote ``yes'' on this important  bill.   Finally, I would like to share some comments from the Associated  General Contractors of Minnesota, who noted that ``H.R. 3905 changes no  environmental review processes, relaxes no environmental standards, and  specifically restates Congress' prohibition on any mining activity in  the BWCAW and the surrounding protective buffer.''   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record their full letter.                                      Associated General Contractors                                                    of Minnesota,                                                  November 22, 2017.        Dear Congressman Walz: On behalf of the Associated General       Contractors of Minnesota and our over 400 member firms, I am       writing to urge your support for H.R. 3905, the ``Minnesota's       Economic Rights (MINER) in the Superior National Forest       Act,'' bipartisan legislation sponsored by Cong. Tom Emmer       (MN-6th) and cosponsored by Cong. Collin Peterson (MN-7th),       Cong. Jason Lewis (MN-2nd) and Cong. Paul Gosar (AZ-4th).       H.R. 3905 is currently on the agenda of the House Rules       Committee, on a path for House floor action in the coming       weeks.        In 1950, Congress took action to make land available for       mineral exploration and development within the Superior       National Forest (SNF) within the Iron Range region in       Northeast Minnesota. In 1978, Congress prohibited mining       within the region's Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness       (BWCAW) and an adjacent protective buffer zone, while       reaffirming that mining should be allowed and promoted in the       remaining area of the SNF.        H.R. 3905 aims to correct the injustices being thrust upon       the Iron Range by requiring congressional approval of any       mineral withdrawal or monument designation involving the       National Forest System lands in the State of Minnesota, as       well as providing for the renewal of certain mineral leases       and ensuring future leases in the area remain valid and       renewed as outlined by current law. Moreover, H.R. 3905       changes no environmental review processes, relaxes no       environmental standards, and specifically restates  [[Page H9500]]       Congress' prohibition on any mining activity in the BWCAW and       surrounding protective buffer.        H.R. 3905 would reaffirm long-standing Congressional intent       in the management and development of critical minerals in       Minnesota, eliminate bureaucratic delays in developing       environmentally-responsible mine projects proposals, and       restore the promise of future job growth and economic       opportunity to an economically distressed region of the       state.        We strongly urge your vote in support of H.R. 3905. Thank       you for your support of mining in Minnesota and the thousands       of good paying jobs that are sustained through safe and       effective management of these natural resources.            Sincerely,                                                         Tim Worke,                                                               CEO.
