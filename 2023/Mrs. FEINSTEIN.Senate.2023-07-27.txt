 Mr. President, I rise today to pay a heartfelt  tribute to my long-time director of communications, Tom Mentzer, who  passed away after a lengthy battle with cancer. Tom was a larger than  life personality and his loss is still felt deeply by myself and our  entire office.   Tom was born in Poulsbo, WA, but spent a large part of his youth in  Germany in the cities of Kaiserslautern and Heidelberg. He was a  graduate of Heidelberg American High School and went on to DePauw  University, where he majored in political science and communications.  Tom stayed in Indiana for his graduate work and completed his master's  in journalism at Indiana University in 2001.   He began his communications career in 1994 as a reporter for the  Heidelberg Herald-Post. Upon completion of his masters, Tom began work  with Scripps Howard News Service before joining the Urban Institute. In  2007, he was hired as a press secretary for Congressman Sam Farr. Tom  joined my staff in 2010 as a press secretary, and 4 years later, he  assumed the role of director of communications, which he maintained  until his passing.   Tom was among the best at his craft and he played a role in messaging  nearly every piece of legislation from my office. I valued his wise  counsel on many contentious issues, and he was by my side during the  release of the torture report as well as multiple reelection campaigns,  appropriations fights, and Supreme Court nominations. He was essential  to our efforts on ending gun violence, climate change, water issues,  and the Lake Tahoe Summit.   Always ready with a humorous quip, Tom understood how to lighten the  mood during the most difficult of days. His zeal for life was  infectious, and it extended to many things outside of the office,  including travel, sports, cooking, food, and drinks. Tom had a unique  ability to connect with people from all walks of life and was a mentor  to many in our office. He had an empathy that I admired, and I, like so  many others, will greatly miss his wry take on issues of the day.   Tom was private about his cancer diagnosis, and many did not know the  extent of the disease. Although he did not beat cancer, he was  determined not to let it define him. He was fond of a quote by the late  comedian Norm MacDonald, who said, ``I'm no doctor, but I'm pretty sure  if you die, the cancer dies at the same time. That's not a loss. That's  a draw.''   I will forever be grateful for Tom's wisdom and dedication to my  office and the people of California. I offer my sincere condolences to  Tom's family and his wife Kristen, with whom he shared the better part  of 22 years of his life. I wish all of them the best during this  difficult chapter of their lives.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to give a belated and  fond farewell to a valued and long-standing member of my staff, Mr.  David Grannis.   Every Member of this Chamber understands the importance of having  wise counsel in their corner. It is not only important, but essential,  in order to produce meaningful results for your constituents. To that  end, David Grannis was an essential part of my team for the past 5  years while serving as the chief of staff to my office.   I previously offered a similar tribute to David in 2016, when he left  his position as staff director for the Senate Select Committee on  Intelligence to serve as the Principal Deputy Under Secretary at the  Department of Homeland Security's Office of Intelligence and Analysis.  I will be forever grateful for his return to my personal office, where  he ably guided my staff through multiple Supreme Court nominations,  impeachments, all-night vote-a-ramas, a global pandemic, and an  insurrection. I will also always remember his support during a  particularly difficult period after my husband's passing in 2022.   David has had a long and distinguished history of public service. In  addition to his time with the Department of Homeland Security, he  served on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence for over a  decade, beginning as my designee in March of 2005, then serving as my  staff director beginning in January of 2009 when I took over as chair  of the committee. Prior to joining the Intelligence Committee in 2005,  David worked on the House Select Committee on Homeland Security and was  the senior policy adviser to Representative Jane Harman on matters of  national security.  [[Page S3745]]    Before coming to Congress, David worked for 2 years at the National  Research Council's Board on Chemical Sciences and Technology on  projects studying the ability to make explosives more detectable and  identifiable. He has a master's of public policy from the Harvard  Kennedy School of Government, where he worked for former Secretary of  Defense Ash Carter.   As my chief of staff, David led with wit and wisdom and demonstrated  an uncanny ability to get the job done. He has been by my side for  countless meetings with foreign leaders, ambassadors, military  commanders, corporate chiefs, and local officials. David has served as  a mentor for many members of my staff and his professionalism and  dedication are second to none. He is someone that I am proud to call a  friend.   I would also like to take this opportunity to thank David's wife,  Kerry Searle Grannis, and their three wonderful children: Owen, Amelia,  and Nathaniel. The chief of staff job is certainly not always easy. I  appreciate their support of David throughout his tenure with my office,  and I hope his next venture will allow for more time with his family.   While I am sad to see David leave, I am thrilled that he has taken on  a new role as the executive director for the Commission on the National  Defense Strategy. I have every confidence that his steady hand, insight  on the issues, and decisive leadership will serve the commission well.   I thank David for his years of dedicated service to the people of  California. I wish him all the best in his future endeavors, and I will  deeply miss him.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise today to introduce the EQIP  Water Conservation Act of 2023 and thank Senators Marshall, Bennet,  Lujan, Padilla, Kelly, and Sinema for joining me as original  cosponsors.   Our bill would clarify eligibility requirements for water  conservation and irrigation efficiency practices funded under the U.S.  Department of Agriculture's Environmental Quality Incentives Program,  EQIP, to allow irrigation districts to undertake large-scale off-farm  water conservation projects that benefit many farms rather than only  single-farm projects.   Drought poses a persistent and potentially lethal threat to  agriculture in Western States. In 2021 alone, drought cost California's  agricultural sector $1.1 billion in direct costs and nearly 9,000 jobs,  while farmers were forced to leave 400,000 acres of land unplanted.  This situation is causing irreparable harm to agricultural communities  across the West, and farmers need tools to adapt. EQIP is a crucial  tool in the effort to combat drought, and the programs' funds must be  made fully available to water agencies, which often serve hundreds of  farmers.   In the 2018 farm bill, Congress authorized the Secretary of  Agriculture to waive payment limitations and adjusted gross income,  AGI, limitations to more effectively support water district projects  that conserve water, provide fish and wildlife habitat, and combat  drought. However, a subsequent USDA rule effectively nullified this  provision by capping EQIP payments for water agencies at $900,000,  which is only twice the cap for projects that benefit individual  farmers.   Since water agencies often serve dozens or even hundreds of farmers,  this rule makes no sense and undermines the 2018 farm bill's goal of  facilitating water conservation projects by water agencies.   Our bill would require the Secretary of Agriculture to waive the EQIP  payment cap of $900,000 for water agencies. To be clear, this bill does  not attempt to bypass the payment cap for individual farms; rather, it  would set the cap on projects based on the number of farmers it serves.  For instance, if a water agency serves 10 farmers, the total payment  limitation would be $4.5 million, or $450,000 per farmer. Our bill  would also deduct for EQIP payments already made to farmers served by  that agency's project.   In maintaining a per-farmer payment limitation at the same level as  the limit for individual farmers, our bill recognizes that water  agencies serve many farmers and that providing adequate funds to these  entities will allow USDA to more effectively meet conservation and  irrigation efficiency goals.   Congress has an opportunity this year to make significant strides in  improving irrigation efficiency and water conservation while more  faithfully adhering to the conservation goals of the 2018 farm bill. I  thank my cosponsors for their partnership on this bill, and I urge the  Senate to take it up and pass it as soon as possible.                                  ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. Padilla):   S. 2697. A bill to amend the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development  Act to modify the definitions of the terms ``rural'' and ``rural area''  for purposes of grants and loans to remedy a lack of compliance with  certain drinking water standards, and for other purposes; to the  Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.    Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Clean  Drinking Water for Rural Communities Act of 2023 and thank my colleague  Senator Padilla for joining me as an original cosponsor.   Our bill would change the eligibility limit for the water and  wastewater programs within the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Office  of Rural Development from 10,000 residents to 20,000 residents for  investments to treat contaminated drinking water that does not meet  Federal and State standards. Modifying the threshold would correct an  oversight that is a barrier for many rural and agricultural communities  to access clean drinking water.   Many rural communities across the United States lack access to safe  drinking water because their aging systems have not kept pace with  worsening pollution. In many of these communities, agricultural runoff  has caused nitrate concentrations to soar, which can cause cancer,  thyroid disease, and developmental defects. The problem has become  widespread in low-income, rural, and farmworker communities in  California's Central Valley, where the majority of residents get their  water from wells without any treatment system.   Unfortunately, the cost of addressing this problem can be prohibitive  for small water systems that serve mostly low-income residents. Many of  these communities exceed the 10,000-resident limit for USDA programs  but are too small to be competitive for other drinking water assistance  programs. These communities are left to rely on bottled water or  drinking water that does not comply with Federal or State standards.   The small change proposed in this bill would enable more communities  in the Central Valley and around the country to use USDA funds to  remove contamination or connect to larger water systems.   Congress has an opportunity this year to make this small change to  USDA's Water and Waste Disposal Loan and Grant Program to improve  access to safe, clean drinking water for individuals in small,  agricultural communities. I thank Senator Padilla for his partnership  on this bill, and I urge the full Senate to take it up and pass it as  soon as possible.                                  ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. Padilla):   S. 2698. A bill to require the Secretary of Agriculture to carry out  a program to provide payments to producers experiencing certain crop  losses as a result of a disaster; to the Committee on Agriculture,  Nutrition, and Forestry.    Madam President, I rise today to introduce the  Agricultural Emergency Relief Act of 2023 and thank my colleague  Senator Padilla for joining me as an original cosponsor.   Our bill would establish a consistent structure and end the delays in  administering ad hoc agricultural disaster assistance by authorizing  the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Emergency Relief Program. In  addition to improving the distribution of supplemental disaster funds  appropriated by Congress, this program would encourage participation in  crop insurance by requiring producers who receive relief payments to  purchase 2 years of insurance.   Every year, farmers across the country are contending with disasters  of increasing severity and frequency, whether droughts and wildfires in  the West, hurricanes in the Southeast, freezes in the Midwest, or  flooding throughout the country. In some cases, crop insurance is able  to cover the damages caused by these storms, but producers often  require additional assistance due to the scale of the damage. This is  especially true with specialty crops, where producers may lack  affordable insurance options and, as a result, often operate with  little coverage or no insurance at all. Federal disaster assistance has  been a critical bridge back to production for these farmers, who are  producing the Nation's food supply amid the worsening impacts of  climate change.   Since fiscal year 2018, Congress has appropriated more than $19  billion for agricultural disaster assistance. However, these funds,  lacking proper authorizing language, have been distributed through four  different USDA programs, with changing requirements, forms, and  processes from year to year. Each time USDA has had to create a new  program, administrative delays have slowed the dispersal of relief,  leaving producers, their families, and their communities in limbo.  Farmers deserve more reliability, which our bill would provide.   Our bill would authorize USDA's Emergency Relief Program to provide  consistent, authorized guidelines for program administration of ad hoc  disaster funds. Payment calculations for farmers would rely on  indemnities reported to USDA or on calculation of  [[Page S3765]]  lost revenue. This flexibility will help support farmers producing both  commodities and specialty crops. Our bill would also require producers  to purchase crop insurance for 2 years after receiving a relief  payment.   Congress has an opportunity to provide clarity and consistency to our  Nation's farmers who have weathered disasters and delays in assistance.  I thank Senator Padilla for his partnership on this bill, and I urge  the Senate to take it up and pass it as soon as possible.                                  ______                                         By Mr. PADILLA (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Ms. Hirono, Mr.          Markey, Mrs. Gillibrand, and Mr. Booker):   S. 2701. A bill to address the homelessness and housing crises, to  move toward the goal of providing for a home for all Americans, and for  other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban  Affairs.    Madam President, I rise today to introduce the EQIP  Water Conservation Act of 2023 and thank Senators Marshall, Bennet,  Lujan, Padilla, Kelly, and Sinema for joining me as original  cosponsors.
