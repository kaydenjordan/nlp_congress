 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 250th  anniversary of Fincastle, Virginia.   In 1772, western-moving settlers John Mill and Israel Christian  founded the town of Fincastle, and by 1784 there were 59 homes as well  as taverns and the early formation of a justice system.   Once Virginia's gateway to the West, Fincastle is the county seat of  Botetourt, which once extended to the Mississippi River. Meriweather  Lewis and William Clark visited Fincastle during their great expedition  into the West. William returned to Fincastle and married Julia Hancock  in 1808 in the historic home, Santillane. The town has been nationally  recognized as a Lewis and Clark community.   Passing settlers stopped in Fincastle on their way into the interior  of what would become the United States, conducting business and buying  goods from the merchants in town.   Today, Fincastle proudly maintains its heritage and history.   Their version of the Botetourt County Courthouse, designed by  President Thomas Jefferson, is located in Fincastle and contains  records going back hundreds of years.   Fincastle's annual Historic Fincastle Festival will be a bit more  special this year, celebrating the town's 250th anniversary, and being  held this weekend.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent this historic town, a bedrock of  the oldest colony and the great Commonwealth of Virginia.                            biden's radical agenda     Mr. Speaker, I rise to criticize President Biden and House  Democrats in Washington for turning their backs on hardworking  families.   Month after month, they have continued to advance a radical agenda  that has crushed the American Dream.   Grocery costs are up 13\1/2\ percent, electricity costs are up 15\1/ 2\ percent, fuel oil costs are up nearly 70 percent. Everything has  gone up since this failed President took office. Why? Because Biden and  the Democrats are obsessed with spending taxpayer dollars and pushing  Socialist Green New Deal policies.   Last week, after yet another inflation report showed that prices were  up again, Joe Biden and the Democrats threw a party at the White House.  To add insult to injury, on his recent interview on ``60 Minutes,''  President Biden had zero remorse for the devastating effects of his  raging inflation crisis.   He continues to claim that the economy is great and that tons of jobs  are being created. That is a lie. Here is what he is not telling you.  Full-time jobs are way down, and it is only part-time jobs that are  growing.   Biden and Democrats have sent a clear message that they don't care  about American families. There is one solution to this problem: Stop  reckless government spending. Virginia families are sick and tired of  paying the price for Biden's radical agenda.   When Republicans retake the majority next year, we will end this  inflation-fueled spending, fix this broken economy, and deliver power  back to the American people.  [[Page H8016]]
