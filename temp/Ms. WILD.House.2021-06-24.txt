 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the child tax  credit, which will start reaching families next month.   It is hard to overstate the tremendous good that the American Rescue  Plan is doing for people all across Pennsylvania and, indeed, all  across this country. Soon, we will see even more direct relief heading  to families in Monroe, Northampton, and Lehigh Counties in my district.   Starting in July, nearly all families with children in my district  will receive monthly payments of up to $300 per child through the end  of the year as part of the expanded and improved child tax credit. The  expanded and improved child tax credit will be a lifeline for many  struggling families, helping more than 133,000 children in my district.   I cannot overstate how meaningful this assistance is to families who  have been hit so hard this past year. These are payments that will help  families pay for the cost of childcare, healthcare, diapers, and  clothing. For many, these payments will be the difference between food  on the table or hunger.   I am proud to have fought for and passed the American Rescue Plan,  and I am glad we were able to get important help like the child tax  credit into the hands of families across Pennsylvania 7.                            ____________________
