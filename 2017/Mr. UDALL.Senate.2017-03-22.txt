 Mr. President, Ta-Nez-Bah means in Navajo ``one who  completes a circle.'' Ta-Nez-Bah was an apt middle name for Pablita  Abeyta whose life encircled art, advocacy, and dedication to Native  peoples.   Pablita Ta-Nez-Bah Abeyta was born in Gallup, NM, in 1953, to Narciso  Ha-So-De Abeyta and Sylvia Ann (Shipley) Abeyta. Her father was Navajo  and an internationally recognized painter and silversmith. Her mother  was Anglo and a Quaker and an accomplished ceramist and weaver in her  own right.   Pablita and her six siblings were raised in and around the arts and  the traditions of the Navajo people. Each had an artistic talent. Her  sister Elizabeth was a masterful sculptor and ceramic artist; her  brother Tony is a highly acclaimed painter and jeweler; and her sister  Alice Seely is a nationally recognized sculptor, painter, and jeweler.   Pablita attended the Institute for American Indian Arts in Santa Fe  and received a masters in public affairs from the University of New  Mexico in 1983.   She then headed off to Washington, DC, where she would combine  advocacy and art the rest of her life and where she would play a key  role in founding the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of the  American Indian, NMAI.   Pablita had a full career on Capitol Hill for many years until her  retirement, always advocating for Native causes. She lobbied for the  Navajo Nation; worked as a legislative aide to U.S. Representative Ben  Nighthorse Campbell from Colorado; staffed the U.S. House Interior  Committee's Office of Indian Affairs under my uncle, U.S.  Representative Mo Udall; held a legislative liaison position at the  Smithsonian Institute; and served as special assistant with the NMAI.   Pablita attended the first congressional hearing on NMAI in 1987,  worked for its establishment through congressional legislation, and  worked on its highly successful private fundraising drive. Her work was  instrumental to starting and building the museum.   Pablita was also an accomplished sculptor. Inspired by the strength,  beauty, and serenity of Native women, her sculptures have been  described as ``smooth, round and sensuous.'' Her artwork won many  awards at the Santa Fe Indian Market, was included in a Smithsonian  National Museum of American History exhibition, and is held in the  permanent collection of the NMAI. Pablita commented of her sculptures  that ``. . . the female figurines sing, talk, and reflect the seasons  and Navajo spiritual ceremony. I am making a statement with my art  about the importance of family, community and my heritage.''   Pablita passed away January 31, 2017, at age 63. She completed many  circles in her life, and I honor all that she accomplished.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to Wilson  Miles Halona, an outstanding member of the Navajo Nation, a loving  husband and father, and a courageous American veteran. Sadly, at age  95, he passed away February 28, 2017.   Mr. Halona was born January 1, 1922, in the Chuska Mountains near  Tohatchi, NM. His maternal clan was the Ashiihi, Salt People Clan, and  his paternal clan was To'hani, Near the Water People Clan. He was the  son of sheep herders, Barney and Annie Halona. One of his sons tells  the story of Mr. Halona's mother going into labor with him as she was  herding sheep in the middle of winter. She stopped to give birth,  outside in the cold, and then went back to herding. He came from strong  stock.   This is the second time I have had the privilege to honor Mr. Halona.  The first was on November 20, 2012, at the Pueblo Indian Cultural  Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Mr. Wilson was a World War II hero,  but had not received the recognition he deserved. Almost 60 years after  the war, his family worked to make sure he received the acknowledgment  and medals he earned for his bravery and service.   Mr. Halona was part of the D-Day invasion. Serving in the Army, he  and his fellow soldiers landed in Normandy, on Utah Beach, in July  1944. They were part of the third wave of American soldiers to land,  and there were already many casualties scattered on the beach.   Mr. Halona was a gunner. As he and his battalion started moving  inland, they encountered heavy gunfire from Germans who were dug into  mountaintops along the beach in cement bunkers. The American troops  returned the gunfire and fought for over 3 hours before they destroyed  two German bunkers. Mr. Halona's battalion stopped further casualties  and took control of the beachfront.   They headed to Brussels and then on to Bonn and Luxembourg, where the  U.S. had established a military base. Winter came upon them, and they  were snowed in for 4 months. After the snow cleared, the battalion  moved to take over Munich, where they saw firsthand the death and  destruction of the Holocaust. In Stuttgart, they drove out the Germans,  captured Hitler's top generals, transferred them to jail in Nuremburg,  and kept guard. Mr. Halona himself guarded Reichsmarschall Hermann  Goering for several hours. Mr. Halona credited his Navajo traditions  and prayers for helping him during and after the war.   When Mr. Halona was finally given the honors owed in 2012, he  received the Good Conduct Medal, European-African-Middle Eastern  Campaign Medal with one Silver Service Star, World War II Victory  Medal, the Honorable Service Lapel Button WWII, and the Sharpshooter  Badge with Rifle Bar Presentation. I was deeply honored that he asked  me to present his medals.   Mr. Halona served the Navajo Nation with distinction as well. He was  a member of the Navajo Nation Council for four terms and president of  the Tohatchi chapter for eight terms. He was first appointed to the  advisory board for the Navajo Housing Authority and then served as its  first chair. He was instrumental in developing the housing authority-- The Navajo Housing Authority was one of the first tribal housing  authorities to be funded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban  Development--and making sure that Navajo people had better living  conditions. He worked to develop the Indian Health Service within the  Navajo Nation and to build schools on the reservation. He even helped  create the Navajo rodeo association. Mr. Halona's service to his tribe  stretched far and deep.   Mr. Halona was married to his wife, Ruby Arviso, from 1942 until her  passing in 2013. He had 7 children, and is survived by 5, along with 16  grandchildren and 29 great-grandchildren.   Wilson Miles Halona lived a life of service to family, tribe, and  Nation. I honor his life and his work.  [[Page S1932]]                                ____________________
