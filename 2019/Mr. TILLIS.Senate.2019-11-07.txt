 Mr. President, I rise today to pay MG Gregory A.  Lusk, the Adjutant General of the North Carolina National Guard, for  his many years of service to the great State of North Carolina.   Major General Lusk has served as the 40th Adjutant General of the  North Carolina National Guard with distinction for nearly a decade.  Major General Lusk's adept leadership over the roughly 11,500 citizen  soldiers and airmen serving in the North Carolina Army and Air National  Guard has been prominently displayed during the multiple harrowing  natural disasters that have struck North Carolina in recent years. In  2018, Major General Lusk oversaw a massive mobilization of N.C.  Guardsmen prior to the landfall of Hurricane Florence. During the  ensuing deployment, 3,400 N.C. Guardsmen assisted local, State, and  Federal disaster response teams on hundreds dangerous search and rescue  operations vital missions to provide lifesaving relief to evacuated  families. In total, more than 1,300 North Carolinians were safely  evacuated from dangerous floodwaters due to the effective command of  Major General Lusk and the efforts of the North Carolina National  Guard.   The tireless leadership of Major General Lusk has been invaluable  during the numerous overseas deployments, stateside military exercises,  and natural disaster responses that the North Carolina National Guard  has participated in since his appointment to adjutant general in 2010.  Major General Lusk's contribution to advancing the overall readiness  and operational capabilities of the North Carolina National Guard has  been critical in maintaining an effective and resilient Reserve Force.  Through operations including Inherent Resolve, Enduring Freedom, and  Freedom's Sentinel, as well as during the Hurricanes Irene, Matthew,  Florence, and Dorian, Major General Lusk has ensured that the men and  women of the Guard had the utmost preparation and training for every  mission that they embarked on.   Major General Lusk has selflessly served the state of North Carolina  and our Nation for almost 40 years. Following his commissioning through  the Reserve Officer Training Program at North Carolina State University  in 1982, Major General Lusk was stationed throughout the State and  around the world as he rose from a second lieutenant to a major  general. Major General Lusk was mobilized twice to Iraq as both an  executive officer and a commander of the 30th Heavy Brigade Combat  Team, commanding 4,000 North Carolina Guardsmen in support of Operation  Iraqi Freedom.   As a U.S. Senator, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee,  and a North Carolinian, I am pleased to congratulate Major General  Gregory Lusk on his retirement, for his impressive career of military  service and steadfast commitment to our country.                            ____________________
