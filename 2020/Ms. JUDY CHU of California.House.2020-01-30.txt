 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong  support of Congress Member Khanna's resolution to prevent any funds  from being used for an unauthorized war with Iran.   Just a few weeks ago, America and Iran were on the brink of a  terrible and destructive conflict. Fortunately, both sides stepped  back, but the tensions and volatility remain.   Make no mistake, Iran continues to be a challenge and continues to  threaten U.S. interests in the region. However, as the Iran nuclear  deal demonstrated, conflict is not inevitable.   But with a President committed to a campaign of maximum pressure, we  cannot simply wait for the next crisis and hope for the best. That is  why we must reclaim Congress' constitutional authority to declare war  and prevent the President from leading us into a war of choice.   Already, the House passed a bipartisan War Powers Resolution to force  the President to seek congressional authorization for any war with  Iran. Today's resolution would help enforce that by prohibiting the use  of funds for an unauthorized war.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
