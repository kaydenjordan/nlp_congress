 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from New York, and I  particularly thank her for her very cogent remarks and wish to  associate myself with those remarks in every sense of the word; and I  say so to the good lady from the State of New York as the leader of the  CBC task force on Federal court nominations, including the Supreme  Court nomination, where I have had the opportunity to look deeply at  the decisions of this nominee now serving on the court of appeals, as  it turns out, for the District of Columbia, Brett Kavanaugh.   I think the gentlewoman's remarks are telling in their understanding  of the extreme damage he would do--and I must add not only to African  Americans, but to the rule of law as we have known it.   I rise to indicate that the Congressional Black Caucus stands in  strong opposition to the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, and we  will be doing all we can to keep that nomination from proceeding to the  floor of the Senate. We do have two members of the Congressional Black  Caucus on the Judiciary Committee in the Senate, and we are working  closely with them as well.   We in the Congressional Black Caucus are not the only Members of  Congress opposed to this nomination, but we represent those Americans  who have been disproportionately dependent on a fair Supreme Court.  African Americans have always been a minority group in our country. For  that reason, from slavery on to the days of discrimination in the 19th  and 20th centuries, the African American community has been  particularly dependent on the courts of the United States to protect  them from unequal treatment by the majority.   We have had every reason to know that, if we are in the hands of the  partisan majority, given 400 years of history, we have no protection.  African Americans are disproportionately dependent on an objective  Supreme Court. Now, that doesn't mean a Supreme Court of our choosing,  but a Supreme Court that is open to all points of view and capable of  seeing beyond partisanship.   Brett Kavanaugh is not that nominee. We know so because he has  perhaps the longest record of opinions of names submitted to  Republicans for review.   The D.C. circuit, which is the federal Court of Appeals for the  District of Columbia, which happens to be my district, has been a  circuit where Kavanaugh has been very mindful of the Supreme Court. I  say that because he has so often written in dissent from his own  colleagues on a Republican Court that it has been as if he were trying  to write his way onto the Supreme Court.   Remember Kavanaugh's background. He started his career as a political  operative in the Bush administration, and he has brought that extreme  partnership, as a political operative, straight into the D.C. circuit.   We are not asking the Senate for a nominee of the kind we would have  chosen. That is not our demand. But because this is the most partisan  Congress since the Civil War, I believe we are within our rights in  asking for a Court that would be a stabilizing influence so the  American people could see that not all is lost because there is an  objective actor on the scene, and that actor is the Supreme Court of  the United States.   It is that Court which has protected us, we who are African  Americans, from unequal treatment ever since Brown v. Board of  Education in 1954. That does not mean that African Americans have  always won at the Supreme Court level, but they have always had reason  to believe that there was a court of last resort that would be open to  them.   We no longer would have that sense of openness to their views if  Brett Kavanaugh becomes the nominee put  [[Page H6253]]  forward in this session. We have seen no evidence that he would adhere  to equal protection of the laws.   I will cite some examples that illustrate where his views in his  cases lead that he would not protect the long-held holding of the  courts that no American can be arrested without probable cause, that he  would not protect even the separation of powers, and that he would not  uphold the rights of Americans to qualify for affordable healthcare.   All of those notions have a disproportionate effect on African  Americans, though they affect every American in the United States.   Remember, Judge Kavanaugh would be appointed to a Court that already  has a majority appointed by Republican Presidents. Yet, while sitting  on the D.C. court of appeals, he has distinguished himself by seeking  to overturn long-existing precedent, even when members of that court,  also appointed by Republican Presidents, have disagreed with him.   Let me give an example in an area of criminal law.   We now see African Americans in the streets protesting overzealous  law enforcement because African American men have been shot and killed  and people go to the streets because, if you can't get justice to the  courts, that is all they have.                                time  2030    Yet, Judge Kavanaugh has suggested that it is appropriate for the  probable cause standard to be more ``flexible.'' Why?   Virtually no police have indeed been indicted, even given the  evidence of African Americans shot down in the streets. Why do we need  to narrow the ancient probable cause requirement?   He has indicated that police searches without a warrant or  individualized suspicion should be allowed. He has even praised  narrowing the rights long ago afforded to all defendants against  incriminatory statements against themselves. How deep does that go in  American constitutional law? How dangerous would it be to have a  justice who would question the right against self incrimination?   Judge Kavanaugh's extreme views also show no respect for the  fundamental right of women to make decisions about their own bodies,  even though, 45 years ago, the Supreme Court itself established the  right to abortion. That is a controversial right in our country, but it  has withstood the test of time.   Let me offer an indication from a recent decision by Brett Kavanaugh,  which his own court had to overturn, that shows he has no respect for  precedent. That is perhaps our chief issue with this nominee. Precedent  must be respected or else we are all open to whatever Congress or the  Court wants to do.   A young woman, immigrant, undocumented, sought an abortion. As it  turns out, she had gone through the most rigorous of requirements,  those required by Texas, because that is where she entered the country.  This matter came to the D.C. court of appeals, however.   Judge Kavanaugh found, with the time running--remember, if abortions  are to be performed, they are to be performed, according to the Supreme  Court, as early as possible--found that more time was needed because  she needed a sponsor, something that the Supreme Court has never  required, in order for that abortion to occur. The court overturned  Judge Kavanaugh's opinion. Look how dangerous it would have been. She  could have gone past the 12-week, the 15-week, the 20-week deadline,  which the House has approved on occasion.   These are rights not to be tampered with, but he has already tampered  with them on the court of appeals. This court, the Court of Appeals for  the District of Columbia--and I won't go into all the cases--has shown  that he is an executive-oriented justice. That is to say, whatever the  President wants, the President gets. This is the court that looks at  most administrative law decisions before they go anywhere else.   Kavanaugh tried to strike down the net neutrality rule. Now, that is  controversial here in Congress. But the basis he used for the courts to  do it, the majority said--remember, this is a majority which our  Republican President has appointed--the majority noted that the dissent  was, using their words, ``misconceived'' because Kavanaugh claimed a  First Amendment protection for large internet service providers never  found by any court, and certainly not the Supreme Court but found to  be, again, by his Republican colleagues on the D.C. Circuit, to be  ``counterintuitive.''   I cannot go through each and every one of Judge Kavanaugh's decisions  here, but I must point to perhaps his most extreme opinion. In a  decision on the Affordable Care Act, this is what a jurist in the  United States of America said, and I quote:   ``Under the Constitution, the President may decline to enforce a  statute that regulates private individuals when the President deems the  statute unconstitutional, even if a court has held or would hold the  statute constitutional.''   That is bold. It says that the President may choose to rise above the  law and enforce a law even if found unconstitutional. The Congress of  the United States should not be willing to go along with this. I cite a  case on my side of an issue but surely you can see the implications for  yours.   The President is supposed to make sure to ``take care that the laws  are faithfully executed.'' To faithfully execute that law, you would  have to enforce whatever the Congress or the Courts had found.   Of course, most concerning for many is his view of the special  counsel where he has opined that it may be unconstitutional, and there  is every reason to believe that he may well believe that Mueller's  special counsel role should be struck down.   A Republican President is entitled to a Republican nominee. He is not  entitled to a nominee whose opinions fly in the face of the law for the  last 75 years.   Judge Brett Kavanaugh's long list of opinions mark an extreme  departure from established American constitutional and other law. We  ask that every effort be made to oppose a man who would ignore  established precedent, even precedent that his own conservative  colleagues agree with, and who, I believe, cannot uphold the law fairly  to protect the rights of all American citizens.   We believe that the first to feel the effect of such a nominee would  be the millions of Americans who are of African American ancestry whom  the Congressional Black Caucus represents.   I thank my good friend, again, from New York, for permitting me to go  on at length about some of the precedents I have discovered that I  thought would be particularly troubling, not only to the African  American community, but to the American people.
