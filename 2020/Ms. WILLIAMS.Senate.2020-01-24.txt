 President Zelensky explained that more than--      or just equally with--the financial and physical value of the       assistance, that it was the symbolic nature of that       assistance that really was the show of U.S. support for       Ukraine and for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial       integrity. And I think he was stressing that to the Vice       President to really underscore the need for the security       assistance to be released.         I believe that is what President Zelensky was       indicating, that any signal or sign that U.S. support was       wavering would be construed by Russia as potentially an       opportunity for them to strengthen their own hand in Ukraine.    Mr. Manager CROW. This is an important point, particularly when the  President and his attorneys tried to argue: no harm, no foul.   The financial assistance itself was really important to Ukraine, no  question about it. But the aid was equally important as a signal to  Russia of our support for Ukraine. And regardless of whether the aid  was ultimately released, the fact that the hold became public sent a  very clear signal to Russia that our support for Ukraine was wavering,  and Russia was watching very closely for any sign of weakness. The  damage was done.   Now, any possible doubt about whether the aid was linked to the  investigations has been erased by the President's own Chief of Staff.  We have seen this video before during the trial, but there is a really  good reason for this. It is a complete admission on national TV that  the military aid was conditioned on Ukraine helping the President's  political campaign.   Here, once again, is what Mulvaney said.
