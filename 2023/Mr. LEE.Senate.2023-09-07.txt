 Mr. President, the American people are sharply divided on  some issues. One of those issues is abortion. One group of people has a  different idea about when human life begins and is worth protecting. It  needs to be protected under law. It is difficult to reconcile the views  of those who are in sharp contrast with each other given that one group  thinks that human life begins earlier--much earlier--than the other  group.   As difficult as it can be to reconcile those competing viewpoints  where Americans are so sharply divided, there is an issue related to  abortion on which Americans are overwhelmingly and refreshingly united;  that is, because both sides tend to recognize that a number of  Americans are uncomfortable with abortion to the extent that we are,  Americans overwhelmingly agree, with a vast supermajority being in  agreement, that the Federal Government should not use U.S. taxpayer  funds for abortions.   To that end, Congress has passed laws providing just that. One  specific law deals specifically with the U.S. Department of Defense.  Codified in 10 U.S.C., section 1093, the statute, which has been on the  books for decades, says that you may not use Department of Defense  funding or facilities for abortions.   Well, late last year, a rumor started circulating to the effect that  the U.S. Department of Defense was considering adopting policies that  would fund abortion travels, specifically allowing military personnel  seeking abortions in a neighboring State or in a different State than  where they were living or stationed to receive 3 weeks of paid leave  time and compensated travel--air travel or otherwise--lodging  accommodations, a per diem, et cetera, specifically to have an  abortion.   My friend and colleague, the distinguished senior Senator from the  State of Alabama, Senator Tuberville, was concerned about this. In his  sitting on the Armed Services Committee in the Senate, which he does,  he visited with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and expressed his  concerns about this rumored policy.   He said: You shouldn't do this. This is inconsistent with the spirit,  if not also the letter, of 10 U.S.C., section 1093. If you do this,  there will be consequences, including, among other things, that I,  Senator Tuberville, will be forced into a position in which I will  delay the confirmations of flag officer military promotions.   Regrettably, a couple of months later, Secretary Austin, in  completely ignoring Federal law, in completely ignoring what Senator  Tuberville had told him, proceeded with the policy anyway. By so doing,  he made a decision to openly flout Federal law. The sole purpose of  this policy is to try to find an all-too-cute, way-too-tricky route  around what Federal law requires, flatly inconsistent with the spirit,  if not also the letter, of the Federal law.    Since then, there has been debate on this on the Senate floor. Words  have been exchanged. People have strong views about this approach. But  make no mistake, all Senator Tuberville is doing is saying that in the  past, I, along with every other Senator, typically moved Heaven and  Earth to expedite the confirmation of these military promotions to  allow them to occur quickly. Most of them are not controversial.   That is the norm, but these things require unanimous consent. And  there is something about unanimous consent: It requires, as the name  implies, actual unanimity, meaning any one Senator can raise an  objection that makes expedited confirmation not possible. This doesn't  stop the confirmation; all it does is require additional steps to be  taken. It takes more time.   Yesterday, we had a statement--a statement that was unfortunate, a  statement that brings me to the Senate floor today--a statement made by  Secretary Carlos Del Toro, the Secretary of the U.S. Navy. Secretary  Del Toro, with whom I have worked on other matters in the past and for  whom I have had great respect, made a very unfortunate and  inappropriate statement. Here is what he said:         I would have never imagined that one of our own senators       would actually be aiding and abetting communists and other       autocratic regimes around the world.    This statement, to be clear, was talking only about Senator  Tuberville saying: In light of this policy, which I believe is  incompatible with Federal law, I am not going to facilitate the  expedited confirmation of the nominees in question.   That is all he said. Yet, for that, he was accused by the Secretary  of the U.S. Navy of ``aiding and abetting communists and other  autocratic regimes around the world.'' This is strange. This is  unacceptable. And this body should emphatically, unambiguously reject  the ad hominem attack against Senator Tuberville by Secretary Del Toro.   Look, I get it. Sometimes passions are inflamed. Sometimes people  feel really strongly about things. I hope and expect Secretary Del Toro  will see the error of this and retract and apologize for this statement  because he has essentially accused a Member of our body, a  distinguished friend to the United States, to the people of Alabama,  and to me personally, of treason, of directly jeopardizing the security  of the United States and putting it at risk by aiding and abetting  communist and other autocratic regimes around the world.   Personal attacks against Members of Congress or other people based on  policy views, policy disagreements--here, procedural, strategic  disagreements--certainly violate the high standard of decorum that has  long been honored and is typically held and exhibited by the leadership  of the U.S. Armed Forces.   Look, there are important things to consider when you evaluate this  policy, this policy designed to flout Federal law.   We have three branches of government. One branch, where we work,  makes the law. The executive branch, where the Pentagon exists and the  White House exists and all the executive branch Agencies exist--they  are there to enforce the law. Then you have the judicial branch across  the street, headed by the Supreme Court, which interprets the law when  people disagree as to the law's meaning. We are the only branch that  gets to make the law.   The very, very first operative provision, the first clause of the  first section of the first article of the Constitution--Article I,  Section 1, Clause 1--makes clear that ``all legislative powers herein  granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall  consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives.''   Article I, Section 7 makes clear--even clearer--how this works. You  cannot make a Federal law without passing the same legislation through  the House and through the Senate--identical language--and then  submitting that to the President--presenting it, as we say--for  signature, veto, or acquiescence.   If you don't follow the formula of Article I, Section 7, you have not  made a Federal law. Once a Federal law is made, it cannot be changed or  unmade  [[Page S4331]]  without going through that same process. But here, the Department of  Defense seems not to have gotten the memo, and by ``the memo,'' I mean  the U.S. Constitution.   This oath of office that I have right here, this is an oath of office  that is a prerequisite. It is required of all those elected or  appointed to civil service or uniform service, that they have to take  before assuming their duties in question. Here is what it says:         I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and       defend the Constitution of the United States against all       enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith       and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation       freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion;       and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of       the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.    That is codified in Federal law, adopted by Congress in 5 U.S.C.,  section 3331.   Look, by swearing to support and uphold the Constitution, as this  oath requires, as is required to do under Federal statute, anyone  taking this oath understands that our Constitution expressly,  explicitly, unambiguously, and exclusively empowers Congress to make  the laws. Only Congress has lawmaking power. Only Congress may change  the law. Only Congress may repeal the law. The other branches can't do  that.   Now, the outrage from Secretary Del Toro and, I would add, from some  other Pentagon officials, including but not limited to Defense  Secretary Lloyd Austin, sort of has a tendency to make it appear as  though they have written a new oath, as it were.   So when we look at this, we can imagine perhaps what they might be  thinking. Whether they have gone to the trouble of rewriting it in this  fashion or not, essentially what they have done is to come up with  President Biden's own Pentagon-specific oath of office. It is as though  they are saying: I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will make all  laws that I determine are necessary and proper; that I will bear true  faith and allegiance to the same laws that I have decided to make  within the executive branch; that I take this obligation freely,  without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will  legislate from the E-Ring of the Pentagon, which I am about to enter.  So help me God.   That, of course, is not the real oath. That oath, of course, is an  abomination, and it is an affront to this body, to the other Chamber of  Congress, and to the Constitution itself. This is an oath that rejects  the Constitution. It empowers unelected and unaccountable officials-- officials who have never been elected to make laws--as supreme  lawmakers.    Secretary Austin and the civilian leadership of the service branches  want us to believe that the sky is falling and that the falling sky has  been prompted to fall by Senator Tuberville and that Senator Tuberville  himself is somehow empowering communist and other autocratic regimes  throughout the world, imperiling and endangering the United States.  These are not just fighting words; these are words tantamount to an  accusation of treason--words that are unfounded; words made with  knowledge of their falsity or reckless disregard for their  truthfulness; words that disregard what is actually happening here.  These are not appropriate. These are way over the line.   In reality, if this is where truly aiding and abetting communist and  other autocratic regimes were concerned, if that is really what we were  facing, if that is really where we were and American national security  was being imperiled in the manner and to the degree these people have  suggested, including and especially Secretary Del Toro, we would be  looking at a very different outcome here. If they really believed  this--which they do not, and we know they don't believe it because if  we were in that situation, there are only one, two, maybe three  possible outcomes at that moment: either the Department of Defense  would ideally just suspend its attempt to circumvent Federal law and  end its abortion travel policy--if they suspended this right now,  either indefinitely or until such time as they could change the law to  do what they want to do, that is the fastest way to do that. And I have  it on good authority that Senator Tuberville would release his hold  immediately and that these people could move forward very, very quickly  on an expedited basis.   If they want these people confirmed, that is all they have to do-- suspend that policy. I am willing to bet--I am not even a betting man,  but I would bet here anyway--he would lift it. He would lift it today.   Option No. 2, possibility No. 2: Senator Schumer and the Senate  Democrats--if we really were in that environment where national  security were being imperiled and we were strengthening the hands of  hostile regimes all over the world because of Senator Tuberville; if  that is really where we were just because he was requiring the whole  process rather than expedited consideration of these nominees, well,  then Senator Schumer and the Senate Democrats would take the time to  bring these nominees up for a vote on the floor.   You see, there are procedures by which we can bring them to the floor  even with a hold. A hold is not a death knell. It is not a veto. All it  says is ``I am not going to give my consent.'' Every Member of the  United States has to consent to expedite consideration. They could  still do it, but they are not.   So one of those two outcomes or some variation of them--that is what  we would be facing. But, instead, what are we looking at? Well, just  the day before yesterday, the Senate held its first vote in 40 days,  and it appears very, very likely that within just an hour or two, maybe  three, the Senate will be recessing for the weekend and not voting  again until Monday. So we have the ability to move nominees forward.  Senator Schumer and the Senate Democrats have the ability to put them  on the calendar. It would just take some additional steps. It takes  time. But they are not doing it. They are not budging. Why? Because  they know their words aren't true. They know their spewing of  invective, unfair, defamatory accusations relates to facts that they  don't even believe because if they believed them, we would be in a very  different procedural posture.   Look, whether you agree or not agree with Senator Tuberville's  strategic decision here, whether you as a U.S. Senator or as an  onlooker would have made the same decision--regardless of how you come  down on that, regardless of where you are on the position of abortion  or government funding for abortion, Senator Tuberville is well within  his rights. These are rights that each individual Senator holds and  owns uniquely, personal to them. This is consistent with his assignment  on the Senate Armed Services Committee. He is doing the job the way he  believes he should do his job in a manner consistent with how the  voters in the great State of Alabama feel.   So we have and we respect these rules, and we have respected them for  centuries. Respecting the rules and the institution requires us to  respect those with whom we disagree when it comes to procedural  decisions like this one. We need to respect them not just in spite of a  disagreement but especially in the face of a disagreement if we are  going to uphold these rules, which have lasted for centuries and helped  propel this body to the status that I hope it can live up to more  completely, as the world's greatest deliberative legislative body.   Yet it is interesting. To show that we really are not in this place  where we would be if they took these things seriously, just yesterday,  Senator Schumer, the Senate majority leader himself, commented, when  asked about or in reference to his own refusal to put the confirmation  of C.Q. Brown to be the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on the  Senate floor for a vote--here is what he said:         This is a problem created by Republicans, and it's up to       them to solve it. . . . We're not going to shift the burden       to Democrats when this is a Republican-caused problem.    This is nuts. What he is saying here is that, yeah, in the past, we  would have expected to vote on the confirmation of the Chairman of the  Joint Chiefs of Staff. In fact, in the 12\1/2\ years I have served in  this body, I think we have voted on the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of  Staff individually and not as part of some massive, en bloc  confirmation package. Yet he is not even willing to move the Chairman  of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It is not even that long of a process to  get this person on the calendar. He is not willing even to do that.  Why? Well, he told us  [[Page S4332]]  why--because he is having too much fun blaming Republicans for it. He  holds the tools to get people confirmed. He is not willing to move  them. He is not willing to budge an inch.   Look, while Americans may disagree on the legality of abortion, and  they do, there has long been this overwhelming, bipartisan,  supermajority understanding first and foremost among the American  people at large--and there has until very lately even been that  bipartisan, overwhelming, supermajority consensus among Federal elected  lawmakers--that Americans are against tacitly supporting abortion with  their taxpayers dollars.   The last time I read the Constitution, I noticed that, as I noted  earlier, it is Congress that makes the laws, not the Department of  Defense. Senator Tuberville is right to oppose this egregious policy,  and he is well within his rights as a Member of the U.S. Senate to take  this position. We should commend his courage and applaud his dedication  to upholding his oath of office, his commitment to the Constitution,  standing for those who cannot stand, let alone speak, for themselves.   Even if you don't agree with Senator Tuberville on abortion or on  Federal funding for abortion or on his particular use of this  particular procedural remedy, you should at least respect it. If you  can't respect him and show respect for his decision, you are showing  disrespect for this institution, for its rules, and for our governing  documents, including the Constitution, and for the entity, the customs  and traditions that have helped preserve our unique form of  constitutional representative government in America.   Let this message to Secretary Austin and Secretary Del Toro be clear:  If you want to make laws, run for Congress. You can't legislate from  the E-Ring of the Pentagon. Until then, stand down and leave the  lawmaking to the lawmakers.                            ____________________
