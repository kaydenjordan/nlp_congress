 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (S. 2497) to amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and  the Arms Export Control Act to make improvements to certain defense and  security assistance provisions and to authorize the appropriations of  funds to Israel, and for other purposes, as amended.

TITLE I--SECURITY ASSISTANCE FOR ISRAEL       SEC. 101. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) In February 1987, the United States granted Israel       major non-NATO ally status.        (2) On August 16, 2007, the United States and Israel signed       a ten-year Memorandum of Understanding on United States       military assistance to Israel. The total assistance over the       course of this understanding would equal $30,000,000,000.        (3) On July 27, 2012, the United States-Israel Enhanced       Security Cooperation Act of 2012 (Public Law 112-150; 22       U.S.C. 8601 et seq.) declared it to be the policy of the       United States ``to help the Government of Israel preserve its       qualitative military edge amid rapid and uncertain regional       political transformation'' and stated the sense of Congress       that the United States Government should ``provide the       Government of Israel defense articles and defense services       through such mechanisms as appropriate, to include air       refueling tankers, missile defense capabilities, and       specialized munitions''.        (4) On December 19, 2014, President Barack Obama signed       into law the United States-Israel Strategic Partnership Act       of 2014 (Public Law 113-296) which stated the sense of       Congress that Israel is a major strategic partner of the       United States and declared it to be the policy of the United       States ``to continue to provide Israel with robust security       assistance, including for the procurement of the Iron Dome       Missile Defense System''.        (5) Section 1679 of the National Defense Authorization Act       for Fiscal Year 2016 (Public Law 114-92; 129 Stat. 1135)       authorized funds to be appropriated for Israeli cooperative       missile defense program codevelopment and coproduction,       including funds to be provided to the Government of Israel to       procure the David's Sling weapon system as well as the Arrow       3 Upper Tier Interceptor Program.        (6) On September 14, 2016, the United States and Israel       signed a ten-year Memorandum of Understanding reaffirming the       importance of continuing annual United States military       assistance to Israel and cooperative missile defense programs       in a way that enhances Israel's security and strengthens the       bilateral relationship between the two countries.        (7) The 2016 Memorandum of Understanding reflected United       States support of Foreign Military Financing (FMF) grant       assistance to Israel over the ten year period beginning in       fiscal year 2019 and ending in fiscal year 2028. FMF grant       assistance would be at a level of $3,300,000,000 annually,       totaling $33,000,000,000, the largest single pledge of       military assistance ever and a reiteration of the seven-      decade, unshakeable, bipartisan commitment of the United       States to Israel's security.        (8) The Memorandum of Understanding also reflected United       States support for funding for cooperative programs to       develop, produce, and procure missile, rocket, and projectile       defense capabilities over a ten year period beginning in       fiscal year 2019 and ending in fiscal year 2028 at a level of       $500,000,000 per year, totaling $5,000,000,000.       SEC. 102. STATEMENT OF POLICY REGARDING ISRAEL'S DEFENSE                     SYSTEMS.

(a) In General.--Notwithstanding section 514 of the Foreign       Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2321h), the President is       authorized to transfer such quantities of precision guided       munitions from reserve stocks to Israel as necessary for       legitimate self-defense and otherwise consistent with the       purposes and conditions for such transfers under the Arms       Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.).        (b) Certifications.--Except in case of emergency, not later       than 5 days before making a transfer under this section, the       President shall certify in an unclassified notification to       the appropriate congressional committees that the transfer of       the precision guided munitions--        (1) does not affect the ability of the United States to       maintain a sufficient supply of precision guided munitions;        (2) does not harm the combat readiness of the United States       or the ability of the United States to meet its commitment to       allies for the transfer of such munitions;        (3) is necessary for Israel to counter the threat of       rockets in a timely fashion; and        (4) is in the national security interest of the United       States.       SEC. 107. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON RAPID ACQUISITION AND                     DEPLOYMENT PROCEDURES.         It is the sense of Congress that the President should       prescribe procedures for the rapid acquisition and deployment       of precision guided munitions for United States       counterterrorism missions, or to assist an ally of the United       States, including Israel, that is subject to direct missile       threat.       SEC. 108. ELIGIBILITY OF ISRAEL FOR THE STRATEGIC TRADE                     AUTHORIZATION EXCEPTION TO CERTAIN EXPORT                     CONTROL LICENSING REQUIREMENTS.         (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:        (1) Israel has adopted high standards in the field of       export controls.        (2) Israel has declared its unilateral adherence to the       Missile Technology Control Regime, the Australia Group, and       the Nuclear Suppliers Group.        (3) Israel is a party to--        (A) the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the       Use of Certain Conventional Weapons which may be Deemed to be       Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects,       signed at Geneva October 10, 1980;        (B) the Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of       Asphyxiating, Poisonous or  [[Page H8146]]       Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare,       signed at Geneva June 17, 1925; and        (C) the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear       Material, adopted at Vienna October 26, 1979.

TITLE II--ENHANCED UNITED STATES-ISRAEL COOPERATION       SEC. 201. UNITED STATES-ISRAEL SPACE COOPERATION.         (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:        (1) Authorized in 1958, the National Aeronautics and Space       Administration (NASA) supports and coordinates United States       Government research in aeronautics, human exploration and       operations, science, and space technology.        (2) Established in 1983, the Israel Space Agency (ISA)       supports the growth of Israel's space industry by supporting       academic research, technological innovation, and educational       activities.        (3) The mutual interest of the United States and Israel in       space exploration affords both nations an opportunity to       leverage their unique abilities to advance scientific       discovery.        (4) In 1996, NASA and the ISA entered into an agreement       outlining areas of mutual cooperation, which remained in       force until 2005.        (5) Since 1996, NASA and the ISA have successfully       cooperated on many space programs supporting the Global       Positioning System and research related to the sun, earth       science, and the environment.        (6) The bond between NASA and the ISA was permanently       forged on February 1, 2003, with the loss of the crew of STS-      107, including Israeli Astronaut Ilan Ramon.        (7) On October 13, 2015, the United States and Israel       signed the Framework Agreement between the National       Aeronautics and Space Administration of the United States of       America and the Israel Space Agency for Cooperation in       Aeronautics and the Exploration and Use of Airspace and Outer       Space for Peaceful Purposes.        (b) Continuing Cooperation.--The Administrator of the       National Aeronautics and Space Administration shall continue       to work with the Israel Space Agency to identify and       cooperatively pursue peaceful space exploration and science       initiatives in areas of mutual interest, taking all       appropriate measures to protect sensitive information,       intellectual property, trade secrets, and economic interests       of the United States.

AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO A COOPERATIVE PROJECT                     AGREEMENT WITH ISRAEL TO COUNTER UNMANNED                     AERIAL VEHICLES THAT THREATEN THE UNITED STATES                     OR ISRAEL.         (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:        (1) On February 10, 2018, Iran launched from Syria an       unmanned aerial vehicle (commonly known as a ``drone'') that       penetrated Israeli airspace.        (2) According to a press report, the unmanned aerial       vehicle was in Israeli airspace for a minute and a half       before being shot down by its air force.        (3) Senior Israeli officials stated that the unmanned       aerial vehicle was an advanced piece of technology.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress       that--        (1) joint research and development to counter unmanned       aerial vehicles will serve the national security interests of       the United States and Israel;        (2) Israel faces urgent and emerging threats from unmanned       aerial vehicles, and other unmanned vehicles, launched from       Lebanon by Hezbollah, from Syria by Iran's Revolutionary       Guard Corps, or from others seeking to attack Israel;        (3) efforts to counter unmanned aerial vehicles should       include the feasibility of utilizing directed energy and high       powered microwave technologies, which can disable vehicles       without kinetic destruction; and        (4) the United States and Israel should continue to work       together to defend against all threats to the safety,       security, and national interests of both countries.        (c) Authority To Enter Into Agreement.--        (1) In general.--The President is authorized to enter into       a cooperative project agreement with Israel under the       authority of section 27 of the Arms Export Control Act (22       U.S.C. 2767), to carry out research on, and development,       testing, evaluation, and joint production (including follow-      on support) of, defense articles and defense services, such       as the use of directed energy or high powered microwave       technology, to detect, track, and destroy unmanned aerial       vehicles that threaten the United States or Israel.        (2) Applicable requirements.--The cooperative project       agreement described in paragraph (1) shall--        (A) provide that any activities carried out pursuant to the       agreement are subject to--        (i) the applicable requirements described in subparagraphs       (A), (B), and (C) of section 27(b)(2) of the Arms Export       Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2767(b)(2)); and        (ii) any other applicable requirements of the Arms Export       Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.) with respect to the use,       transfers, and security of such defense articles and defense       services under that Act;        (B) establish a framework to negotiate the rights to       intellectual property developed under the agreement; and        (C) include appropriate protections for sensitive       technology.

TITLE III--ENSURING ISRAEL'S QUALITATIVE MILITARY EDGE       SEC. 301. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         It is the policy of the United States to ensure that Israel       maintains its ability to counter and defeat any credible       conventional military, or emerging, threat from any       individual state or possible coalition of states or from non-      state actors, while sustaining minimal damages and       casualties, through the use of superior military means,       possessed in sufficient quantity, including weapons, command,       control, communication, intelligence, surveillance, and       reconnaissance capabilities that in their technical       characteristics are superior in capability to those of such       other individual or possible coalition states or non-state       actors.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days  [[Page H8147]]  in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous  material in the Record.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as we all know, Israel faces growing threats, but  particularly from Iran and its terrorist proxies such as Hezbollah.   This year, for the first time, we have seen direct military  engagement between Iran and Israel. It is not just attacks coming over  the border from Lebanon with Hezbollah, but direct military attacks.  Iran launched a drone and fired rockets toward Israel. They did both  from the perch that they have now in Syria. Those Iranian militia and  troops are in Syria. Meanwhile, Iran's terrorist proxy, Hezbollah,  continues to amass rockets and missiles. They have well over 100,000 in  their inventory now. This bill will ensure that the United States  continues to have Israel's back in the face of these growing threats.   With this measure, we are codifying the assistance levels in the  latest 10-year U.S.-Israel memorandum of understanding. What that aims  to do is strengthen our already robust relationship, especially on  defense matters. The bill also works to build on the United States' and  Israel's successful history of cooperation on technology development.  Think of the Iron Dome missile defense system, which shot down some of  those Iranian rockets. Mr. Engel and I have seen those Iron Dome  systems at work, deployed in Israel.   More recently, the U.S. and Israel have begun collaborating on anti- tunnel technology. Why?   Well, Eliot and I can tell you that we had the opportunity--and this  was a sad story--to go into one of those tunnels. We did not know where  that tunnel ended up when we started. The other end of that tunnel was  an elementary school in Israel. Obviously, the intent of the terrorists  was to use that tunnel in order to go in and kidnap children and then  force the IDF to fight block by block by block. Hamas dug those  tunnels. Hezbollah digs tunnels, as well. This anti-tunnel technology  will help the IDF find and destroy those tunnels that are used for  smuggling and launching attacks on Israel.   This measure supports continued cooperation on space science and  exploration, in line with the NASA Administrator's recent trip to  Israel to discuss expanding U.S.-Israel space cooperation.   This bill also authorizes the United States and Israel to collaborate  on humanitarian assistance projects around the world. It authorizes the  President to transfer precision-guided munitions to Israel.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros- Lehtinen). She is chairman emeritus of the full committee and the  current chairman of the Middle East and North Africa Subcommittee. I  thank her for her work on this bill. I also thank the gentleman from  Florida, Ted Deutch, the ranking member of the Middle East and North  Africa Subcommittee. Together, these two members authored the House  companion to this Senate bill, which passed our committee unanimously,  the latest in a long list of successful collaborations between our  committee members.   In honor of her tremendous legacy as an advocate for Israel, we are  naming this legislation the Ileana Ros-Lehtinen United States-Israel  Security Assistance Act of 2018.   In her almost three decades in the House, Chairman Ros-Lehtinen has  made steadfast support for Israel a hallmark of her congressional  career. She was the first woman to chair the Committee on Foreign  Affairs and the first Hispanic women to serve in Congress. The U.S.- Israel relationship is stronger for the work that she has done in  Congress. She will be greatly missed.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                     Committee on Science, Space, and Technology,                                 Washington, DC, September 10, 2018.      Hon. Edward R. Royce,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing concerning S. 2497, the       ``United States-Israel Security Assistance Authorization Act       of 2018,'' which was referred to your Committee on August 3,       2018.        S. 2497 contains provisions within the Committee on       Science, Space, and Technology's Rule X jurisdiction. As a       result of your having consulted with the Committee and in       order to expedite this bill for floor consideration, the       Committee on Science, Space, and Technology will forego       action on the bill. This is being done on the basis of our       mutual understanding that doing so will in no way diminish or       alter the jurisdiction of the Committee on Science, Space,       and Technology with respect to the appointment of conferees,       or to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject       matters contained in the bill or similar legislation.        I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming       this understanding, and request that you include a copy of       this letter and your response in the Congressional Record       during the floor consideration of this bill. Thank you in       advance for your cooperation.            Sincerely,                                                       Lamar Smith,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                 Washington, DC, September 10, 2018.      Hon. Lamar Smith,      Chairman, House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Smith: Thank you for consulting with the       Foreign Affairs Committee and agreeing to be discharged from       further consideration of S. 2497, United States-Israel       Security Assistance Authorization Act of 2018, so that the       bill may proceed expeditiously to the House floor.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this resolution or similar legislation in the future. I       would support your effort to seek appointment of an       appropriate number of conferees from your committee to any       House-Senate conference on this legislation.        I will seek to place our letters on S. 2497 into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.       I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and       look forward to continuing to work together as this measure       moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                   Edward R. Royce,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                 Washington, DC, September 10, 2018.      Hon. William M. ``Mac'' Thornberry,      Chairman, House Armed Services Committee,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Thornberry: Thank you for consulting with the       Foreign Affairs Committee and agreeing to be discharged from       further consideration of S. 2497, United States-Israel       Security Assistance Authorization Act of 2018, so that the       bill may proceed expeditiously to the House floor.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this resolution or similar legislation in the future. I       would support your effort to seek appointment of an       appropriate number of conferees from your committee to any       House-Senate conference on this legislation.        I will seek to place our letters on S. 2497 into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.       I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and       look forward to continuing to work together as this measure       moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                   Edward R. Royce,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), the chairman emeritus of  the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the author of H.R. 5141, the House  predecessor of the legislation we have before us.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), chairman of the Foreign Affairs  Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and  International Organizations.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   The democratic Jewish State of Israel is a friend and a major  strategic partner of the United States. Israel is a beacon, as Ileana  shared with us, of freedom, of democracy, of stability in the otherwise  troubled Middle East. In short, it is the very opposite of the brutal  and corrupt Iranian regime.   Iran has never made its threats to Israel a secret, and that is what  they mean when the Ayatollah says: ``Death to Israel; death to  America.''   After years of moving the pieces into place, including by showering  its proxies, Hezbollah and Hamas, with money and with rockets and with  missiles and attempting to exploit the conflict in Syria to build a  military presence and support base there on the border, it is slowly  but surely preparing to make good on this threat. With this bill, we  can ensure that Israel has the tools to defend it self and defend our  shared interests in the face of that mounting threat.   I do thank our ranking member, Eliot Engel, and I do thank Ted Deutch  for all of the bipartisan cooperation that has allowed us to move so  many measures through the committee, through the Senate, and into law.   I also want, in closing, to thank and to note that I was the  beneficiary of the good work of my predecessor in this position, Ileana  Ros-Lehtinen, when I took over the committee 6 years ago, and for that  I am also very thankful.   I am thankful for the contributions that all of these individuals  have made to the betterment of our defense, the security of the United  States, the security of our allies. I am proud of the fact that we have  done it in a bipartisan way.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 1911) to amend the State Department Basic  Authorities Act of 1956 to monitor and combat anti-Semitism globally,  and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1911         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Special Envoy to Monitor and       Combat Anti-Semitism Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. FINDING.         Congress finds that since the Global Anti-Semitism Review       Act of 2004 was enacted, in many foreign countries acts of       anti-Semitism have been frequent and wide in scope, the       perpetrators and variety of threats to Jewish communities and       their institutions have proliferated, and in some countries       anti-Semitic attacks have increased in frequency, scope,       violence, and deadliness.       SEC. 3. MONITORING AND COMBATING ANTI-SEMITISM.         (a) In General.--Subsection (a) of section 59 of the State       Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C. 2731) is       amended--        (1) in paragraph (2)--        (A) in subparagraph (A)--        (i) by inserting before the period at the end the       following: ``, who shall be appointed by the President, by       and with the advice and consent of the Senate''; and        (ii) by adding at the end the following new sentence: ``The       Special Envoy shall report directly to the Secretary.''; and        (B) in subparagraph (B)--        (i) in the heading, but striking ``Appointment'' and       inserting ``Nomination'';        (ii) by striking the first sentence;        (iii) in the second sentence, by striking ``If the       Secretary determines that such is appropriate, the Secretary       may appoint'' and inserting ``If the President determines       that such is appropriate, the President may nominate''; and        (iv) in the third sentence, by striking ``The Secretary may       allow such officer or employee to retain the position (and       the responsibilities associated with such position) held  [[Page H8151]]       by such officer or employee prior to the appointment'' and       inserting ``Such officer or employee may not retain the       position (or the responsibilities associated with such       position) held by such officer or employee prior to the       nomination''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following new paragraphs:        ``(3) Duties.--The Special Envoy shall serve as the primary       advisor to, and coordinate efforts across, the United States       Government relating to monitoring and combating anti-Semitism       and anti-Semitic incitement that occur in foreign countries.        ``(4) Rank and status of ambassador.--The Special Envoy       shall have the rank of ambassador.        ``(5) Qualifications.--The Special Envoy should be a person       of recognized distinction in the field of--        ``(A) combating anti-Semitism;        ``(B) religious freedom; or        ``(C) law enforcement.''.        (b) Nomination.--Not later than 90 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, and not later than 120 after any       such position becomes vacant, the President shall nominate       the Special Envoy for Monitoring and Combating anti-Semitism       under section 59 of the State Department Basic Authorities       Act of 1956, as amended by subsection (a) of this section.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material in the Record.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, disturbingly, incidents of anti-Semitism are on the  increase across Europe, across the Middle East, frankly, across the  world. As Moshe Kantor, the vice president of the World Jewish Caucus,  has said: ``We are witnessing a global process of radicalization. . . .  Unfortunately, and with no surprise, the common element that unifies  radicals seems to be their hatred of Jews.''   Today, anti-Semitism is increasingly being acted upon and, in some  cases, even institutionalized. Country by country, we are seeing school  curriculums attempting to indoctrinate children and attempting to  spread hate. We are seeing courts and legislation institutionalize  anti-Semitism. And we are seeing acts of violence against the Jewish  people and their places of worship being excused.   How do they rationalize it? Under the guise of a political protest.   It is critical that the U.S. play a leading role to stop this scourge  of hate. Yet for more than a year and a half, the top position at the  State Department charged with combating anti-Semitism worldwide has  remained vacant.   Further, for more than 1 year, the office has also been completely  unstaffed. This is unacceptable. I have raised this issue before.   As a senior official at the State Department reminded world leaders  this past winter: ``Absent action, the sacred pledge of `never again'  can become empty rhetoric.''   We cannot allow that to happen, and the bill before us today, H.R.  1911, will help reassert U.S. leadership in combating anti-Semitism  worldwide. It will mandate the expeditious appointment of the Special  Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism, and it will elevate the  office to ambassadorial rank with direct access to the Secretary of  State.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this  measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), chairman of the Foreign Affairs  Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and  International Organizations. He is the author of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute  to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), who chairs the Foreign  Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa.    Mr. Speaker, I have one more speaker. I  yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Roskam), a member  of the Committee on Ways and Means, and co-chair of the bipartisan Task  Force on Combating Anti-Semitism.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   We have seen the horrific consequences when free societies turn a  blind eye to anti-Semitic incitement and to anti-Semitic violence.  Passage of this bill reaffirms that combating anti-Semitism is a top  priority for the United States, and it will fill the Special Envoy  position and provide it with adequate staff that is going to strengthen  our ability to work with our partners overseas.   So I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  agree to the resolution (H. Res. 401) urging China, South Korea,  Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, Cambodia, Laos, India,  and all nations to outlaw the dog and cat meat trade and to enforce  existing laws against the trade, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 401         Whereas the consumption of dog meat has occurred in every       corner of the world including in Asia;        Whereas established dog meat markets still exist in Asia;        Whereas the Humane Society International, Animals Asia       Foundation, and others estimate that 30,000,000 dogs and       10,000,000 cats die annually across Asia for the trade in dog       and cat meat;        Whereas it is estimated as many as 200,000 live dogs are       trafficked each year from Thailand across the Mekong River to       Vietnam, where dog meat is considered a delicacy;        Whereas cat meat, known locally as ``little tiger'', is       also a delicacy in Vietnam and, although officially banned,       is widely available in specialty restaurants;        Whereas due to a traditional belief that high adrenaline       levels produce tender meat and increase supposed health       benefits, dogs killed for their meat may be first       intentionally subjected to extreme fear and suffering through       hanging or bludgeoning;        Whereas there appears to be little scientific evidence to       support traditional claims of the health benefits of       consuming dog meat;        Whereas there have been reports of abuse, poor living       conditions, and cruel slaughtering techniques with respect to       dogs and cats farmed for their meat;        Whereas many dogs and cats die during transport to       slaughterhouses, after days or weeks crammed into small cages       on the back of vehicles without food or water, and others       suffer from illness or injury during such transport;        Whereas in February 2015, Vietnamese authorities impounded       a truck in Hanoi smuggling three tons of live cats from China       that were intended for the illegal cat meat trade, but then       buried thousands of the seized cats--many, reportedly, while       alive--claiming a desire to avoid the spread of disease;        Whereas the extreme suffering of dogs and cats at such       slaughterhouses and on such transportation trucks would       breach anti-cruelty laws in the United States, such as the       Animal Welfare Act (7 U.S.C. 2131 et seq.) and the Humane       Methods of Slaughter Act (7 U.S.C. 1901 et seq.);        Whereas many government officials, civil society advocates,       and activists are working to end the dog and cat meat trade       on anti-cruelty and public health grounds, and the       governments of Singapore, Taiwan, and Hong Kong have passed       laws banning the slaughter of dogs for meat consumption;        Whereas Chinese activists have claimed that stolen pets are       sometimes used in the dog meat market in China;        Whereas Chinese dog transporters reportedly routinely flout       regulations such as the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture       Veterinary Bureau Circular No. 16 (2013), which requires dogs       to be quarantined and issued a quarantine certificate before       being transported across provincial boundaries;        Whereas the World Health Organization has linked the dog       meat industry to human outbreaks of trichinellosis, cholera,       and rabies, although consumption of dog meat alone has not       been confirmed to spread rabies to humans;        Whereas those involved in the dog meat industry are at an       increased health risk for zoonotic diseases, which can       transfer from dogs to humans through infectious material such       as saliva;        Whereas the spread of such diseases may be exacerbated by       unsanitary conditions of slaughter and by the sale of dog       meat at open-air markets and restaurants; and        Whereas Betsy Miranda, Asia Coordinator for the Global       Alliance for Rabies Control, said in June 2013 that the       spread of disease through the dog meat trade was ``rampant''       across Southeast Asia, and that ``The risk that the animals       are in poor health and not vaccinated is very high. If they       move across borders they risk carrying the disease across       large distances'': Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) calls for an end to the dog and cat meat trade on       cruelty and public health grounds;        (2) urges all nations to outlaw the dog and cat meat trade       and enforce existing laws against such trade; and        (3) affirms the commitment of the United States to the       protection of animals and to advancing the progress of animal       protection around the world.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous material in the Record.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Hastings for authoring this  important measure on the dog and cat meat trade. It is an important  issue to animal  [[Page H8154]]  lovers around this globe, and this resolution has garnered tremendous  bipartisan support. He has over 100 cosponsors in this Congress for it.   Protecting the world's animals, whether we are talking about dogs and  cats or rhinoceros and elephant, it is not a partisan issue; and I am  proud to have authored a number of critical pieces of legislation to  advance this cause, including the END Wildlife Trafficking Act of 2016.   Mr. Speaker, in recent years, we have made some important progress  toward stopping the consumption of dog meat around the world. But,  sadly, dog meat markets still exist in Asia.   In fact, it is estimated that 30 million dogs and 10 million cats die  annually across Asia as a result of the dog and cat meat trade, and  they often live under horrendous conditions.   And this practice--I would make one other point--it also raises  serious public health concerns. The World Health Organization has  linked the dog meat industry to human outbreaks of multiple serious  diseases, including cholera, and including rabies. The spread of  disease is made worse by all aspects of the trade, from the unsanitary  conditions of slaughter, and the sale of dog meat in open-air markets  and restaurants, and from that, to the trafficking of these animals  across international borders.   This important resolution urges all nations to abolish the dog and  cat meat trade, to enforce existing laws against such trade, and to  affirm the U.S. commitment to protecting animals, both here at home and  around the world.   I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this measure.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time to close.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Hastings  again for this legislation and for championing his support for the  protection of dogs and cats around the world.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 6197) to amend the State Department Basic  Authorities Act of 1956 to authorize rewards for thwarting wildlife  trafficking linked to transnational organized crime, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6197         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Rescuing Animals With       Rewards Act of 2018'' or the ``RAWR Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) Wildlife trafficking is a major transnational crime       that is estimated to generate over $10 billion a year in       illegal profits and which is increasingly perpetrated by       organized, sophisticated criminal enterprises, including       known terrorist organizations.        (2) Wildlife trafficking not only threatens endangered       species worldwide, but also jeopardizes local security,       spreads disease, undermines rule of law, fuels corruption,       and damages economic development.        (3) Combating wildlife trafficking requires a coordinated       and sustained approach at the global, regional, national, and       local levels.        (4) Congress stated in the Eliminate, Neutralize, and       Disrupt Wildlife Trafficking Act of 2016 that it is the       policy of the United States to take immediate actions to stop       the illegal global trade in wildlife and wildlife products       and associated transnational organized crime.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that       the Department of State's rewards program is a powerful tool       in combating sophisticated international crime and that the       Department of State and Federal law enforcement should work       in concert to offer rewards that target wildlife traffickers.       SEC. 3. REWARDS FOR JUSTICE.         Subparagraph (B) of section 36(k)(5) of the State       Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C.       2708(k)(5)) is amended by inserting ``wildlife trafficking       (as defined by section 2(12) of the Eliminate, Neutralize,       and Disrupt Wildlife Trafficking Act of 2016 (16 U.S.C.       7601(12); Public Law 114-231)) and'' after ``includes''.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous materials in the Record.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure, which targets  transnational wildlife traffickers through the State Department's  existing global rewards program. These rewards will serve as a powerful  tool to capture and to convict--to convict--wanted transnational  criminals and terrorists who profit from the illegal wildlife trade.   Last week as we opened the papers, there were 87 elephant carcasses  discovered in Botswana's Okavango Delta. These animals were shot by  poachers. They were brutally stripped of their tusks. They were left to  die.   This is a very real and urgent issue. Wildlife trafficking is  generating over $10 billion a year in illegal profits for increasingly  sophisticated criminal syndicates, and it is also generating profits  for terrorists who are involved in this kind of slaughter. The illegal  ivory trade is especially lucrative.   Mr. Speaker, for years now, I have been engaged in this effort to  save some of the most endangered species. During a recent trip to  Tanzania, my colleagues and I met with the law enforcement and park  rangers on the front lines. They told us how they were outmanned. They  are outgunned. They are up against sophisticated criminal networks that  use helicopters, that use night vision goggles.   We have met with local communities impacted by these crimes, who  explain how wildlife trafficking jeopardizes local security, spreads  disease, of course undermines the rule of law. It fuels corruption. It  damages economic development.   Wildlife trafficking is a serious national security threat, and  combating it requires a global approach to identifying and apprehending  the world's worst offenders. And time is not on our side. Each day of  inaction means more animals poached, more cash for criminal syndicates  and terrorists.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the bill's author, Representative Donovan, as  well as cosponsors Castro and Ranking Member Eliot Engel for their work  on this important measure. I urge my colleagues to join me in support  of this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Donovan), a member of the Committee on  Foreign Affairs, a former prosecutor. He is the author of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, a former district attorney like Dan Donovan can tell  you, if you are trying to get the attention of a thug, there is nothing  like a reward on your head to create real fear for that terrorist or  that criminal.   We want wildlife traffickers to know the fear of being hunted. It is  time we send the message to wildlife traffickers around the world that  the United States will use every tool at our disposal to stop them and  to take them down.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the bill, and I yield back the balance  of my time.
