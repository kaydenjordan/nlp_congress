 Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate Root  Negative One, Springdale's Don Tyson School of Innovation Robotics  Team, on qualifying for the FIRST Global Challenge in Dubai. Arkansas  is proud to have a team from our State represent the United States in  the robotics competition in October.   Root Negative One has achieved much success in the team's 4-year  history. It won the Inspire Award, the top award given at the FIRST  Tech Challenge tournament, in its first year. During the 2017-2018  season, the team earned the Inspire Award at the Arkansas FIRST Tech  Challenge Championship, and it was an Inspire Award Finalist at the  FIRST Tech Challenge World Championship in Houston, TX. This past  season, the team won the Inspire Awards at the Alabama FIRST Tech  Challenge Championship and the FIRST Tech Challenge World Championship  in Houston. This award recognizes Root Negative One as one of the top  two teams worldwide.   For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology--FIRST-- empowers students to develop skills in science, technology,  engineering, and mathematics--STEM--and provides opportunities for  youth to make connections with professionals in these areas. University  of Arkansas College of Engineering professors Richard Cassady and Chase  Rainwater volunteer as team coaches, serving as excellent mentors to  the students. Since day one, the team has worked hard to build a world- class, high-school robotics program to compete at the most elite level.   The numerous benefits these Springdale students get from  participating in the FIRST program will have a long lasting impact on  team members. By having the opportunity to learn from professional  engineers and master STEM skills before they enter college, they are  well on their way to successful futures.   I am very proud of the team's accomplishments as its members continue  their journey to develop such relevant, in-demand skills.  Congratulations to Root Negative One Robotics Team on all of these  accomplishments on earning a spot to compete in the FIRST Global  Challenge. I wish the team the best of luck as it represents our  country in the fall.                            ____________________
