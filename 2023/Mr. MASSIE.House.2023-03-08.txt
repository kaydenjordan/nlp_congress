 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that it be in  order at any time to consider H. Con. Res. 21 in the House if called up  by the chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs or his designee; that  the concurrent resolution be considered as read; that the previous  question be considered as ordered on the concurrent resolution to  adoption without intervening motion except for 1 hour of debate equally  divided among and controlled by Representative McCaul of Texas,  Representative Meeks of New York, and Representative Gaetz of Florida  or their respective designees; and that the provisions of section 7 of  the War Powers Resolution, 50 U.S.C. 1546, shall not apply to H. Con.  Res. 20.    Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 199 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 199         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 140) to amend title 5, United States Code, to       prohibit Federal employees from advocating for censorship of       viewpoints in their official capacity, and for other       purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed       with. All points of order against consideration of the bill       are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and       shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by       the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Oversight and Accountability or their respective designees.       After general debate the bill shall be considered for       amendment under the five-minute rule. In lieu of the       amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the       Committee on Oversight and Accountability now printed in the       bill, it shall be in order to consider as an original bill       for the purpose of amendment under the five-minute rule an       amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the       text of Rules Committee Print 118-1. That amendment in the       nature of a substitute shall be considered as read. All       points of order against that amendment in the nature of a       substitute are waived. No amendment to that amendment in the       nature of a substitute shall be in order except those printed       in the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this       resolution.

All points of order against such       amendments are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. Any Member may demand a separate vote in the House       on any amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole to the       bill or to the amendment in the nature of a substitute made       in order as original text.

Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the joint resolution (H.J.       Res. 27) providing for congressional disapproval under       chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule       submitted by the Department of the Army, Corps of Engineers,       Department of Defense and the Environmental Protection Agency       relating to ``Revised Definition of `Waters of the United       States' ''. All points of order against consideration of the       joint resolution are waived. The joint resolution shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the joint resolution are waived. The previous question shall       be considered as ordered on the joint resolution and on any       amendment thereto to final passage without intervening motion       except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled       by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Transportation and Infrastructure or their respective       designees; and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 3.

All points of order against consideration of the       bill are waived. The bill shall be considered as read. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       bill and on any amendment thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence or       their respective designees; and (2) one motion to commit.        Sec. 4.  The provisions of section 7 of the War Powers       Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1546) shall not apply to a concurrent       resolution introduced during the first session of the One       Hundred Eighteenth Congress pursuant to  [[Page H1162]]       section 5 of the War Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1544) with       respect to Syria.        Sec. 5.  If a veto message is laid before the House on       House Joint Resolution 30, then after the message is read and       the objections of the President are spread at large upon the       Journal, further consideration of the veto message and the       joint resolution shall be postponed until the legislative day       of March 23, 2023; and on that legislative day, the House       shall proceed to the constitutional question of       reconsideration and dispose of such question without       intervening motion.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to amend the  pending resolution with an amendment that I have placed at the desk.    Madam Speaker, last night, the Rules Committee met and  reported House Resolution 199, providing for consideration of three  measures: H.R. 140, H.J. Res. 27, and S. 619.   The rule provides for H.R. 140 to be considered under a structured  rule with 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair  and the ranking minority member of the Committee on Oversight and  Accountability or their designees.   The rule further provides for consideration of H.J. Res. 27 under a  closed rule with 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the  chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Transportation  and Infrastructure.                                time  1230    Additionally, the rule provides for consideration of S. 619, under  closed rule, with 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by  the chair and ranking minority member of the Select Committee on  Intelligence.   Finally, the rule postpones the vote on a potential veto message from  the President on H.J. Res. 30 until the legislative day of March 23.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Roy).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this rule and in support of the  underlying legislation, H.R. 140, which went through regular order,  which was marked up in the Oversight and Reform Committee, where  Democrats had copious opportunities to offer amendments and to change  the bill, as did Republicans.   H.R. 140 is called the Protecting Speech from Government Interference  Act, and would prohibit Federal employees from using their official  authority to censor a private entity, including outside of normal duty  hours or away from an employee's normal duty post.   Under President Biden, administration officials and Federal  bureaucrats have abused their positions, authority, and influence to  encourage censorship and erode Americans' First Amendment rights.   Recently released reports have uncovered efforts by the Federal  Bureau of Investigation, the Centers for Disease Control, the  Department of Homeland Security, and other government agencies to  pressure social media companies and internet providers to censor and  remove speech posted on social media platforms.   Advocates for this censorship flag certain posts and users as  spreading misinformation on various topics, including COVID-19, racial  justice, and the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.   Executives at Facebook and Twitter have admitted that prior to the  2020 Presidential election, after a warning from the FBI, they censored  the sharing of news regarding Hunter Biden's laptop leak, which has  since been proven true. It was not a Russian disinformation campaign.    Even former White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki, during a July 2021  press briefing, called on Facebook to ban specific accounts from its  platform.   Congress should recognize that the biggest spreader of misinformation  over the last several years, whether it has been about elections or  about COVID, has been the Federal Government.   The censorship must stop. Congress must restore constitutional  protections enshrined in the First Amendment.   H.R. 140, and the amendments that are pending votes here as well, are  critical to ensure that government officials can never again promote  censorship and pressure private entities to suppress Americans' First  Amendment rights.   Additionally, the rule before us provides for consideration of H.J.  Res. 27, a resolution ``providing for congressional disapproval under  chapter 8 of Title 5, United States Code, of the rules submitted by the  Department of the Army Corps of Engineers, Department of Defense, and  the Environmental Protection Agency relating to ``Revised definition of  `Waters of the United States.' ''   It is Groundhog Day again in America. Every time the administration  changes, this rule changes.   The Biden administration's new rule would radically redefine the term  ``Waters of the United States'' to expand the Federal Government's  authority in regulating bodies of water.   Specifically, Biden's EPA would expand the term to include  impoundments of jurisdictional waters, tributaries, adjacent wetlands,  and additional waters.                                time  1245    To be clear, what the Biden administration is pushing through here  will heap serious burdens on farmers, small businesses, homebuilders,  and rural communities across our country.   In 1972, Congress didn't tell the EPA and the Army Corps of  Engineers: Do whatever you think is necessary to protect water. That is  not what the bill said. Yet, that is what they have taken as their  directive.   The Clean Water Act was never intended to be applied as broadly as  the  [[Page H1164]]  Biden administration is proposing. Every Member of Congress should be  concerned about the EPA's attempt to expand its authority over  individuals' private property and regulate farms and communities, even  those which lie far away from any lakes, rivers, or streams and very  far away from Washington, D.C.   Congress has the constitutional authority and responsibility to  provide oversight and to review regulations issued by the executive  branch. If the executive branch promulgates rules that could overstep  their authority, as President Biden is doing here, it is vital that we  exercise our oversight authority in Congress.   Finally, the rule before us provides for consideration of S. 619, the  COVID-19 Origin Act of 2023, which would finally declassify any  information relating to potential links between the Wuhan Institute of  Virology and the origin of COVID-19.   In 2020, at the height of the pandemic, anyone who spoke out  questioning whether COVID-19 might have come from the Wuhan lab in  China was denounced as a conspiracy theorist, and their words were  labeled as ``dangerous misinformation.'' People were censored online,  their accounts were suspended, and their reputations were damaged for  questioning the origins of COVID-19.   What is the difference between COVID-19 conspiracy theory and the  truth? About 2 years. We have seen them called natural immunity  conspiracy theories. We have seen people who said masks don't work  called conspiracy theorists. Now, we are finding out that all of those  conspiracy theories, so-called, were accurate.   Fast-forward to today. Even the government admits it. The Department  of Energy and the FBI have both publicly reported their conclusions  that COVID-19 likely emerged as a result of a lab leak from the Wuhan  Institute of Virology, a research institute in Wuhan, China, controlled  by the People's Republic of China and, ultimately, the Chinese  Communist Party.   Was it funded in part by our government? Yes, it was.   This legislation is long overdue and is necessary to expose the truth  about the origins of COVID-19. Americans deserve to see the  information. President Biden could have released this information at  any point. It could have been released a year ago. It could be released  today without this resolution. But this resolution is important because  the President has not released this information. The last Congress, led  by Speaker Pelosi, could have voted to do what we are doing here today.  But no, they wanted it to remain hidden from the American public. I  fear the Federal Government has been involved in a coverup about the  origins of COVID-19 because they are afraid of being exposed as  culpable in the creation of the disease at the center of the pandemic.   To my colleague's point about the videos that were released on  Monday, I think the other side of the aisle is out of touch and out of  step with the American public on this.   A recent poll by Rasmussen showed that 81 percent of likely voters  believe that all of the tapes should be released. The Democrats had 2  years to release these tapes. But 81 percent of voters believe that.   Is that just Republicans? No.   Madam Speaker, 86 percent of Republicans and 78 percent of  Democrats--they are out of step with their own party--believe that  these videotapes should be released because Americans deserve to know  the truth and the defendants in these trials deserve to have the  evidence they need to present their defense.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Langworthy).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record an  article in the New York Post titled: ``10 myths told by COVID experts-- and now debunked,'' by Marty Makary, a professor at Johns Hopkins  School of Medicine.    Madam Speaker, in this article that I have just  referenced, misinformation No. 7 was that ``COVID originating from the  Wuhan lab is a conspiracy theory.'' It is not. I think we are going to  find that out when this resolution passes, and I expect a lot of  Democrat support for the resolution. It passed by unanimous consent in  the Senate.   ``Google admitted to suppressing searches of `lab leak' during the  pandemic. Dr. Francis Collins, head of the National Institutes of  Health, claimed, and still does, he didn't believe the virus came from  a lab.   ``Ultimately, overwhelming circumstantial evidence points to a lab  leak origin, the same origin suggested to Dr. Anthony Fauci by two very  prominent virologists in a January 2020 meeting he assembled at the  beginning of the pandemic. According to documents obtained by Bret  Baier of FOX News, they told Fauci and Collins that the virus may have  been manipulated and originated in the lab, but then suddenly changed  their tune in public comments days after meeting with the NIH  officials. The virologists were later awarded nearly $9 million from  Fauci's agency.''   Maybe this is why we are not getting the truth yet. We will get the  truth if this rule passes and the subsequent S. 619 passes here in the  House. I think it is very important.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, although it is not the subject of today's resolution  or any of the bills covered by this resolution, the Democrats just  can't avoid talking about the release of the January 6 videos. They  keep going back to it during this debate.   Madam Speaker, I would remind them that 78 percent of Democrats out  in America support the release of all of these videos.   The fact that they are apoplectic about the few minutes of video that  Tucker Carlson released on Monday shows that Tucker Carlson is over the  target. For 2 years, they have been selectively releasing information  and videos to set a narrative. In just a few minutes, the entire  narrative was challenged--might I say it collapsed under the scrutiny,  under the review of just a few minutes of undoctored video that came  from this body.   I applaud Tucker Carlson for releasing that. The American people are  right. If the Democrats are so upset that only a few of these videos  were released, I would remind them that they were able to release these  at any point in the past.   Moving on to something that is the subject of this resolution, I want  to talk about the repeal of Joe Biden's 2023 WOTUS ruling, the waters  of the U.S. ruling. Like I said before, it is ``Groundhog Day'' again.   Under President Bush, we had one set of rules that farmers,  homebuilders, and landowners came to understand. They were a little  hard to comply with because every division of the Army Corps of  Engineers might interpret them differently, or different States would  interpret them differently, or different bureaucrats at the EPA would  interpret them differently.   Then, Obama came along with a rule to expand the definition of waters  of the U.S., and then Trump came into office and the rules changed  again. Now, Biden is here trying, once again, to change the rules on  what are the waters of the U.S.   The farmers and homebuilders I talk to don't say they don't want any  regulations. Nobody in this body has said no regulation is what we  want.   The question is, give us clear, precise, understandable regulations  we can follow that do not change. Frankly, those should be written by  Congress. They shouldn't be made up by every administration that comes  into power. Yet, that is what we are doing, or that is what has  happened.   Today, we are talking about repealing those onerous changes and  unclear changes. For instance, Susan Bodine testified in front of the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee this year on this topic,  and she talked about the significant nexus test that they apply in  WOTUS 2023, waters of the U.S. To support expanded jurisdiction under  this rule, the agencies now claim that isolated water can affect the  biological integrity of navigable water.   What does that mean? If you have a puddle of water that a bird lands  in and drinks from and takes some seeds or some larvae, and when it  drinks and flies to a river and deposits it in its bird droppings, or  maybe as it flies over the river and it doesn't even visit the river,  if there is any kind of biological connection--and as we have found,  everything is biologically connected on this planet. If there is any  biological connection that they can establish between a puddle of water  on your property and a navigable water, then they say, this is now  covered under waters of the U.S. This is ridiculous.   The only certainty that our farmers and our landowners are going to  get from Biden's 2023 WOTUS rule is the certainty that if a raindrop  has fallen on your property, a government agent will show up someday  and tell you what you can and can't do with that property under this  rule.   That is why it is important for us to repeal that, and that is why  this resolution is so important.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, will the gentleman yield?    Madam Speaker, I said that the other side could have  released them.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I surely didn't expect this to turn into a debate on  the January 6 videotapes or to hear the Democrats propose that it  sounds like they are in favor of all of the tapes being released  instead of just some of them.   I think if the gentleman would review the transcript, and I could be  wrong, but I think he will find out that I said Tucker Carlson only  released a few minutes of that, and those few minutes were able to  destroy the narrative that had been constructed over 2 years.   But if the gentleman cares to answer a question, then maybe we have  come to some bipartisan agreement that all of the tapes should be  released.   Madam Speaker, I would ask if the gentleman when he speaks next if he  would speak to that topic and if he would be in favor of releasing all  of the tapes instead of releasing them partially.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, it is somewhat serendipitous, but in the context of  this debate on a rule about other bills, it seems we have come to some  agreement, it appears to me, with the American people, 81 percent of  whom believe that all of the tapes should be released. It seems as if  we have come to some agreement that we all would be better off if we  get to the bottom of the truth and all of the truth comes out and all  of the tapes come out so that no one side can distort what actually  happened that day, and then let the American people decide.   So in the interest of transparency and in the interest of getting  back to the subject matter at hand, which are three bills covered by  this rule, I want to talk about S. 619, which is so important. It is  transparency, and it is the transparency that the American people  deserve. It passed by unanimous consent in the Senate. Even though it  seems like there is some opposition on the other side, I suspect we are  going to get a lot of votes from Democrats on S. 619.    I think it is important to go on the record for elected  Representatives to say whether or not they believe their constituents  are entitled to the truth which our government possesses or at least  information that they possess that would help somebody come to a  conclusion of what the origins of this virus were and did they come  from Wuhan.   The President could do this at any time. He could have done it at any  time in the past 2 years. He hasn't done it. It is time to put him on  the spot and say: You either veto this or you release that information  that you have withheld from the American public for 2 years, which is  too long. I suspect we could overcome his veto.  [[Page H1171]]    Next, Madam Speaker, I want to talk about the Waters of the U.S.  rule.   Why is this timely?   Because on March 20 this goes into effect. That is why it is so  urgent to repeal the 2023 Waters of the U.S. rule.   These are laws.   Were they written by lawmakers?   No. Our Founding Fathers created three branches of government. We  have the executive branch which enforces laws, we have the judicial  branch which resolves disputes, and we have the legislative branch  which is supposed to make the laws. Yet, here we sit abdicating that  authority and that responsibility. You can delegate authority, but you  can't delegate responsibility, Madam Speaker.   We have a responsibility to the American people to make sure that  these laws are concise, that they don't change on the whim of an  executive who gets in the White House, that they are not onerous, that  they have their intended effect, and that they are applied uniformly  across the country.   Yet we have abdicated that responsibility. But we will take that  responsibility back by the passage of this rule and the subsequent  legislation to repeal the WOTUS, Waters of the United States 2023, by  Joe Biden. We, the American people, deserve that.   Finally, I will close by talking about H.R. 140. This is a bill that  went through regular order. What a wonderful thing. We have talked  about it so much. It is a bill that covers one topic only. We have  talked about that so much. Here we are, and we even have a chance--even  though it was amended in the committee--to amend it here on the floor  to perfect it even more for Members and by Members who aren't members  of that committee.   Are these amendments that are not germane?   Are these the kind of amendments that the American people hate where  Members offer an amendment and then they stick something into a bill  that is completely unrelated to it?   No. Every one of these amendments is germane to this bill. We have  made sure of that in the Rules Committee. The gentleman serves on the  Rules Committee, and he had plenty of time to voice his concerns there.   So we have a lot of amendments that are great. I think they will  improve the bill. But what is most important is that people have a  chance to have their point made and to get a vote on this.   Finally, I will talk about what H.R. 140 would fix. It would fix this  loophole that they think they have constructed that allows the Federal  Government to violate the Constitution.   Obviously, Federal agents can't take away our First Amendment rights,  and, obviously, the Constitution wasn't meant to bind social media  companies. It was meant to bind the administration.   What we have is a loophole where the administration leans on a social  media company that they are paying money to. Millions of dollars have  gone to these social media companies from the CDC and from the FBI.   So when they say:         Would you pretty please ban this user?    Or:         Would you pretty please take down these posts? There is a       whole series of these posts.    The government doesn't get in line. They have a back door that they  can trot to every day and submit lists of people whom they think should  be banned because they don't like what they have said.   This is dangerous to our Republic. If the other side wants to call it  a democracy, then it is dangerous to the democracy. But this is a  republic.   Our government has built an elaborate but constitutionally unsound  framework for violating these natural rights.   As we have seen with the Twitter files, they boldly work in close  cooperation with private-sector actors who aren't subject to  constitutional restrictions imposed on government by our Founders.    But they also claim foreign influence and national security so they  can target U.S. citizens with agencies in the government under the  military chain of command whose missions are ostensibly directed at  foreign actors who have no constitutional rights.   Elected lawmakers be damned, legions of government lawyers create  shaky legal scaffolding and ad hoc doctrine to indemnify the actors  within our government who eagerly exploit these loopholes.   In this way, government actors can claim everything they do is legal.  They have a bunch of lawyers to back them:         Oh, we didn't do anything illegal, it is all legal. Here,       look at our doctrine. The lawyers have gone through it, it is       all legal.    Here is the problem, Madam Speaker: much of what they do is  unconstitutional.   So whose job is it to resolve that difference?   It is actually not the Supreme Court's job. We are entrusted with  oversight. We all here swore an oath to the Constitution, and if we  know that authorizations that we have made or that funding that we have  appropriated has been twisted in a way to get around the Constitution  or to drive through a loophole that some lawyers in the administrative  branch have created, then it is our obligation--we owe it to the  American people, we swore an oath to the Constitution--to fix that--not  to make them go to court to get some remedy--but to fix it, to stop it  in its tracks.   H.R. 140 with its pending amendments is a good down payment on that  promise to the American people.   Madam Speaker, I support this rule, I urge my colleagues to vote for  it.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 199         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 5. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       resolution (H. Res. 178) affirming the House of       Representatives' commitment to protect and strengthen Social       Security and Medicare. The resolution shall be considered as       read. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on       the resolution and preamble to adoption without intervening       motion or demand for division of the question except one hour       of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means or       their respective designees.        Sec. 6. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H. Res. 178.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution, as amended.
