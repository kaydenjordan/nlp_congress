 Mr. President, I join with the majority leader in  offering our prayers for those who are injured.   I was absolutely shaken by the news of a shooting early this morning  at the baseball field in Alexandria where many of my friends and  colleagues were practicing for the annual Congressional Baseball Game,  an event that brings us together each year.   It has been reported that Representative Scalise, the House whip, was  shot during the attack, as were two brave members of the Capitol Police  Force and others, including a staffer. Let us pray that they and any  others who were injured are able to recover quickly.   This morning is the most sobering reminder of how thankful we should  be for the service of the Capitol Police Force, who put their lives on  the line day in and day out for us to be safe. I could not be more  grateful that Capitol Police was there at a time to prevent this attack  from being any worse than it was. I was in the gym with Senator Paul,  who had been there, and he had told me that, had these two Capitol  police officers, who were part of Congressman Scalise's detail, not  been there, it might have been a massacre because there would have been  no one to respond. But their bravery is exemplary of all the Capitol  Police Force, and we thank them.   The entire Senate family sends its thoughts and prayers to those who  were wounded and our gratitude to the police officers and first  responders who were at the scene.   I yield the floor.  [[Page S3462]]                                ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator  from Ohio speak next for 2 minutes, the Senator from Idaho speak after  that for 5, and I will conclude with 5 minutes. The vote will be held  thereafter.    Mr. President, in a few minutes, we will vote on an  amendment that consists of a package of Russia sanctions. I would like  to endorse the amendment in the strongest possible terms and hope we  can get all of our colleagues to vote for it.   It was negotiated by a bipartisan group of Senators who did a great  job: Senators Corker and Cardin, Crapo and Brown, with a great deal of  help from Senators Shaheen, Durbin, Menendez. Leader McConnell and I  worked extremely well on this issue together, which I hope portends  future things we can do together in a bipartisan way. This amendment is  as bipartisan as it gets, and rightly so because this is an issue that  should unite Members of both parties and concern Americans of all  political stripes.   Over the past several years, President Putin and his allies and the  Russian oligarchy have committed several sanctionable offenses.  President Putin has violated the sovereignty of its neighbor, Ukraine,  by annexing Crimea. He is guilty of human rights abuses, including  propping up the brutal Assad regime in Syria, and stifling political  dissent and the human rights of his own people. In Mr. Putin's Russia,  elections are neither fair nor free. The media is controlled by the  state, and the political opposition is hardly tolerated.   This is a regime that has routinely flouted international norms and  agreements; that severely and brutishly pursues its own self-interest  without regard to legitimate rights of other nations and peoples. For  that, the U.S. Congress passed a series of economic sanctions to  squeeze Putin and his allies and show them that the United States  strongly condemns these actions, and that was before Russia conducted a  high-level campaign to interfere in the American election.   The Russia sanctions legislation we are about to vote on would  address these two critical issues. By codifying existing sanctions and  creating a process for congressional review of any decision to weaken  or lift them, we are ensuring that the United States continues to  punish Putin for his reckless and destabilizing actions. It is  particularly significant that a bipartisan coalition is seeking to  reestablish Congress, not the President, as the final arbiter of  sanctions relief, considering that this administration has been too  eager--far too eager in my mind--to put sanctions relief on the table.  These additional sanctions will send a powerful bipartisan statement  that Russia and any other nation that might try to interfere with our  elections will be punished.   There is no process more sacred in our democracy than the guarantee  of free and fair elections, no principle more enshrined in our system  of government than the people participating in our noble democratic  experiment at the ballot box. That bedrock principle, the fundamental  right was attacked by Mr. Putin. If we did nothing--or we reduce  sanctions, as the President sometimes has talked about--we would eat at  the wellspring of our democracy. Foreign powers influencing whom we  elect is something the Founding Fathers feared, and we are doing  everything we can in this body to try and stop.   With the upcoming vote, the U.S. Senate is saying to President Putin:  You will be held accountable for your actions. Foreign interference in  our democracy has been a concern since the founding of the Republic. It  is the origin of the emoluments clause in the Constitution. In  Federalist 68, Alexander Hamilton writes that ``these most deadly  adversaries of the republican government [come] chiefly from the desire  in foreign powers to gain improper ascendant in our councils.'' Every  ``practical obstacle,'' Hamilton  [[Page S3474]]  said, ``should be opposed to [such] cabal, intrigue, and corruption.''   We cannot let Russia's meddling in our elections go unpunished, lest  they ever consider such interference again, nor any other nation in the  world. They must know that if any future attempts are made to degrade  our democracy, the retribution of the U.S. Congress will be sure and  will be swift.   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the amendment.   I yield the floor.
