 Mr. President, I rise to honor the service of Colonel  (retired) Anita Deason as she retires from her work on behalf of the  people of Arkansas, and especially the military and veterans community,  as a member of my staff in the U.S. Senate.   Colonel Deason started her lifetime of service at 19 years old when  she joined the Arkansas Army National Guard. She retired from that  career in 2013 with 33 years of service and soon after joined my staff  as our military and veterans liaison. Throughout her tenure with my  office, she has used her knowledge and experience to improve programs  and services for countless veterans and their families.   Over the past 7 years, Colonel Deason has traveled all across the  Natural State to meet with veterans' organizations; visit local, State,  and Federal facilities, as well as nonprofits; and resolve countless  problems for her fellow veterans. Whether bringing groups together to  tackle difficult issues or lending her support to promising new  programs, she used every skill and connection she had to improve the  lives of the men and women who serve our State and our Nation.   Of all her accomplishments during her time in the Senate, Anita is  probably best known as a champion of the Library of Congress Veterans  History Project. She spearheaded my office's involvement in this  program to ensure that stories of America's veterans are recorded for  generations to come. At that time, Arkansas veterans were  underrepresented in this national collection, so she set out to conduct  interviews and train other Arkansans to do the same. She ensured that  veterans from all eras are included and that previously overlooked  stories were recorded from veterans of color, women veterans, and  others who served our country with honor and helped shape our modern  military. She taught workshops, gave media interviews and trained other  congressional staff, all in an effort to make the project even more  robust and successful because of her passion for helping to learn about  and preserve our former servicemembers' stories and experiences.   Her tenure in the Senate is only a small portion of Colonel Deason's  public service. During her career in the Arkansas Army National Guard,  she served as a platoon leader, detachment commander, company executive  officer, and company commander. She was eventually promoted to colonel  while serving as the human resources officer.  [[Page S6912]]    She received a number of awards and decorations during her military  career including the Legion of Merit, Meritorious Service Medal, and  the Arkansas Commendation Medal. In 2018, she was inducted into the  Arkansas Military Veterans Hall of Fame. It was a well-deserved honor  for her tremendous military service and her dedication to fighting for  the needs of servicemembers and veterans throughout her years with the  U.S. Senate.   It has been a blessing and true honor to have Anita Deason as a  member of my team. Her unique perspective, dedication, and caring  nature have been invaluable in our work to meet the needs of Arkansas'  veterans. She truly made a difference. We will all miss working with  her and wish her the best of luck in retirement.                            ____________________
