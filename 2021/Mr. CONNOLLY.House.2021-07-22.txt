 Mr. Speaker, after 20 years, the United States is  winding down its involvement in a long, protracted war in Afghanistan,  but we have an obligation to the men and women who have served with  Allied forces who put themselves at risk, especially the interpreters.   I am proud of the fact that the first 2,500 of those people will be,  in fact, located in Virginia for processing as we try to protect them  and their families for their service in a noble cause.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to voting for the bill that will be  coming up later this morning, and I thank Mr. Crow, particularly, for  his leadership in this matter.                            ____________________
