 Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to  authorize a game-changing scale of investment in making America's  infrastructure more resilient to natural disasters.   The BUILD Resilience Act would build on the National Disaster  Resilience Competition first authorized in the 2013 Hurricane Sandy  emergency supplemental disaster package. It would authorize $1 billion  a year over 5 years to jumpstart large-scale investment in community  resilience--supporting jobs, strengthening infrastructure, and reducing  risk to communities from disasters like hurricanes and flooding.   This bill aims to follow the ``ounce of prevention'' principle.  Cleaning up after a disaster is important, but if we invest in sturdier  infrastructure before the disaster, there will be less to clean up  after the disaster. This is borne out in two separate studies. The  Congressional Budget Office estimates that every $1 invested upfront in  resilient infrastructure saves $3 on the back end. The Multihazard  Mitigation Council of the National Institute of Building Sciences  estimates $4 of benefit.   The Sandy Competition supported resilience projects in low-lying  coastal areas of Virginia and Louisiana; in Sandy-affected areas of New  York and New Jersey, in flood-prone Midwest regions like Iowa and North  Dakota, and elsewhere. But Virginia's grant illustrates the scale of  the challenge. This grant is supporting innovative flood-control  projects but only in two at-risk neighborhoods of Norfolk, which is  only one part of a broader Hampton Roads region. Neighboring localities  like Newport News and Chesapeake submitted proposals to address their  own infrastructure needs, but funding was insufficient. Since there  will always be risk of another devastating storm, we must learn from  Sandy and take steps now to protect our communities later. This bill  tries to do that.   With a range from 1\1/2\ to 7 feet of sea level rise projected by the  year 2100, the Hampton Roads region is the second largest population  center at risk from sea level rise in the Nation, behind only New  Orleans. Residents are dealing with skyrocketing flood insurance  premiums and flooding not only after a Sandy or a Matthew but from  ordinary rainstorms. This is a direct Federal responsibility given the  presence of the largest concentration of naval power in the world. An  ODU study estimates that the main Norfolk city road leading into Naval  Station Norfolk could be inundated by the tides a few hours per day by  midcentury. That makes this not only an infrastructure issue but a  national security issue.   I hope to work with the White House and Congress to advance a  comprehensive infrastructure package that rises to this challenge.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to  authorize a game-changing scale of investment in making America's  infrastructure more resilient to natural disasters.
