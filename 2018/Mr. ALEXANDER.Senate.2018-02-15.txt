 Mr. President, the Senator from Delaware is somewhere  in the neighborhood, and he has a train to catch in a few minutes. So I  ask unanimous consent that after I make a few remarks about today's  events and the voting today, the Senator from Delaware be recognized,  and that following his speaking, I be recognized again.    Mr. President, today the Senate voted on immigration.   Immigration is a passionate issue. It affects the lives of people. It  affects the American creed, which involves the rule of law, which  involves the fact that we are a nation of immigrants. It goes to the  heart of our country, and we have very strong opinions about it. All of  us know that.   Of course, that is the reason we have a U.S. Senate. This is not an  issue that the Shreveport City Council or the Nashville Metro Council  can solve. We can't solve the problem of our Nation's borders. We can't  solve the problem in our communities about what to do about people who  were brought here as children illegally through no fault of their own.  That is our job. That is the job of the President of the United States.  That is the job of the Senate, and it is the job of the Congress.   We tried before. We tried in 2007, and we failed. We tried in 2013,  and this body passed a bill with 68 or 69 votes. I voted for it. If we  had passed that bill, as for all the issues we debated today, we  wouldn't have them anymore because we dealt then with border security  in 2013. We would have added 20,000 border agents, 700 miles of  fencing, biometric detection at our ports of exit and entry, and E- Verify for all of the employers in the country. We would have dealt  with the issue of legal status for people illegally here, people  overstaying their visas, temporary workers. We would have done all of  that in 2013, but we did not do it.   So we are left with this problem of a large number of people living  in this country--some for a long period of time--who were brought here  as children through no fault of their own, which is one problem. We  have another problem on the border, which is that the border isn't  secure. People coming across the border is one problem, but in my view,  the drugs coming across the border are the biggest problem. We have had  a lot of hearings in the HELP Committee about opioid addiction. A lot  of the heroin and a lot of the illegal drugs that are devastating our  communities are coming across our southern border. It is just a fact,  and we need to deal with it.   So we are dealing with and we voted today on what to do about the  children brought here illegally by their parents through no fault of  their own and what to do about border security. The President of the  United States did his job on this one.   He did what a President is supposed to do.   I read a book by George Reedy, who was Lyndon Johnson's Press  Secretary. He said that a President's job--the Senator from Delaware is  a former Governor, so he knows about this. He and I had an executive  job when we were Governors. I did my job this way as Governor. A  President's job is to see an urgent need, to develop a strategy to meet  the need, and to persuade at least half the people you are right. That  is what George Reedy said the President's job was, and I think  President Trump in this case has done his job. He saw an urgent need.  He saw a need of the Dreamers, the DACA people who are here. He saw an  urgent need to deal with the border. He saw an urgent need to deal with  some other holes in our system of legal immigration. He saw a need to  deal with the fact that we have kind of slipped into a situation where  the million people a year who come here legally, unlike most countries  in the world, are brought here by cousins just because they are  cousins. They are not brought here because they are part of the  immediate family or because they add something special to our country,  either skilled or unskilled, and he sought to change that.   The President recognized the fact that once we give someone legal  status in this country, once we say to them: We have decided we want  you to be here permanently or nearly permanently. We want you at least  one day to dream of becoming a citizen of the United States--I agree  with the President on that. I don't want millions of people living in  this country permanently who are pledging their allegiance to  Afghanistan and Russia and China and Japan and every other country in  the world; I want them to stand up in the Federal court or wherever  they have the naturalization ceremony--or to be able to dream of  standing there--and take the same oath of allegiance to this country  that George Washington's soldiers took at Valley Forge, which is the  same allegiance today that it was then, where you renounce your  allegiance to any other country and you pledge your allegiance to the  United States. I want anyone who we have decided deserves legal status  on a permanent basis to have that in the back of their mind, not the  pledge of allegiance to Korea or Afghanistan or Bangladesh or Chile or  any other country in the world.   I think the President did his job. He made a reasonable proposal. I  think he did something that most Democrats and many Americans--maybe  many Republicans--did not expect him to do. He said: Let's take care  permanently of these 1.8 million children who were brought here through  no fault of their own. As long as they don't get in trouble and follow  the law, are law-abiding, let's give them the dream of citizenship  after 10 or 12 years. Let's deal with merit-based immigration. Let's  make some changes in our legal system. Let's plug some of the holes in  the border so these drugs don't come in.   The President made a very strong proposal. Now we are doing what we  are supposed to do. We are supposed to  [[Page S1153]]  react to that. Well, we did today. Senator Grassley offered the  President's proposal, and it got 39 votes. A bipartisan group offered a  narrower version of what the President wanted, and it only included the  border security part--$25 billion--and a permanent fix for the DACA or  Dreamers, who are here because of that provision in the law. It got 54  votes. But neither got 60. Neither got to 60, which we need.   Why do we need 60 votes? Because we are the U.S. Senate. The House of  Representatives only needs a majority. We get 60 because we want a  consensus. Why do we need a consensus? When we take on a big,  difficult, passionate issue like this, we want the people of this  country to accept it. We want them to turn around and look--well, if  that many Democrats and that many Republicans thought it was a good  idea, then maybe I should rethink my own view and think it is a good  idea.   That is why President Trump has a chance to be Nixon to China on the  immigration issue. He won his election to a large extent because he  promised a wall and he talked about immigration. Now he is saying: Here  is a solution that has to do with border security, citizenship, and the  DACA children, and people will pay attention to that. And they will pay  attention to us if we get more than a bare majority to vote for some  version of what the President has recommended. Well, we are up to 54.   I can give you an example of what I just said. In the late 1960s, the  debate was civil rights. Everett Dirksen was the minority leader of the  Senate; he was the Republican leader. Lyndon Johnson was the President;  he was a Democratic President. They worked together to get 68 votes for  the civil rights bill of 1968. It was opposed by Senator Richard  Russell of Georgia, but when Senator Russell lost, he flew back to  Atlanta and said: It is the law, and we should follow it.   That is what we did with civil rights. That is what we did with  Social Security. That is what we did with Medicare. That is what we did  more recently with fixing No Child Left Behind. That is what we did  with 21st Century Cures. When we take on a tough, complicated issue and  we talk about it long enough and we get enough of us on both sides of  the aisle to agree on it, we get a consensus, the country accepts it,  and you don't have to worry about the next Congress coming in and  passing it, repealing it, and changing it.    When we don't do that, it is like ObamaCare. It passes with a  partisan vote, and then we have a permanent political battle trying to  repeal it or replace it. That has been going on for 8 years. We are  still not through it yet. We hope to be, but we are not through it yet.   So we need 60 votes for a solution for the DACA children who were  brought here and the border security position. Actually, I would  suggest our goal should be 70, not 60. We are not going to get there  with a situation that has 47 or 48 Democrats and 8 or 9 Republicans-- that doesn't make 60 in the public schools of Tennessee--and we won't  get it with almost all the Republicans and just a few Democrats. That  is not a majority. That is not a consensus. That is not going to  persuade the people of this country that we have come up with something  lasting that most people can accept. I have no doubt we can get there.   There were 36 Senators of both parties who came to a meeting 3 weeks  ago at which we said to our two whips--Senators Durbin and Cornyn, on  each side--we would like for the two of you to help us find a consensus  on this. There were 36 of us. There have been 20 or 25 meetings--about  equal number in both parties--trying to find some solution here. I  think we are making some pretty good progress. We just didn't get there  today.   I am glad the majority leader said that this is not the end of it. It  can't be the end of it. We can't just leave this here. I can't go back  to Tennessee and tell Memphis or Nashville or Knoxville: Sorry, we  can't do it, so the mayor or the city council will now decide what to  do about these children who are illegally here and about the drugs  coming across the southern border and about legal immigration. I can't  do that.   I need to say: I am going to go back. The President has done his job.  The Senate worked on it for a week. We got up to 54 votes. We need 70.  We need 70.   So my hope is that the President will continue to advocate; do his  job; see an urgent need--he did; recommend a strategy to deal with the  need--he did; and try to persuade at least half the people he is right.  He is a good persuader. And then we will do our job, and that is not to  stand in the corners and throw things at each other. Let's see where we  can agree and do what we did on civil rights and fixing No Child Left  Behind. This is not any harder than those issues. We ought to be able  to do it; otherwise, we shouldn't be here.   I tell my colleagues often that it is pretty hard to be a Senator. It  is hard to get here. It is hard to stay here. And while you are here,  you might as well amount to something, and amounting to something means  getting a result. We didn't get a result today, but I am convinced that  we can.   In conclusion--and then I will go to my friend from Delaware--how do  we get to 70? Well, I came up here years ago and worked for a Senator  named Howard Baker. He was very successful in this body. He ended up as  the majority leader. He stood right over there next to Senator Byrd  when he was the Democratic leader. They had great differences of  opinion, but they ran this body very well. Howard Baker had a saying.  He said that it helped to be an eloquent listener, and he said that you  have to remember that sometimes the other fellow might be right.   I would like to say to my Democratic friends that in this case the  other fellow might be named Trump. They might not like that. They may  not like it, but I think we should give the President credit for seeing  an urgent need, recommending a strategy, and doing his best to persuade  half of the Americans that he is right about that.   I think we need some Members on the other side to do what eight of us  on the Republican side did this day, which is move the other direction,  recognize that the other fellow might be right, come to a conclusion,  and do our job. I think we made a start this week, but we are not there  yet. I look forward to the opportunity to finish the job, and  remembering Howard Baker's advice that the other fellow might be right  might be a good way to start.   Mr. President, I yield the floor to my distinguished colleague, the  Senator from Delaware.    Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Delaware for  his remarks and his comments. I certainly hope that when we come back,  we can get a result. That is what the job is about. I cosponsored and  voted for the President's legislation. I cosponsored and voted for the  bipartisan legislation. My hope is that I have a chance to cosponsor  and vote for legislation that gets 65 or 70 votes and solves the  problem.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to note the presence on  the floor of the junior Senator from Alabama, Mr. Jones, who has been  waiting patiently. He and I were working together on something that I  am about to speak about, a resolution that has to do with an event that  happened 50 years ago, the Memphis sanitation workers strike.   He has plenty to say about it, but he has not yet made what we call  his maiden speech on the Senate floor. We usually reserve that moment  for a singular opportunity to speak. So he is waiting until that time  to speak. I respect that. I told him the little story of what happened  to Senator Baker when he was in Senator Jones' position. Baker's  father-in-law, Senator Dirksen, whom I mentioned, was the leader.  Everybody assembled to hear Baker's maiden speech. Baker spoke a little  too long. Dirksen came over to congratulate him. Baker looked up and  said to his father-in-law, Senator Dirksen: How did I do?   Dirksen said: Howard, perhaps you should occasionally enjoy the  luxury of an unexpressed thought.   So I congratulate Senator Jones on his sticking with tradition here.  I value the fact that we are working together on civil rights, as well  as the fact that we will be in Memphis together on the Civil Rights  Pilgrimage, which he is taking a part in leading early next month. I  thank him for being on the floor today while I make these remarks.                            ____________________     Mr. President, 1968 was a tumultuous year. Violent  protests erupted in cities across the country. Both Dr. Martin Luther  King, Jr., and then-Senator and Presidential candidate Robert F.  Kennedy were assassinated, and American soldiers were fighting in the  Vietnam war.   In Memphis, TN, African-American sanitation workers had faced years  of hazardous working conditions and discrimination in pay and benefits.  Their strike would become a historic event in the civil rights  movement.   In January 1968, the workers began negotiating with Memphis Mayor  Henry Loeb and the Memphis City Council to improve pay and working  conditions.   On February 1, 1968, two sanitation workers, Echol Cole and Robert  Walker, sought shelter from the pouring rain and were crushed to death  in their garbage truck when the compactor on the truck malfunctioned.  Their deaths galvanized the 1,300 African-American sanitation workers  who decided to begin their strike to protest working conditions on  February 12, 1968.   The workers demanded recognition of their union, increased pay, and  safer working conditions. Mayor Loeb and the city council responded by  threatening to replace the striking workers unless they returned to  work.   Throughout February and early March, negotiations continued, and on  March 28, 1968, Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Rev. James Lawson  led a march from the Clayborn Temple that ended with rioting, arrests,  and the death of 16-year-old Larry Payne. Civil rights leaders vowed to  march again, focusing on the principles of nonviolence.   On April 3, 1968, Dr. King addressed a rally of 10,000 African- American workers and residents, members of the clergy, and union  members at the Mason Temple--the Memphis headquarters of the Church of  God in Christ. His speech included these lines:         I have been to the mountain top. . . . I've seen the       Promised Land. I may not get there with you. But I want you       to know tonight that we, as a people, will get to the       Promised Land.    That was Dr. Martin Luther King.   The next day, April 4, 1968, Dr. King was assassinated as he stood on  a balcony at the Lorraine Motel.   On April 8, 1968, 4 days later, 42,000 people marched in Memphis. The  strike was resolved on April 16. The 1,300 sanitation workers in  Memphis took a stand for freedom, and they displayed courage in their  pursuit of equality.   In his speech on April 3, Dr. King said:         Now we're going to march again, and we've got to march       again, in order to put the issue where it is supposed to be--      and force everybody to see that there are 1,300 of God's       children here suffering, sometimes going hungry, going       through dark and dreary nights wondering how this thing is       going to come out. That's the issue. And we've got to say to       the nation: We know how it's coming out. For when people get       caught up with that which is right and they are willing to       sacrifice for it, there is no stopping point short of       victory.    Now, 50 years later, this resolution that I, Senator Jones, Senator  Cardin, and Senator Corker submitted seeks to recognize their sacrifice  and contributions to the civil rights movement.   It is important that our children grow up learning about how these  1,300 Memphis sanitation workers and many others struggled for racial  justice in the midst of all that chaos. That is why, on Tuesday, I  submitted the Senate resolution to which I referred. I did it, along  with U.S. Senator Bob Corker, my colleague from Tennessee; Senator Doug  Jones from Alabama; and Senator Ben Cardin from Maryland, to recognize  the 50th anniversary of the 1968 Memphis sanitation workers strike.   Representative Steve Cohen has submitted the same resolution in the  U.S. House of Representatives. He recruited 76 cosponsors.   I would like to thank Representative Cohen for taking the lead in the  House. I would like to thank my Tennessee colleagues, Representatives  Black, Blackburn, Cooper, DesJarlais, Duncan, Fleischmann, Kustoff, and  Roe for their support as well.   I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this resolution.
