 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1988, the Protecting  Affordable Mortgages for Veterans Act, introduced by my friend, the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr.   David Scott).   This bill is an important continuation of work that our colleague Lee  Zeldin from Long Island, who is a lieutenant colonel in the Army  Reserve, started last Congress to better protect our Nation's veterans  from financial fraud.   This Congress, I was pleased to join Congressmen Scott and Zeldin as  an original cosponsor of this legislation, along with my colleague on  the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, Congressman Levin, to assist  with advancing this bill through both this committee, the Financial  Services Committee, and the House Veterans' Affairs Committee.   Last year, Congress enacted S. 2155, the most pro-growth banking bill  in a generation. Section 309 of that legislation included a provision  to impose a new seasoning requirement for the securitization of loans  insured by the VA.   This provision addresses the questionable practice of churning; that  is, the refinancing of a home loan over and over again just to generate  fees and profits for lenders with a slight short-term benefit for the  borrower but at an increased life-of-the-loan cost.   Unfortunately, that provision created a technical issue for a group  of VA loans that fell into no-man's land, if you will, between the date  on which the mortgage was issued and the technical requirements of the  new law, increasing the risk to lenders and making the loans less  attractive to investors.   Congressmen Zeldin and Scott took quick action to correct this  unintended consequence, but Congress ran out of time last year and it  did not become law.   The bill we are considering today, H.R. 1988, is a continuation of  their efforts to address this unintended problem and ensure that these  VA loans receive the equitable treatment they deserve.   To some, this bill today might seem to be just a technical fix, but  it is an important one. Our Nation's veterans should not be subject to  suspect practices like churning.   I am pleased that this bill, along with the ongoing efforts of the VA  loan securitizer Ginnie Mae, will stamp out churning and better protect  veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1988 and, once  again, commend my colleague from Georgia (Mr.  [[Page H5275]]    David Scott), and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, again, I thank my friend, the gentleman from  Georgia, for his bipartisanship and his willingness to fight for  veterans. I appreciate that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Zeldin), my Republican colleague on the House  Financial Services Committee, a veteran himself and a servicemember who  has been a champion on legislating this fix.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Once again, I thank the sponsor of this legislation, the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr.   David Scott).   I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Zeldin) for his continued  leadership on this legislation.   I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Levin), whom I have the  privilege of serving with on the Veterans Affairs' Committee as well,  for his leadership in getting this bipartisan legislation to the House  floor and to this point.   I thank the chairwoman of our full committee, the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Waters), for her leadership in helping navigate this  legislation forward.   Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, this is an important piece of  legislation. It is bipartisan recognition of a problem created  unintentionally by a law passed last year, and it is about providing  two basic protections for veterans: protecting veterans who are seeking  the dream of homeownership from predatory practices and from this  practice of churning, and preserving liquidity in the secondary market  for VA loans, which, in a nutshell, means that our veterans will have  access to more affordable housing.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friends on the other side of the aisle, and I  thank Mr. Zeldin for his leadership.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 2515, the Whistleblower Protection Reform  Act of 2019.   I would like to thank my colleagues, Congressman Green and  Congressman Huizenga, for their work on this commonsense, bipartisan  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, whistleblowers play a very important role in rooting out  bad behavior that harms the market as well as mom-and-pop investors.  Additionally, businesses have a self-interest in detecting and  eliminating illegal activity as swiftly as possible within their  organizations. To that end, clarifying the concept of encouraging  employees to report alleged securities fraud activities to their  employers without fear of retaliation just makes simple common sense.   Businesses typically strive to comply with the law, and they have  incentives to do so from market pressures, but it is also because  unlawful activity hurts the company itself and it hurts its investors,  driving down the company's value, tarnishing the company's reputation,  repelling business partners and customers, and damaging the overall  marketplace. That is why, frankly, the vast majority of actors in the  private sector do the right thing.   For these reasons, many companies have implemented strong internal  reporting measures to detect and mitigate potential wrongdoing before  harm spreads. But if internal whistleblowers who report potential  securities law violations internally are not protected from  retaliation, what good are these internal reporting systems that these  companies have voluntarily established?   That notion might seem counterintuitive, but last year, in the  Digital Realty Trust case, the Supreme Court held that the  whistleblower antiretaliation protections of the Dodd-Frank Act do not  extend to internal whistleblowers; only those who report to the SEC are  protected from retaliation.   Now, this is not an error in the Supreme Court's judgment; it is  simply a faithful interpretation of the flawed drafting of the Dodd- Frank law. This bill solves this problem by amending section 922 of  Dodd-Frank to clarify that whistleblowers who report alleged misconduct  internally with their employers but not to the SEC are protected by  Dodd-Frank's antiretaliation provisions.   By clarifying that Dodd-Frank's antiretaliation protections also  apply to internal whistleblowers, this bill addresses the Supreme  Court's interpretation and aligns Dodd-Frank's whistleblower  protections with other major whistleblower laws.   Again, I want to thank Congressman Green and Congressman Huizenga for  this important bipartisan legislation, which I proudly support. I urge  all of my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 2515.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time, and I  am prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, again, I would thank Congressman Green and Congressman  Huizenga for their leadership on this extending of whistleblower  protections, and I yield back the balance of my time.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty)  for her leadership and her work on H.R. 2162, the Housing Financial  Literacy Act of 2019.   The Federal Housing Administration currently provides government- backed mortgage insurance to more than $1.3 trillion in loans. FHA  insurance allows a wide array of borrowers to qualify for mortgages,  including many low- and moderate-income families who might not  otherwise have access to credit through traditional underwriting.   In fiscal year 2018, the FHA endorsed over 1 million forward  mortgages, including over 775,000 purchase loans, nearly 83 percent of  which were to first-time home buyers.   Given the large population of first-time home buyers using the FHA,  it makes sense to encourage those individuals to seek out ways to  strengthen their financial knowledge and better prepare themselves for  the challenges of homeownership.   Right now, current law states that FHA has the ability to provide  first-time homeowners with a discount on their FHA upfront premiums if  they complete an approved homeownership financial counseling course-- makes a lot of sense. However, the statute is drafted in such a way  that the provision only applies in particular circumstances when FHA  upfront premiums exceed 2.75 percent.   Since FHA upfront premiums are currently set at 1.75 percent, a rate  that has not been exceeded in a decade, FHA does not currently provide  an upfront premium discount to first-time homeowners who complete a  financial counseling course.   This bill, H.R. 2162, would amend current law to require FHA to  provide a 0.25 percent upfront premium discount from the prevailing  rate in effect at the time for other borrowers to first-time home  borrowers. This equates to a $625 savings off the current premium  structure on a $250,000 mortgage.   The hope is, by making such a discount mandatory, more first-time  homeowners will seek out financial literacy counseling and produce  better outcomes for a traditionally at-risk group of homeowners.   The bottom line is that FHA is a valuable tool to help expand the  universe of mortgage credit in our housing system, and we ought to be  doing all that we can to make sure that we are using our limited public  resources to encourage all borrowers to be well-prepared for the  commitment of homeownership through financial counseling or any other  effective means of creating more stable and reliable borrowers.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Stivers), my Republican colleague, who is the  co-chairman of the Financial Literacy Caucus in Congress and someone  who has worked in a bipartisan way very productively with Congresswoman  Beatty on this important initiative.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, again, I would like to commend and applaud my friend,  the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty), for her leadership on this.  What an outstanding list of endorsements of this legislation. It goes  to show how much work she has put into this and that Congressman  Stivers and others have put into this bipartisan legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman of the full committee,  Congresswoman Waters, for bringing this forward.   In conclusion, as we look at this legislation, it is really a win- win-win:   It is a win because first-time home buyers are now going to be able  to have a more affordable downpayment.   It is a win, in addition, because those first-time homeowners, as the  gentlewoman from Ohio and the gentleman from Ohio pointed out, will be  more prepared for the responsibility of homeownership, which is what is  typically the most significant investment anyone makes in their entire  lifetime.   And, finally--and I think this is a point that we do need to  underscore as well--when you are talking about federally insured,  federally backed, taxpayer-insured, taxpayer-supported mortgages, it is  good for the American taxpayer that we make sure that homeowners are  prepared for that very important responsibility.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues--for homeowners, for  taxpayers--to support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise in support of H. Res. 456.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, Congresswoman Pressley and  Congressman Huizenga, for their work on this bipartisan resolution.   More often than not, discussions in the Financial Services Committee  are about the Securities and Exchange Commission, as it is the primary  Federal regulatory agency for the U.S. securities markets.   However, State securities regulators also play an important and  complementary role in grassroots investor protection, investor  education, and facilitating capital formation.   H. Res. 456 highlights the important investor protection missions of  State and Federal securities regulators. The resolution also encourages  the continued collaboration between the SEC and State securities  regulators.   American capital markets provide an avenue for mom-and-pop investors  and retail investors to achieve the American Dream and grow their nest  egg for retirement, for their child's college tuition, or to buy a  home. Protecting investors, ensuring the integrity of our capital  markets, and promoting capital formation are goals that we all can  stand behind.   This resolution recognizes the important role State securities  regulators play on each of these fronts.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 456, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, once again, I appreciate the work of Ms.  Pressley, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2919, the Improving Investment  Research for Small and Emerging Issuers Act. I thank my colleagues,  Congressman Huizenga and Congressman McAdams, for their efforts on this  bipartisan legislation that will help small companies and our capital  markets.   The U.S. capital markets have, and continue to be, a vibrant  ecosystem, fueling America's economic growth and generating millions of  private sector jobs. These markets provide financing and needed  resources to the smallest startups and the largest international  companies.   However, a company's size often impacts how easily it can access  capital. For example, larger companies have generally found capital  markets easier to access than smaller ones.   While the number of IPOs in the U.S. has rebounded from its post- crisis glut--thanks in large part to the success of the bipartisan JOBS  Act of 2012--smaller companies still face significant regulatory and  market impediments that disincentivize them from accessing capital via  the public markets.   There are differing perspectives as to why fewer companies,  particularly small companies, have gone public over the past few  decades. The data suggest that in fulfilling its capital formation  mandate, the Securities and Exchange Commission needs to tailor its  approach to account for the varying nature and size of companies.                                time  1745    An important piece to this approach is recognizing insufficient  research coverage of microcap, small-cap, and emerging companies can  undermine the liquidity necessary to attract investor interest and  facilitate capital necessary for growth.   This bipartisan legislation would direct the SEC to study, evaluate,  and  [[Page H5283]]  report on issues affecting the ability of emerging growth companies and  other small issuers to obtain research coverage, including SEC rules,  FINRA rules, State and Federal liability concerns, the 2003 Global  Analyst Research Settlements, and MiFID II.   Again, I thank Congressman Huizenga and Congressman McAdams for this  commonsense and bipartisan legislation, which I support.   Mr. Speaker, we have no further speakers, so at this time, I will  close. Let me once again urge my colleagues to support this commonsense  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3050, the Expanding  Investment in Small Business Act.   I commend my colleague, an outstanding new member of the Financial  Services Committee, Congressman Steil from Wisconsin, for his hard work  on this important bill that will help us make our capital markets  stronger and more attractive. Because of his personal experience and  his background in public markets as a counsel for a publicly traded  company, he has brought to bear particular expertise in forwarding this  legislation for our consideration.   Mutual funds have historically played an important role in providing  liquidity to newly public companies. Since 1990, the total number of  registered mutual funds has grown approximately 10 times; mean fund  size has more than doubled; and open-end fund holdings of U.S.  corporate equities have reached approximately 24 percent of the entire  market. This growth means the investment decisions of mutual funds  today are an important aspect of our public capital markets.   As the size of mutual funds has increased in recent years, the  diversified fund limit rules, specifically the 10 percent cap on a  diversified fund's ownership of an issuer's outstanding shares, have  limited funds' ability to take meaningful positions in small-cap  companies, according to industry experts.   The current 10 percent cap on mutual fund positions limits interest  in small-cap IPOs because as large funds' assets under management grow,  the 10 percent cap means that any investment in a small IPO will have a  negligible impact on overall fund return.   Declining mutual fund interest in small IPOs also materially weakens  the trading environment for small-cap stocks and likely deters small,  private firms from joining our public markets, something we should not  be discouraging.   H.R. 3050 would require the SEC to study whether the current  diversified fund limit threshold for mutual funds to 10 percent  constrains their ability to take meaningful positions in small-cap  companies.   As part of its report, the SEC shall recommend to Congress any  statutory changes that should be undertaken to address the SEC's  findings.   This is an important bill for helping us make our capital markets as  attractive as possible, especially for smaller companies.   For these reasons, I support H.R. 3050. I commend my colleague, the  gentleman from Wisconsin, for his leadership and his experience on this  issue, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Steil), the author of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Riggleman), who is an outstanding new member of the House  Financial Services Committee. He is another gentleman who comes to  Congress not as a politician, but as an entrepreneur, someone who has  built businesses and created jobs himself and understands intimately  the need for small businesses and entrepreneurs to have the ability to  access capital.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2409, the Expanding Access to  Capital for Rural Job Creators Act. As a Member of Congress who  represents a rural area, I want to commend the work of Congresswoman  Axne and Congressman Mooney for their bipartisan commitment to help  rural small businesses access capital.   In the House Financial Services Committee, we continue to highlight  the importance of capital formation for individuals in underbanked  rural communities.   Small and rural communities in Kentucky and other places are  extremely vulnerable during recessions and during recovery, and their  subsequent recoveries are often slower due to a lack of access to  capital.  [[Page H5286]]    U.S. counties as a whole saw more business establishments close than  open during the first 5 years of the most recent financial crisis. This  decline was felt disproportionately in rural areas, where the  percentage of business closures was higher. Additionally, as our  economy recovers, data shows that small businesses and startups are  much less likely to form in rural areas than urban areas.   H.R. 2409 is an example of bipartisan legislation that can help solve  the biggest issue for a number of rural small businesses, and that is  access to capital.   H.R. 2409 would amend the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to direct  the Advocate for Small Business Capital Formation to identify unique  challenges to rural-area small businesses when identifying problems  that small businesses have with securing access to capital.   Small towns across the country are still struggling to recover from  the post-financial crisis recession. It is imperative that we fully  understand the challenges facing rural areas so that we can  reinvigorate economic growth and diversify rural economies in those  areas that need help the most. This bipartisan bill is an important  tool for us to better address the capital formation issues facing our  rural small businesses and job creators.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2409, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, as I said before, the gentleman from Virginia  who is going to speak has personal experience in the private sector, is  an entrepreneur, and knows a lot about rural America and rural  America's need for access to capital as an entrepreneur.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Riggleman), who is an outstanding new member of our committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. John W. Rose), who is another outstanding new member of  our committee. The gentleman from Tennessee does, in fact, represent a  rural district and is himself a job creator and someone who knows about  the need to provide expanded access to credit for rural American  entrepreneurs.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield myself  the balance of my time to close.   Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, as a Representative of a rural  congressional district and who has tremendous respect for the  hardworking, small business owners of rural America--and in my case,  rural, central, and eastern Kentucky--I know how hard it is for folks  to access the credit that they need to build a business, to grow jobs,  to create greater and better opportunities for themselves and their  employees.   Not every small business in America, Mr. Speaker, can access Silicon  Valley. Not every small business in middle America can access Wall  Street. We need the SEC to have greater sensitivity to rural small  business and their unique challenges in terms of access to capital  formation.   So I applaud the leadership of the Members who have brought this  legislation forward. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  Vote in favor of rural small business capital formation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
