 Madam President, today, the Senate debates removing the  authority of the President to wage war in Iraq. Momentous as such  debate might be, it is largely rendered symbolic by the fact that the  war in Iraq has been over for more than a decade.   Were this body serious about debating the authority of the President  to wage war across Africa and the Middle East, we would today be  repealing the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force.   Presidential administrations of both parties have used the 9/11  authorization to justify war in over 20 countries, from Afghanistan to  Libya to Syria to Somalia to Yemen. In fact, both parties have  essentially argued that the 9/11 AUMF has no temporal or geographic  limits at all.   Repealing the Iraq war authorization will end no wars and save no  lives.   The bill before us ignores the pervasive, seemingly limitless 9/11  proclamation, and it seeks, instead, to repeal the 1991 and 2002  authorizations to make war against Saddam Hussein's Iraq--a regime that  no longer exists.   So we are missing the point here. We are going to repeal the one  authorization they no longer use and leave the  [[Page S900]]  one in place that authorizes war everywhere, all the time.   The public is told to celebrate the boldness of a Senate that will  today end a war that has been over for over a decade, while ignoring an  authorization of war that is really the only pertinent current  authorization.   Now, it is true that some unreconstructed neoconservatives still  advocate for the 2002 authorization to make war against Saddam  Hussein's Iraq, but no serious scholars believe that the Iraq war  resolution has any bearing at all in a world where the current  Government of Iraq is an ally, at least ostensibly, of the United  States.   Even more insensibly, some of these neocon throwbacks argue that a  20-year-old authorization to counter Saddam Hussein's Iraq somehow has  something to do with authorizing military force against Iran. It is  nonsensical. The very argument is so strained that ordinarily one  wouldn't even bother countering such a frivolous case except for the  fact that many Senators insist on making it.   We voted to go to war against Saddam Hussein's Iraq. He is dead and  gone. His government is gone. The new government is an ally. The  authorization means absolutely nothing. But yet some people argue on  the floor: Oh, we have to have this in case we want to attack Iran.   Have they ever heard of coming back here and asking for permission?   Have they ever heard of saying we hold this power given to us by the  Constitution and that we should be the ones to bestow the declaration  of war to the President?   The 2002 AUMF doesn't mention Iran. President Bush's March 2003  speech to the Nation announcing his decision to invade Iraq does not  mention Iran, and Iran and Iraq were enemies for over two decades prior  to the invasion. In fact, the House report accompanying the 2002 AUMF  refers to Iran but only as a victim of Saddam Hussein's aggression.  Nothing--absolutely nothing--in the Iraq war authorization justifies  hostilities against Iran.   One would think that these brave ``armchair'' generals would relish  the thought of actually debating a war and putting their vote, their  imprimatur, their stamp of approval on their very own war. And yet they  want to leave it to a previous generation and have no debate should we  decide that we need to go to war with Iran. Instead, this plucky crowd  of war advocates want a permanent authorization of war on the books so  as not to be troubled with the tedium of debating new wars or waiting  possibly 24 hours for the consent of Congress.   It wasn't always so. While Henry Clay was not always the greatest  opponent of war, he did find his voice when his son Henry Junior, was  killed in the unnecessary Mexican-American War. In the spring of 1844,  after hearing of Henry Junior's death at the battle of Buena Vista,  Henry Clay put into words what every Founding Father had previously  explained. He spoke these words in Lexington, KY:         A declaration of war is the highest and most awful exercise       of sovereignty. The Convention, which framed our federal       constitution, had learned from the pages of history that it       had been often and greatly abused. It had seen that war had       often been commenced upon the most trifling of pretexts . . .       that such a vast and tremendous power ought not to be       confided to the perilous exercise of one single man. The       Convention, therefore, resolved to guard the war-making power       against these great abuses. . . . Whenever called upon to       determine upon the solemn question of peace and war, Congress       must consider and deliberate and decide upon the motives,       objects and causes of the war.    That was Henry Clay in 1884.   And yet, today, the best the present Congress can muster is to  propose to end a war that ended long ago. In fact, we are told  precisely that it is OK to repeal this particular authorization because  the President isn't really using it.   If you ask President Biden if we take away the 9/11 authorization, he  would say: Oh, no, no. We are still using that one in about 20  different countries.   So we are going to repeal the one authorization he no longer cares  about, and we are going to leave into place one that virtually-- Presidents of both parties have virtually said is unlimited in scope.   It wasn't intended to be. If you read the authorization from 9/11,  you will find that it is very specific.   But today don't worry that we actually might rein in Presidential  authority for war. Don't worry that today's repeal will actually end  any current war anywhere. Don't worry. Don't worry about continuing to  send our soldiers to the Middle East. Don't worry about continuing to  send our soldiers to Somalia and Syria and Iraq.   The argument for repeal is that, like most debates in Congress, the  victory will be Pyrrhic and ignored and war will go on. The armament  industry spread throughout the United States will continue to prosper.   Don't worry. The vote today is easy. The vote today is mere  symbolism.   I will support that symbolism, but I will not pretend that it is  brave or meaningful or that one American soldier's life will be saved.  I will support the symbolism because that is all the bravery that this  particular Senate considers to be possible. But I won't celebrate  today's vote as anything more than symbolism.   If there exists any desire to end America's forever wars, Congress  should today strike a blow for peace by repealing the 2001  authorization for war. After all, the 9/11 AUMF never intended to  authorize worldwide war, all the time, everywhere, forever.   The wording of the 9/11 AUMF was debated in 2001, a generation ago,  and was precisely worded to authorize the President to make war on  those who attacked us on 9/11 and those who harbored them--not a word  about making war on associated forces, not a word about making war on  their descendants, not a word about making worldwide war on religious  extremism. But that is exactly what the 9/11 2001 AUMF has become--a  catchall for a permanent war, everywhere, all the time.   So if anyone in the Senate is really serious about regaining the  power to declare war, about informing Presidents of both parties that  the Constitution exclusively gave the power to declare war to Congress,  I offer an amendment today that might actually bring an American  soldier home, an amendment that might actually save an American  soldier's life, an amendment that sends an actual signal to the  President that congressional authority and resolve actually lives and  breathes and will resist Presidential aggrandizement.   Some Senators will argue that a vote to repeal the 9/11 military  force proclamation for war--but they say: Well, we could do it, but  only if we simultaneously replace it with another sweeping transfer of  war-making power to future Presidents.   Really? Is there not one defender of Congress's exclusive power to  declare war?   Is there no one else who will reject the abdication of Congress to  constitutional responsibilities?   Is there not anyone who will defend the notion that absenting  perpetual authorization for war, we could survive on just the  Constitution alone?   For most of American history, for 225 years, we lived without a  perpetual authorization of war. We addressed it as it arose and  Congress voted--not a generation ago's Congress, the people currently  elected would debate on one of the most important debates we ever have,  whether to go to war. But most people here will say, no, we need to  keep a proclamation from 9/11 that has nothing to do with the world  today and nothing to do with the attack on 9/11. We need to keep it in  place just in case so we could have troops everywhere.   For most of our history, we survived without such a perpetual  authorization. The Republic survived under the notion that America is  reticent to make war; that we are a merchant nation conscious of the  great prosperity economic freedom has brought us in the world and also  conscious of the devastation and famine and brutality and the despair  of war but also quite outspoken in our history that America won't be  trifled with; that once awakened, once attacked, America can and will  bring that mighty economic engine to life--the engine that defeated  Hitler, the engine that defeated the Japanese Empire, and the engine  that after 9/11 showed that America will not countenance, for any  reason, an attack on our people.   Couldn't we live under the Constitution again? Couldn't we show the  confidence in our people, in our Congress, in our own individual self- worth to let  [[Page S901]]  the world know that we don't want perpetual war; we don't want to be  the policemen of the world; we don't want our Army stationed across the  globe. But provoke us, attack us, and you will discover that we cherish  our freedom, and we will fight for it; that our fight will be a  constitutional one.    When America was attacked at Pearl Harbor, the Congress reacted  constitutionally within days to declare war. When America was attacked  on 9/11, once again, Congress acted in a nearly unanimous fashion to  declare war. Couldn't we obey the Constitution and declare war when  necessary and not keep on the books a perpetual authorization of war?   Only by eliminating these perpetual authorizations for war will  Congress regain its constitutional prerogative to declare war. One  generation should not bind another generation to war. The Congress that  voted for the war in 2001 is no longer constituted, and many of those  Members are no longer even living. Many of our soldiers were not even  born when Congress authorized that war.   So, today, I will offer the U.S. Senate a chance to repeal the 9/11/ 2001 authorization for war, to reclaim our constitutional power, and  send a message to the world that we are a nation of peace; that when  provoked to war, the gentle giant that is America will respond lawfully  according to the Constitution; that when war is absolutely necessary,  America will obey the Constitution, which requires us to debate and  vote upon war and not hide beneath another generation's deliberations.   Today, we should rise above symbolism and repeal the 9/11  authorization for war and show our respect for the Constitution, our  fealty to the rule of law, and our sincere desire that peace, not  perpetual war, be our legacy.    Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 2, and I ask  that it be reported by number.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the following  interns in my office be granted floor privileges until May 5, 2023:  Andrew Jarocki, Nicholas Sierco, Leon Kamenev, and Henry Beck.
