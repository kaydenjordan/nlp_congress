 Madam President, May is Military Appreciation Month. In  light of that, I come to the Senate floor to remind us all just how  important our military is to our way of life. One of the blessings of  being a U.S. Senator and being on the Armed Services Committee and a  past member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I have had the  privilege to travel, as you have, around the world, visiting with our  men and women in uniform.   I have concluded that the best--and I mean the very best--of what we  produce here in America is in uniform around the world, worn by our  women and men, protecting our interests and defending freedom around  the world. There are only six reasons in the Declaration of  Independence why 13 Colonies got together in the first place, and one  of those was to provide for the common defense.   Today, the world is more dangerous than any time in my lifetime.  Today, the United States faces five threats across five domains. This  is much more complicated than the world has ever seen. Today, we  measure the threats in this manner: China, Russia, North Korea, Iran,  and terrorism across five domains.   It used to be air, land, and sea. Unfortunately, today, it is air,  land, sea, cyber, and now space. The tragedy, frankly, of our time is  we have treated space as a scientific endeavor over the last 30 years,  and others who we now consider potential threats have treated it as a  military domain.   I grew up in a military town. My father served in Germany during  World War II. When World War II was ended, he joined the Reserves and  then was called up again in the Korean war. He spent a couple of years  in Korea during the Korean war. I have his dog tags today in my office.  They serve as a constant reminder of his commitment to defending our  ideals and upholding our way of life here in America. It reminds me  that every single woman and man in uniform in our services today do the  same thing.   Today, I am humbled to represent our men and women in uniform in the  United States Armed Services Committee. I take that very seriously, as  I know every member does. One of my greatest honors as a member of this  committee and a former member of the Foreign Relations Committee, as I  said, is to travel overseas. The highlight in every one of those trips  is not meeting with the head of state or the head of the military or  the foreign minister; it was having dinner with people from my home  State who were in uniform around the world.   When President Obama was in office, the No. 1 request I heard from  heads of state around the world was: We need America to reengage.   At that time, America had withdrawn. We had created a vacuum. People  weren't asking us to be the world's policeman. They were asking us to  basically reengage and have a seat at the table and lead again. After a  decade of withdrawal from the world stage under the prior  administration, America is now leading again.   President Trump is reengaged with the rest of the world. He has made  it clear that America's interest comes first. When we say America  first, it doesn't mean America alone. Today, our allies trust us again,  and our adversaries fear us again. President Trump has also taken  action to rebuild  [[Page S2998]]  our military after it was gutted during the prior administration. Under  President Obama, spending on the military was cut 25 percent, and we  saw the resulting drop in our readiness.   In the last 2 years, we have updated defense spending by $80 billion  a year. As a result, in addition, we have avoided the use of continuing  resolutions in each of the last 2 years, thanks to people on both sides  of the aisle--Senator Leahy and Senator Shelby, who are the ranking  member and the chair of the Appropriations Committee--who worked  diligently last year and made sure that we got defense funding done  before the end of the fiscal year and without a continuing resolution.   Because of that, readiness is on the rise again in the military.  Modernization efforts and rebuilding our military are underway, and our  men and women in uniform are safer around the world, No. 1, and have  the resources they need to carry out their mission.   I am proud of the progress that we have made in just a very short  period of time. Just in the last 2 years, our readiness has  dramatically improved. However, a continuing resolution of any length  for fiscal year 2020 will erode and undo a lot of progress we have made  just in readiness over the last couple of years.   I am really very concerned that this is a primary responsibility of  ours here in the Senate and, indeed, in Congress, and it is one we have  not stood up to in the past. We have got to do better than that this  year.   I believe that Secretary of the Navy, Richard Spencer, said it best  when he described the impact of continuing resolutions. Since the 1974  Budget Act was put into place, Congress has used 187 continuing  resolutions as a release valve to fund the government in a temporary  manner.   Let me say that again, since 1974, 45 years, we have used 187  continuing resolutions. Each one of those continuing resolutions is  devastating to our military in so many ways that I will get into in  just a minute. Continuing resolutions are absolutely devastating to our  military, both in readiness and the ability to rebuild our military. It  is the most insidious thing Congress can do to our men and women in  uniform. Many of us here don't even realize the damage that continuing  resolutions do to our military.   I have questioned all three current service Secretaries and their  chiefs of staff, both publicly and in private meetings, about the  operational impacts of continuing resolutions and funding uncertainty.   Here are some of the responses:   A continuing resolution ``would be like a punch in the gut,''  according to ADM John Richardson, Chief of Naval Operations.   A continuing resolution ``would stall our progress on readiness and  modernization,'' said Gen. Bob Neller, Commandant of the U.S. Marine  Corps.   Heather Wilson, Secretary of the Air Force, said that the defense  budget sequester ``did more damage to the United States Air Force and  our ability to defend the nation than anything our adversaries have  done in the last 10 years--and we did it to ourselves.''   Secretary of the Army Mark Esper said:         Fiscal uncertainty has done a great deal to erode our       readiness and hamper our ability to modernize. . . . If we do       not modernize the force right now, we risk losing a future       conflict against Russia or China. It's just that simple.    Finally, Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer said, and this is  classic:         Continuing resolutions have cost the Department of the Navy       roughly $4 billion. . . . Since 2011, we have put $4 billion       in a trash can, put lighter fluid on top of it and burned it.    I don't know how to put it more clearly than that.   CRs have a direct and immediate impact across the entire Department  of Defense--from training, to readiness, to maintenance, to personnel,  and, yes, to contracting.   During a CR, training must be rescoped, scaled back, or discontinued  entirely, which means our warfighters are less prepared for battle and  don't have the resources to defend themselves properly when in the heat  of battle.   Depot maintenance and weapons development are delayed, resulting in  costly delays, less lethality, and higher costs.   Hiring and recruitment are put on pause, leaving critical gaps in  workforce skill sets.   We have the development of cyber capability and space capabilities  now. We are just ginning up those capabilities, and CRs absolutely  devastate these young, developing capabilities.   Change-of-station moves for servicemembers and their families are  halted, creating unnecessary turmoil for families. Can you imagine that  you have kids, and you are going to be deployed overseas. The timing  has to be right to get your kids in schools over there. Well, if a CR  happens to occur--and guess what happens around September 30. The end  of our fiscal year. If your family is moving around that period of  time, it could be held up because of that CR. That is very  disconcerting to families already stressed by increased deployments and  rapid turnarounds.   The DOD cannot start new contracts or in many cases has to cancel  existing ones. That devastates the supply chain. When we look at the  supply chain in the military, after the devastating disinvestment of  the last administration, one of the things that have to be rebuilt is  the supply chain. The consistent funding of the supply chain is  critical to the long-term defense of this country, and it is one we  have taken for granted and have devastated over the last decade.   Additionally, the Department of Defense has outlined hundreds of  critical projects that would be disrupted or even discontinued if a  current CR is used this year. I can think of one right now. A very much  in demand helicopter has been under development for the last few years.  It is ready to go. It is ready to be sent to the troops in the field.  Yet, if we have a CR come September 30, it will be delayed 1 full year.   We cannot allow this any longer. Clearly, CRs create inefficiencies  and uncertainty that hurt the bottom line and our ability to fight.  These funding disruptions weaken our strategic capability and shake the  confidence and foundation of our Nation's industrial base.   Until 2018, the Department of Defense started 13 of the last 17 years  under a continuing resolution. Thirteen of the last 17 years, they  started their fiscal year under a continuing resolution. Fortunately,  for the last 2 years, despite other funding failures of Congress, we  did not have to use a CR to fund the military. That has been a major  factor in boosting readiness and our reinvestment and recap efforts.   I hate to say it, but I believe we are staring down the barrel of a  potential CR on September 30 this year. As we sit here tonight, there  are only 25 working days between now and July 31. Why is that  important? Because in the month of August, this body, along with the  House, goes back to their States, and it is a work period in those  States. That means we will not be able to pass appropriations bills  here because we will not be here.   If we don't move this appropriations bill and get it passed by the  end, I believe, of July, when we come back in September, there will be  only 10 working days, legislative working days, and there is no way we  are going to get it all funded in that time.   Last year, on July 31, we had only appropriated about 12\1/2\ percent  of the Federal discretionary budget. We stayed here in August, to the  credit of the leadership, Senator McConnell. I believe that because of  that, we went from 12\1/2\ percent to 75 percent funding, including the  Department of Defense, and therefore we were able to avoid a continuing  resolution last year, as I have said.   Other people have said that the greatest threat to our national  security is our own national debt--General Mattis, Admiral Mullen.  There are various other people who have said that who are in a position  where they should know. I would add one thing to that that is  devastating to our ability to defend this country, and that is the use  of continuing resolutions.   When we look at the domain threats and the natural threats that have  evolved in the world right now--China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, and  terrorism--I don't think any of that damages the military, potentially,  as much as our inability here to provide consistent funding for our  military.   During Military Appreciation Month, I can think of no higher calling  than for Congress to work diligently on passing a defense  appropriations bill.  [[Page S2999]]  First, we have to pass the National Defense Authorization Act, which we  are working on this week. All the subcommittees are passing their  markups this week. We hope to move on that immediately. I believe that  will get passed here without much controversy.   I know that leadership right now is talking about moving in a very  intense manner, with a critical sense of urgency, to get this Defense  appropriations bill done. I applaud those efforts. I want to support it  in any way I can.   I call on everybody in this body to be supportive of making sure that  we can have, for the third year in a row--this is not a partisan issue;  this is about our men and women in uniform. Given that this month is  Military Appreciation Month, what better time to face up to this  potential and make sure that we don't have a continuing resolution come  September 30 of this year. That is the least we can do for our women  and men in uniform. And we can fulfill the responsibility our Founders  laid out in the Declaration of Independence when they outlined those  six reasons why we were coming together, and the No. 1 reason we had at  that time was to provide for the security of the United States of  America.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.
