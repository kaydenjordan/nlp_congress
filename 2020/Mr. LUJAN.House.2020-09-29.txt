 Madam Speaker, during this COVID-19 pandemic, which has  already killed more than 200,000 Americans, it is crucial that the CDC  and State health departments are sharing essential, lifesaving public  health data from Tribal epidemiology centers to protect the health of  the people they serve.   TECs, like any State or local health department, are legally entitled  to access to the same data, but for the first months of the public  health emergency, this data was withheld, despite the urging of Tribal  leaders, myself, and fellow members of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.   This data, including information on COVID-19 testing, positive case  numbers, contact tracing, and more, is essential for Tribes and TECs to  protect the health and well-being of the communities they serve.   That is why Representative Gianforte and I introduced the bipartisan  Tribal Health Data Improvement Act with the support of the National  [[Page H5012]]  Indian Health Board. While the CDC Director has fulfilled the  commitment he made to me to share COVID-related data with all the TECs,  there are still barriers to accessing other important data sets that  are crucial to protecting the public health during and after this  pandemic.   This important legislation makes it clear that the Department of  Health and Human Services and State health departments are required to  share data with Tribal health authorities, and it includes additional  funding to make this happen.   This legislation is about justice and living up to the Federal  Government's legal responsibility. It would help save lives as we  continue working to defeat this virus. Tribes and TECs are working hard  to protect public health in their communities, and it is their right to  access the CDC data to do so.   Madam Speaker, I look forward to seeing the House pass this  legislation, and I will urge my colleagues in the Senate to act with  the same urgency.
