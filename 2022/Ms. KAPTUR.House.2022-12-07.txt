 Madam Speaker, today is day number 286 of Russia's  unprovoked, illegal terrorist war on Ukraine.   As Congress works to complete our 2023 appropriations bills, it is  critical that the appropriation accounts for defense and energy  security be fully funded. Let us be mindful that liberty has real  enemies.   Our Nation, in alliance with the free nations of the world, cannot  miss a beat in ensuring NATO remains the strongest defender of global  liberty.   Vladimir Putin's criminal war on its innocent neighbor began in 2014.  By crossing Ukraine's sovereign border, Putin violated every tenet of  international law that has existed since World War II.   Then in February of this year, Russia unleashed its full terror. The  free world must draw a bold line in the sand against Russia's illegal  behavior.   Any nation that does not respect the sovereignty, territorial  integrity, and independence of adjoining nations must be brought to  full reckoning.   The free world cannot stand by idly. Putin's war machine must be  defeated.   The people of Ukraine are fighting valiantly for their own freedom.  May the bills being drafted as I speak ensure our Nation meets its  obligation as liberty's primary defender.  [[Page H8812]]                                ____________________
