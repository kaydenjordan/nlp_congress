 Mr. Speaker, recently the United States has  considered issuing a central bank digital currency. CBDCs are digital  liabilities issued by a central bank and made available to the public.   The implications for the United States dollar as the world's reserve  currency, and for domestic fiscal and monetary policy, of a US CBDC are  hotly debated by experts.   What should not be controversial, however, is that the Federal  Reserve, Treasury, and all other executive agencies cannot issue a CBDC  without explicit authorization from Congress. Article I, Section 8 of  the Constitution grants that power ``to coin money'' and ``regulate the  value thereof'' exclusively to Congress.   Under section 16 of the Federal Reserve Act, the Fed can issue  ``Federal Reserve notes,'' but CBDCs are not Federal Reserve notes. The  law restricts Federal Reserve notes to paper notes printed on ``plates  and dies'' engraved by the Treasury Department according to a detailed  process that clearly does not apply to digital money.   The Federal Reserve has consistently recognized that it lacks  authority to issue a CBDC without congressional authorization. The Fed  published a report on CBDCs in January of 2022 and said that it would  not issue a CBDC without ``clear support'' from Congress ``in the form  of a specific authorizing law.'' Fed Chair Jerome Powell has personally  affirmed that view on multiple occasions since that report was  published.   For example, last September, he said during a panel discussion on  digital finance that the Fed ``will need approval from both the  executive branch and Congress to move ahead with a central bank digital  currency.''   Although the Fed understands that it cannot issue a CBDC without  authorization from Congress, some commentators continue to suggest that  legislation may not be necessary. They are wrong.   The Framers of the Constitution understood the importance of a strong  and stable national currency, which is why they granted Congress the  exclusive power to coin money and regulate its value. Congress must not  forfeit this power, which is why I am introducing the Power to Mint  Act.   This bill clearly prohibits the Federal Reserve and the Treasury  Department from issuing a CBDC without authorization from Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Representative French Hill, who is  the chairman of the Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial  Technology and Inclusion on the Financial Services Committee for his  work with me on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Hill for his  partnership and leadership on this subject.   The benefits that the United States enjoys due to the dollar's global  reserve status have been called an exorbitant privilege, but that  privilege rests in part upon scrupulous observance of the rule of law  and how we regulate our currency.   The Power to Mint Act reinforces the rule of law by emphasizing  Congress' authority to control the future of the dollar.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to cosponsor my bill and keep the  power to authorize new currency with Congress.                            ____________________
