 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 8124) to amend title 18, United States Code, to  provide for transportation and subsistence for criminal justice  defendants, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 8124         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Criminal Judicial       Administration Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2. TRANSPORTATION AND SUBSISTENCE FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE                     ACT DEFENDANTS.         Section 4285 of title 18, United States Code, is amended in       the first sentence--        (1) by striking ``when the interests of justice would be       served thereby and the United States judge or magistrate       judge is satisfied, after appropriate inquiry, that the       defendant is financially unable to provide the necessary       transportation to appear before the required court on his       own'' and inserting ``when the United States judge or       magistrate judge is satisfied that the defendant is indigent       based on appointment of counsel pursuant to section 3006A,       or, after appropriate inquiry, that the defendant is       financially unable to provide necessary transportation on his       own''; and        (2) by striking ``to the place where his appearance is       required,'' and inserting ``(1) to the place where each       appearance is required and (2) to return to the place of the       person's arrest or bona fide residence,'';        (3) by striking ``to his destination,'' and inserting       ``which includes money for both lodging and food, during       travel to the person's destination and during any proceeding       at which the person's appearance is required''.       SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE USE OF MAGISTRATE JUDGES TO DECIDE                     POSTJUDGMENT MOTIONS.         Section 3401 of title 18, United States Code, is amended--        (1) in subsection (b)--        (A) in the second sentence, by striking ``and'' after       ``trial, judgment,'';        (B) in the second sentence, by inserting ``, and rulings on       all post-judgment motions'' after ``sentencing'';        (C) in the third sentence, by striking ``and'' after       ``trial, judgment,''; and        (D) in the third sentence, by inserting ``, and rulings on       all post-judgment motions'' after ``sentencing'';        (2) in subsection (c), by striking ``, with the approval of       a judge of the district court,''; and        (3) by inserting after subsection (i) the following:        ``(j) A magistrate judge who exercises trial jurisdiction       under this section, in either a petty offense case or a       misdemeanor case in which the defendant has consented to a       magistrate judge, may also rule on all post-judgment motions       in that case, including but not limited to petitions for       writs of habeas corpus, writs of coram nobis, motions to       vacate a sentence under section 2255 of title 28, and motions       related to mental competency under chapter 313 of this       title.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 8124, the Criminal Judicial Administration Act of  2020 is a bipartisan piece of legislation that makes two very modest  but important amendments to current law, promoting the efficient,  effective, and fair administration of justice.   The first part of this bill concerns out-of-custody criminal  defendants, particularly those who are released pending trial to live  in communities that are located far from the courthouse where their  cases are being heard.   The majority of Federal criminal defendants are detained pending  trial, and the United States Marshals Service is responsible for  housing and transporting them to court hearings, including trial. In  addition, under current law, the court may order the U.S. marshals to  provide funds for a criminal defendant who is released pending trial  but cannot afford the cost of travel to cover the defendant's travel to  the location of the courthouse for hearings or trial.   However, the defendant must fund their own way back home, and a  defendant in this position would not be able to receive financial  support from the U.S. marshals for subsistence, such as lodging and  meals. For an indigent defendant, these costs are sometimes  insurmountable.   For instance, a defendant from Hawaii who must attend their 2-week  trial in the Southern District of New York, would have to figure out  how to pay for 2 weeks of lodging in New York City, or a defendant  released to live at home on the Navajo Reservation, who has a pretrial  hearing at the Federal courthouse in Phoenix, Arizona, may not be able  to afford gas for the 6-hour ride back home.   For years, our Federal courts have struggled with how to assist  indigent defendants when they find themselves in these difficult  situations. But unfortunately, the courts' efforts have come up against  the text of the statute. This bill would authorize courts in the  interest of justice to order the U.S. marshals to cover roundtrip  travel and subsistence for defendants who must attend court hearings  but cannot afford to pay this on their own. The Judicial Conference of  the United States has urged us to correct this grave unfairness. I am  pleased to see that we are finally doing that with this bill.   The second part of this bill concerning Federal magistrate judges is  also supported by the Judicial Conference. Magistrate judges have trial  jurisdiction over certain misdemeanors, except for class A  misdemeanors, for which the maximum sentence is up to 1 year in  custody. With a defendant's consent, however, a magistrate judge may  exercise trial jurisdiction over a case involving a class A  misdemeanor.   Magistrate judges frequently do so and often hear class A misdemeanor  cases all the way through judgment and sentencing. Under current law, a  magistrate's jurisdiction ends after judgment is entered in a  misdemeanor case and post-judgment jurisdiction reverts to the district  court.   Indeed, magistrate judges are not authorized to hear post-judgment  motions, such as motions to vacate a sentence, even though they are the  ones that handled the entire matter at the trial level and are best  equipped to hear such post-judgment motions.   Among other things, this bill would authorize a magistrate judge to  hear post-judgment motions in misdemeanor cases in which she or he  exercised trial jurisdiction. This amendment clearly improves judicial  economy. It makes perfect sense. This is a straightforward and  bipartisan measure that will help our criminal justice system in a more  effective and fair manner.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Jeffries).    Mr. Speaker, the Criminal Judicial  Administration Act of 2020 is a modest but important bill. I commend  our colleagues, Representatives Jeffries and Roby, for their leadership  in bringing these important issues to our attention.   I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  bipartisan bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today on the House floor to  express my strong and unwavering support for the Fight Notario Fraud  Act of 2020.   This bill would hold public notaries accountable that abuse their  power to take advantage of vulnerable communities with language  barriers or who cannot read or who cannot fully understand the legal  system.   Many Spanish-speaking immigrants, for example, turn to notaries  because in their home countries a notario publico refers to a lawyer.   H.R. 8225 criminalizes notario fraud schemes to ensure that no one  can take advantage of the literal-sounding translation of notario  publico.   Significantly, some grifters have fraudulently used the notary public  title to hold themselves out as authorized to provide advice and  services.   When I was a legal aid lawyer, I remember seeing firsthand many  deceitful practices at the expense of poor  [[Page H5151]]  people due to the language barrier, due to the immigration status, or  due to the fact that people could not read the papers that they brought  to the notario publicos. That was wrong then, and it is still wrong  today.   As Members of Congress, we have a responsibility to protect the well- being and livelihoods of the most vulnerable among us, including  American families across the country. Certainly, courts have recognized  the widespread prevalence of notario fraud, and the negative impact on  immigrants and their families is clear.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my comadre and good friend,  Congresswoman Debbie Mucarsel-Powell of south Florida, for exemplary  leadership on this issue and for sponsoring this bill. I urge all of my  colleagues to vote in favor of this very important legislation. Let's  put an end to these fraudulent schemes.
