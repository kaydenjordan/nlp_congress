 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules,  I call up House Resolution 803 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 803         Resolved, That during further consideration of the bill       (H.R. 5376) to provide for reconciliation pursuant to title       II of S. Con. Res. 14, pursuant to House Resolution 774, the       further amendment printed in the report of the Committee on       Rules accompanying this resolution shall be considered as       adopted.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Reschenthaler), pending which I yield myself such time as I may  consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is  for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, today, the Rules Committee met and reported a rule,  House Resolution 803. The rule self-executes an additional manager's  amendment to H.R. 5376, the Build Back Better Act.  [[Page H6599]]    Madam Speaker, I don't think I will surprise anyone here when I say  that reconciliation can be a challenging process. The legislation we  pass here must be vetted to comply with the Senate's procedural rules  so that it can be considered there as quickly as possible. This is why  we are here tonight, to ensure the historic Build Back Better bill can  be taken up across the Capitol without delay.   There was some concern that this process might negatively impact the  policies and programs contained in the legislation. But I am proud to  report tonight, Madam Speaker, that this rule makes only very technical  changes.   As the summary states, it makes ``technical changes to narrow U.S.  Code citations and references to comply with Senate procedural  requirements.''   Now, let me put that in plain English, Madam Speaker. The Build Back  Better Act remains virtually unchanged.   That means U.S. workers will see the establishment of the first-ever  national paid family and medical leave guarantee.   People will see the largest expansion of healthcare coverage since  the Affordable Care Act was passed nearly a decade ago.   Nine million Americans will see their premiums reduced through the  expansion of the premium tax credit.   Four million people who are uninsured today will have access to  quality care through the closing of Medicaid's coverage gap.   Those who take prescription drugs will see lower costs since Medicare  is finally--finally--allowed to start negotiating drug prices.   The more than 25 million people who rely on insulin in this country  will see the cost of insulin capped at just $35.   Families will save an average of $8,600 per child every year through  the establishment of universal and free preschool for 3- and 4-year- olds.   Five million students will see their Pell grants get a boost, and  Dreamers will be eligible to receive them.   Roughly 40 million American families will see a tax cut through the  extension of the child tax credit. This was first enacted in the  American Rescue Plan and will help cut child poverty nearly in half.   And, yes, Madam Speaker, future generations will have a more livable  planet through historic investments that we are making here to combat  the climate crisis.   Now, I know this has been a long process at times. The Rules  Committee has spent more than a dozen hours over multiple meetings  considering this bill, and that is in addition to the work of all the  other committees.   But now, Madam Speaker, the numbers have been crunched; the technical  language has been vetted; and we are on the doorstep of passing this  historic bill.   The Build Back Better Act is a transformational bill at a historic  moment, and it is up to all of us to seize this opportunity.   I urge all of my colleagues to support this rule and advance this  transformational legislation so that we can deliver for the American  people.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a November 17 Reuters article  titled ``Rating agencies say Biden's spending plans will not add to  inflationary pressure.''                       [From Reuters, Nov. 16, 2021]  Rating Agencies Say Biden's Spending Plans Will Not Add to Inflationary                                  Pressure                            (By Kanishka Singh)         U.S. President Joe Biden's infrastructure and social       spending legislation will not add to inflationary pressures       in the U.S. economy, economists and analysts in leading       rating agencies told Reuters on Tuesday.        Biden has spent the past few months promoting the merits of       both pieces of legislation--the $1.75 trillion ``Build Back       Better''  [[Page H6600]]       plan and a separate $1 trillion infrastructure plan. read       more        The two pieces of legislation ``should not have any real       material impact on inflation'', William Foster, vice       president and senior credit officer (Sovereign Risk) at       Moody's Investors Service, told Reuters.        The impact of the spending packages on the fiscal deficit       will be rather small because they will be spread over a       relatively long time horizon, Foster added.        Senator Joe Manchin, a centrist Democrat, has previously       raised inflationary concerns in relation to Biden's social       spending plan, with a report earlier this month suggesting he       may delay the passage of the Build Back Better legislation.       read more        ``The bills do not add to inflation pressures, as the       policies help to lift long-term economic growth via stronger       productivity and labor force growth, and thus take the edge       off of inflation,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at       Moody's Analytics, which operates independently from the       parent company's ratings business.        Zandi said the costs of both the infrastructure and social       spending legislation were sustainable.        ``The bills are largely paid for through higher taxes on       multinational corporations and well-to-do households, and       more than paid for if the benefit of the added growth and the       resulting impact on the government's fiscal situation are       considered'', he said in an interview.        Charles Seville, senior director and Americas sovereigns       co-head at Fitch Ratings, said the two pieces of legislation       ``will neither boost nor quell inflation much in the short-      run.''        Government spending will still add less to demand in 2022       than in 2021 and over the longer-run, the social spending       legislation could increase labor supply through provisions       such as childcare, and productivity, Seville told Reuters.        The House of Representatives passed the $1 trillion       infrastructure package earlier this month after the Senate       approved it in August. Biden signed the bill into law on       Monday.        The Build Back Better package includes provisions on       childcare and preschool, eldercare, healthcare, prescription       drug pricing and immigration.        ``The deficit will still narrow in FY 2022 as pandemic       relief spending drops out and the economic recovery boosts       tax revenues'', Seville said. ``But the legislation (Build       Back Better) does not sustainably fund all the initiatives,       particularly if these are extended and don't sunset, meaning       that they will be funded by greater borrowing.''        The Congressional Budget Office anticipates publishing a       complete cost estimate for the Build Back Better plan by       Friday, Nov. 19. Biden said on Tuesday he expected the Build       Back Better legislation to be passed within a week's time.    Madam Speaker, just yesterday, economists and analysts  made clear that the Build Back Better bill would not add to  inflationary pressures. Let me remind those on the other side that  there are provisions in this legislation to bolster our supply chains.   If we want to talk about values, our values are that we want to lower  the cost of prescription drugs for our senior citizens. Our values are  that we think it is outrageous that drug companies charge so much for  insulin, a drug that has been around forever, yet families are being  gouged by these drug companies. There is a provision in this bill that  caps insulin costs at just $35 a month. Those are our values.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Colorado  (Mr. Neguse), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I have to tell you, I think what is on display here  really is the difference between Democrats and Republicans.   I mean, this Build Back Better bill is about our values and about  what we are for, about solving problems. And what we hear from our  Republican friends is hate and vitriol, blaming Joe Biden for  everything. It is a cloudy day out; it is Joe Biden's fault. I mean,  everything. But no solutions, nothing that they are for.   We passed a historic infrastructure bill 2 weeks ago. It is going to  help rebuild our country. The overwhelming majority of my Republican  friends voted against it, and the few that voted for it are now under  attack by the Republican leadership and are being threatened with  losing their committee assignments. I mean, that is their response to  our infrastructure challenges.   When the previous President, Mr. Trump, was in office, we had  infrastructure week, infrastructure month, infrastructure press  release, but no infrastructure money. Thankfully, because of the  leadership of this President, and Members of this Congress who voted  for it, we have an infrastructure bill.   When you talk about policies that they are against, I mean, really,  you are against the extension of the child tax credit, which has  decreased child poverty by almost 30 percent?   Are you against increasing the Pell grants and against investing in  affordable housing?   Are you against dealing with the climate crisis?   Are you against, you know, the universal free pre-K for 3-year-olds  and 4-year-olds?   Are you against expanding the earned income tax credit?   Are you against making historic investments in historically Black  colleges and universities?   I mean, I can go on and on and on. But these are the things we are  for. What you hear from the other side is what they are against.   I think the American people think it is more important for us to tell  them what we are for. And what this bill is about is about being on the  side of those who struggle in this country every day.   And, by the way, there are investments in this bill to deal with our  supply chain issues, which can also help with inflation, but I guess  they are against that, too.   I now yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn  B. Maloney), the distinguished chair of the Committee on Oversight and  Reform.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I don't even know how to respond to all of that. I would just say to  my friends that the American people had what they had to offer. When  they were in the majority, we had 4 years of Donald Trump, and guess  what? They voted for Joe Biden and gave him a victory by millions and  millions and millions and millions of votes. So, I don't think they  want what they were selling.   I just also say to my friends who are trying to lecture us on tax  policy, my Republican friends can't be serious here. You added $2  trillion to the deficit to give tax breaks to millionaires and  billionaires and corporations at the expense of everyone else. It was  shameful. It was shameful what my friends did.   I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Takano), the  distinguished chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Carter).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Jones).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  New Mexico (Ms. Stansbury).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman.    Madam Speaker, let's be clear. My friends are saying  that putting a cap on the cost of insulin is somehow socialism or  undercutting the United States of America.   Give me a break. Talk to parents whose children have diabetes and how  they anguish over the costs and how they worry about how their children  will be able to support the cost of their prescriptions once they  become 26 and are no longer on their parents' healthcare.   So let's get real. This is a debate about values. We are on the side  of capping the cost of insulin so that diabetes patients aren't gouged  like they are now.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms.  Titus).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Scanlon), a distinguished member of the Committee on  Rules.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. Connolly).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, you have to love these Republicans. They get up and  talk about everything but what is in this Build Back Better bill. When  all else fails, they get out and they bash immigrants again, blame  immigrants for everything.   Having a tough time at work? Well, blame an immigrant.   Having a problem with your marriage? Well, blame immigrants.   But the bottom line is, they come to the floor and they tell us what  they are against but they don't tell us what they are for. This bill  includes an extension of the child tax credit, which has already  reduced child poverty in this country by 30 percent. They are against  that? We are for that.   This bill actually caps the cost of insulin to $35 a month. Talk to  your constituents who have to rely on insulin to save the lives of  their children. I mean, really? You are against that? We are for that.   We actually care about our children's future. That is why there is  money in here to deal with the climate crisis; while my friends deny  that there is even a climate crisis to be concerned about.   So give me a break. Give me a break. This is a statement of our  values. This is what we are for. We don't hear what they are for. All  we hear is what they are against.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Soto).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I get it. Republicans are never going to support this  bill. Maybe they don't want to see healthcare coverage expanded, or  maybe they don't want to see insulin costs capped, or maybe they don't  want to see education costs lowered or families given a tax break or  workers given paid family and medical leave.   Maybe they will just never support anything President Biden likes. I  don't know. I have given up trying to get into the heads of Republicans  long ago.   But I do know this. Tonight, we have a chance to advance a historic  bill that would truly change people's lives for the better.   This is why I ran for Congress. This is why so many of my colleagues  on the Democratic side ran for Congress, not to help people just a  little bit, not to solve only a few of the problems that they face, but  to truly take their challenges head-on. This bill does that.   I have a sneaking suspicion that despite all the doom and gloom from  Republicans today, they will be proven just as wrong here as they were  when they objected to the Affordable Care Act nearly a decade ago.   Build Back Better meets this moment. By passing this rule and  advancing this legislation, this Congress will, too.   The text of the material previously referred to by Mr. Reschenthaler  is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 803         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this       resolution, the further amendment printed in section 3 shall       be in order after debate pursuant to the first section of       House Resolution 774 if offered by Representative Jordan of       Ohio or a designee. That amendment shall be considered as       read. All points of order against that amendment are waived.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on that       amendment without intervening motion except 10 minutes of       debate equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an       opponent.        Sec. 3. The further amendment referred to in section 2 is       as follows:        Strike title VI (and redesignate succeeding titles       accordingly).    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.
