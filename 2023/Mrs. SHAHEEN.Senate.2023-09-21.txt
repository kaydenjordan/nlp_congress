 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the  University of New Hampshire Franklin Pierce School of Law on its 50th  anniversary.   Taking its name from the only Granite Stater to become President of  the United States, the Franklin Pierce Law Center was established in  1973 as New Hampshire's first law school. Its founder, renowned  inventor Robert Rines, welcomed the first class of students in an old  bull barn on the city of Concord's east side. The school's modest  beginnings belie the outsized and  [[Page S4653]]  international impact it would soon have on the legal community,  particularly in the field of intellectual property--IP--law.   The Franklin Pierce Law Center quickly developed a reputation as a  powerhouse in IP law. It strove not only to instill an understanding in  intellectual property law, but also to train students to be comfortable  in the practice of an emerging legal field. Many of its graduates have  climbed to positions of global influence in IP, and many attribute  their success and achievements to the preparation and instruction they  acquired as law students. The law center's administration--and Mr.  Rines in particular--also invited groups from other countries to attend  classes at no cost. These groups observed the American system of patent  law and ventured home to shape systems that suited the needs of their  own countries.   In 2010, the Franklin Pierce Law Center entered into a partnership  with the University of New Hampshire to become the University of New  Hampshire School of Law. It was renamed the University of New Hampshire  Franklin Pierce School of Law in 2019 after careful consideration of  the Franklin Pierce name in the intellectual property community and its  longstanding reputation for innovative legal education.   While known for its intellectual property law curriculum, the  University of New Hampshire Franklin Pierce School of Law also offers  instruction in traditional legal fields, as well as public interest and  social justice law, health policy and law and sports and entertainment  law. It is also home to the Daniel Webster Scholars Honors Program, a  groundbreaking initiative that provides an alternative to the  traditional bar licensing process. These students enroll in a rigorous  educational program under the supervision of judges, lawyers,  professors, and bar examiners, and they are sworn into the New  Hampshire bar the day before law school graduation. It is the only  program of its kind in the country.   Thousands of attorneys in 48 States and more than 80 countries can  point to their experience at the University of New Hampshire Franklin  Pierce School of Law as the foundation of their thriving legal  practices and careers. Countless more have been represented, educated,  and protected by attorneys who honed their skills in an active,  practice-based learning environment in Concord, NH. The reach of this  small school with humble beginnings is truly widespread.   I congratulate the University of New Hampshire Franklin Pierce School  of Law on this important milestone and wish the law school community  all the best as it celebrates its past and looks forward to its bright  future.                            ____________________
