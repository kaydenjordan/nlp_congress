 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of  provisions of the Build Back Better Act that will help substantially  our seniors in western New York.   The bill moving through the House recognizes the importance of human  infrastructure, of care infrastructure, and this includes making big  investments in our seniors.   The bill provides Medicare coverage for hearing, dental, and vision  benefits.   It provides a Medicaid funding increase so seniors can live safely at  home.   It recognizes the importance of caregivers by providing a tax cut to  support families who struggle to care for their loved ones.   It addresses critical shortages in our health workforce so seniors,  when they are in a nursing home or hospital, have access to the best  professionals available.   And it will cut prescription costs by using the leverage of the  Federal Government to get a better deal for Medicare beneficiaries.   These are all important investments in our seniors and those who love  them, and they need our support.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the provisions as  Congress moves toward passage.                            ____________________
