 Madam President, I rise today to once again oppose a  waiver to bypass U.S. law and allow a recently retired member of Armed  Forces to serve as our Secretary of Defense. On the merits, I support  the nomination of Lloyd Austin, and I believe that Mr. Austin is highly  qualified for this role. However, the importance of civilian leadership  at the Department of Defense is greater than any individual nominee.   The subordination of military authority to civil authority is a  bedrock principle of our democracy. In 2017, when I voted against a  waiver to allow James Mattis to serve as Secretary of Defense, I  stressed that our Founders' emphasis on civilian leadership  distinguished the young United States from the other nations of the  time. I also noted that in enacting the exception for General Marshall  in 1950, Congress expressly stated that: ``the authority granted by  this Act is not to be construed as approval by the Congress of  continuing appointments of military men to the office of Secretary of  Defense in the future. It is hereby expressed as the sense of the  Congress that after General Marshall leaves the office of secretary of  defense, no additional appointments of military men to that office  shall be approved.''   I still believe that the 7-year waiting period is a valuable  practice--one of many--that preserves our--Nation's long tradition of  placing civilian authority above military authority. In 2017, I said  ``should Congress vote to waive this law at this moment in time, I will  review the nomination [. . .] on its individual merits.'' And I intend  to apply my words then to my actions now and will consider Mr. Austin's  nomination on its merits when it comes to the floor for a vote.
