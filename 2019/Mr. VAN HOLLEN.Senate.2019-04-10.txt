 Mr. President, President Trump has nominated David  Bernhardt to be Secretary of the Interior.   The Department of the Interior has broad management responsibilities  over our public lands and waters, wildlife, and is also responsible for  maintaining the trust responsibilities on behalf of the United States  with Indian Country. They also have over 70,000 Federal employees.   There have been significant questions raised about Mr. Bernhardt's  decisions and priorities in his position as Deputy Secretary and Acting  Secretary that have directly benefitted his former clients, while  harming our public lands and wildlife.   There are a number of troubling issues with Mr. Bernhardt's record on  the critical issues before the Department of the Interior, but there  are two that are of particular concern to me.   First, I am particularly concerned about Mr. Bernhardt's role in the  Solicitor's Opinion, M-37050, on the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, MBTA.  The Solicitor's Opinion, or M-Opinion, on the MBTA was released on  December 22, 2017, without any public or scientific input or  environmental analysis, abruptly removing longstanding protections for  migratory birds. These protections have been implemented in a  bipartisan manner from every administration since the early 1970s. It  is likely that millions of birds have been saved thanks to this law and  the leadership of the Department. The MBTA has significantly reduced  the number of birds killed from oil waste pits and other threats, and  it has provided accountability and recovery funds after oil spills such  as Deepwater Horizon. This change has been opposed by 17 former  Interior officials from every Republican and Democratic administration  since the early 1970s, as well as Flyway Councils representing nearly  every State wildlife agency in the country.   In letters exchanged between me and the Department of the Interior,  they have admitted that due to the M-Opinion on the MBTA, they will no  longer be able to secure fines or penalties for violations of the MBTA  from companies responsible for an oil spill that non-intentionally  kills migratory birds similar to the British Petroleum (BP) Deepwater  Horizon disaster of 2010, which killed an estimated 1,000,000 migratory  birds.   Furthermore, despite the MBTA's strong record in saving birds through  reasonable enforcement, one of Mr. Bernhardt's former clients, the  Independent Petroleum Association of America, IPAA, urged the  Department of the Interior to gut the MBTA and remove protections for  birds and any requirements to take actions to minimize impacts to birds  from their activities.   Just this week, we learned that there have been at least three oil  spills recently that appear to have killed migratory birds, in which  the Department of the Interior admitted in internal emails they can't  respond to due to the MBTA M-Opinion.   So in the case of the MBTA, we see a dramatic change in the  Department of the Interior's legal interpretation of a key wildlife law  that appears to have benefited a former client of Mr. Bernhardt.   The second issue of critical concern to me is offshore drilling. I  hail from a coastal State and a State that is firmly opposed to any oil  and gas drilling off of our coastline. Mr. Bernhardt has overseen the  Bureau of Ocean Energy Management's, BOEM, development of an oil and  gas leasing plan that dramatically expands risky offshore drilling and  that has prompted bipartisan criticism at all levels of government. The  Department of the Interior, under Mr. Bernhardt's leadership, has  simultaneously been working to weaken offshore drilling safety  standards put in place in response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill  and at the recommendation of a bipartisan commission that investigated  the disaster.   I have serious questions about whether Mr. Bernhardt can do his job  without confronting conflicts of interest at every turn, and I fear  that he will put powerful special interests before the public interest.   For these reasons, I opposed David Bernhardt's nomination as  Secretary of the Interior.                            ____________________
