 Mr. Chair, I thank my friend and colleague from Arizona  for yielding and for his leadership on this issue.   I rise today because while House Republicans vilify families that are  coming to the United States for refuge, House Democrats and the Biden  administration are working to address immigration challenges with real  solutions.   As many cities are welcoming asylum seekers and migrant families,  House Democrats are fighting to provide resources to local governments  that are processing migrant arrivals. House Democrats are fighting to  relieve the immigration court backlog and provide stability for those  stuck in the system. House Democrats are fighting to allow people to  work and support their families. House Democrats are fighting to  improve processing at the border.   To be clear, this bill does not provide any solutions for our  communities. This bill does not address the core issues driving  migration. It does not provide resources to local governments that are  handling migrant arrivals. It does nothing. In fact, it does the exact  opposite of being productive by limiting available facilities to house  migrants while they go through a process to which they are legally  entitled. This bill has no purpose other than to score cheap political  points for House Republicans.   When House Republicans are ready to discuss real solutions, we will  be ready to work with them. Right now, I encourage all of my colleagues  to vote ``no'' on H.R. 5283.
