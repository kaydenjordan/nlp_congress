 Mr. President, well, this afternoon we pick up where we  left off last night. The Senate has voted to advance the bipartisan  infrastructure bill and bring debate on the substitute amendment to an  end.   I would repeat that Democrats are ready and willing to vote on  additional amendments to the bill before moving to final passage. Once  again, that will require the cooperation of our Republican colleagues.  I hope they will cooperate so we can move more quickly. Otherwise, we  will proceed by the book and finish the bill.   I said yesterday that we could do this the easy way or the hard way.  Yesterday, it appeared that some Republicans would like the Senate to  do this the hard way. In any case, we will keep proceeding until we get  this bill done.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now, on another related matter, as the  Senate approaches final passage of the bipartisan infrastructure bill,  I want to shine a spotlight on a part of the legislative process that  doesn't see the light often enough: the Office of the Senate  Legislative Counsel.   There is an old political yarn that the legislative process is like  watching sausage get made; you would rather not know.   Well, the Office of Legislative Counsel occupies a particularly  difficult part of the sausage-making: turning Senators' broad outlines  for legislation into specific and precise legislative language. It is a  very hard job. For over a century, this group of hidden experts have  had a hand in crafting every major piece of legislation introduced in  this Chamber.  [[Page S6032]]    A century ago, many scoffed at the notion of having a team of  professionals help the Senate write legislation. It was actually a New  Yorker, I am proud to say, Elihu Root, who originally suggested in 1912  that, maybe, this body could use a little help in constructing well- written laws. It took a few years after he made his plea, but the  complexity of tax legislation to raise revenue during World War I led  to the creation of the original drafting service.   During its first 4 years, the Legislative Drafting Service handled  518 requests. By the 114th Congress, however, they were receiving more  than 65,000. It is an amazing workload, unglamorous but vital and  essential.   Over the past few weeks, as we have worked on the bipartisan  infrastructure bill, the members of the legislative counsel have  sacrificed weekends, family gatherings, and many, many hours of sleep  to allow the Senate to do its work. I have seen it. We have called them  up at 11 p.m. and said: You are needed to get this ready by the  morning. And they don't flinch. They just roll up their sleeves and  work in their professional way.   So we have always asked a lot of the legislative counsel, but they  stepped up and did their job with excellence. There are a lot of  members of the team who deserve recognition, beginning with the team's  laudable and impressive leader on this bill, Deanna Edwards.   I also want to thank Diane Nesmeyer and her team of assistants, who  have all contributed very long hours, and let me mention them. They  each deserve their own acknowledgement: Heather Burnham, Mark Mazzone,  Christina Kennelly, Chris Patterson, Patrick Ryan, Karson Katz, Heather  Lowell, Matt McGhie, John Goetcheus, Ruth Ernst, Mark McGunagle,  Allison Otto, Vince Gaiani, Phil Lynch, John Henderson, James Ollen- Smith, Kim Albrecht-Taylor, Christine Miranda, Rob Silver, Evan Frank,  and Molly Dunlop.   To every single person I mentioned, thank you, thank you, thank you  for your incredible and indispensable work. Your skill and dedication  makes it possible for this Chamber to serve the American public.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, it has been a long day, but we have  plowed through as I have intended, and the  [[Page S6058]]  cloture motion on the final bill has passed by a very handsome,  overwhelming vote.   And now we will continue to move forward on the infrastructure bill.  The substitute amendment, which is the text of the bipartisan bill, has  been agreed to, and cloture has been invoked on the underlying bill.   We will move forward. Amendments are no longer in order, and we will  move forward to wrap this up as expeditiously as possible and then move  on to the budget resolution with reconciliation instructions.   The two-track process is moving along. It has been a process that has  been a very good process. It has taken a while, but it is going to be  worth it, as, hopefully, we will have both bills very, very soon--the  bipartisan infrastructure bill and the budget resolution with  reconciliation instructions                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 12 noon, Monday,  August 9--that is tomorrow, in case you have forgotten the days--that  following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired,  the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two  leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and morning  business be closed; that upon the conclusion of morning business, the  Senate resume consideration of H.R. 3684; finally, that all time during  recess, adjournment, or period of morning business count postcloture-- the clock is ticking--on H.R. 3684.    If there is no further business to come before the  Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned under the  previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 10:21 p.m., adjourned until  Monday, August 9, 2021, at 12 noon.
