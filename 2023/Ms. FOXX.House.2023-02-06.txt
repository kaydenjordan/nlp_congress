 Mr. Speaker, the college-for-all mentality failed our  country's students.   It failed students who paid or borrowed for degrees with no return on  their investment.   It failed workers who lack the skills to succeed in their field.   It failed businessowners who are left with open positions they can't  fill.   And it failed entire industries suffering from a widening skills gap.   That is why I cosponsored the Promoting Employment and Lifelong  Learning (PELL) Act.   The PELL Act will allow students to use Pell grants for high quality,  short-term education programs, creating even more pathways to the  American Dream.   Instead of financing an expensive diploma, students will obtain in- demand skills so they can be successful in the workforce. This is the  right path forward for postsecondary education.                            ____________________
