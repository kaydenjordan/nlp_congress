 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, for the past 2 years, we have made  historic, steady progress to strengthen the American economy. Under  President Biden's leadership, we have successfully navigated one  challenge after another, from the COVID pandemic to Putin's invasion of  Ukraine, to supply chain snarls and persistent inflation.   While America's economy has remained resilient in the face of these  challenges, it is not invincible. We received a reminder of that just a  few days ago when financial regulators took swift action to prevent a  catastrophe.   Over the weekend, Federal regulators seized a major bank that was  teetering on the brink of collapse, First Republic, and sold it to  JPMorgan Chase. These actions not only protected First Republic's  depositors, they could have saved our economy from potential recession.  Why do I say that? Well, First Republic was the third major bank to  fail in 2 months. In fact, it was the second largest bank failure since  2008. So think about what could have happened had regulators failed to  contain the damage from First Republic's collapse. Today, we would be  reading headlines about panicking investors, panicking depositors, and  turmoil throughout the financial system. Thankfully, we avoided that  outcome. It is because the Government had the good sense to step in and  maintain confidence in the banking system.   Now, Federal regulators stepped in to protect our economy when the  crisis at hand was a bank with $229 billion in assets, but that $229  billion bank asset pales in comparison to a much larger undertaking we  are facing in Washington today--the future of America's $23 trillion  economy.   Right now, in the U.S. House of Representatives, Speaker McCarthy is  threatening our economy with the first-ever Federal debt default, the  first time ever in our history. Let's put Speaker McCarthy's dangerous  gamble in context.   Just days ago, some of the smartest financial minds in the world were  convinced that a $229 billion bank could be the difference between  financial stability and financial calamity. Well, that $229 billion is  a tiny fraction of the $23 trillion economy that Speaker McCarthy is  gambling with.   We are only weeks away from the deadline of June 1. That is when  Secretary Yellen says America could default on our Federal debt. So  every day the House Republicans refuse to perform the most basic  responsibility of government--paying our bills--they are spreading  uncertainty throughout the global economy. That uncertainty is  dangerous and costly.    Over the past few years, our Nation has emerged from the depths of a  once-in-a-century pandemic; we have navigated one market disruption  after another; and, today, we are finally moving in the right  direction. But now, Speaker McCarthy, in the House, wants to throw all  of that historic progress away. Why? To please the most radical members  of his party. The debt ceiling proposal House Republicans passed last  week is not a budget;  [[Page S1524]]  it is a MAGA manifesto. It is a ransom note to the American people:  Either suffer the disastrous consequences of debt default or face  devastating cuts in services and programs that millions of Americans  rely on every day.   I just left a hearing in the Appropriations Subcommittee on Health  and Human Services. Appearing before that committee was the National  Institutes of Health. This is the premier medical research Agency in  the world. Of the 500-plus new prescription drugs, they are responsible  for almost all of them in basic research. Just this week, we had a  dramatic announcement in Chicago by Northwestern University in its  doing medical research. And I am going to try to say this properly as a  liberal arts-trained lawyer when I get into medicine and science. But  they have finally found a way to successfully breach the blood-brain  barrier. What does it mean? We had two of our most famous Senators in  modern times--Ted Kennedy and John McCain--both pass away because of  glioblastoma--brain cancer. The Presiding Officer understands that  personally more than any other Member of this body. We watched as they  went through surgery, which was the only technique that could be used  on this brain cancer, in an attempt to remove the tumor and all of the  cancer cells. Well, naturally and unfortunately, that process is not as  good as it should be. Tumor brain cells remained and, ultimately, took  their lives.   Well, now these doctors at Northwestern have found a way to breach  this blood-brain barrier so that they can apply chemotherapy drugs to  the brain directly. It is a dramatic development that could have  applications as well when it comes to Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. That  was discovered this week because of an NIH grant, a National Institutes  of Health grant--millions of dollars to these researchers that could  transform the way we treat brain cancer in America as well as  Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.   So what does Speaker McCarthy want to do with the budget of this  Agency, the National Institutes of Health? He wants to cut it by 20 to  25 percent. That is an outrage to think that we would forestall the  research that could save lives and alleviate suffering across America  and the fact that our leadership and the world of medical research  would be jeopardized because of gamesmanship by Speaker McCarthy on the  issue of the debt ceiling.   His proposal for a budget--if you want to call it that--is a MAGA  manifesto. They don't care. They are determined to preserve the Trump  tax cuts at any expense. When you look at cutting 20 to 25 percent from  medical research, it is true that they will go to the extreme.   What would debt default look like?   Well, it would wipe out also trillions of dollars in savings of  families across America, and the 401(k)s would take a beating. It would  kill millions of jobs and force businesses to grind to a halt, and it  would send our economy into a recession.   Does Speaker McCarthy believe that any of us were sent to Washington  to achieve that goal?   Defaulting would send interest rates soaring, making costly credit  cards and mortgages even more expensive. It is a nonstarter, but so is  accepting any of the destructive cuts that I have described.   Their MAGA manifesto would cause needless suffering all across  America. It would hurt virtually everybody in this Nation except the  top 1 percent, which would have their Trump tax cuts preserved.   To start, this Republican bill would decimate funding for America's  veterans--eliminating 80,000 jobs in the Veterans Health  Administration--and threaten housing and food security for them as  well.   This proposal would also wipe out 30,000 law enforcement and Border  Patrol jobs.   Next week, we have got a watershed event occurring on the border. I  am sure the Presiding Officer is aware of it as he represents the State  of New Mexico.   The question is, What is going to happen when we eliminate title 42?  Are we going to have an onslaught of thousands of people seeking asylum  in this country, and are we ready for them?   I have heard many Members of the Senate from the other side of the  aisle suggest they are unhappy with the situation. I am, too, but we  need to respond to it in an orderly, direct fashion. Defunding Border  Patrol agents is a ridiculous outcome, and to think that Speaker  McCarthy would defund Border Patrol agents in this country at this  moment in history is just nonsensical.   I would just say that, when it comes to the defunding of the police  and Border Patrol agents, it is a bad idea even if it comes from the  Republican Speaker.   If this proposal became law, I might add--the proposal by Speaker  McCarthy for his budget--we would also cut 1 million senior citizens'  Meals on Wheels. What does this program do? For many of our elderly  citizens, particularly those who are in a compromised medical state,  this is the only social contact they have each day--perhaps with the  mailman as well. That is it. To eliminate this Meals on Wheels in order  to preserve the tax cuts from the Trump administration is just unfair.   Let me tell you what the cuts would mean in my State of Illinois.   The Republican proposal would force 13,000 children in our State to  lose childcare and preschool. It would strip food assistance from  55,000 women, infants, and children. Does that make any sense at all?  It would threaten the medical care for more than 186,000 veterans in  Illinois, and 50,000 seniors would lose their Meals on Wheels in my  State.   Yesterday, my office heard from the Greater Chicago Food Depository-- a food bank that is one of the best. It provides meals to seniors and  families. Here is what one of their staff members said:         These proposed cuts are coming at a time when the need       we're seeing in the community is as high as it was during the       beginning days of COVID. Families are really struggling.    These are the families who Speaker McCarthy would abandon with his  MAGA manifesto. And for what purpose is he doing this? I will tell  you--to keep tax cuts for the wealthiest people and the most profitable  corporations in place--another windfall for the well-off.   We can and should debate our spending practices for the year to come,  but this is not it. This is not the place to do it, and this is not the  time to do it with the debt ceiling looming. Right now, we have one  responsibility--to maintain the reputation of the United States of  America in upholding the full faith and credit of standing behind our  debts and making our payments. That is our constitutional duty. The  path forward is clear. We need a clean bill for the debt ceiling, and  then we can debate the issue of the budget and appropriations.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm  Judge LaShonda Hunt to the U.S. District Court for the Northern  District of Illinois.   Born in Mississippi and raised on the South Side of Chicago, Judge  Hunt received her bachelor's degree from the University of Illinois at  Urbana-Champaign and her J.D. from the University of Michigan Law  School.   After working as a staff attorney for the U.S. Court of Appeals for  the Seventh Circuit, Judge Hunt clerked for Judge William J. Hibbler on  the Northern District of Illinois. Immediately following her clerkship,  Judge Hunt worked for 2 years as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the U.S.  Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois. In 2010, she  returned to this role and served for another 5 years. As a Federal  prosecutor, she handled cases involving employment discrimination,  civil rights violations, healthcare fraud, and more. After leaving the  U.S. Attorney's Office, Judge Hunt worked for the State of Illinois in  the Department of Corrections and the Department of Central Management  Services. In 2017, the Seventh Circuit appointed Judge Hunt to serve as  a U.S. Bankruptcy Judge for the Northern District of Illinois. She has  presided over approximately 22,000 bankruptcy cases and adversary  proceedings, about 75 of which have gone to verdict or judgement.   The American Bar Association rated Judge Hunt ``well qualified,'' and  she received a strong bipartisan vote in committee. Given her extensive  experience, dedication to public service and deep knowledge of the  Northern District of Illinois, Senator Duckworth and I strongly support  Judge Hunt. I am honored to vote for her confirmation, and I urge my  colleagues join me.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein) is necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein) is necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein) and the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) are necessarily  absent.    Mr. President, yesterday the Senate confirmed Judge  Wesley Hsu to the U.S. District Court for the Central District of  California.   Born in St. Louis, MO, Judge Hsu received both his bachelor's degree  and J.D. from Yale University.   Judge Hsu began his career in private practice as an associate and  contract attorney at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, LLP, where he worked on a  range of intellectual property matters.   After working in private practice, he served as an Assistant U.S.  Attorney for the same district to which he is now nominated. In this  role, he gained significant litigation experience in both criminal and  civil proceedings.   During his time at the Department of Justice, Judge Hsu successfully  prosecuted a defendant who trafficked computer networking equipment,  which the Department named as one of its most significant intellectual  property operations to date.   In 2017, Judge Hsu was appointed as a Superior Court Judge for the  Los Angeles County Superior Court. Since his appointment, he has  presided over more than 200 criminal and civil cases that have gone to  verdict or judgment.   The American Bar Association rated Judge Hsu unanimously ``well  qualified,'' and he has the strong support of Senators Feinstein and  Padilla.   Judge Hsu's deep ties to the California legal community, combined  with his significant courtroom experience, will make him an excellent  addition to the Federal bench.   I thank my colleagues for confirming his nomination.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
