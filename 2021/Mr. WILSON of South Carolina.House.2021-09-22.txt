 Mr. Speaker, American neighborhoods are  under terrorist threat due to the Biden catastrophic blunder of the  Afghan surrender with on open southern border. This is not his only  failure as inflation undermines American families.   Under Biden, borrowing and spending has already caused inflation to  surge to the fastest pace in 13 years, according to the Labor  Department. Sadly, we have price increases: Gasoline, 42.7 percent;  bacon, 17 percent; chicken, 7.2 percent; fish and seafood, 10.6  percent; eggs, 9.9 percent.   Whatever the increase in wages, inflation has wiped out gains.  Americans keep less under Biden. Now, Biden proposes $3.5 trillion in  more borrowing, taxing, and spending, which will destroy private sector  jobs, add to the debt of younger citizens, and weaken retirement  accounts.   In conclusion, God bless our troops who successfully protected  America for 20 years, as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from abroad to our neighborhoods.  [[Page H4878]]                                ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition.    Madam Speaker, as I begin, I was  grateful to support the prior amendment that we just had by President  Gerry Connolly and also Congressman Steve Chabot, but I oppose this  particular amendment.   U.S. troops are in Syria to fight ISIS. They were sent by President  Barack Obama pursuant to the 2001 counterterrorism AUMF. The global war  on terrorism is not over. It is moving, as we have sadly seen, the  terrorist attack last week in New Zealand and as we see the terrorists  who are coming across the southern border into the United States.    For years we have worked with our partners on the ground to eliminate  the caliphate. We must not leave them behind as they have been brave  patriots and could be subject to murderous terrorists.   This mission has been incredibly successful. However, the job is not  done. The threat of ISIS against American families and our allies  remains. The nations that have faced the most cross-border attacks are  India with 60,000 deaths; Israel with--just this year, in the past  couple of months--12,000 Iranian rockets by an attack by Hamas from  Gaza; and, of course, in America 3,000 persons murdered on 9/11.   Our continued presence on the ground is necessary to ensure the  enduring defeat of ISIS and protecting American families by defeating  terrorists overseas.   This shortsighted amendment would prematurely cut short our presence  in Syria. Our small force in Syria is incredibly effective and part of  the global coalition to defeat ISIS. This is not the time for America  to abandon our allies and partners in Syria in the global war on  terrorism. None of us want our soldiers overseas longer than absolutely  necessary, but forcing a withdrawal too soon only ensures we will have  to return as we saw in Iraq when the troops were withdrawn too soon,  and U.S. troops had to go in just a few years later to fight ISIS.                                time  1530    In my opinion, we are seeing this play out again, sadly, in  Afghanistan as the country is a safe haven for Islamic extremists to  provide for suicide bomber attacks on families in India, Israel, and  America.   We must avoid a similar situation in Syria. Withdrawals should be  based on the defeat of ISIS, not an artificial timeline. We know the  success of peace through strength, and we also know of failure by war  through appeasement.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment,  although I would like to point out that I agree very much with my  colleague from New York of the appreciation of our Kurdish allies.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the  yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to  the amendment.    Madam Speaker, we are all concerned  about the ongoing war in Yemen, including civilian casualties in the  conflict with the Houthis murderously using civilians as human shields.   The Iran-backed Houthis continue to launch indiscriminate attacks  against the Saudi homeland, threatening Saudi civilians and more than  70,000 American citizens residing in Saudi Arabia.   These murderous attacks target civilians and civilian infrastructure,  like the Abha International Airport, causing death, injury, and damage  to property. This is an intentional targeting of civilians and is in no  way a military target.   The terrorist-supporting regime of Iran is using the Houthis as  proxies in the ongoing global war on terrorism.   We cannot forget the pain and suffering that the Houthis themselves  have inflicted on the Yemeni citizens with the Houthi brutal  subjugation and occupation.   One-sided initiatives that restrict U.S. support for Saudi Arabia, in  word or deed, only telegraph more vulnerability that will lead to  further attacks by the Houthis. We know the success of peace through  strength and the failure of war through appeasement.   It is encouraging that, in recent weeks, the Biden administration's  messaging has focused strongly on the Houthis' intransigence in ending  the conflict in Yemen, calling on the Houthis to agree to a  comprehensive cease-fire immediately.   We must stop terrorists overseas to protect our allies who are  targeted by the terrorists. India has lost over 60,000 persons due to  cross-border terrorism; Israel, this year, has had to face nearly  12,000 rockets provided by Iran to the Hamas terrorists in Gaza; and,  sadly, we noted the 20th anniversary of 3,000 Americans killed on  September 11, 2001.   We should be using our longstanding relationship with the Saudis to  press them to take every possible precaution to prevent civilian  casualties. For nearly a century, there has been a warm cultural,  educational, military, and economic partnership with the people of  Saudi Arabia.   But this amendment is too far detached from the sad realities of the  Houthi attacks across the border and in Yemen. The drones and rockets  have been provided by the terrorist-sponsoring regime of Iran, which  oppresses its citizens and defames the extraordinary heritage of  Persia.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I would like to  reiterate and join, actually, with my colleagues to point out that it  has been encouraging in recent weeks that the Biden administration has  changed its messaging to strongly focus on the Houthis' intransigence  in ending the conflict in Yemen and calling for the Houthis to agree to  a comprehensive cease-fire immediately, as we also recognize, again,  that we have had a 100-year relationship with the people of Saudi  Arabia that has been so mutually beneficial for the people of Saudi  Arabia, the United States, and our allies.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.    Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to  the amendment.    Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition,  with the great appreciation of our chairman,  Greg Meeks--great  appreciation, even if I disagree.   We are all concerned about the ongoing war in Yemen, including the  civilian casualties in the conflict due to the Houthis using human  shields.   However, sadly, many are focused disproportionately on Saudi Arabia  while the Iran-backed Houthis continue to terrorize the people of Yemen  and launch intentional, indiscriminate attacks against the Saudi  homeland of innocent civilians, where 70,000 Americans live and work.   We need to be aware of how the rhetoric in America regarding Saudi  Arabia and the Yemen war empowers the Houthis to engage in further  aggression with the murderous, intentional attacks on Saudi citizens,  using drones and rockets provided by the terrorist-sponsoring regime in  Iran, which oppresses its citizens and defames the extraordinary  heritage of Persia. Iran perpetuates the ongoing global war on  terrorism.   It is encouraging that, in recent weeks, the Biden administration's  messaging has strongly focused on the Houthis' intransigence in ending  the conflict in Yemen, calling on the Houthis to agree to a  comprehensive cease-fire immediately.   Additionally, the President already announced his plan to end U.S.  support for offensive operations in Yemen, including relevant arms  sales.   We should wait and see the results of this new policy before adding  further legislative restrictions. We should be using our longstanding  relationship with the Saudis to press them to take every precaution  against civilian casualties. For nearly a century, there has been a  warm cultural, educational, military, and economic partnership with the  wonderful people of Saudi Arabia.   While the amendment contains specified exceptions, it does not  address the core challenge of trying to rehabilitate the U.S.-Saudi  partnership while trying to improve Saudi actions with respect to  civilian protections as Houthis murderously use human shields.   I do not think this amendment helps protect our national security  interests in the Middle East, nor will it measurably change Saudi  actions. We should be standing for the success of peace through  strength and not the failure of war through appeasement.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I will disagree with  Chairman Ted Deutch. Usually, we agree.   Additionally, I disagree with Chairman  Greg Meeks, but I do  appreciate the chairman's recognition of the Iranian and Houthi drone  attacks on civilian communities where large numbers of Americans live.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the  yeas and nays.
