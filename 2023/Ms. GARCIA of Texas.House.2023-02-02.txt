 Mr. Speaker, once again, House Republicans are  prioritizing extreme political stunts over problem-solving for the  American people.   Speaker McCarthy's purely partisan move to strip Representative Omar  from her committee is not only a political stunt but a blow to the  integrity of our democratic institutions and solves no problem.   In modern American history, the punishment of stripping Members of  Congress of their committee assignments has been reserved only for the  most egregious wrongdoing, including threats to colleagues.  Congresswoman Omar has neither threatened a colleague, nor has she  committed any egregious wrongdoing.   If Republicans want to degrade the integrity of the House and its  committees, it will be up to Democrats to stand up against these  efforts. We will always stand for integrity in our House.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose the efforts today by the extreme MAGA  Republicans in this political stunt that solves no problems.                            ____________________
