 Mr. Speaker, it is the great State of Texas. I want to  set the Record straight on that.   I commend Chairman Upton and Ranking Member Rush for bringing this  bipartisan bill the floor. All we hear is about how we don't get along,  Mr. Speaker. Nobody is watching when we do get along. And all of the  bills that are being debated and voted on on the House floor today are  examples of bipartisanship at the Energy and Commerce Committee, and  Mr. Upton, Mr. Rush, Mr. Pallone, Mr. Walden, and the other ranking  members and subcommittee chairmen are to be commended for that.    One of the bipartisan amendments, which was adopted in full committee  on this bill, is a bipartisan amendment from Mr. McNerney, a Democrat  from California, and myself, that deals with the cybersecurity and  would suggest that, as these States provide these energy security plans  to the Department of Energy, they include an assessment of  cybersecurity.   So I can't tell you that this is the most important amendment that  has ever been added to a bill in our committee, but it is a very good  amendment, a very positive amendment. As plans are developed, including  an assessment of cybersecurity threats and solutions to those threats,  it should make the grid better, more reliable, and help make our  country safer.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support H.R. 3050. Again, I commend Mr. Upton  and Mr. Rush for working together, and I hope the House very quickly  passes this and sends it to the other body.
