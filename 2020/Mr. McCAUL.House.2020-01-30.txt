 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this dangerous amendment.  I would like to refresh the memory of my colleagues on the other side  of the aisle.   The Iranian regime orchestrated over a dozen attacks against  Americans in Iraq over the last 3 months, killing a U.S. citizen and  wounding four U.S. servicemembers. They also hit the Embassy of the  United States, ordering a  [[Page H719]]  fiery attack on the U.S. Embassy and launched a ballistic missile  attack on the United States Forces.    Honestly, Mr. Speaker, I don't know what more the President needs in  terms of authorization to respond in self-defense given these events.  The President has made it abundantly clear that he is not starting a  war with Iran. He has repeatedly shown restraint after Iran's  provocations and deescalated when others would not.   When forced by Iran's dangerous escalations, the President has  targeted limited military action to defend Americans overseas, using  his Article II constitutional authority. This included the strike in  Baghdad against Soleimani, Iran's mastermind of terror, who was  responsible for killing more than 600 Americans and wounding thousands  more. He has blood on his hands.   But my colleagues cannot accept the fact that the President acted  time and again with restraint in these matters. They are so blinded by  their contempt for this President that they are seeking to tie his  hands. They would rather risk putting Americans in the Middle East in  harm's way by an Iranian regime with a 40-year history of deadly  aggression against us.   This amendment takes legitimate options off the table for the  executive branch. In doing so, it shows America divided in the face of  mounting Iranian threats, making our Nation less safe. Make no mistake,  Iran and others are watching as the Democrats needlessly divide us.   We all agree that, under Article I of the Constitution, only Congress  possesses the authority to declare war, but this amendment goes much  further than prohibiting an unauthorized war. This amendment uses  Congress' power of the purse to preclude any use of force whatsoever  against Iran unless it is previously authorized by Congress or provoked  by an attack on the territory or the Armed Forces of the United States.   Think about what that means. What can our military do if Iran attacks  American civilians or diplomats or commercial shipping overseas? Under  this reckless amendment, the answer is absolutely nothing. The United  States military cannot fire a single shot until after the successful  completion of a bicameral legislative process that enacts law  authorizing the use of force. How many Americans would be dead by then?   We need Iran and its terrorist proxies to think twice about attacking  Americans, our friends, and our own interests, not enabling them like  this amendment does.   Further, this is an unprecedented attempt to limit the powers claimed  by every Commander in Chief, both Democrat and Republican, since the  War Powers Resolution was enacted over President Nixon's veto in 1973.   This misguided amendment is actually far more restrictive than the  War Powers Resolution itself, which recognizes the use of our Armed  Forces for up to 60 days without legislative authorization in  situations of war.   This is absolutely not the time to play politics with our national  security. Iran's aggression is not going to go away anytime soon.   I would like to quote from a July 8 letter from the Department of  Defense when this same proposal was considered as an amendment to the  Defense Authorization bill. ``The Department strongly opposes this  amendment. . . . If U.S. citizens, diplomatic facilities in the region,  or other important national interests are threatened or attacked, we  must be able to respond promptly and in an appropriate fashion.''   That letter was sent 5 months before the attack on the U.S. Embassy  in Baghdad. The concerns expressed in the letter are even more urgent  today, given the many attacks on Americans in Iraq in recent days.   Bottom line, this measure emboldens our adversary by tying the  President's hands on Iran.   Mr. Speaker, therefore, I oppose this legislation, which I believe is  politics at its worst. It is dangerous. It ties our Commander in  Chief's hands. It emboldens our enemy, the largest state sponsor of  terror, the Islamic Republic of Iran. And I urge my colleagues to do  the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Thornberry), the lead Republican on the House Armed Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McClintock).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Riggleman), a veteran of the United States Air Force, who  served in Operation Allied Force, Operation Enduring Freedom, and  multiple counterterrorism activities over the past two decades.   We thank him for his service.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Wyoming (Ms. Cheney), the distinguished chair of the Republican  Conference.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Kansas (Mr. Watkins), a veteran of the United States Army with 8 years  of combat service in the Middle East.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Waltz), a U.S. Army veteran and decorated Special Forces  officer with 23 years of service, including combat tours in Afghanistan  and the Middle East.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, we have no more speakers, and I continue  to reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Madam Speaker, as I have said repeatedly, I am strongly in favor of  exercising our solemn Article I authority for matters of war and peace;  but we are not at war with Iran, we are not engaged in hostilities, and  the President is not trying to start a war with Iran.   I have been in the White House, and I have heard him say this  personally. In fact, he has shown incredible restraint against Iran  after they shot  [[Page H726]]  down our drone, after they hit 50 percent of the Saudi oil fields,  after they killed an American, and after they wounded four soldiers.   My Democratic colleagues know very well there are many situations  short of war which require military action. In fact, they supported  President Obama's thousands of unauthorized strikes in Libya which were  not even related to the protection of Americans overseas.   I believe it is hypocritical and dangerous for the majority to tie  this President's hands in responding to the very real and growing  threats that Iran and its proxies pose to Americans in the Middle East.  As I said, they killed an American contractor and they launched a  massive attack against our Embassy in Baghdad.   For those Members who think it was a minor brush against the Embassy,  look at these photos. Look at the damage that was done to our United  States Embassy. It is absolutely disgraceful.   Soleimani had an imminent plot when he went to Damascus, Lebanon, and  Baghdad to meet with his number two guy to go to the Ayatollah to get  the green light to get out further operations to kill diplomats and  American soldiers. The idea that that strike on Soleimani was not  justified, I don't know what more evidence was required than this.   Then, after this, they launched antiballistic missiles against United  States military bases. They launched dozens of ballistic missiles at  U.S. Forces, causing, as the Speaker said, traumatic brain injury in at  least 50 U.S. servicemen.   Again, what more do we need?   It is unconscionable at this point in time, with this happening at  this time in history, to limit the President's ability to respond as  needed to protect American lives from this vicious regime. This time I  think the Democrats have gone too far.   Like President Reagan said, I believe in peace through strength, and  it is my sincere hope that we will not need to launch another strike  like the President did against Qasem Soleimani, but it did make the  world a safer place.   Unfortunately, the enemy also gets a vote. If Iran doubts our resolve  to respond forcefully, then it will surely affect their calculus moving  forward about whether to attack America again.   In opposing this amendment, I am standing with the Iranian people. It  is important that they hear this. I know they are hearing this because  I have so many Iranian friends who tell me that what we say here in  this Chamber means something. The people of Iran are listening, and  when they see a divided Congress, that sends the worst message at the  absolute worst time.   I want to let the American citizens there in the Middle East know  that they deserve to be covered by the umbrella of our great men and  women in uniform. They deserve the protection of our government. If  their lives are threatened, I do not view them as a hypothetical. They  are real people representing our country abroad, and I will not let  them be vulnerable.   So, Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment for  the second time this Congress because it divides the Nation and sends a  wrong message at the wrong time to the people of Iran.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I strongly oppose repealing the Authorization for Use  of Military Force to ``defend the national security of the United  States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq.''   We should not be repealing current counterterrorism authorities  unless and until we have replaced them with an updated AUMF that  clearly allows us to confront the enemies that continue to threaten our  Nation, our people, and our allies.   As I have stated before, I would prefer a new, updated AUMF. But in  the 13 months our Democratic colleagues have been in charge, we have  seen no such proposal from the majority. In fact, they haven't even  started that conversation.   None of us want to see the extension of any conflict beyond what is  necessary, but we also have learned that premature disengagement can  have huge costs, such as when the Obama administration's rush to  withdraw U.S. troops out of Iraq contributed to the deadly rise of ISIS  in Iraq and Syria and the formation of the caliphate.   The 2002 Iraq AUMF was not only used against Saddam Hussein; it also  identified al-Qaida and ``other international terrorist organizations,  including organizations that threaten the lives and safety of United  States citizens.''   So those on the other side who say this only applies to Saddam  Hussein, that is absolutely incorrect. It applies to international  terrorist organizations like al-Qaida.   Members will recall that al-Qaida in Iraq later became ISIS, a brutal  transnational terrorist organization that continues to threaten  American lives and interests in our homeland. And for that reason,  President Obama used the 2002 AUMF as legal authority for his military  operations against ISIS in Iraq.   The current administration opposes repealing the 2002 AUMF because it  ``remains an important source of additional authority for military  operations against ISIS in Iraq and to defend the national security of  the United States against threats emanating from Iraq.''   As my colleagues know, these vital counter-ISIS operations continue.  Repealing that authorization without a replacement endangers not only  the United States' national security, but our coalition partners, most  notably, Iraq.   The 2002 AUMF was most recently invoked for our January 2 strike on  Qasem Soleimani, Iran's mastermind of terror, who killed more than 600  Americans, wounded thousands more, and orchestrated the fiery New  Year's attack on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. It was a targeted,  defensive strike in Iraq against a designated terrorist by the Obama  administration who threatened U.S. Forces inside Iraq.   In the 2 months beforehand, Soleimani and his proxies launched a  dozen attacks against U.S. personnel in Iraq, killing one American and  wounding four U.S. servicemen near Kirkuk on December 27. And then,  furthermore, as we saw in the photographs  [[Page H728]]  from the previous argument, the Embassy was attacked in a very strong  way.   I don't know what more evidence the President needed to respond under  Article II in self-defense than this, Madam Speaker. And if he did not  do so, he would be derelict in his responsibility.   And if he didn't stop the plot that we know Soleimani was getting  ready to move forward after he went to Damascus and Lebanon and Baghdad  to go to the Ayatollah to get the green light to kill more Americans  and diplomats, then what would the American people say?   What if we had a storm on the Embassy like in 1979, then what?   I think the President was restrained. I think he did the right thing  at the right time. It was an appropriate use of this AUMF, which states  that Iraq ``poses a continuing threat to the national security of the  United States . . . by, among other things . . . harboring terrorist  organizations.''   Contrary to some of the rhetoric we heard 3 weeks ago, the  administration does not claim that the 2002 AUMF gives them a blank  check--as we have heard quite a bit on the other side--to attack Iran.   To the contrary--this is very important--the administration, and the  President has told me personally, they have stated publicly that it has  never interpreted the 2002 Iraq AUMF to provide authority for strikes  inside of Iran or for war with Iran. Soleimani was in Baghdad,  designated by Obama as a terrorist.   The President is also not seeking war with Iran. He has said this  time and time again, and he gets misquoted on this time and time again.   The President has shown great restraint time and again after Iran's  increasing provocations. I was actually quite surprised, after our U.S.  military drones were struck down, there wasn't a response. And as he  told the Nation and the world, he wants a deal that allows Iran to  thrive and prosper.   Repealing this AUMF does not retroactively remove the President's  ability to order his justified and limited strike on Soleimani. A  repeal standing alone will only send the wrong message to our troops,  our partners, our enemies, and our terrorist adversaries in Iraq.   To be sure, the 2002 AUMF should be replaced with new authorities-- after all, it is almost 20 years old--that reflect current  circumstances and provide our men and women in uniform with clear  support for their critical missions that protect us. And it also gives  the American people a voice in that.   I deeply regret that my colleagues are not serious enough about  exercising our Article I authority to put forward a real, updated  alternative to counter the persistent terrorist threats that we see in  Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere.   Therefore, I see today's effort as nothing more than a political  message that does nothing to that end. It ties the hands of the  President at a time when he is responsibly facing down a very dangerous  Iranian regime, the Islamic Republic of Iran, the largest state sponsor  of terrorism, that lives by the motto, ``Death to America.''    These critical constitutional issues of war and peace deserve better  than that. I think if we are serious, we will work on both sides of the  aisle. I know my Conference has great interest in working on a  modernized 2002 AUMF, and I hope the other side can join us in that  effort in the following year.   But, with respect to this, with no replacement, it would be very  dangerous. It would tie our hands' ability to attack ISIS in Iraq. I  think it is ill-advised, and, for that reason, I oppose it.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry), whose four decades of uniformed service to  our Nation included 40 combat missions in Iraq before his retirement  last year as a general in the United States Army.                                time  1100     Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Nebraska (Mr. Bacon), who was deployed to the Middle East four times  during his 30-year career with the United States Air Force before his  retirement as a brigadier general.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Gohmert).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McCarthy), the Republican leader.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Mississippi (Mr. Palazzo), a Marine combat veteran of the Gulf war and  a current member of the Mississippi National Guard.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), the Republican whip.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Reed).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I think back to my dad's war. Churchill warned Neville  Chamberlain about the dark clouds of the Nazi regime on the horizon. He  talked about how weakness invites aggression, and then we saw Hitler  take the world stage.   Reagan talked about peace through strength. These are the ideals I  believe  [[Page H736]]  in, and these bills do not project that. They project weakness;  weakness with ISIS; weakness with Iran; and weakness with our enemies.   I would like to close by stating the obvious, and I think we all can  agree here to some extent, that the 2002 AUMF is outdated. It is almost  20 years old. I believe it is time to replace it with a new authority  that is tailored to the specific threats that we face today.   But one thing that has been mischaracterized is that this only  applied to Saddam Hussein, when, in fact, the AUMF says: ``Iraq poses a  continuing threat to the national security of the United States.'' And  Iraq does, among other things, ``harbor other international terrorist  organizations, including organizations that threaten the lives and  safety of American citizens.''   That, my friend, is ISIS. It is not just Saddam Hussein. It is ISIS.  And we have seen ISIS too much. We owe an updated AUMF to our soldiers,  I think, who are in Iraq risking their lives for our security. We owe a  debt to our partners and to the American people. But the problem, Madam  Speaker, and the reason I oppose this amendment, is because passing it,  does not make any progress toward that goal.   A standalone repeal does not recognize the reality on the ground that  our counterterrorism mission in Iraq is ongoing as we debate here on  the floor right now, today.   The inspector general for the counter-ISIS mission just reported last  quarter that: ``In Iraq . . . ISIS continued this quarter to solidify  and expand its command and control structures.'' On the other hand,  they said: ``. . . it had not increased its capabilities in areas where  the coalition was actively conducting operations against ISIS.''   Madam Speaker, repealing the AUMF without a replacement shows our  soldiers, our partners, our adversaries, that we are undermining our  important mission there to protect the homeland; that we are not  committed to completing the mission; and that we are not committed to a  free and democratic Iraq.   The last time the United States abandoned Iraq under President Obama,  ISIS reared its ugly head and formed the caliphate.   Just a few short years later, they declared it a caliphate and killed  and savaged thousands of people. We all saw the videos. It surged all  across the world. At that time, I was chairman of the Homeland Security  Committee, and in 2016, the threat briefings were absolutely  terrifying; one external operation after another to kill Americans in  the United States out of Iraq and Syria.   None of us want to see the next ISIS rise. None of us in this Chamber  should allow that to ever happen again. So let's have a serious  conversation about what an Authorization for Use of Military Force to  defeat today's threats would look like instead of playing partisan  politics.                                time  1215    What else are the Democrats' partisan maneuvers costing us today?  They are exploiting the Greatest Generation, our World War II merchant  mariners whose brothers died at the hands of the Nazis on the high  seas.   World War II veterans are dying every day, yet this majority is  hijacking a bipartisan bill to honor their bravery in World War II as  the vehicle for these two political measures.   Rather than sending the President a Senate-passed version of this  bill to grant this long-overdue recognition, they are setting that  effort back to square one where it will require passage again by the  Senate that is tied up with impeachment.   Let me just say this: As the son of a World War II veteran, I am  saddened and ashamed that the majority would allow playing procedural  games that set back this bipartisan bill that was on its way to the  President's desk. They are forcing these elderly merchant mariners,  World War II veterans, to wait even longer for the thanks of a grateful  nation.   In closing, we owe it to our constituents to take action to replace  this 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force, but this, Madam  Speaker, does nothing to meet that goal.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this empty and reckless  gesture and vote ``no'' on the amendment, and I yield back the balance  of my time.
