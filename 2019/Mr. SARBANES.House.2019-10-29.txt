 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Today the House of Representatives will affirm, finally, that we  recognize the horrors of the Armenian genocide and are committed to  remembering the victims of this crime against humanity.   Our moral standing in the world requires us to acknowledge the truth  of the Armenian genocide. For too long, we have acquiesced in Turkey's  policy of genocide denial, unwilling to risk the ire of our so-called  ally.   However, Turkey's actions against the Kurds in Syria have reinforced  what many of us have long known: Erdogan's Turkey does not stand for  human rights or religious freedom, but instead spreads authoritarianism  wherever it goes. Erdogan's disdain for democracy and contempt for an  ally was on display 2 years ago when his bodyguards attacked peaceful  demonstrators right here in our Nation's Capital.   I am pleased that later today the House will vote to impose sanctions  on Turkey for its actions in Syria. This resolution and that bill are  tied together. They are both powerful statements that we respect  fundamental  [[Page H8566]]  human rights and that we desire to stand on the right side of history.
