 Madam Speaker, with just 7 days remaining in  his term, today's highly partisan rush to impeach the President is  being done without knowing the whole truth which takes time, effort and  serious scrutiny to establish.   Today's snap impeachment vote alleging President Trump's ``incitement  of insurrection'' lacks an objective and thorough investigation of the  facts.   Astonishingly, there have been no congressional hearings on H. Res.  24--the impeachment resolution--which was only introduced two days ago  on January 11th.   The fact that the U.S. Senate won't even consider the impeachment  resolution passed by the House until after the January 20th  inauguration begs the question as to why the debate and vote isn't  postponed until we have all the facts.   Our Nation is in desperate need of unity and civility as it prepares  for the inauguration of President-elect Biden.   Impeachment of President Trump--without a thorough analysis of the  facts which takes time, effort and serious scrutiny to establish--will  not in any way help to heal a divided America.   Let me state again that I unequivocally condemn the assault on the  Capitol last week and those who committed murder, violence, vandalism  and other crimes should be prosecuted to the greatest extent of the  law.   We must be committed to zero-tolerance towards violence in any form.   I strongly support and have cosponsored H.R. 275 to create a national  bipartisan commission to comprehensively investigate the January 6th  deadly attack on the Capitol.
