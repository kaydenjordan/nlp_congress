 Mr. Speaker, in the passing of Congressman John  Lewis, I have lost a dear friend, Georgia has lost a true leader, and  our nation has lost a civil rights icon.   John Lewis and I first met upon my arrival to Congress nearly three  decades ago. Yet, by  [[Page H3675]]  the time of that meeting, he had already made a profound impact on my  life. It was because of his early work on the advancement of the Civil  and Voting Rights Acts that I can stand here and address you today.   His grasp of the nuances and complexities of public policy, paired  with his genuine personality, made him a dynamic presence in this  Chamber. When he spoke, everyone--regardless of party or politics-- listened. When he sang--like he did when we were jailed together  following a nonviolent protest at the Embassy of Sudan--peace ensued.  His stories captivated, his advice educated, his sermons inspired, and  his speeches motivated. He brought the same passion he had as an  activist to the halls of Congress, where he spent his career  representing Georgia's 5th district.   It is impossible to properly eulogize John Lewis with only words--for  he was a man of action. We would therefore all do well to reaffirm our  commitment to the preservation of equality and justice in his honor,  which is necessary now more than ever before.   Mr. Speaker, I wish to offer my condolences to John Lewis's family  and to thank the Congressman for a life full of ``good trouble.''   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, for so many of us,  serving in the U.S. Congress is the achievement of a lifetime. But by  the time John Lewis arrived to this chamber, he had already built a  historic legacy, as one of the Greats of the Civil Rights Movement. A  man of inspiration and hope, committed to the struggles of freedom and  justice, John had to put himself on the line and defend social justice  throughout his whole lifetime.   America has lost one of its great leaders. John never relented in  fighting for what he felt was right, yet he always sought the good in  others. Having suffered bigotry and violence, he would not let himself  be dragged down by hate.   It is a privilege to me, to have been able to know and serve in  Congress with such a champion of equality and civil rights. Humble as  the truly great are humble, serene and kind, but John was strong in his  convictions. In his office he displayed mementos of our nation's crude  history of segregation and the events of the struggle that he still  remembered as if it were yesterday. I was privileged to have  conversations with him asking about his experiences, in which he gladly  spent much longer time than the usual congressional meeting. In his  gaze as he spoke you could see an inner peace that filled the room and  seemed magical.   John Lewis always supported the right of Puerto Ricans to choose  their own future and achieve full equality as American citizens, and I  was able to count on him as cosponsor of the Puerto Rico Statehood  Admission Act (H.R. 4901). He also joined in our effort to recognize  the valor and sacrifice in battle of the Puerto Rican soldiers of the  65th Infantry Regiment as cosponsor of the measure to establish the  13th of April as National Borinqueneers Day.   In the same spirit of justice and equality, he asked me to be the  Republican co-lead for the Every Child Deserves a Family Act (H.R.  3114), a piece of legislation that seeks to end discrimination in  adoption and foster care agencies across the nation, forbidding  discrimination against children, youths, families and individuals on  the basis of religion, sex (including sexual orientation and gender  identity) and marital status in the management and delivery of child  welfare services. I did not hesitate to say yes. Discrimination is  discrimination whether you are talking political or social issues.   Representative Lewis' gallant defense of equality and justice  extended to the struggle for the rights of the LGBTQ community. I was  proud to join him in the Equality Act, which would extend by law the  protection against discrimination under the 1964 Civil Rights Act to  LGBTQ individuals. The march towards true justice on which John Lewis  spent his life goes on: it is up to us to continue it. There will be  other bridges to cross, and his courage should inspire us to cross  them, but always with love and care for all people.   May John's loved ones be comforted by the knowledge that his memory  will continue to inspire many generations who are learning from his  words, about inclusion and about fighting hatred with love. I Thank  John (he never wanted me to call him Congressman or Mr. Lewis).                            ____________________
