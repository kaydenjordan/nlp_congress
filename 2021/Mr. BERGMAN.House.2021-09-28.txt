 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his leadership on  this extremely important issue.   I want to expose for my constituents the real truth about the so- called infrastructure portion of the Democrats' destructive $5.5  trillion package.   You can read for yourself in the bill that only a fraction of the  funds go to roads, bridges, broadband, and other things people outside  the swamp would generally consider infrastructure, a true and  embarrassingly small drop in the bucket, considering the current state  of Michigan's infrastructure. By the way, our roads still haven't been  fixed.   But more importantly, I am asking you to read between the lines to  understand that this package will stretch the long, intrusive arm of  the Federal Government into your life, more than ever before. Your  energy bill, your taxes, your job, your Nation's borders, your economic  freedom.    As your Representative, I can't let this happen, and I urge my  colleagues to oppose this bill.
