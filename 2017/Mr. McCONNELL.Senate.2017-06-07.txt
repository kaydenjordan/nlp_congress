 Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk, and I ask for its first reading.    Mr. President, I now ask for a second reading and, in  order to place the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule  XIV, I object to my own request.    Mr. President, Senators today will have an opportunity  to advance important bipartisan Iran sanctions legislation. As we  consider this bill, we anticipate that amendments addressing Russia  sanctions are likely to be offered. I am encouraged that the chairmen  of the Foreign Relations and Banking Committees, Senator Corker and  Senator Crapo, have already been in discussions with their respective  ranking members to work toward a bipartisan agreement. I support that  effort, and I will have more to say about the underlying legislation  tomorrow.                            ____________________     Now, Mr. President, on one other matter, later today  President Trump will visit Cincinnati to discuss the importance of our  Nation's inland waterways. Kentucky is home to over 1,900 miles of  navigable inland waterways, which, in addition to adding majestic  beauty to my State, are also vital to thousands of jobs in the  Commonwealth.   In recent years, over 95 million tons of cargo and agricultural  products have been transported across these water trade routes. Our  many levees, docks, and dams represent crucial infrastructure that play  an important role in our regional and national economy.   I am proud of the work Congress has done in the past to protect our  Nation's waterways, like passing the Water Resources Development Act by  a bipartisan majority last year in order to support infrastructure,  enhance commerce, and maintain American ecosystems.   As President Trump continues to release his plans for our Nation's  infrastructure, I look forward to working with the administration and  colleagues in the Senate to protect and improve the many roads,  bridges, airports, and waterways that serve people and jobs all across  our country.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, the cloture vote on the motion to proceed to  S. 722 occur at 1:45 p.m. today, and if cloture is invoked, time  postcloture count as if invoked at 10:30 a.m.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
