 Mr. Speaker, while still more work needs  to be done to confront our Nation's challenges with opioids, I am  pleased to report that my home State of North Carolina is working to  stem the tide and has witnessed a drop in opioid overdoses.   In my district, Surry County and its healthcare professionals, first  responders, and addiction counselors deserve recognition as  contributing to the county witnessing a drop of over 75 percent in  opioid-related emergency room visits within the last year.   This comes as we implement one of the most significant bills that  Congress passed last year, the comprehensive SUPPORT for Patients and  Communities Act.   I helped introduce that legislation with bipartisan colleagues, and I  am glad to report that the bill is achieving its goal in stemming the  tide of addiction by improving prevention and public health efforts,  enhancing treatment and recovery programs, and providing communities  more tools in their fight.   Again, Mr. Speaker, more work needs to be done to confront our  Nation's  [[Page H9260]]  challenges with opioids, but Congress laid the groundwork for this work  to be done at the State and local level with the passage of the SUPPORT  for Patients and Communities Act.                            ____________________
