 Mr. Speaker, I am honored to take this oath and to join  this House.   The founding creed of our country holds that we are endowed by our  Creator, that our rights do not come from the State, but from the hand  of God. We have always believed that government is established to  secure those rights, and the oath we have taken binds us to that cause.  I believe in that cause.   When we started our campaign, we heard a lot of talk about how  nothing could get done in the government anymore. Wise commentators  worried that we were too divided, our institutions too old and too slow  to respond, and our people's ancient faith in our democratic process  was disappearing, but that is not what we found.   At Legion posts, at union halls, and on people's doorsteps, we found  a faith in America and a fierce determination to make our institutions  work again, as they have so often in our history. The people of western  Pennsylvania picked me up every day.   The essential truth of our situation is we are all in this together.  We need solidarity with each other; we need universal programs and  aspirations; and we need to honor the service of our fellow citizens.   I will do my level best to reach out, to find common ground, and to  help this great American institution deliver the results we need and  deserve.   It may be difficult to acknowledge everyone, but I will start with my  grandmother, Barbara Lamb, who is in the House. My parents, Tom and  Katie, are with her, along with my uncles, my aunt, and my brother. I  also have a brother and sister watching from far away. My fiancee is in  the House as well, and I hope everybody gives her a round of applause.                            ____________________
