 Madam President, October is National Disability Employment  Awareness Month. I would like to take a moment to honor IFB Solutions,  headquartered in my hometown of Winston-Salem, NC. IFB Solutions has  been operating in North Carolina for over 85 years and over that time  has provided employment to thousands of blind and visually impaired  individuals.   Over their many decades of operation, IFB has helped fill the needs  of the Federal Government with high quality products, delivered on  time, and at a fair market value.   As we celebrate National Disability Employment Awareness month, I  applaud IFB Solutions for their commitment to offering employment  opportunities for the blind and visually impaired. It is my hope that  more employers will understand the value of having a diverse workforce  and follow suit.  [[Page S7366]]                                ____________________
