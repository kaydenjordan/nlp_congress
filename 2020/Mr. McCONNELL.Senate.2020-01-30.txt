 Mr. Chief Justice, the Senate will conduct another  question and answer period today. We were able to get through nearly  100 questions yesterday. Senators posed constructive questions, and the  parties were succinct and responsive. I would like to compliment all  who participated yesterday.   We will again break every 2 to 3 hours and look to take a break for  dinner around 6:30.   We have been respectful of the Chief Justice's unique position in  reading our questions. I want to be able to continue to assure him that  that level of consideration for him will continue.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.    Mr. Chief Justice, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate stand in recess until 4 p.m.   There being no objection, at 3:37 p.m., the Senate, sitting as a  Court of Impeachment, recessed until 4:03 p.m.; whereupon the Senate  reassembled when called to order by the Chief Justice   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Idaho.    Mr. Chief Justice, I am about to send a question to  the desk, but I am going to suggest that following the response to my  question and one more Democratic question, we take a 45-minute break  for dinner.   So I send a question to the desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. I am sure there is no objection.   The question from the majority leader is for the counsel to the  President:         Would you please respond to the question on bipartisanship       by Senator Alexander and any assertions the House managers       made in response to any of the previous questions?     =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S721, January 30, 2020, second column, the following  appears: The question from the majority leader is for the counsel  to the President: Would you please respond to the question on  bipartisanship by Senator ALEXANDER and any assertions the House  managers made in response to any previous questions?      The online Record has been corrected to read: The question from  the majority leader is for the counsel to the President: Would you  please respond to the question on bipartisanship by Senator  ALEXANDER and any assertions the House managers made in response  to any of the previous questions?    ========================= END NOTE =========================      Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, majority leader, thank you  for that question.   In response to Senator Alexander, your question, in the Nixon case,  the authorizing resolution--this is in the House to authorize the  inquiry--was passed by a vote of 410 to 4. Four hundred and ten voted  in favor of the inquiry; only four voted against. Two hundred and  thirty-two Democrats, 177 Republicans, and 1 Independent voted in  favor.   In the Clinton authorizing resolution--this was H. Res. 581--they  authorized just the beginning of the inquiry. It passed by a vote of  258 to 176 Now, 31 Democrats joined 227 Republicans voting in favor of  authorizing that inquiry. That was substantial bipartisan support to  authorize the inquiry.    In this case, H. Res. 660, which was passed on October 31, had  bipartisan opposition. The votes in favor of the resolution were 231  Democrats and 1 Independent. The opposition was all Republicans, 194,  plus 2 Democrats voting against.   In terms of other assertions that have been made, there are just a  couple of points I wanted to touch on. There has been a lot said  about--House managers have suggested that counsel for the President  have argued that the President could do anything he wants now--solicit  any foreign interference in any election. If he thinks it will help him  get elected, that is OK, and that is the theory of the case. That is  absolutely false. That is a gross distortion of what has been  presented, and let me make a couple of points about that.   There have been questions about the campaign finance laws, and one  narrow point that we have made in response to specific questions about  the campaign finance laws is simply that information--limited  information--being presented to a party is not a contribution, a thing  of value under the campaign finance laws. And that is not just my  conclusion; that is what the Mueller report said. When the Mueller  report looked into this, it said: ``No judicial decision has treated  the voluntary provision of uncompensated opposition research or similar  information as a thing of value that could amount to a contribution  under campaign-finance law.'' That is volume I, page 187. So that is a  limited point.   The bigger point: The suggestion has been made, because of Professor  Dershowitz's comments, that the theory that the President's counsel is  advancing is the President can do anything he wants. If he thinks it  will advance his reelection, any quid pro quo, anything he wants,  anything goes. That is not true. Professor Dershowitz today issued a  statement to show that that was an exaggeration of what he was saying.   But let me make an even more narrow point. Aside from what Professor  Dershowitz was saying the other night and explaining in abstract and  hypothetical terms and academic terms, we have a specific case here.  And the specific case here is the one that has been framed by the House  managers. And the defects in that case and their theory of the case  are, there is abuse of power that involves no allegation of a crime  whatsoever and no allegation of a violation of established law.  Instead, the theory that you can take action that, on its face, is  objectively permissible under the powers of the President and determine  that it is going to be  [[Page S722]]  treated as impeachable and impermissible solely on an inquiry into  subjective motives--that is what the House Judiciary Committee report  says. That is a theory that is infinitely malleable. It provides no  standard--no real standard at all. And that was one core point  Professor Dershowitz was making, that it is tantamount to impeachment  for maladministration.   The other point I will make is they set the standard for themselves  with respect to investigations. They have to establish, in order to  establish their bad motive, that there is not a scintilla of evidence-- there is nothing that you can look at that would suggest any possible  legitimate national interest in inquiring into 2016 election  interference or the Biden and Burisma affair. They can't possibly meet  that standard. It is overdetermined that there is a legitimate policy  interest in at least raising a question about those things.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.    Mr. Chief Justice, we do indeed.
