 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R.  5515, the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal  Year 2019.   This report authorizes additional funding for nuclear modernization  efforts. We make good on promises to improve defense-related  infrastructure. It authorizes full funding for a low-yield nuclear  warhead. It also postures the United States to credibly address the  threat posed by Chinese and Russian strategic nuclear weapons in the  future.   On missile defense, the conference report includes policy support and  funding for space-based sensing, boost-phase intercept, hypersonics,  and directed energy efforts.   Regarding national security space reform, this conference report  establishes a sub-unified command for space. It tasks the Department  with developing an alternative acquisition for national security space,  and it directs the Department to deliver a space warfighting policy and  readiness plan. These steps begin taking us down a path toward  implementing President Trump's directive to establish a space force.   Finally, it also includes significant reforms as to how the DOD  calculates work at our Nation's depots in an effort to modernize and  streamline that process to better support both the depots and the  warfighters who depend on them.   In conclusion, I want to thank the subcommittee's distinguished  ranking member,  Jim Cooper. He has been a great partner in this  endeavor. I also thank Chairman Thornberry and Ranking Member Smith for  their leadership in fashioning this outstanding bill.   I strongly urge my colleagues to support it.
