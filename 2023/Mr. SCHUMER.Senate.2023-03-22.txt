 Mr. President, on AUMF first, two decades after the  start of the Iraq war, the Senate this week debates legislation to  repeal the authority that commenced the war to begin with. By a large  vote--67 to 28--the Senate yesterday sent a clear message that the time  has come to repeal the AUMFs of 2002 and 1991. At this point, repealing  the Iraq AUMFs in the Senate is not a matter of if but, rather, of  when.   I hope, given such a strong bipartisan vote yesterday, we can move  quickly. There should be no needless delay or dilatory tactics on  something the majority of Senators support. We are in the process of  negotiating amendments. We want to be reasonable, but this process is  going to proceed as quickly as it can.   Allowing these AUMFs to remain on the books is just asking for a  future administration to abuse them and, God forbid, bumble us into a  new conflict in the Middle East.   War powers belong in the hands of Congress, and we should use and  exert that authority by bringing these AUMFs to a close.   It is my hope that both sides can reach an agreement to accelerate  this process very soon. In the meantime, once again, thanks, kudos to  Senators Kaine and Young, Chairman Menendez and Ranking Member Risch,  and all of the cosponsors. There are many in this legislation.    I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin),  the Senator from California (Mrs. Feinstein), and the Senator from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Fetterman) are necessarily absent.    Madam President, first let me salute our chair of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee and our Member of the committee, the  Senator from Virginia, for the great work they have done.   We are trying to be very fair in the amendment process. We are trying  to allow amendments to occur, but we want to try to move the bill along  as well and not just do things for dilatory or extraneous purposes. So  I am very glad we have agreed on these three amendments and hope we can  agree on a few more and get things done.                              Order of Business    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to  consider the following amendments: Paul No. 2, Graham No. 14, Lee No.  22; that if offered, the Senate vote in relation to the Paul and Graham  amendments at 5:50 p.m. today, with 2 minutes for debate equally  divided between votes; further, that the Senate vote in relation to the  Lee amendment at a time to be determined by the majority leader,  following consultation with the Republican leader, with 60 affirmative  votes required for the adoption of the Paul and Lee amendments, all  without intervening action or debate.    I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin),  the Senator from California (Mrs. Feinstein), the Senator from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Fetterman), and the Senator from New Mexico (Mr.  Heinrich) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin),  the Senator from California (Mrs. Feinstein), and the Senator from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Fetterman) are necessarily absent.
