 Madam Speaker, make no mistake, this resolution is about  the killing of Soleimani. He was a terrorist, no different than al- Baghdadi, then al-Zarqawi, then Osama bin Laden, then Khalid Sheikh  Mohammed. He was the head of a designated terrorist organization no  different than ISIS or al-Qaida.   He was responsible for the deaths of our men and women--and I know  most in here haven't seen or smelled or touched that kind of death, but  let me tell you about it. They were burned alive inside of their  Humvees. Their lungs were scorched by the flames of the explosions.   The vehicle fragments were blown into their skulls. Some of them were  paralyzed. Some of them had their arms blown off. Some of them had  their legs blown off. Some of them will never see again. Some of them  will never be recognized again by those who knew them previously.   Each and every one of them, they are the credible explanation for  deleting this terrorist target from our world.   And no doubt, it is dangerous to take out a terrorist target, but a  coward is somebody who lacks the courage to endure danger. This is the  fundamental difference in voting ``yes'' or ``no'' here.   If you vote ``no,'' you understand that we would be justified to kill  100 Soleimanis for just one of our heroes who have been killed by him.  The danger would be worth it.   For those who vote ``yes,'' they see that he has killed hundreds of  our servicemembers but can still not find the justification to kill him  because, unlike our fallen heroes, they lack the courage to endure  danger.
