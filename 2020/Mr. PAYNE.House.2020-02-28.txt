 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet on Monday next, when it shall  convene at noon for morning-hour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative  business.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Henry Hamilton to  close Black History Month.   Mr. Hamilton is the principal of the Whitney E. Houston Academy in  East Orange, New Jersey. He has been a teacher, administrator, and  principal at the school for 50 years of his 57 years in education.   His dedication to his students is shown every single day. He chats  with them in the halls. He eats meals with them during lunch. He  encourages them when they are having a bad day. He even carries  peppermint treats to reward students for good grades.   He loves teaching so much that he never missed a day of work for his  first 33 years of service.   Madam Speaker, I celebrated his work and legacy during my special  Black History Month celebration on February 21. He is an asset to my  district, a revered public servant, and a great, great man. He deserves  all these accolades and many more.                            ____________________
