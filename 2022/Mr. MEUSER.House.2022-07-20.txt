 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana, my  very good friend, for offering this opportunity to speak on these  important issues.   Mr. Speaker, 1 year ago this week, President Biden stood before the  American people and said that inflation was temporary. At that point,  the Consumer Price Index, which measures inflation, of course, stood at  5.4 percent.   In the 365 days since, the price of nearly everything has increased,  and the Consumer Price Index has skyrocketed at 9.1 percent.   Eggs are up 33 percent; milk is up 16 percent; chicken is up 18  percent; and worst of all, Americans are paying over 60 percent more  for gasoline than they were a year ago, costing American families, my  constituents, and everyone throughout our country, nearly $6,000 extra  a year. Now we have our Transportation Secretary telling us the truth,  that this pain--and I'm quoting--will lead to more purchases of  electric cars.   So that was the plan. Thanks for being honest, Mr. Secretary.   Meanwhile, however, neither the administration nor the Secretary of  Transportation has any understanding of where the energy comes from to  charge all of these electric cars.   They are not exactly chess players, Mr. Speaker.   As my friend from Louisiana put it, inflation, incompetence--the  third ``I''?
