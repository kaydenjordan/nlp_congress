 Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight the good work  that has been done by FEMA in my district in California where we had  the devastating Camp fire affect and devastate Paradise, California.  The cleanup and the recovery from this disaster is going pretty well,  with a coordinated effort with FEMA, Army Corps of Engineers, and State  entities like the Cal OES.   The response from the Federal Government after the President's visit  has not been disappointing but, indeed, going pretty well.   So far, more than $48 million has been approved by FEMA to help  recover from wildfire losses in California, including Butte County and  Paradise. FEMA has been on the ground helping people get the assistance  they need directly. Nearly 7,000 individual assistance applications  have already been approved.   It is still extremely challenging for people who have suffered losses  and who are, indeed, displaced from their homes, having to live with  friends, relatives, motels, whatever that might be. I get that. It is  very difficult. But we are all working in a coordinated way together to  move along the recovery efforts as quickly as possible with State  entities and Federal entities and local government. The outpouring of  people who support each other has been amazing.   The administration has made a commitment from day 1 to help our  people recover, and they have been backing it up to this point, and I  expect this will fully continue.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 22.
