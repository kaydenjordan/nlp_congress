 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I rise in support of H.R. 1873, the Electricity Reliability and  Forest Protection Act.   In California, we know all too well the disastrous effects of  wildfires. Reducing the threat of wildfires requires numerous proactive  efforts, including the timely removal of fire hazards.   My colleague, Mr. LaMalfa, has identified a solution to help improve  fire hazard removal on Federal lands and prevent electrical blackouts.   There are more than 18,000 miles of power lines on Forest Service and  Bureau of Land Management land, and these transmission lines, running  along electricity rights-of-way, are critical to the power distribution  in the West.   The costs of operating and maintaining these transmission rights-of- way are borne by utility companies, but approval for companies to  remove the fire  [[Page H5024]]  hazards comes from the Forest Service. Currently, it takes the Forest  Service months to grant approval to remove a dead tree.   H.R. 1873 addresses this issue by allowing utility companies to  remove fire risks in a timely manner and ensuring we are being  responsible stewards of our Federal lands.   The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Additionally, the bill allows utility companies to engage  in responsible vegetation management along these rights-of-way,  including language that I have added, which encourages the management  practices for our pollinators, enhancing the habitat and forage for  these pollinators, such as commercial and native bees that are so  important to our trees and our community.   I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense, bipartisan bill.
