 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to condemn the impending  government shutdown and House Republicans' refusal to set politics  aside for the good of the American people.   Rather than working across the aisle with Democrats to fund the  government like the Senate, my Republican colleagues are threatening a  catastrophic shutdown unless their extreme demands are met.   Make no mistake, a government shutdown is entirely preventable.  Extreme Republicans in the House are choosing to put politics over the  American people.   A government shutdown threatens the lives and livelihoods of our  servicemembers, small business owners, children, and families who rely  on Head Start and WIC, and so much more.   Mr. Speaker, with only 1 day left until the government funding runs  out, House Democrats are willing to work across the aisle to keep  government open.   It is time for Republicans to do the same for the American people.                            ____________________
