 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment,  which directs the Secretary of Defense to develop a plan for a pilot  program to train skilled technicians for placement in the defense  industrial base, including critical shipbuilding skills such as  welding, metrology, quality assurance, machining, and additive  manufacturing.    Mr. Chair, I would like to begin by thanking my friends, colleagues,  and fellow Virginians, Representatives Luria, Wittman, McEachin, and  Beyer, for their partnership on this amendment.   Our Nation's defense industrial base is a critical aspect of our  Nation's national security and economic prosperity. We must continue to  adapt this industry to respond to the emerging challenges and global  realities that face our country. One such challenge is training a  workforce that can maintain the required tools and products our Armed  Forces need.   The Defense Industrial Base report to the President dated October  2018 stated: ``Without concerted action that provides both a ready  workforce and continuously-charged pipeline of new employees, the U.S.  will not be able to maintain the large, vibrant, and diverse machine  tools sector needed.''   This amendment helps the Department of Defense close the gap in our  Nation's workforce that threatens our global competitiveness and  military capabilities. It will help America modernize its workforce and  create a pipeline of new employees who support our security apparatus.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
