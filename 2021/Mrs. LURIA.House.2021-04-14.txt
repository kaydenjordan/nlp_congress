 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2368, the  COVENANT Act, legislation to ensure our Nation's veterans can receive  the benefits they deserve after being exposed to toxic substances in  the course of their service.   Mr. Speaker, protecting the quality of life of our veterans is a top  priority of this Congress, and particularly for my colleagues on the  House Veterans' Affairs Committee, where I chair the Disability  Assistance and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee.   One such veteran I have the privilege of representing, Master  Sergeant Brian Graves of Virginia Beach, flew missions over the Middle  East for the United States Air Force. Today, he lives with breathing  problems after inhaling jet fumes and being exposed to other toxins  during his time of service.   The COVENANT Act will dramatically streamline the VA benefits process  for thousands of veterans like Master Sergeant Graves.   Between June 2007 and February 2021, we know that 13,900 veterans  filed a disability benefit claim related to toxic exposure. Mr.  Speaker, of those nearly 14,000 veterans, only 4,000 claims were  granted. That is simply unacceptable. We cannot allow history to repeat  itself. Veterans like myself watched our peers who served in Vietnam  wait decades for the benefits they deserve.   The recent veterans who served in the Middle East, southwest Asia,  east Africa, and the Philippines need our help today. Mr. Speaker, they  are hurting and, in some cases, dying. Congress must not neglect them  in their time of need.   That is why I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the  COVENANT Act, a comprehensive approach to securing benefits for  veterans exposed to toxic substances overseas.                            ____________________
