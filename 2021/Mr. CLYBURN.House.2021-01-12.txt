 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution. In  recent days, it has become indisputable that this President is unable  to uphold his oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution.   On the contrary, he seems only capable of attacking the Constitution.  Never before has a President sought to overturn a fair and secure  election, threatening State officials to manufacture fraudulent votes.   Never before has a President incited mob violence to block  certification of his opponent's victory.   Never before has a President refused to condemn and demand the  cessation of an attack on our country.   The devastating bruises on our Nation's soul can only begin to heal  by removing the weapon used to bludgeon us.   The Vice President must invoke the 25th Amendment to immediately  remove power from this dangerous President. And if he doesn't, we must  vote to impeach.
