 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand in the House  of Representatives today to announce the reintroduction of the LGBTQ  Pride  [[Page H5971]]  Month resolution. This resolution encourages the celebration of the  month of June as LGBTQ Pride Month.   I am very proud to say that we are introducing this resolution  because we want to commemorate the historic Stonewall uprising that  took place at the Stonewall Inn in New York City on June 28, 1969.   The resolution has 95 original cosponsors, and I would dearly like to  call each name; but, of course, time doesn't permit, and I might omit a  name. So, Mr. Speaker, please know that it is well supported, and I am  proud to have talked to a good many of the cosponsors who are very  proud to be associated with this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, this resolution celebrates the accomplishments of many  persons in the LGBTQ community, among them, Mayor Annise Parker, who  was the first lesbian elected as mayor of the City of Houston--and who  did an outstanding job, I might add.   It also celebrates the hard work of the transgender community and  what it has done to spread awareness about tolerance and inclusion to  make sure all people are celebrated in this great country.   It recognizes the protesters who stood for human rights and dignity  at the Stonewall Inn on June 28, 1969. It recognizes them as some of  the pioneers of the movement.   The resolution celebrates the creation of gay rights organizations in  major cities in the aftermath of the Stonewall uprising. It highlights  the importance of the American Psychiatric Association removing  homosexuality from its list of mental illnesses in December of 1973.   I want to pause and just say a word about this. Mr. Speaker, this was  a significant accomplishment. It might seem like a small thing to a  good many people, but when your very being is defined as a mental  illness, and that is removed, it means something to people. It means  that people can be themselves and not thought to be ill. So I am very  proud to highlight this and the importance of it.   It recognizes Elaine Noble as the first LGBTQ candidate elected to a  State legislature in 1974, and Barney Frank, whom I had the honor of  serving with in the House of Representatives on the Financial Services  Committee, as the first Representative to come out as an openly gay  Member of the Congress of the United States in 1987.   It highlights the importance of the Civil Service Commission  eliminating the ban on hiring homosexuals in most Federal jobs in 1975.  Imagine not being hired simply because of who you are.   It celebrates Harvey Milk having made national headlines when he was  sworn in as an openly gay member of the San Francisco Board of  Supervisors.   It also highlights the importance of 1980, the Democratic Convention,  where Democrats took a stance in support of gay rights.   It celebrates Vermont becoming the first State to legally recognize  civil unions between gay and lesbian couples in the year 2000.   The resolution highlights the importance of the Supreme Court's  ruling in Lawrence v. Texas in June of 2003, which held that, under the  14th Amendment, States could not criminalize the private, intimate  relationships of same-sex couples.   It highlights the significance of Congress approving and President  Obama signing the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell.   It celebrates 2012 as the first year in which all 50 States had at  least one LGBTQ-elected official.   It celebrates Senator Tammy Baldwin being the first openly gay United  States Senator in January of 2013.   It highlights the importance of the ruling in the United States v.  Windsor, which found section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA,  to be unconstitutional.   It highlights the Equality Act, which was introduced on July 23,  2015, by Congressman David Cicilline--with bipartisan support, I might  add--as the first comprehensive civil rights bill, which amends the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 to include sex, sexual orientation, and gender  identity among the prohibited categories of discrimination or  segregation in places of public accommodation.   It also celebrates Eric Fanning being sworn in as the first openly  gay Secretary of the Army.   Mr. Speaker, Presidents have acknowledged this month as Pride Month.  President Clinton was the first to do so in 1999. President Obama  followed. It is unfortunate, however, that this President has not done  so. This President has not honored the month of June as Pride Month,  although he has honored it as a reason to celebrate many other things.  We hope that the President will have a change of heart and will  recognize June as Pride Month because there is good reason to do so.    On June 28, 1969, the patrons of the Stonewall Inn decided to rise  up. It was a seminal moment in time for the LGBTQ community. The  movement was born out of the necessity to live and thrive in a country  where, at the time, it was neither accepted nor safe in many places to  do so. Stonewall is recognized by most people as the moment in time  when persons decided that they had had enough.   It was not unusual for members of the police department to come in.  It wasn't just in Stonewall, not just into New York, but they would go  into places where LGBTQ persons would congregate and harass them. It  was something that was not accepted, of course, by the community. But  officers, for whatever reason, thought that they could do so with  impunity and, in fact, did do so with impunity in a good many places.   Well, on this date, the members of the community decided that they  would not take anymore. There was a pushback from the community in the  form of persons just absolutely refusing to allow the harassment to  take place. An uprising, a riot if you will, took place. As a result,  many cities across the country adopted LGBTQ organizations and pride  became something that persons wanted to exhibit.   This was something that has metamorphosed from that moment in time to  today, when we have Pride celebrations across the length and the  breadth of the country. In Houston, we had a significant Pride parade.  Literally scores of thousands of people were assembled and had the  opportunity to celebrate with pride the fact that they were members of  the LGBTQ community or they were allies of the LGBTQ community.   The LGBTQ community has many allies in Congress, allies across the  length and breadth of the country and the various statehouses, in  police departments, allies who are willing to stand up and stand with  the LGBTQ community. I count myself as an ally of the community and  would hope that, as an ally of the community, what we are doing today  will further the understanding that we, regardless as to who we are,  should be proud to be associated with the LGBTQ community and proud to  work with the LGBTQ community to acquire the additional rights that we  all enjoy, to a certain extent--I say ``we all'' because there are  still some things that are being denied persons of African ancestry-- but to receive the rights that the Constitution accords all people.   I would use, as an example, the right to simply have a job. There are  places in this country where persons are still fired because of who  they are. Once it is known that a person is a member of the LGBTQ  community, they are terminated with impunity.   We have to do something about this. This is the United States of  America. It is the greatest country in the world, and as such, we ought  not discriminate against anyone because of who they happen to be.   Here in Congress, we have the LGBTQ Caucus. I am proud to be  associated with this caucus. It has taken a stand not only for the  rights of members of the LGBTQ community, but also for the rights of  members of other communities. It has taken a stand when it comes to  immigration, taken a stand when it comes to integration.   The LGBTQ Caucus in the Congress of the United States of America has  a very broad reach, a very good understanding of the notion that human  dignity is something that should be accorded all people. Human rights  are not to be denied people because of who they are or who they happen  to love.   I am honored to be associated with the caucus, and I am a very proud  American who stands here tonight to say: Let's continue to celebrate  June as LGBTQ Pride Month, and let's encourage the President of the  United  [[Page H5972]]  States of America to do what other Presidents have done. This is a  noble thing, it is an honorable thing, and we ask that it be done.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now  adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 1 o'clock and 44 minutes  p.m.), the House adjourned until tomorrow, Friday, June 29, 2018, at 9  a.m.                            ____________________
