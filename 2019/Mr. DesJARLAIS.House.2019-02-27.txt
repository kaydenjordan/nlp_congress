 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support President  Trump's declaration of a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border.   Sophisticated cartels--some of the most dangerous criminals and  terrorist organizations in the world--are partnering with foreign  adversaries, including Cuba, Venezuela, Iran, and China smuggling  drugs, as well as human beings, into our country.   Mexican cartels produce or distribute the most heroin, fentanyl,  cocaine, and methamphetamine here, killing tens of thousands of  Americans annually.   My constituents are suffering from the opioid epidemic.   MS-13 and other violent gangs have infiltrated recent migrant  caravans; however, the equivalent of a migrant caravan crosses the  border almost weekly.   These forces are destabilizing and deadly to people on both sides,  particularly for the less fortunate among us.   Under legal authority Congress has granted the executive branch-- which Barack Obama also used to combat cartels and illegal  immigration--the President, the power to declare a national emergency  to fund construction of the new border barriers at dangerous weak  points.   As a fiscal conservative, constitutionalist, and strong advocate for  the  [[Page H2242]]  military, I believe the need is clear and pressing, the law supports  immediate action, and ample funding exists to address this crisis.                            ____________________
