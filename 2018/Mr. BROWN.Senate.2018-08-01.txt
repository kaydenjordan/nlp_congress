 Mr. President, I will start by thanking Senator Hatch. He  and I are cochairs of the Pensions Committee. We had a commitment, and  we had a good meeting in his office last week. We had a good discussion  and hearing in our joint committee; we have four Republicans and four  Democrats from each House solving what looks to some to be an  intractable pension problem.   But if you are one of 16,000 Ohio Teamsters, mine workers, iron  workers, carpenters, bakers, and others, it is your life because you  put--what this town doesn't always understand on collective bargaining  is you give up money today at the bargaining table so you will have a  pension later in life; you will have economic security.   In part because of Wall Street shenanigans and other things, these  pensions are in jeopardy. They could face up to 60 percent in pension  cuts. We also know that a whole lot of businesses, at least 210 in my  State alone, could face layoffs or, worse, bankruptcy. Many of them are  family-owned transportation and manufacturing and construction  companies. They could face very, very dire economic times if Congress  doesn't fix that, let alone what is going to happen to the Pension  Benefit Guaranty Corporation. I thank Senator Hatch for that.  [[Page S5554]]    Mr. President, I am a little curious, though, when I hear him and  others talk about the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as if it is  this awful, out-of-control Federal agency. What bothers my colleagues  about the CFPB is that it is the only agency in government that is  willing to stand up against the Wall Street interests. We see the  Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and we know how close he is  to Wall Street--the Comptroller. We see the FDIC and we see the Federal  Reserve and we see these nominees who come out of a White House that  looks like it is a retreat for Wall Street executives, and they are on  one side protecting Wall Street and doing Wall Street's bidding.   We have one agency, just one agency, which my conservative, pro-Wall  Street, pro-corporate colleagues complain about every day, every week,  every month--an agency that has saved 29 million American consumers $12  million. How do you think--and they want to rein in that agency, saying  the agency just has too much power over people's lives. It is actually  protecting--my friend, the Senator from Massachusetts, who is also in  the hall, talks about their being a cop on the beat. They are  protecting consumers while Wall Street is doing whatever Wall Street  does to them. I will just leave it at that.                            ____________________     Mr. President, a free, independent press is vital to our  democracy. It is enshrined in our Constitution. We need tenacious,  dedicated journalists, who will afflict the comfortable and comfort the  afflicted, to ask tough questions, to challenge special interests, to  connect Americans with their communities. That is why I joined my  colleagues this week on a resolution condemning this administration's  awful, vicious, demagogic attacks on reporters--including the decision  last week to bar a reporter from attending a White House event just  because the White House didn't like the questions she asked--with the  repeated labeling of the free press as ``enemies of the people.''   Watch the video from last night. Watch the video in Florida from last  night where the President egged on, egged on, and egged on his  supporters to start screaming at newspaper reporters and other  reporters--people who are doing their jobs.   In spite of this President using Stalinist language--I am just  reading a book right now written by a Stalinist translator, and this  book talks about a lot of the language Stalin used. He called people  ``enemies of the people.'' That is Communist talk. That is Stalinist  talk. Yet this President calls reporters who get up every day and do  their jobs--most of them not paid very well, frankly--the enemy of the  people. They do vital work not just in Washington but throughout the  country.   I would like to take a moment to highlight one of them. I am going to  come to this floor every so often in the weeks and months ahead, and I  am going to talk about a local reporter--a reporter who gets up every  day, who probably doesn't make more than $20,000 or $30,000 a year. In  many cases it is a little more than that, but reporters are generally  not particularly well-paid people. I want to talk about the important  work that local Ohio journalists do. Some of them I have met; others I  haven't met but I have observed, because I know how important they are  to their communities. I will start doing this on a regular basis  because in this town today, with this administration, with this  President of the United States--I still can't believe a President of  the United States engages in talk like Stalin--the Soviet Stalin-- calling American citizens who get up every day and do their job and do  their job to the best of their ability ``enemies of the people,'' and  he tries to get the crowds he speaks to, the people he addresses, to  chime in and call them ``enemies of the people'' and start calling  those reporters names.   I want this floor message that I am going to do from time to time to  be a constant reminder of how reporters contribute to their  communities.   Last week, the Daily Jeffersonian in eastern Ohio ran a story on the  upcoming Firemen's Festival in Caldwell, OH, a town in Appalachia,  reported by a local reporter named Austin Erickson. It is the local  fire department's biggest fundraiser of the year. They rely on the  proceeds in part because of the corruption in State government where  State government doesn't fund local communities like they used to for a  whole bunch of reasons, but this fire department relies on the proceeds  of the Fireman's Festival to fund daily maintenance, testing, and  safety gear of their firefighters.   Mr. Erickson talked to the festival's chairman, who pointed to the  fire department and told the reporter: ``If it's in those four walls,  it's from that festival.'' In other words, if it weren't for this  festival, we wouldn't have the fire equipment we need.   Through its work, the Daily Jeffersonian and local reporters like Mr.  Erickson are informing their communities about ways to support local  firefighters and responders who keep them safe. If people like Mr.  Erickson of the Daily Jeffersonian in Cambridge, OH, were not writing  these stories, were not reporting on the Fireman's Festival, not as  many people would go or understand it. They spend their hard-earned  money there. It helps their local communities. It helps their fire  department.   Enemies of the People? If the President would listen and see what  these reporters do every day, maybe he would stop the demagoguery.  Maybe he would stop calling people names. Maybe he would stop calling  his own Attorney General names. Maybe he would stand up to Putin who  clearly--that is a whole other story. I won't get into that.   Let's go back to these local reporters and what journalists do every  day and what Mr. Erickson does. It is what newspapers all over Ohio-- from my hometown paper, the Mansfield News Journal, the paper where my  wife used to work, the Cleveland Plain Dealer, the Columbus Dispatch,  the Cincinnati Enquirer, a smaller paper, the News-Herald, the Lorain  Journal--I could go on and on and on, paper after paper after paper.   Journalists wake up every day and do their jobs. They serve their  communities, and they serve their country. They are not enemies of the  people. I just pray to God that the President of the United States will  stop that kind of talk.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today we came together to pass important  bipartisan legislation to strengthen our national security and invest  in American jobs.   Many of my colleagues of both parties have helped get the National  Defense Authorization Act over the finish line. I particularly want to  thank my colleague Senator Portman from my State, who worked with our  office to secure important Ohio priorities, and Senator Inhofe and my  friend Jack Reed, who served so well on the Banking Committee in  addition to the work he has done on unemployment insurance and on  military issues, and Senator Crapo, my colleague from Idaho, as we  worked on securing and fortifying our national interests when it comes  to foreign investments. All of these colleagues of mine worked with the  conference committee to get our agencies new tools to screen Chinese  and other foreign investments for national security threats.   This bill would not have been possible without the leadership of one  Senator in particular; that is, the senior Senator from Arizona.  Senator McCain's leadership on this legislation and throughout his  career is why this Congress honored him through the naming of this  bill--the John McCain National Defense Authorization Act. That is a  rare honor. Congress rarely honors its own. We all know we all have  feet of clay and don't put our friends here up on a pedestal, but for a  few lions in the Senate, including Sam Nunn, John Warner, Ike Skelton,  Carl Levin, and now John McCain, we have done that.   It honors his commitment to our national security through the John S.  McCain Strategic Defense Fellows Program--fitting tributes to the  service and sacrifice of a man like John McCain. We know his story--how  a young Navy pilot was captured behind enemy lines, yet he never  wavered in his commitment to his fellow POWs in Vietnam.  [[Page S5555]]    I have had my disagreements with him. We all have. But we have always  respected each other. He has been a leader whom almost all of us from  both parties have relied on for guidance, including national security  issues and on issues when, in my first year in the Senate, I worked  with Senator McCain on keeping down the costs of prescription drugs.   He has been a critical fighter for sanctions to hold our adversaries  accountable. Last year, we worked together, along with Senators Crapo,  Schumer, Graham, Rubio, Corker, and Cardin, to pass tough, new  sanctions on Russia, Iran, and North Korea.   He has always been clear that we don't only honor the rule of law or  refrain from torture when it is easy or convenient. He authored a 2015  amendment to prohibit the use of torture as an interrogation method.   He has been forceful in defending our allies against Russian  aggression in Crimea and Georgia and Montenegro. After the Helsinki  summit, Senator McCain--one of the few Republicans in this body who is  willing to call the President out when he does something, especially on  foreign soil, to attack the United States of America--spoke out  forcefully against the President cozying up to Putin and his attacks on  journalists.   He said: ``The President [of the United States, Donald Trump,] made a  conscious choice to defend a tyrant against the fair questions of a  free press, and to grant Putin an uncontested platform to spew  propaganda and lies to the world.''   He said: ``All that makes us who we are--a republic of free people  dedicated to the cause of liberty at home and abroad.''   Those words stood out because so few Republicans were willing to  utter them.   Throughout his life and career, he has lived the motto of ``country  first.'' I thank my colleague from Arizona for his work on the National  Defense Authorization Act this year. I look forward to continuing our  work together to protect our national security and together to serve  the people of this great country.
