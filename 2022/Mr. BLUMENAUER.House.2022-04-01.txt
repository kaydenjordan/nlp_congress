 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman for his  courtesy and his leadership, and all the people that my friend, Barbara  Lee, just acknowledged.   Mr. Speaker, a century ago, we were in the midst of a prohibition  against alcohol. And the problems that my dear friend from Oregon  highlighted in terms of the prohibition against cannabis, I agree with  him about the horrific situation in southern Oregon, and I look forward  to working with him to try and remediate it. But the solution is to be  found in this legislation.   The problem of the cartels, the illegal activity, the black market,  is a result of the fact that the Federal Government does not have its  act together. People across the country have acted to take it into  their own hands and, as a result, we have a piecemeal approach.   Mr. Speaker, 48 States have some form of legalization. What Chairman  Nadler and the committee has done is provide a framework to be able to  harness the forces, to be able to do the research so we can deal with  impairment. The Federal Government interferes with that now. We have an  opportunity to solve the horrific problem of lack of access to banking  services, which makes dispensaries across the country sitting ducks.   It adds to expenses for minorities. It adds to the problems of law  enforcement. We face a situation now of great racial injustice in this  country that the legislation faces.                                time  1015    We have an opportunity to unlock untold benefits for more medical  research and be able to channel the efforts into a legal matter, to be  able to have a taxing system federally, and to be able to strengthen  the legal cannabis market so that the profits flow to the people who  should do it rather than the cartels and the corner drug dealers that  are still cutting corners.   My friend is right about the problems in southern Oregon, but he is  wrong about the solution. The MORE Act is a solution to provide the  framework, provide the research, redirect the resources to be able to  solve the problem that has been created by the failed prohibition on  cannabis.   This is historic legislation, in part, because we will send this to  the Senate where there is a different mindset for the leadership. We  have opened the opportunity to solve these problems. I urge us to take  advantage of it and move forward.
