 Mr. Speaker, this week, in the Natural Resources  Committee, we passed my bill, H.R. 289, the Guides and Outfitters Act,  called the GO Act. It will help people be able to access public lands,  national parks, U.S. Forest Service land, and BLM land for recreational  activities without the litany and long wait of having to get permits.  This will streamline that process.   A couple of aspects include getting all the different agencies to  work together to have a one-stop permitting process and shorten the  length of time it takes to get these permits so that people can have  events that are compatible with the use of these public lands and enjoy  them. Indeed, no one is trying to hurt the environment, and we don't  need a 6-month study every time somebody wants to have a bikefest or a  jog through their public lands.  [[Page H5244]]    We think the GO Act will be a very important, helpful tool,  especially during the summertime, when people like to get outdoors and  enjoy their public lands.                            ____________________
