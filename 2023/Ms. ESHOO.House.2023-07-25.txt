 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding time  to me, and I thank him for support of my bill, the Securing  Semiconductor Supply Chains Act of 2023.   My congressional district was named for the materials that  semiconductors are made of--Silicon Valley.   Mr. Speaker, 30 years ago, the United States manufactured nearly 40  percent of all semiconductors. Today, we produce only 12 percent. This  lack of domestic semiconductor manufacturing poses a significant risk  to our economy and national security.   The semiconductor supply chain is fragile, and it can be disrupted  easily, with serious consequences to our daily lives.                                time  1815    To bolster domestic semiconductor production and reduce reliance on  foreign suppliers, my legislation directs the Department of Commerce's  SelectUSA program to develop strategies to attract investment in U.S.  semiconductor manufacturers and supply chains.   It will leverage the considerable downpayment Congress made in the  CHIPS and Science Act and expand opportunities for the private sector  to invest in American manufacturing.   This bipartisan, bicameral legislation, along with the investments  made in the CHIPS and Science Act, will bring the U.S. back to being  number one in the world in semiconductor manufacturing and maintain  leadership in technological innovation.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Pence for his partnership on this  legislation, and I urge my colleagues to vote for it. This is a very  good bill, and it is going to build on what we need to bring this  manufacturing back to the United States and make us number one in the  world.
