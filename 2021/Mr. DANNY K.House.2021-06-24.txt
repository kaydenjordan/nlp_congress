 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to  the Reverend Dr. Ronald Myers, who was one of the real reasons that  President  [[Page H3087]]  Biden was able to sign into law Juneteenth as a national holiday.   Reverend Myers was founder of numerous medical and cultural  organizations and a committed physician, serving the poorest Americans  through clinics in Tchula, Belzoni, Yazoo City, Indianola, Greenville,  and Tupelo, Mississippi.   Doc was also a jazz musician, composer, and human rights activist.  The New York Times stated: ``There aren't many doctors like Ronald  Myers, a jazz-playing, Baptist-preaching, family practitioner whose  dream has always been to practice medicine in the kind of place most  other doctors wouldn't even stop for a tank of gas.''   In 1994, a group of community leaders from across the country  gathered at Christian Unity Baptist Church in New Orleans, Louisiana,  to work for greater national recognition of Juneteenth, a holiday  celebrating the end of slavery. Dr. Myers was elected chairman of this  advocacy effort, which led to the establishment of the National  Juneteenth Observance Foundation and his recognition as the leader of  the modern Juneteenth movement in America. Doc was instrumental in the  passage of 45 of the 49 State and District of Columbia pieces of  legislation naming Juneteenth as a day of observance in this country.   Working with the Congressional Black Caucus, which included Illinois  Senator Barack Obama and Representative   Danny Davis, he sought  legislation to recognize Juneteenth independence, hosting the annual  Juneteenth prayer breakfasts.                                time  1015    He established the Washington Juneteenth National Holiday Observance  and the National Day of Reconciliation and Healing from the Legacy of  Enslavement, which includes the National Juneteenth Black Holocaust  ``Maafa'' Memorial Service.   Dr. Myers organized the National Association of Juneteenth Jazz  Presenters and the Fellowship of Creative Christian Jazz Musicians.  Under his leadership, the Washington Juneteenth congressional event was  held by the National Juneteenth Observance Foundation, Juneteenth  America, Inc., and the National Association of Juneteenth Jazz  Presenters.   An accomplished jazz pianist, trumpeter, and composer, Dr. Myers  performed across the country promoting ``June is Black Music Month!''-- Celebrating Juneteenth Jazz--``Preserving Our African American Jazz  Legacy!''   For over 20 years, he met with State politicians, local Juneteenth  organizations, and community leaders.   Charles Taylor, author of Juneteenth, said: ``Doc would give a copy  of my Juneteenth book to every Governor who made Juneteenth a holiday  or observance. He even gave Sarah Palin a copy when she was the  Governor of Alaska after her State recognized Juneteenth.''   At an award ceremony at the Beverly Hills Temple of the Arts at the  Saban Theatre, founder Rabbi David Baron said: ``Reverend Dr. Ronald V.  Myers is an outstanding living model of all the values for which Martin  Luther King stood.''   Thanks to Steve Williams, who has carried on Dr. Myers' work; and my  staffer, Dr. Caleb Gilchrist, who has worked closely with him.   Thank you, Dr. Myers, and may you rest in peace.                            ____________________     DAVIS of Illinois (for himself and Mrs.               Walorski):        H.R. 4127.
