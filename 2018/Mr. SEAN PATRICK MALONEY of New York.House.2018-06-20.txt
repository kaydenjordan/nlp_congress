 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  memorialize Martin Martinez and to draw attention to his story and his  struggle.   Martin lived for over 30 years here in the United States. He worked  hard, paid taxes, learned English. He had two beautiful American  children, one of them, Maria, worked for the people of the United  States, the House of Representatives, and for me.   Martin was a good American, but he was also an undocumented  immigrant, and even though he was putting himself at risk and he knew  it, he and his wife self-reported to the government to declare their  status. They followed every instruction they were given, and they  stayed out of any kind of trouble, but they were still deported.   Soon after the deportation, Martin paid the ultimate price and lost  his life on February 27.   Now, he had existing heart problems, but his daughter, Maria, will  tell you, ``This administration separated my family and my dad died of  a broken heart.''   Maria and her brother are now forced to grieve alone, for their  mother was also deported and has been barred from reentering the United  States for a decade.   Maria and the rest of the Martinez family are forced to suffer the  real human cost of this administration's policies. And it is stories  like Martin's that so clearly demonstrate the need for comprehensive  immigration reform.   Martin's story is the story of millions of immigrants. It is our  story. And it is our responsibility to learn from it and to act. We  can't bring back Martin Martinez, but we can do something to heal our  country.                            ____________________
