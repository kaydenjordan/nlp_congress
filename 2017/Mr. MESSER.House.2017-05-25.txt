 Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1973,  which aims to strengthen protections against child victims of sexual  abuse.   I am a parent. In fact, today, with me, I have my son, Hudson, and  one of my daughters, Ava.   Sadly, over the course of the past couple of years, countless stories  of young athletes being abused, including in Indiana, have revealed  glaring inadequacies in our law. These stories, many about coaches and  doctors and trainers and other adults who have abused their positions  of authority and trust to exploit young athletes, are appalling and, as  a parent, gut wrenching. Every one of these kids deserved better.   This bill aims to ensure that acts of suspected child abuse are  promptly reported to an organization's national governing body to make  sure that these cases are immediately disclosed to local or Federal law  enforcement authorities. Short of this requirement being codified into  law, predatory individuals can continue perpetrating horrific crimes  against young athletes with relative impunity.   In addition, this bill requires national governing bodies to develop  specific policies and procedures for reporting sexual abuse cases to  law enforcement and to keep track of individuals who leave one facility  due to complaints and then go to another facility to repeat that abuse  elsewhere.   I want to thank my colleague from Indiana (Mrs. Brooks) for her  important work on this legislation--she is my kids' second favorite  Member of Congress--and for her hard work on this important bill to  protect kids all across America from abuse.   I encourage my colleagues to support the bill.
