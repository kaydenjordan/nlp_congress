 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the  gentleman from Montana, for yielding and for the support that he and  the ranking member provided for this important legislation.   It is an honor to bring H.R. 3655 to the House today to designate the  facility of the U.S. Postal Service located at 1300 Main Street in  Belmar, New Jersey, as the Dr. Walter S. McAfee Post Office Building.   Dr. Walter McAfee was a scientist, educator, and adviser to the U.S.  Army Communications-Electronics Command and the Fort Monmouth  community.   Mr. Speaker, I reached out to the leaders of the Information Age  Learning Center, also known as InfoAge, several months ago and asked  them if they could recommend a member of their community who they  believed ought to be honored in this way, and they recommended Dr.  McAfee.   As some of you may know, InfoAge has been the leading organization  preserving scientific history, innovation, and communications located  at the former Army camp, Camp Evans, and subpost of Fort Monmouth.   Dr. McAfee was instrumental in the success of Project Diana, an  effort by scientists at Camp Evans that pierced the Earth's outer  atmosphere with high frequency signals, in other words, radar. It was  his mathematical calculations that enabled the team to bounce the first  radio signals off the Moon's surface. Without the success of his  calculations that allowed for communication to occur between Earth and  space, the achievements of launching the satellites into space or  sending a man to the Moon would have not been possible.   It is the achievement of this extraordinary man that actually helped  launch us into the space age. During his time at Fort Monmouth, Dr.  McAfee also developed sensors which were used to detect and track enemy  movements during the Vietnam war. He served as director of a NATO study  on surveillance and target acquisition, high-priority technologies,  during the Cold War.   Dr. McAfee was the first African American to be promoted to GS-16, a  supergrade civilian position in the U.S. Army Materiel Command, AMC,  and to be inducted into the AMC Hall of Fame. Throughout his lifetime,  his achievements were recognized through dozens of awards and honors  that he received for his contribution to science and to the defense of  the United States and our allies.                                time  1515    He was known for his love of learning, his high ethical standards,  and great sense of humor.   He passed away in 1995 in Belmar, New Jersey. He and his wife, Viola,  were married for close to 54 years and are survived by their daughters,  Diane Mercedes McAfee and Marsha Bera-Morris.   I thank my colleagues for their anticipated support for this  legislation.
