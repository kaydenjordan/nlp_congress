 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of increased  sanctions on Russia, Iran, and North Korea. I thank Chairman Royce and  Ranking Member Eliot Engel for their leadership on this issue. I cannot  overstate the importance of sending a strong message to our adversaries  that there will be consequences for their bad behavior.   Back in October of last year, at the height of the Presidential  campaign, I was briefed by our intelligence community. They told me  that Russia engaged in a blatant effort to meddle in our domestic  affairs and, specifically, our democratic process. I was an outspoken  supporter of the need for a strong response then, and I remain so now.   However, in the process of making Russia pay an economic cost for  their bad behavior, we must ensure we are not harming U.S. interests at  home and abroad.   I want to thank Chairman Royce for clarifying that Section 232 of  this bill only applies to Russian energy export pipelines. We should  not be in the business of sanctioning pipelines that help provide  energy independence from Russia. Putin uses this as a tool to provide  political leverage over his neighbors.   So, again, I want to thank Chairman Royce for his leadership in  working with me on this, I think, clarification to the Senate companion  and for his leadership in the House on this important issue.
