 DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I thank Mr.  Pallone. I appreciate the opportunity to speak about the Nuclear  Utilization of Keynote Energy Act, or the NUKE Act. I thank my  colleague, Adam Kinzinger, for introducing this bill and working with  me to advance it. I also thank Chris Bowman and Claire Borzner from my  staff, as well as Mr. Kinzinger's staff, and the Energy and Commerce  Committee staff for their diligent work to get this bill to the floor.   This legislation is very timely as the nuclear industry is facing  pressure from a variety of factors. Nuclear energy provides nearly 40  percent of Pennsylvania's electricity, and it employs thousands of  skilled workers in Pennsylvania.   However, increasing NRC fees and uncertainty in the nuclear export  process threaten this carbon-free and reliable source of baseload  power. Addressing some of these issues is necessary to protect jobs in  Pennsylvania and across the country, as well as to meet our Nation's  climate goals.   This bipartisan legislation will take important steps to modernize  the NRC's fee structure, set achievable and flexible timelines for  application reviews, and look to future reforms that will ensure the  NRC can continue to effectively protect public health and safety.   The bill addresses a serious reality facing the nuclear industry. As  nuclear power plants retire, the remaining fleet will be faced with  increasing fees from the NRC. We need to support our existing nuclear  plants while ensuring that the NRC is able to fulfill its mission, and  I believe that this legislation accomplishes those goals.   So once again, I thank Mr. Kinzinger for his work, and I urge my  colleagues to support this important legislation.
