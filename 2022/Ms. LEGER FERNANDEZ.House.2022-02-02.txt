 Madam Speaker, with the America COMPETES Act, we  will invent it in America; we will build it in America; and we will  create American jobs.   Importantly, the America COMPETES Act gives us the opportunity to  discover, develop, and make what we need everywhere in America. That is  why I introduced, and I urge my colleagues to support, four amendments  that could expand jobs to rural, Latino, Native American, and minority  communities. The workers who produce what America needs must look like  America.   The America COMPETES Act could invest billions of dollars to build  chips and conduct research in New Mexico and other rural communities  facing economic despair. With my amendments, this bill can create jobs  for that beautifully diverse workforce that powers our Nation as we  transition to clean energy.   Energy workers deserve economic opportunity in a changing world.  Let's ensure we have innovation, training, and jobs for American  workers everywhere as we power a prosperous future.
