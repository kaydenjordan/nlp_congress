 Madam Speaker, since November 2020, our team has  pressured the National Personnel Records Center, the agency responsible  for processing veterans' service records, to return to full staffing  levels and expedite the requests of veterans, who in some cases have  waited over a year for access to their benefits.   Most recently, the NPRC was operating at 25 percent capacity due to  the pandemic, but it said it would fully reopen this month. However,  the agency offered no plan on how it will tackle a backlog that has now  grown to 600,000 records requests. That is 100,000 more added since  June 2021.   The lack of transparency at the NPRC has made it clear that we must  pass legislation, like the RECORDS Act, to direct the NPRC to fully  reopen and report to Congress on its efforts to clear out the backlog  of records requests.   Our veterans did not hesitate to sacrifice for America, and we must  not hesitate in our duty to ensure they have a responsive government  that is attentive to their needs.                            ____________________
