 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, first, I send my heartfelt condolences to  the Bush family on the passing of former First Lady Barbara Bush.  Simply put, Mrs. Bush was the personification of grace and class as  First Lady and as a human being throughout her life. She will be missed  by people on both sides of the aisle and by all Americans.                                Foreign Policy    Mr. President, let me begin with the issue of our Nation's foreign  policy.   Over the weekend, the Ambassador to the U.N., Nikki Haley, went on  national television to announce a new round of sanctions against Russia  for enabling the brutal Assad regime to commit chemical weapons attacks  against its own people. Only 24 hours later, the White House reversed  course, and senior administration officials blamed Nikki Haley for  being ``confused.''   The word ``confused'' may, in fact, define this administration's  foreign policy. Does anyone at the White House talk to each other? Is  there a coordinated strategy or is our foreign policy completely  subject to the President's fleeting whims, changing as they do, day-to- day and moment-to-moment, often being guided by what some commentator  says on television? Unfortunately, that is what it looks like from the  outside, and it is going to put America and our interests abroad in  danger.   Predictability and consistency in foreign policy are not boring. They  are fundamental assets. It lets our allies know that we will support  them, and it lets our adversaries know that they cannot get away with  violating national norms. The erratic nature of this administration's  foreign policy, exemplified by the abrupt reversal of Nikki Haley's  announcement, is something all Americans should be worried about.   All Americans should be concerned about President Trump's disturbing  decision to pull back from sanctioning Russia for its support of Assad  and for its enabling of his use of chemical weapons in the wanton  murder of his own people. This extends a sad pattern of inconsistency  toward Russia's malign activities, both here in America and across the  globe, when what is required of this administration are more  aggressive, comprehensive, and consistent policy actions that impose on  Putin and his allies sufficient costs to change their behavior.   A second foreign policy issue is the administration's ongoing efforts  to secure a diplomatic deal with North Korea. We all want diplomacy to  succeed with North Korea. My primary concern with the President and his  efforts with respect to North Korea relate to preparation and to  discipline. We are all aware that the President makes decisions about  sensitive issues without seeking--or in spite of--expert advice.  Indeed, his decision to move forward with the North Korea summit was an  example of this type of decision making. Yet, whether or not there is  ever a time and place for this sort of  [[Page S2230]]  decision making, it is unquestionably the wrong way to approach a tense  summit between two nuclear-armed adversaries.   We should all root for a diplomatic solution to the decades-long  North Korean conflict because we know the costs of war on the Korean  Peninsula would be catastrophic. That is why the United States should  pursue a diplomatic opening, including through direct diplomacy with  Pyongyang. Yet, thus far, we have not seen any indication that North  Korea is willing to take concrete measures toward denuclearization.   We have read this book before, and I am concerned that the  administration, without its having a clear or coherent strategy, is  buying a pile of magic beans at the cost of our allies and partners and  our own security. As Secretary Gates once said, ``I'm tired of buying  the same horse twice.'' There is a diplomatic pathway forward with  North Korea. It is just not clear that President Trump is on it or  would even know how to find it or stay on it.                                    Trade    Mr. President, on another matter, trade, the President and I don't  agree on a whole lot, but on the issue of China's rapacious trading  policies, we see eye to eye. Presidents from both parties, in my  estimation, have failed to act strongly enough against the threat posed  by China. President Trump, unlike both Presidents Bush and Obama, is  finally doing something about it. I remain disappointed, however, that  the President passed up the opportunity, once again, to label China as  a currency manipulator.   Nonetheless, yesterday, a really good thing happened. The FCC voted  unanimously to advance a measure to limit the ability of Chinese  telecom companies to sell in the United States--chiefly Huawei and ZTE,  two major Chinese telecom companies. Huawei and ZTE are both state- backed companies. Their effort to enter the American market is a great  example of how China attempts to steal our private data and  intellectual property. The FCC has said that allowing these two  companies into the United States would pose a national security threat  because it would give state-backed Chinese companies ``hidden `back  doors' to our networks'' that would allow them ``to inject viruses and  other malware, steal Americans' private data, spy on U.S. businesses,  and more.'' Those are the FCC's words.   The United States is a world leader in high-tech manufacturing and  development, so, naturally, China's Government is going after that  lucrative industry and continues to try to steal its way to a  competitive advantage. Every one of our top industries that employs  millions of Americans in good-paying jobs and makes our economy the  envy of the world is targeted by the Chinese. This one is no different.   So I applaud the FCC's decision and President Trump for pursuing a  tough course of action against China and its rapacious trading  policies. The President is exactly right about China in that it seeks  to take advantage of the United States in innumerable ways by  undercutting our products, stealing our intellectual property, and  denying American companies market access. I strongly encourage the FCC  to finalize this measure, and I encourage President Trump to stick with  his tougher posture toward China.                        Legislation Before the Senate    Mr. President, finally, a note about floor action this week. The  Republicans are pushing, in succession, legislation that hurts labor  rights and working people, consumers, the environment, and communities  of color. President Trump, during his campaign, would often wonder  aloud about what these folks had to lose by voting for him. Now we  know.   The Republican majority seems intent on putting forward heavily  partisan bills that have no chance of passing or have little practical  impact but are simply designed to be divisive. That is not going to get  us anywhere, and it is turning the Senate, which all of us want to be a  deliberative, bipartisan body, into a bit of a farce this week--no  debate, no amendments.   So I suggest to my colleagues on the other side: Let's get back to  pursuing bipartisan accomplishments that actually advance the interests  of the American worker, the American consumer, and the middle class.  After all, that is what we were elected to do.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the Senate routinely reauthorizes the  Coast Guard, much like the Defense act. It shouldn't be a terribly  partisan issue. It never has been. We all deeply respect the work of  the Coast Guard and recognize the heroism of the men and women who  serve in that capacity.   But, unfortunately, the Republican majority slipped a poison pill  rider into this otherwise noncontroversial bill that would repeal part  of the Clean Water Act. That is why the Coast Guard reauthorization  bill failed today.   The rider would prohibit the EPA and the States from regulating  pollution and invasive species from the ballast water of large vessels.  Instead, it would let the Coast Guard set regulations--an agency that  doesn't have the environmental expertise of the EPA. This is a massive  change to the Clean Water Act.   The Clean Water Act has worked well for decades because the States  drive innovation and enforcement in partnership with the EPA. Under  this law, States would no longer be able to do that. The idea of  States' rights goes out the window.   I have visited many different parts of my State, in Upstate New York,  where invasive species have long plagued communities, or parts of Long  Island, where toxic chemicals and algae plague the bays and beaches.  They hurt our clamming industry severely. They hurt businesses, they  hurt tourism, and they hurt fishing as well--you name it.   We believe the rider will cost many States tens of billions of  dollars in lost economic activity. Let me repeat that. Many States will  lose tens of billions of dollars in economic activity because of this  rider.   Let me also say this about small recreational fishermen--and New York  State is third in the number of recreational pleasure boats. No one is  proposing to hurt the little guy. That is why Democrats are ready to  permanently exempt them from vessel discharge requirements.   Finally, let me make a point about progress and regular order. The  vessel discharge provisions in this bill violate the regular order of  the Senate. This is a matter under the jurisdiction of the Environment  and Public Works Committee, not the Commerce Committee. There was no  consultation with the EPW minority on this provision. There were no  hearings. Instead, the Commerce Committee inserted these provisions  into the Coast Guard reauthorization bill over the objection of many  Democrats.   So I will be offering shortly to pass a clean Coast Guard  reauthorization bill by unanimous consent. It includes a permanent  exemption from discharge requirements for small recreational fishermen.  Democrats are ready to pass this Coast Guard bill as is, without the  poison pill environmental rider.   Mr. President, as in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  that the amendment at the desk to the McConnell motion to concur with  amendment No. 2232 be called up and made in order; that the amendment  be agreed to; that the motion to concur with amendment No. 2232, as  amended, be agreed to; and that the motion to refer and all other  amendments be withdrawn.    I will not.    Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my colleague  the Republican leader in reestablishing the Senate NATO Observer Group.  In the late 1940s, under the stewardship of President Harry Truman, the  United States led our Western allies in the creation of an  unprecedented arrangement to provide for our collective defense. Since  then, NATO has guaranteed the security of our European allies and has  come to our aid, protecting the United States in its darkest hours  following the 9/11 attacks. Today, new threats are emerging from Russia  and along NATO's southern border, making the alliance more necessary  than ever. It is the responsibility of the Senate to be kept abreast of  any and all factors affecting such a key component of our national  defense.   The Senate NATO Observer group was first established in 1997 and  oversaw the enlargement of our alliance to countries recently freed  from Soviet domination in Eastern Europe. Following the reestablishment  of the group in 2002 by Majority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota and  Minority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Senate NATO Observer  group had an oversight role during the NATO mission in Afghanistan-- again, the only time a NATO member has invoked the right to collective  self-defense.   Unfortunately, since talks of further enlargement of the alliance  expired 10 years ago, the Senate Observer Group lapsed. Since that  time, Russia has reasserted itself in Eastern Europe through the  aggressive use of hybrid warfare, including cyber infiltration of our  allies' political infrastructure, as well as our own. While Georgia  considered eventual NATO membership, Russia invaded and occupied South  Ossetia and Abkhazia, regions which remain in Russian hands today. A  similar fate befell Ukraine in 2014, when Russia's ``little green men''  were inserted into a civil conflict that spilled over into a civil war  in which thousands of people died.   As we learned during the 2016 Presidential election, the Kremlin's  aggressive posture extends far beyond Russia's borders. American  intelligence agencies have shown conclusively that Russia has  interfered in elections at  [[Page S2257]]  home and abroad using a sophisticated array of cyber attacks and  disinformation to undermine confidence in the American political  process and in Western democracy writ large. Neither the United States  nor our NATO allies are immune from such attacks. That is why it is  imperative that we continue to invest in and strengthen that alliance.  Moreover, it is why the U.S. Senate must be actively involved in  ensuring that our most important alliance remains alert to the serious  issues before us.   There are several pressing issues on which the observer group will  immediately begin work on. NATO recently established a naval command  for the Atlantic, dedicated to ensuring the freedom of the seas, a  policy the United States has steadfastly upheld since the early days of  the republic. In addition to an increased focus on protecting the sea  lanes between Europe and North America, a new NATO logistics command  and a cyber operations center are being formed in response to the  continued aggressive posture of Russian forces along NATO's eastern  border. Cyber defense in particular should be of acute interest to  Senators in this group. Russian cyber attacks have damaged countries  around the world and continue to threaten critical infrastructure in  the United States. I look forward to learning how NATO will integrate  each nation's cyber defense knowledge into its own and how we might  learn from our allies about how best to protect ourselves from cyber  warfare.   This Congress began with a unanimous vote reaffirming the United  States' commitment to article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. There can  be no doubt that the Senate remains firmly committed to transatlantic  security and to countering the malign influence of a hostile Kremlin at  home and abroad. The opportunity to learn from our allies and prepare  for the future is too important. So I am glad that my colleagues  Senators Shaheen and Tillis have spearheaded the reestablishment of the  NATO Observer Group, on which they will serve as cochairs.                            ____________________
