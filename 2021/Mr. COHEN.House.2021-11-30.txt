 Mr. Speaker, President Biden is leading this country in  the right direction. He is moving us forward, but the Republicans  refuse to see it.   The Build Back Better bill will help middle class families, produce  more jobs, reduce taxes, and make costs less on prescription drugs, on  home healthcare for seniors, on childcare for working mothers, and give  them an opportunity to participate in America's economy.   President Biden led us on the bipartisan infrastructure bill.  Bipartisan? Yeah, not much. There were 17 Republicans in the Senate,  maybe 16, only 13 in the House. There is nothing partisan about getting  goods to market, about speeding up the supply chain, which happens when  you get good roads and the opportunity for trucks to travel on them,  trains to proceed, and airplanes to deliver their cargo.   President Biden is leading us in the right direction. We just have to  hope that the Senate and the Republicans here will help us in this last  month as we try to raise the debt ceiling to pay for Trump's tax scam  and to pass a budget.                            ____________________
