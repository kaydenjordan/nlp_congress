 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4374. This  provision would amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to  authorize additional emergency uses for medical products to reduce  deaths and severity of injuries caused by agents of war.   Having served as a combat surgeon in Iraq, I understand the  importance of being able to administer lifesaving treatments at a  moment's notice. Our servicemembers going into harm's way must be  confident that their corpsmen, medics, docs, and health professionals  are equipped with the latest technology to save lives every time.   Freeze-dried plasma is used during the initial resuscitation of  combat casualties. Since 2011, 24 severely injured U.S. troops have  been treated with freeze-dried plasma provided by the French, who have  used this successfully since 1994. Of those patients, 17 lives were  saved due to rapid treatment with freeze-dried plasma.   H.R. 4374 is important because it puts a process in place to broaden  the definition of military emergencies and provides the Department of  Defense with access to expedited FDA processes for the investigational  products like freeze-dried plasma.   I support Chairman Thornberry's unwavering leadership on this issue.  With rapidly developing medical technology, the FDA must be part of the  modernization and readiness of our Armed Forces. We are committed to  ensuring that the FDA does the best it can for our deployed forces, and  I hope that we can find a way to enable the FDA to consider approved  research and clinical studies from our allies in an effort to aid their  approval process.   The future will likely bring more medical devices and drugs that can  save lives. Having a process to approve and implement emerging medical  technologies is a matter of life and death, especially for our brave  troops.
