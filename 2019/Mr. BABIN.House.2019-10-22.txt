 Madam Speaker, for years America has been force-fed  investigation after investigation of our duly elected President, and we  have seen each of these sham investigations meet the same dead end  because there is no evidence of any wrongdoing by Donald Trump.   I have lost hope that these pointless probes will end. House  Democrats are bent on wasting time and taxpayer dollars. If we are all  forced to endure this charade, the least they could do is conduct a  fair investigation.   They say they have evidence to impeach the President yet refuse to  share what that evidence is. They say this is an official impeachment  inquiry, and yet we haven't voted to make it so.   Where is the transparency?   The only evidence that is crystal clear is that the Democrats despise  the President so much that they will do anything to take him down. They  hate that Donald Trump is blocking their agenda of a green, socialist,  nanny state with open borders, so they are willing to mislead the  public to get their way.   There is no due process, just hatred. It is a dangerous precedent to  our great Republic.                            ____________________
