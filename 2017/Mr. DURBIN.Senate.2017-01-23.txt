The Senator from Kansas.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today, I voted against Representative  Pompeo's confirmation as Director of the CIA. His changing statements  on the use of torture leave me no choice. His written answers to the  Senate Intelligence Committee, saying that he will consult with CIA  experts as to whether the methods in the U.S. Army Field Manual are  sufficient and, if they aren't, work with legal experts and  congressional overseers to make changes, are extremely alarming and  contradict what he told me personally when we met in my office.   Federal law now clearly prohibits torture and ``cruel, inhumane, and  degrading'' treatment of detainees and prohibits interrogation  techniques not authorized by the Army Field Manual. We cannot go  backwards on this seminal issue of human rights.   For years, I was highly critical of the CIA's detention and  interrogation program and repeatedly questioned its legality. Over 13  years ago, I authored the first legislation to make clear that the  cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment of detainees is illegal under  U.S. law in all circumstances. Today, I stood in opposition of  Representative Pompeo's confirmation to be CIA Director because, in  order to win the war on terrorism, we must remain true to the  principles upon which our country was founded.                            ____________________
