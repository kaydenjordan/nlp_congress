 Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Supporting  Essential Workers in Retirement Act with my  [[Page S755]]  colleagues Senator Brown, Senator Cassidy, and Senator Casey. Our bill  would ensure that workers who stepped up during the COVID-19 pandemic  and performed essential work in hazardous conditions, including our  first responders and critical supply chain workers, do not have their  Social Security benefits reduced for serving our country.   Semiretired workers make invaluable contributions across all sectors  of our economy. Workers who retire at age 62 may collect Social  Security benefits, but if these workers choose to continue working and  earning income, then the retirement earnings test, or RET, will reduce  the benefits they earn above a certain threshold.   I have heard from many constituents who stepped up to perform  essential work during the pandemic, only to find later that the income  they earned during that time unexpectedly put them above the statutory  RET threshold. One of my constituents, a teacher aide at an Aroostook  County elementary school, is an example of a semiretired worker who was  negatively impacted by the RET. She worked extra hours delivering meals  to children who were at home learning remotely from March through June  of 2020, and as a result she earned more than the RET threshold and had  to pay money back to the Social Security Administration. I have also  heard from semiretired nurses who agreed to work extra hours as our  hospitals were filled with COVID patients and part-time employees who  worked overtime to produce desperately needed personal protective  equipment and COVID tests. They answered the call to fulfill vital  roles when many of us were locked down in the early stages of the  pandemic.   Through no fault of their own, these workers' incomes surpassed the  RET threshold due to overtime and hazard pay. They must now pay back  thousands of dollars in benefits to the Social Security Administration  or face a temporary reduction in their benefits until the money is  recouped. Meanwhile, the money they earned during this time was to  compensate for the exceptional work performed during the pandemic, and  these semiretired essential workers did not plan or budget for a  reduction in benefits or a sudden expense. Mr. President, this is  profoundly unfair for those who aided us during a crisis.   The Supporting Essential Workers in Retirement Act would exempt  premium pay earned by essential workers during the COVID-19 pandemic  from the RET. We should incentivize essential work, not discourage it.  I encourage my colleagues to join us in supporting this bill to ensure  that those brave individuals who performed essential work in hazardous  conditions to help our country address a global pandemic are not  punished for doing so.                                  F_____                                         By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Ms. Sinema, and Mr. King):   S. 3665. A bill to authorize certain aliens seeking asylum to be  employed in the United States while their applications are being  adjudicated; to the Committee on the Judiciary.    Mr. President. I rise today to introduce the Asylum  Seeker Work Authorization Act of 2022 with my colleagues Senator Sinema  and Senator King. This legislation would allow individuals seeking  asylum to be eligible for employment authorizations starting 30 days  after applying for asylum, provided their applications are not  frivolous; they are not detained; and their identities have been  verified, with their names run through the federal--government's  terrorist watch lists. This change would allow asylum applicants to  work, support themselves, and contribute to society without being as  dependent on assistance from local governments while their claims are  being adjudicated.   Under current law, asylum seekers must wait extended periods of time  after filing their applications before they are allowed to apply for  work permits. These long waiting periods were originally adopted by the  Clinton administration--and then extended to a full year by the Trump  administration--out of concern that some migrants might apply for  asylum primarily as a means of getting a work authorization. Clearly,  this change has only transferred the burden of care for these asylum  seekers onto communities across the Nation.   One such community is Portland, ME. Over the span of several months,  a historic surge of asylum seekers has arrived in Portland after  crossing our southern border. Currently, hundreds of asylum seekers are  being housed in emergency shelters by the city of Portland. These  asylum seekers could give a much needed boost to Maine businesses that  are facing labor shortages--our State's unemployment rate is just 4.7  percent--but the lengthy work authorization process prevents these  asylum seekers from getting jobs, even to support themselves.   While the Federal Government has provided assistance to Portland and  other communities around our country dealing with a surge in asylum  seekers, it would be a better solution if those seeking asylum were  able to join the workforce and achieve self-sufficiency as quickly as  possible while awaiting the outcome of their cases.   It is my hope that the changes proposed by our bill will lessen the  burden on the budgets of communities hosting asylum seekers, while  allowing these individuals and their families to support themselves as  they want to do, bringing needed skills to the cities and towns in  which they settle. I encourage my colleagues to support it.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Supporting  Essential Workers in Retirement Act with my  [[Page S755]]  colleagues Senator Brown, Senator Cassidy, and Senator Casey.
