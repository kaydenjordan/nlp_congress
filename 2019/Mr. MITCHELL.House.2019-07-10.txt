 Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Thornberry for yielding me  time.   It has been a pleasure to be on two committees that have historically  been bipartisan, the House Armed Services and Transportation and  Infrastructure. As was indicated, historically this has been a  bipartisan bill. Last year it passed out of committee with one ``no''  vote. The Senate achieved it. It passed the Senate Armed Services  Committee unanimously, and it passed the Senate 86-8.   Yet, here we stand because, Mr. Chairman, bipartisanship is not  simply counting percentages of amendments that were brought to the  floor and passed.   There are significant issues that we are not dealing with in this  bill. While we give people an additional pay raise, a significant raise  to military, we cut funding that impacts modernization, readiness and  training, and cuts military funding $1.2 billion.   Further, the bill neglects to address something that has had  bipartisan support for a long period of time which is nuclear  readiness, our nuclear triad. Here we take a hatchet to it as well.   I stress that we must make a bipartisan effort to bring a bill to  this floor that supports our military consistently and not have  partisan politics take over our military. I support that, I reject this  bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.
