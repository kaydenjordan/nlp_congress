 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of  H.R. 5305. Keeping our government funded and functioning is a basic  responsibility of the Congress. This is must-pass legislation.   Passage will give time to finalize the fiscal year 2022 funding bills  without a government shutdown, and we should get that done as soon as  possible. As chairman of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and  Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, I want to  highlight several items in our jurisdiction.   First, the bill includes $10 billion for agricultural disaster  assistance programs to cover events in 2020 and 2021.  [[Page H5580]]  It includes $275 million for the Emergency Watershed Protection Program  to help communities address damages caused by natural disasters that  impair the watersheds.   Moreover, it ensures USDA can continue to help expand economic  opportunity, create jobs in rural areas, and fully meet the demand for  farm ownership loans. And it provides the authority and funding to  allow the Food and Nutrition Service to increase the amount of fruits  and vegetables in the WIC Food Package, increasing nutrition security  at a time when food insecurity is rampant across our country.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank the committee staffs on both the  Appropriations and the Agriculture Committees. I want to thank Chair  DeLauro, the ranking member, and the committee members for their  dedicated work on the many difficult issues addressed in this bill.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill and keep the government  open so that the programs meant to help America grow economically and  recover from natural disasters can continue to help people all across  this country.
