 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a group of veterans  who have come together to found the nonprofit American Freedom Fund.   These three patriots--Petty Officer Gabriel Stecker, Major Rob  Miller, and Lieutenant Donald Bramer, a fellow Kentuckian--have  selflessly taken on an issue that faces many of our veterans when  separated from service or returned home from operations abroad, to  include loneliness and void of community, preventable circumstances  that magnify wounds both seen and unseen.   Through the American Freedom Fund's mission of athletics, education,  and advocacy, their programs have brought hundreds of Active Reserve  and veteran servicemembers together to play softball, enjoy sporting  events, find that next career, or, more importantly, know that they are  never alone.   It is with great pleasure and pride that I commend these patriots and  the troops of volunteers that make up the American Freedom Fund for  their dedication and continued service to this Nation and its heroes.                            ____________________
