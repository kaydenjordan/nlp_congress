 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Lipinski for yielding to me.   Mr. Speaker, we are out of time to debate the reality of climate  change. Its effects are already here. Recently, each year has brought  with it record-breaking droughts, hurricanes, and natural disasters.   My home State of California just experienced our deadliest wildfire  season yet. This year alone, natural disasters will cost more than $22  billion in recovery efforts. That is why I am proud to work with my  colleague and cofounder of the Climate Solutions Caucus, Mr. Curbelo,  to introduce the bipartisan Coastal State Climate Preparedness Act,  H.R. 3533, which will help coastal States better plan for extreme  weather events and implement climate change adaptation strategies.   We can save lives, homes, and billions of tax dollars by encouraging  these vulnerable communities to prepare their infrastructure for the  impacts of climate change.   After severe weather events like Hurricanes Maria and Harvey, it is  imperative that we invest in readying our infrastructure for the next  extreme weather event. Moreover, we also need to invest in developing  renewable energy sources.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues in the House to join me and Mr.  Curbelo in this effort.
