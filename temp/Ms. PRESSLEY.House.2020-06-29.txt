 Mr. Speaker, I thank Madam Chair for her leadership at  such a time as this.   Two months ago, I stood before my colleagues in this Chamber sounding  the alarms that, without immediate relief, millions in our communities  would face housing instability and eviction.  [[Page H2658]]    Today I rise once more to remind us all that, in only 2 days, the  rent is due. In my district, Massachusetts Seventh, 30 percent of  families have missed a rent payment during the pandemic--30 percent.   Our families, in particular Black families, are on the edge of an  eviction tsunami just as the renter protections put in place through  the CARES Act are due to expire next month.   A report released yesterday by City Life/Vida Urbana found that 78  percent of all evictions filed in Boston before evictions were banned  statewide were in census tracts where the majority of residents are  people of color.   This is an issue of racial, economic, and health justice.   Housing is a critical determinant of public health, as evidenced by  the disproportionately high infection rate amongst our neighbors  experiencing homelessness. I am proud that this bill includes my Public  Health Emergency Shelter Act and will provide more than $11 billion in  funding for rapid rehousing and efforts to improve the health and  safety of those experiencing homelessness.   We must support this critical legislation and affirm our commitment  to housing as a human right and housing as a form of justice.
