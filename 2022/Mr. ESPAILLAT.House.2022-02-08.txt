 Madam Speaker, I rise today because my district is  hurting. Washington Heights-Inwood is  [[Page H1018]]  hurting because they saw how Officer Jason Rivera was taken away from  us. A 22-year old son of Inwood was taken away from us by gun violence  when he responded to a family dispute.   But Harlem also is hurting because both Officers Rivera and Mora  patrolled the 32nd precinct in Harlem, and they were both brutally shot  and killed in the village of Harlem.   Madam Speaker, East Harlem is hurting because we saw how a young  woman, Kristal Bayron-Nieves, who worked in a Burger King, was shot and  killed. Even though she gave the money from the register to the person  that held up the Burger King at gunpoint, she was still brutally shot  and killed--19 years old.   Madam Speaker, finally, the Bronx part of my district is also hurting  because an 11-month-old child, just before she turned 1, sat in the car  with her mother and was shot in the face. All of this happened within  two weeks of each other.   So my district is hurting as we bury these two young police officers,  22 and 27 years old, of Dominican heritage, the first in their family  to serve the Police Department. So gun violence is running rampant. And  we see how many talk about law and order, but when it comes to gun  violence, they are still in the pocket of the NRA; and they won't dare  challenge the NRA.   So I rise because my district is hurting. And we are supportive of  Mayor Adams' plan of precision policing, which has identified 700  people that have been involved in 1,700 acts of violence involving an  illegal weapon. We understand that much more has to be invested in ATF;  so we cut off the iron pipeline that brings weapons to the corner of my  district from South Carolina, North Carolina, and Georgia. But we also  have to invest 50 million in summer youth jobs. We have to invest more  money to have the violence interrupters be part of the resolution of  this violence ripping our communities across the country.   We must all work together to resolve this epidemic of gun violence.  We must pass the package of gun laws that we have here on this floor,  including ghost guns, which continue to play an increased role in the  death of people across the country, circumventing background checks and  other restrictions that must be put in place to keep guns away from  people's hands.    Madam Speaker, I urge my House colleagues to join me today for a  minute of silence in the memory of Officer Rivera and Officer Mora. And  in support of their two families, we join them, and we will always be  by their side.   Madam Speaker, I ask for a minute of silence.                            ____________________
