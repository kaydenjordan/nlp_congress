 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the  Stewartville High School Tigers on winning this year's Minnesota Class  3A high school football championship.   Stewartville capped off an undefeated season with their 43-13 victory  over Annandale in the State championship game on November 25 at the  U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis.   While this marks the third time the Tigers have made it to the State  finals, this year's win earned them the first-ever championship title  in Stewartville's history.   The Tigers finished their 2023 season with a perfect 14-0 record, and  all of us across the First Congressional District are incredibly proud  to call them our own.   Congratulations to Coach Mueller, his team, and the entire  Stewartville community on this well-deserved title.   Way to go, Tigers.                            ____________________
