 Mr. Speaker, on October 2nd, on rollcall votes 544 and  545, I was not present because I was tending to my community in Las  Vegas, in the aftermath of the deadliest mass shooting in United States  history. Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall  vote 544 and ``yea'' on rollcall vote 545.                            ____________________
