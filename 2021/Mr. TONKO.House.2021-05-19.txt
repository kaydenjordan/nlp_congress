 Mr. Speaker, we must act swiftly and with boldness to  renew America's failing water systems.   We know the heartache of failing water systems all too well: lead,  PFAS, disruptive water main breaks, and unaffordable bills.   Yesterday, I introduced bold national drinking water legislation,  written with my friend, the chair of the Committee on Energy and  Commerce, Frank Pallone, to restore America's most critical  infrastructure, and one of our most basic responsibilities of  government, our drinking water systems.   The AQUA Act delivers on President Joe Biden's promise to remove  every lead service line in the country, including removing lead from  the drinking water systems of some 400,000 schools and childcare  centers.   Our bill invests heavily in the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund,  to put resources in the hands of folks on the ground who know what  their communities need.   It delivers a financial lifeline to local water systems in return for  a multi-year commitment that they will not shut off anyone's water  because of financial hardship during this devastating and prolonged  pandemic.   Let's rise to meet the moment. Let's do our jobs. Let's build back  the right way so every American can use and trust the water coming out  of our taps.                            ____________________
