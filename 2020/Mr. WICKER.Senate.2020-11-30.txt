 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the nomination  of Taylor Brantley McNeel for the U.S. District Court for the Southern  District of Mississippi. We will vote in a few minutes on the first  vote for this outstanding nominee, the cloture vote, and then I have  every reason to believe that tomorrow, this outstanding candidate will  be confirmed for elevation to the U.S. District Court of the Southern  District of Mississippi.   Sometimes when we vote, those confirmation votes are party-line  votes. I think, happily, many times they are bipartisan. Based on  conversations across the aisle, I have every reason to believe that the  vote on Taylor McNeel will, in fact, be bipartisan. I certainly hope it  will be because his support back home in Mississippi is certainly  bipartisan and multicultural because he is such an outstanding  individual and such an outstanding attorney and an outstanding member  of our State community.   Taylor McNeel's life has been marked by excellence at every point. Of  course, he is a great lawyer. He is a partner in the law firm of  Brunini, Grantham, Grower & Hewes, where he oversees the gulf coast  office for this large law firm. Taylor McNeel has led a distinguished  career in the firm, with extensive experience in both bench and jury  trials in Federal and State courts. He has served as lead counsel for  numerous appeals to the Mississippi Supreme Court, the Mississippi  Court of Appeals, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.  His clients include individuals, government entities, and businesses  covering a vast range of law.   I believe Senators should be impressed also by his work on behalf of  disadvantaged members of our community back home. He maintains a strong  pro bono practice, representing clients who would not normally be able  to afford legal services. I think he is to be commended for that.   His academic credentials are impeccable. He was a cum laude graduate  from the University of Mississippi, where he received his undergraduate  degree. As an undergraduate, he was an outstanding athlete as well as  leader. He was a member of the Ole Miss Rebel football team and was  elected senior class president of that outstanding university.   He went on to receive his juris doctor degree cum laude from the  University of Mississippi School of Law, where he served on the  Mississippi Law Journal.   Taylor McNeel has been widely recognized as a young lawyer to watch.  He has been named a Mid-South Rising Star in business litigation for 8  years in a row and has been listed 3 years in a row in the 40 & Under  Hot List for the United States in benchmark litigation. Is it any  wonder, then, that he has received a unanimous ``qualified'' rating by  the American Bar Association? Of course, we know that the highest  rating a candidate for district judge can receive is the rating of  ``qualified,'' and the fact that this was done unanimously by the  committee--it just doesn't get any better than that for a candidate for  district judge.   It is important to note also that Mr. McNeel is an outstanding and  active member in his community and is widely respected there. He serves  on the school board of the Pascagoula-Gautier School District. I might  add that is a racially diverse school district. He is an elder in his  church, First Presbyterian Church in Pascagoula, and he has been a  member of the Rotary Club of Biloxi.   Pascagoula is in Jackson County, where he is an outstanding citizen.  Biloxi is in Harrison County, and he is a  [[Page S7102]]  leader there. They are two of our most populous counties in the State  of Mississippi, and he stands head and shoulders above the crowd in  both of those.   He has been president of the Harrison County Bar Association and  holds memberships in the American Inns of Court, the Federal Bar  Association, Fifth Circuit Bar Association, and the Federalist Society.   Taylor and his wife Jessica have three children: Mollie, age 10;  Taylor, age 7; and Brantley Rose, born on the 2nd day of this month.   He has his hands full. I think he will be able to balance being a dad  as well as a district judge. He has outstanding qualifications in the  academic field, the judicial field, and his personal qualifications are  absolutely out of this world. I am confident he will serve the Southern  District of Mississippi and our country well if confirmed.   We will vote on cloture in a few moments. Again, I am sincerely  hoping and believe we will--based on conversations--have a bipartisan  vote, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting yes on the  confirmation of Taylor McNeel.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I have a request for one committee to meet  during today's session of the Senate. It has the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.   Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committee is authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:                        committee on foreign relations    The Committee on Foreign Relations is authorized to meet during the  session of the Senate on Monday, November 30, 2020, at 6 p.m., to  conduct a closed hearing.                            ____________________
