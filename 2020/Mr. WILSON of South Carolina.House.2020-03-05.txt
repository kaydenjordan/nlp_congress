 Mr. Speaker, this was a winning weekend  for basketball in South Carolina.   On Saturday, both the boys and girls Cardinal Newman High School  basketball teams won their State titles, and this past Sunday, the  University of South Carolina women's basketball team won the  Southeastern Conference Championship. Both Cardinal Newman teams fought  until the end to accomplish these impressive wins.   Congratulations to girls' coach Molly Moore and boys coach Philip  Deter on their successful leadership. The Cardinal Newman girls won  over Northwood, and the boys won against Trinity-Byrnes.   Congratulations to the University of South Carolina Women's  Basketball Head Coach of the Year, Dawn Staley, on leading number one  South Carolina to its program-record 23rd straight win. USC women have  a perfect record of 16-0 in the Southeastern Conference this season.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.   Mark Levin is correct. Senator Schumer should be reprimanded for  threatening bodily harm to Supreme Court Justices.                            ____________________
