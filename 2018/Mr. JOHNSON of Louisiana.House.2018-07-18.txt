 Mr. Speaker, I am honored to rise today to  speak to the success in Louisiana's Fourth Congressional District that  we have seen since the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   Every skeptic, even the early skeptics of tax reform, saw near  immediate benefits when the IRS adjusted their withholding tables and  it resulted in bigger paychecks for more than 90 percent of Americans.   Now we are 7 months out, and after the enactment of the Tax Cuts and  Jobs Act, the results are undeniable. Nearly every economic indicator,  whether you are talking about the unemployment rate or wages or job  creation, is showing record growth; and because of this tax reform,  more than 1 million jobs have already been created and more than 4  million Americans have received increased wages or bonuses.   The average tax cut in Louisiana for a family of four was more than  $1,700. That is not crumbs. That is real money for the people in my  district, and it provides them with greater flexibility to save for the  future.   Real benefits for real people, that is what tax reform delivered. I  look forward to many more success stories because of this historic  legislation                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now  adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 11 o'clock and 3 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, July 19, 2018, at 9 a.m.                            ____________________
