 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember Sergeant First  Class Bailey Gillespie, who lived in Rutherford County in my district  and passed away on April 11.   Sergeant Gillespie was a member of the 27th Infantry Regiment during  the Korean war. In November 1950, he was captured. He spent the next  2\1/2\ years as a POW.   During this time, he was tortured, starved, and nearly died. He was  the last POW survivor of the 27th Regiment. Throughout, he kept his  faith in God.   Sergeant Gillespie survived and returned home victorious. For many  veterans, talking about their experiences is painful, but Sergeant  Gillespie spoke about it frequently. He helped other veterans heal. He  also became one of Rutherford County's most active citizens, a leader  in every sense of the word.   To his beloved wife of 70 years, Joy, I extend condolences and thanks  from a grateful Nation.                            ____________________
