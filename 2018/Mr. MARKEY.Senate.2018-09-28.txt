 Mr. President, today I would like to honor the  Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts--the oldest  chartered military organization in the Western Hemisphere--on its 381st  Fall Field Day Tour of Duty. Its charter was signed in 1638 by John  Winthrop, then-Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. The Ancient  and Honorables continue to serve the Commonwealth as a vital part of  its militia, subject to the direction of the adjutant general of the  Massachusetts National Guard.   Although the Ancient and Honorables have long served as the honor  guard for the Governor of the Commonwealth, they continue to play an  integral role in the State's civic rituals. Among their  responsibilities, they participate in the inaugurals of State  constitutional officers, the annual State of the Commonwealth address,  and the yearly celebration of the Constitution of the United States  from the historic State house in the heart of old Boston, but most  importantly, they stand ready to assist in times of peril or emergency.   May the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts long  continue its role in fostering, supporting, and preserving the civic  life of the city of Boston, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the  United States of America. The Ancients serve as world ambassadors of  the United States, where, on their Fall Field Day Tour of Duty, they  pay their respects to fallen soldiers of all nations who have paid the  ultimate sacrifice in defense of freedom.   Today I would like to recognize the Ancient and Honorable Artillery  Company of Massachusetts for their civic responsibilities, patriotic  duties, and community service. May they continue their proud traditions  for many years to come.                            ____________________
