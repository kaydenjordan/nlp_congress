 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1941, H.R. 1146, and  H.R. 205, three bills which will prevent oil and gas leasing on our  Outer Continental Shelf, in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge  and near Florida's Gulf Coast.   In 1969, America suffered a disastrous oil spill off Santa Barbara.  Two decades later, Exxon Valdez devastated Prince William Sound. In  2010, Deepwater Horizon ravaged the Gulf of Mexico.   When will we learn? How much more of our coastline will have to be  ruined? How many more local economies will be shattered? How many more  lives will be lost?   Republican and Democratic officials oppose the administration's  expanded drilling plans. They know the health, environmental, and  economic costs of oil spills and that those accidents occur thousands  of times each year. There is no reason to take such risks, especially  when we have cleaner, safer ways of producing the energy we need.   I applaud Representatives Cunningham, Huffman, and Rooney for  offering this legislation to protect our planet and in the spirit of  Pennsylvania's Constitution, which guarantees the people the right to  clean air, clean water, and the preservation of our natural aesthetic.   I urge Members to support these bills. And I, too, say God bless  America this day and all days.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman, Representative  Maloney, for all her dedication, and I thank her for naming me to share  a few remarks.   I am a new Representative from Pennsylvania, neighbor to New Jersey,  but I spend an awful lot of time in New Jersey, and our whole area was  affected.   Eighteen years ago, planes crashed into the Twin Towers, the  Pentagon, and a Pennsylvania field near Shanksville. September 11  slammed into our national consciousness and has reverberated ever  since.   We lost family, friends, neighbors, coworkers--losses that are  immeasurable. We might have lost more, but on that day, our first  responders rushed toward danger, rescued survivors, and then spent  months cleaning up the wreckage.   That blend of sorrow and courage was on display again in June, when  first responders encouraged Congress to reauthorize the 9/11 Victim  Compensation Fund.   Detective Luis Alvarez told me: ``I'm doing okay, but there are  others out there who aren't doing okay.'' Before Detective Alvarez died  a few weeks later, he said: ``The government has to act like first  responders . . . put politics aside and let's get this bill done.''   Ultimately, we did so--through the might and strength of Carolyn  Maloney, I might add--naming our bill for him, Luis Alvarez, and other  heroes.   In the spirit of Detective Alvarez, let us continue to do so, working  together with decency and respect. That is how we will honor those we  lost; that is how we will honor those we continue to lose; and that is  how we will honor all of those who continue to grieve.
