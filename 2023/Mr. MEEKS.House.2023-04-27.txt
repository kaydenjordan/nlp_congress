 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H. Con. Res. 30.   This resolution was drafted in such a way that it is simultaneously  overbroad and underinclusive. The resolution fails to end our  involvement in hostilities in the region while preventing crucial  security cooperation with local partners in Somalia.   The resolution states that the United States forces must withdraw  from Somalia, unless they are there for the purposes of protecting the  Embassy.   Historically, war powers resolutions such as this are thought of as  attempting to force the President to withdraw American troops from a  foreign country that are actively engaged in combat, but our forces on  the ground in Somalia are there to provide security training and  intelligence support.   Our footprint in Somalia is not large. We have several hundred troops  stationed in the country primarily to train host-nation troops in  countering terrorism.   The sponsor of this legislation sometimes references the lost blood  and  [[Page H2058]]  treasure from our overseas engagements. These are obviously essential  considerations. It is why I supported President Biden's decision to end  the war in Afghanistan. But no American has been killed in Somalia in  over 4 years, and our security cooperation and assistance to the  country amounts to a rounding error in the Federal budget.   It is a fact that Al-Shabaab and other terrorist organizations like  ISIS control large swaths of territory in Somalia, but local forces  from the Somali Government and the African Union Transition Mission in  Somalia have made steady gains the past several years. United States  forces have been instrumental in some of these changes because of the  very training and intelligence support we provide to local forces on  the ground.   By mandating that our forces cease security cooperation in Somalia,  this resolution would roll back some of the gains that have been made  to take back territory from terrorist organizations in the past several  years.   This measure doesn't end American hostilities in the region. It  includes nothing about removing American forces from other nations in  the region where groups like Al-Shabaab operate, and it does nothing to  address over-the-horizon strikes.   While I disagree with this measure, let me say that what I do agree  with is that we are having this debate. It is one that is long overdue.  American forces have been in Somalia and other parts of the world  without proper engagement from the United States Congress.   While I understand the logic that both Republican and Democratic  administrations have used to include groups like Al-Shabaab under the  2001 AUMF, I can tell you that Members of Congress did not believe that  they were authorizing force against Al-Shabaab when we passed the  legislation decades ago. I can tell you this not just because I was  here when Congress voted on that AUMF but because Al-Shabaab didn't  even exist in September 2001.   I believe, though, that the proper way to address the issues of  matters of war and peace in Somalia is not through a legally dubious  resolution such as this. I agree with Representative James in this, and  we should work together, all three of us, I believe, because the right  way to address this issue is through a repeal of the 2001 AUMF and its  replacement with a narrow force authorization that provides the  President authority to combat selected terrorists in selected countries  where the United States' national security is at stake.   Mr. Speaker, I have introduced just such a resolution, and I look  forward to working with my colleagues on that. H.J. Res. 52, which  narrows the list of terrorist organizations the executive branch can  strike, limits the number of countries in which we could engage in  hostilities, places curbs on executive branch additions of associated  forces and successor groups, and includes a sunset requiring Congress  to reauthorize the legislation.                                time  1245    Reasserting Congress' proper role over matters of war and peace while  ensuring that the President has the necessary authorities to strike  those who mean to do us harm can be and is a tough balance to strike. I  believe wholeheartedly it is our responsibility to make some of those  hard decisions. We cannot punt it or give it off just to the executive.  I am willing to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  strike a balance.   Let's take a look at H.J. Res. 52. From the debate we are having  today, I think that we have some of the basics of what we agree with,  that it is this body that the Constitution empowered to make sure there  are checks and balances on the executive.   Unfortunately, I cannot say that about H. Con. Res. 30 before us  today. Therefore, I must oppose this legislation, urge my colleagues to  do the same. Let's come together as Members of the United States House  of Representatives and take our responsibility. Let's repeal and  replace the 2001 AUMF and move forward.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me just say, this debate is long overdue. We happen  to be talking about the AUMF. I would hope that we end up having more  debates on this floor talking about the continent of Africa, who has  long been left off the debate in the United States Congress, which is a  continent that we have got to focus on. I look forward to working with  Mr. James as the chair of that subcommittee.   We need to focus on the stability of Africa, the stability of its  governments and its institutions, because if we don't, it is at our own  danger. We should be doing it because it is the right thing. We should  be listening to those allies that we have on the continent and to those  Presidents, because  [[Page H2060]]  they are the ones who are at threat and in danger of being destroyed by  terrorist groups who have now moved over the continent.   We have got to have this debate more and more and make sure that  Africa is on our front burner, not our back burner. Because if Africa  continues to be on our back burner, we will see Russia and China, as  Mr. James has indicated, and others jumping in. We will see Wagner  coming in to secure these countries. Let's have this debate.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms.  Omar), who came to the United States from the continent of Africa.                                time  1300     Mr. Speaker, I want to clarify for Mr. Mills that when I  mentioned we had not had any deaths in Somalia, I said in the last 4  years. I was acknowledging what happened before. In the last 4 years we  have not lost any American troops in Somalia.   Let me also say, as I said earlier, I am happy that we are having  this debate and talking about the continent of Africa. If we do that,  we have to listen to the African--I can just recall, and sometimes many  of my colleagues, especially on the other side of the aisle, argue that  we don't get the votes we need at times in the U.N. from African  countries.   I recall when we were trying to get votes in regard to Russia's  illegal invasion into Ukraine, and I had to call on African  ambassadors. They said: Now you are calling? We haven't heard from the  United States for a while. Now you want something from me?                                time  1315    We have been asking for assistance in regard to security, and then I  watched to see what was taking place when we looked at our diplomacy.  It took over two decades before, in the 117th Congress, we passed a  State Department authorization bill, and we had to do that through the  NDAA as opposed to saying we were going to stand strongly on diplomacy.   Guess what China did during that period of time? They doubled their  diplomacy budget.   Guess what else is happening? For the first time, China has more  consulates than the United States of America.   General Kelly said that either we do and get engaged in more  diplomacy, or we are going to have to spend more money on bullets.   We have an opportunity to engage and listen to allies and work with  our allies. Many allies have more, and should have more, responsibility  on the continent because they colonized it and are working with us  collectively to try to make sure that the Chinas and the Russias of the  world are not invested and that we are invested, and we are not.   It is our challenge, and I hope that when we get past this debate, we  will be able to have another one. I look forward to doing it,  particularly in our committee, so that we can figure out collectively,  as Ms. Ilhan Omar said, how we can work together and listen to make  sure that we have an overall strategy.   I say this in regard to both parties. I say this to the  administration that should be doing more on the continent of Africa.   So, yes, this is not a partisan debate. This is an American debate.  This is an opportunity to be attentive to a continent that is the  fastest growing and the youngest on this planet but that we have  ignored for far too long.   We have to wake up and do more for the continent of Africa and figure  out diplomacy, figure out how we can help protect them from being  victimized by terrorism, and figure out how we can strengthen  institutions.   We have a lot of work to do. We have to figure out how we reauthorize  AGOA, figure out how we work with the African Union, and figure out how  we work with the African organizations. That is our challenge because,  if not, we imperil ourselves.   I could agree that this is not just an investment in the continent;  it is an  [[Page H2062]]  investment for America and America's leadership.   Let's lead.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas  (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for the  purpose of closing.   I, again, oppose this resolution because it is not an effective or  constitutionally sound approach to resolving the war powers questions  in Somalia that many of us here are, in fact, looking to address.   This resolution will harm U.S. interests in the Horn of Africa and  make the American people less safe.   Mr. Speaker, I say to my colleagues who are serious about asserting  Congress' constitutional role on issues of war and peace: I have some  encouragement from this debate that we will have further debates  talking about Congress' responsibility.   I look forward to joining with the gentleman from Florida where I  heard him talk about how climate change is affecting many of the areas  on the continent. I look forward to working with him in that regard.   I look forward to working with him and hope that we can get the  Speaker to bring over the repeal of the AUMF of 2002 that the Senate  recently has voted on that we passed 2 years ago in the 117th Congress.  I will come out of here looking at some areas on which we can work  collectively.   I urge the gentleman to join me to talk and work so that we can  repeal and replace the 2001 AUMF with a narrower and time-bound scope.   The issues we are discussing here today are pressing and relevant,  but there is a better approach. I look forward to undertaking that  approach with both of my colleagues on the floor and all of my  colleagues on a bipartisan basis and hope that we will have this  conversation and work closely together.   Let me also make a correction. I gave credit to General Kelly on the  statement of if we don't put more money into diplomacy, we have got to  spend more on bullets. That was General James Mattis. I want to make  sure I give proper credit to the proper person in our military.   Let's work together. I think we have a real window of opportunity.  The President of South Korea, who just gave a wonderful speech here,  talked about how we won World War II and the Korean war together with  our allies, saving democracies, putting our values first. Let's do it.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this  resolution, and let's work together in a bipartisan manner,  particularly to help the continent of Africa, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
