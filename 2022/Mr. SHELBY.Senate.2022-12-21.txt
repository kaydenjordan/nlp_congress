 Madam President, I am pleased to speak today about       the profound impact of Mr. James W. Rane, a fellow Alabamian with many       contributions to our great country and my home State of Alabama.        Jimmy has had an impressive career as a renowned businessman. Jimmy       is            [[Page S9778]]            the chairman, president, and CEO of Great Southern Wood Holdings, a       company with a diverse portfolio operating in the areas of building       supplies production, manufacturing and distribution, sawmill       operations, and transportation and logistics through trucking       operations.        Among the family of companies is Great Southern Wood Preserving, the       producers of YellaWood pressure-treated pine products. In 1970, after       acquiring a single facility with a few pieces of equipment in his       hometown, Jimmy Rane started his company. Today, Great Southern Wood       Preserving and its subsidiaries operate in 37 distribution locations       from the Florida Keys to Texas to Canada, as well as much of the       Caribbean and Latin America, and part of the European Union,       Mediterranean region, and China.        Born in 1946, Jimmy grew up in Henry County in southeast Alabama. He       attended Auburn University where he received a bachelor of science       degree in business administration and graduated from the Cumberland       School of Law at Samford University. Later, he successfully completed       multiple business related programs at the Harvard Business School.        Jimmy is actively involved in many civic and educational       organizations. He serves on the board of trustees of Auburn University       and his local church and is on the board of directors of the Henry       County Historical Group. He is also an honorary member of the Auburn       Letterman's Association. From 1973-1977, Jimmy Rane served as a Henry       County judge and is a member of both the Alabama Bar Association and       the American Bar Association. In 2009, he was inducted into the Alabama       Independent School Hall of Fame. Jimmy was named by the Alabama       Broadcasters Association as its Citizen of the Year in 2014.       Additionally, he was named by the Dothan Landmarks Foundation, Inc., as       the recipient of its 2017 Heritage Award, and he was recognized by the       Boy Scouts of America Greater Alabama Council in March 2018 as a Heart       of the Eagle honoree. He serves on the Alabama Heritage Foundation       board of directors and is a member of the International Institute of       Strategic Studies.        A long-time advocate for the positive role of sports in developing       character and leadership lessons, Jimmy was selected by the Alabama       Sports Hall of Fame as their 2018 Distinguished American Sportsman and       was inducted into the organization during an April 2018 ceremony. In       May 2018, he received the Johnny Stallings Award, recognizing his work       on behalf of those with special needs.        Additionally, as the president of his foundation, Jimmy actively       works to raise money to fund college scholarships for deserving       students. More than 560 students have received college scholarships       since its inception in 2000.        Jimmy's business acumen and his commitment to giving back to his       community are to be commended. I appreciate all that he has done on       behalf of Alabama and the many ways he has shared his success with       others. Jimmy will leave Alabama better than he found it, and for that,       I am grateful.                                      ____________________
