 Mr. Speaker, bipartisanship is often applauded in  Congress, but seldom rewarded. Let me repeat that. Bipartisanship is  often applauded, but seldom rewarded, which is an important part of why  we have been unable to pass any meaningful immigration reform in this  body for years.   I have worked with good men and women on the other side of the aisle  on many occasions to advance immigration reform, but none of those  efforts forced the Speaker of the House, whoever he or she was at the  time, to allow a vote, except for the time the House passed the DREAM  Act in 2010.   I continue to work with partners on the other side, because I know if  a vote is allowed, those who see immigrants and immigration as  important assets to this country will prevail. It will take Democrats  and Republicans working together to enact commonsense immigration  reform.   Just this week, the gentleman from Colorado, Republican  Mike  Coffman, and I worked together to demand statistics from the Department  of Homeland Security to determine if the Trump administration is  complying with Federal court orders on the renewal of DACA  applications, and to get more information on the DACA processing  backlogs.   Working with Republicans doesn't win me many friends among Democrats,  who spend their days trying to defeat people like Mr. Coffman. They  would probably prefer I stop working with him. As I said,  bipartisanship is often praised, but seldom rewarded.   Secondly, bipartisanship is more than just signing your name.   Jeff Denham of California and some other Republicans are promoting an  idea that has a great deal of merit: the so-called ``Queen of the  Hill'' rule, which has almost 50 Republican cosponsors and all the  Democrats, myself included.   This rule calls for a debate and votes in the House on a series of  immigration reform bills, some of which would address the vulnerability  of Dreamers and their families to deportation. It is an unprecedented  bipartisan action to demand an immigration vote, and I support it  wholeheartedly. But so far, all the Republicans have had to do is sign  their names as cosponsors. The next step should be that we demand that  Speaker Ryan bring the rule and related bills to the floor for a vote  through a discharge petition.   You see, working with people from the other side of the aisle is just  one aspect of bipartisanship. When the rubber meets the road is when  you take on the leaders of your own party in order to achieve a  bipartisan goal.   When I got arrested protesting President Obama's treatment of  Dreamers and migrants, I didn't win any popularity contest with the  Democratic Caucus. My colleagues were quick to defend the President and  the Democratic Speaker at the time. I was shunned and passed over many  times by my own team.   Later, when I and other Democrats worked with Judge Carter, Sam  Johnson, and Raul Labrador to find bipartisan immigration solutions in  the 113th Congress, Members of my own party told me to stay away. Right  here on this floor they told me: ``Don't help Republicans solve their  immigration problem.''   But I didn't stay away. I kept working with the Republicans, until  they walked away. They were unwilling to take on their own party in the  end. Speaker Boehner backed away when the chips were down.   Speaker Ryan came to my district in Chicago and talked about moving  forward on immigration, with me standing by his side. We are still  waiting for him to put skin in the game. That is what it will take:  taking a courageous position, even in the face of opposition from your  own party.    So the 48 Republicans who joined Mr. Denham's ``Queen of the Hill''  rule calling for immigration votes should not declare mission  accomplished just yet. Your country needs you right now, today. We need  your courage, in addition to your signature. Sign a discharge petition  to bring about the vote on immigration solutions for Dreamers. That  puts your skin in the game. You may not get invited to the next state  dinner or fly on Air Force One, but you will have done a service to  your Nation.   A discharge petition on the Denham bill says you are willing to  expend your personal reputation and political capital to do what is  right and what is necessary in a time of great hatred and divisiveness  at the highest levels over immigrants, refugees, and asylum seekers.   Will you be praised for your bipartisan courage? I hope so.   Will you be rewarded by other politicians or activists in your own  party, or voters in mine? Probably not.   Which is exactly my point. It is hard, it is thankless, but your  country needs help that only Republicans in Congress can provide: put  pressure on your own Republican leadership. I, and a lot of my  colleagues, will work with you, stand by you, support you, but we need  you to lead the way.                            ____________________
