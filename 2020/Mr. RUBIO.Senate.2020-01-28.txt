 Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Committee  on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I honor a small  business that demonstrates America's unique entrepreneurial spirit. I  am pleased to recognize a business for its participation in Florida's  integral economy and its involvement in the community. Today, it is my  pleasure to name Hull's Seafood of Ormond Beach, FL, as the Senate  Small Business of the Week.   Jimmy Hull, owner of Hull's Seafood, spent his childhood exploring  and catching fresh fish at Ponce Inlet. At 20 years old, he obtained  his captain's license, began running fishing charters, and selling the  day's catch to local markets. Eventually, Hull's Seafood opened its  doors in 1984. This restaurant and market makes a conscious effort to  support sustainability by only selling fresh-caught, local seafood.  They guarantee each of their customer's seafood is of the highest  quality. Over the years, Jimmy and his team have continued to expand  the business. Led by Jimmy's strategic vision, Hull's Seafood has  evolved from a small take-out kitchen into a full-service restaurant  and market. In 2018, Hull's Seafood received support from the city of  Ormond Beach, which provided a building improvement grant designed to  assist local small businesses. Jimmy was able to more than triple the  size of the restaurant and double the number of employees, adding an  additional forty workers.   Today, Hull's Seafood Market and Restaurant continues to supply  customers and other local restaurants with the freshest seafood  available. After operating in Ormond Beach for nearly 40 years, the  restaurant has become a landmark within the community and a gathering  place for local residents. Located on Ormond Beach's downtown Main  Street, Hull's Seafood is active within its community, participating in  many city events and supporting local artists by hosting concerts and  displaying art in the restaurant dining room. Additionally, Hull's  Seafood makes a point of showcasing other local businesses on their  social media pages. Jimmy stays true to his passion and is a commercial  fisherman who also operates the restaurant's charter boat to take  passengers on fishing trips. In 2018, Jimmy was awarded the Governor's  Business Ambassador Award for the restaurant's continuous effort to  create local jobs. Jimmy and his team was commended for his advocacy  for fisheries and helping to maintain their sustainability in Florida.   Hull's Seafood is an excellent example of a community and family  oriented small business. The entire team's efforts toward  sustainability and providing high quality seafood do not go unnoticed.  I am proud to recognize Jimmy and everyone at Hull's Seafood for their  hard work, and I look forward to seeing their future successes.  Congratulations again on being named the Senate Small Business of the  Week.                            ____________________
