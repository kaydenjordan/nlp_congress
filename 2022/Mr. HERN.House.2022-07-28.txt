 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, a member of my  delegation and my colleague, Mr. Lucas, for his leadership on this  bill. No one has worked harder on this issue, and the fact that he is  willing to stand up against it today is a testament to the importance  of stopping the build back broke plan.   America is in crisis. Even Obama's economic advisers agree that  wasteful government spending is what got us into this mess. And yet,  the Democrats continue to push for more.   We are staring down the barrel of another useless, wasteful build  back broke plan that will only make our problems worse.   We should not pass one more bill on this floor until we see a bill  than reins in government spending, lowers taxes, unleashes American  energy, and gets Americans back to work.   When the government spends more, the American people have less. The  time to fight is now. I hope all of my colleagues will join me in  opposition to this legislation.
