 Mr. Speaker, on May 15, I joined several of my  colleagues from the House and Senate, officials from USDA, Ambassadors  to the United States, and 150 volunteers at a meal packaging event  hosted by the nonprofit organization Rise Against Hunger and The Kraft  Heinz Company. Together, we packaged 20,000 meals that will be sent to  Mozambique and distributed to families through a school feeding program  in that country.   I admire the incredible efforts of Rise Against Hunger, under the  leadership of Rod Brooks, in hosting meal packaging events like this  one I attended on Capitol Hill a few weeks ago. Last year alone, Rise  Against Hunger served 1.4 million people in 74 countries across the  globe as they worked toward the important goal of ending global hunger  by 2030.   I also applaud the work of Kraft Heinz in advancing its laudable goal  of delivering 1 billion meals to those struggling with hunger by 2021.  Kraft Heinz CEO Bernardo Hees, Board Vice Chairman John Cahill, and  Board Member George Zoghbi traveled to D.C. to lead the event, and I am  grateful for their commitment to ending hunger once and for all.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Georgia  (Mr. Woodall) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, this rule is a study in contradictions from my  Republican colleagues. They have brought up H.R. 8, the Water Resources  Development Act. This is an incredibly important bill to improve our  Nation's ports, locks, dams, and more all across the country. It is a  bipartisan bill, and it was the product of a process that shows how  Congress is supposed to work.   Hearings were held, and thoughtful testimony was given, including  from the head of the Army Corps of Engineers. There was a markup. Input  and ideas were heard from Members on both sides. Remarkably, a majority  of amendments offered were adopted en bloc by a voice vote without much  controversy.   That is important to note, Mr. Speaker, because Republicans these  days aren't known for their lack of controversy. Just this week the  President of the United States is talking about pardoning himself of  possible Federal crimes. His lawyer is floating wild theories about how  the President could shoot his former FBI Director without facing  prosecution while in office.   So this bipartisan bill and the mostly collaborative process that got  us here came as welcome relief--until this bill got to the Rules  Committee. That is when Republican leaders ran into a back room  somewhere and took out a bipartisan amendment from the ranking member  of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Congressman  DeFazio. The amendment would reform the harbor maintenance trust fund  to make sure money gets where it needs to go: to actually maintaining  our harbors.   They did this without any debate and despite the fact that both the  chairman and ranking member of the committee supported it. The  gentleman from Georgia says he is on the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee, and he voted against his chairman and ranking  member. So much for bipartisanship. The majority threw sand in the  gears of what was a good process. They just can't help themselves, and  this is par for the course here.   Just look at the other water development bill, the Energy and Water  Appropriations Act. This could have been another bipartisan measure. It  funds most programs at an adequate level. But the majority reverted  back to their usual ways: ignoring Democratic ideas and filling this up  with one bipartisan proposal after another. It is like a Christmas tree  loaded up with bad ideas.   More than $400 million was cut from 2018 enacted levels for some of  our biggest priorities, things like energy efficiency and renewable  energy programs. Even nuclear nonproliferation programs were cut; and  for what, Mr. Speaker? So the majority can reward their allies by  skewing resources toward the fossil fuel industry.   There are controversial riders that are completely unnecessary and  would do more harm than good. They have no business being in an  appropriations bill.   One of the riders would hinder the Army Corps' ability to protect  clean water. Another would kill the Waters of the United States rule.  There is one rider that would threaten the Endangered Species Act.  There is even language tucked inside this bill that would allow  firearms to be carried on all Army Corps lands; and this from a  majority that refuses to even consider ways to combat gun violence on  the House floor. We can't even get a vote on anything related to gun  violence on this floor. This is outrageous.   The majority is also using this appropriations process to fund  President Trump's stupid, ridiculous, offensive border wall. Mr.  Speaker, didn't the President tell us that Mexico was going to foot the  bill for this ridiculous wall? It is being funded by shortchanging  priorities for the middle class. That includes programs to educate our  children, help students afford college, and provide job training to our  workers, all for this stupid wall--more red meat for the most narrow  parts of the Republican base.   I remember my Republican colleague talking for years about the  importance of passing a budget resolution. Maybe that was just  something they cared about under the Obama administration or something  they do only when they are trying to take healthcare away from people  or reward the wealthy with more tax cuts, because here they are under a  Republican President with a Republican Congress pushing ahead with an  appropriations package without passing a budget. That April 15 deadline  came and went a long time ago.   Mr. Speaker, what happened to doing one bill at a time? We used to  consider appropriations bills separately, but the majority's rule lumps  several together to try to speed up the process and I guess limit  debate; and for what? Funding the government is one of our most  important responsibilities. Two of these bills would probably pass with  broad, bipartisan support, but, apparently, bipartisanship is not a  priority for some of the Republican Conference. So they had to cram  them together with a partisan bill that is filled with harmful  ideological riders.  [[Page H4788]]    I would like to think that the majority would want strong, bipartisan  votes on appropriations bills. We used to have them in the past. We  don't have any bipartisanship now as a direct result of the choices  made by this Republican leadership.   Mr. Speaker, why is the majority using a process that makes it harder  to pass bipartisan bills? It may please their base, but it is an awful  way to legislate. This majority has had 8 years to decide how to run  this place. Mr. Speaker, clearly, they haven't figured it out. There is  no budget and not even an attempt to get one. Where are all the  Republican budget hawks? Where is their countdown clock with ``days  since the last budget''? This majority can't even keep the lights  on. We have seen two government shutdowns this year alone, and it is  only June. My colleague from Georgia again said: Look at all we have  done, and it is June.    The other thing they did is they broke their own record of now being  the most closed Congress in the history of the United States of  America. They have brought more bills to the floor under a restrictive,  closed process than any other Congress in history. Yes, they have  accomplished a lot, it is only June, and it is going to get worse.   There is virtually no oversight of the executive branch from this  majority. None. Just one example, and this is a beauty: we have an EPA  administrator who allegedly got a sweetheart deal on an apartment and  spent $43 on a phone booth. You can't make this stuff up. He asked a  Federal employee who reported to him to hunt for a used mattress from  President Trump's hotel.   None of this seems to bother my Republican colleagues. How is that  possible?   Mr. Speaker, it is time for the adults in Congress to stand up, bring  sanity back to our government, bring professionalism back to our  government, and bring some integrity back to this institution. Make  your constituents proud. Make your government great again. You can  start here today by voting ``no'' on this rule.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am glad the gentleman came here to celebrate. I came  here to remind everybody, again, that this is the most closed Congress  in the history of the United States of America. I think that is an  important fact for people to consider and digest, because process is  important. Process equals substance. I am sorry, but that is not  something to celebrate.    We have no problem with the WRDA bill. We will support that, no  problem. The gang violence bill, I think most of us will support that.  Where we have a problem is what the majority did with the  appropriations bills. The majority took two appropriations bills where  there could be virtual unanimity--certainly bipartisan support--and  says: If you want those bills, you have got to swallow a poison pill.  You have to also vote as part of that package an Energy and Water bill  that is filled with antienvironmental riders.   I get it. I know where the allegiance of the majority party is when  it comes to the environment. It is in the pockets of the oil companies,  the fossil fuel industry, and now the coal companies. I get it.   But for those who are offended by the antienvironmental record of the  Republicans who run this House and certainly by the antienvironmental  record of this administration, we don't want any part of that. That is  not a bipartisan process. That is not a good process.   By the way, these antienvironmental riders have no business being on  an appropriations bill. It is stuff that just was added because the  majority could. So we can't celebrate that process.   Yes, we will vote for the WRDA bill, applaud Chairman Shuster and  applaud Ranking Member DeFazio and all the members of the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. We have no problem with  that.   But this rule is designed for a purpose, and that is to limit debate  and that is to try to put pressure on people to vote for a package that  includes some really horrendous riders on it that do great harm to our  environment. That is not the way this place is supposed to work.   Unfortunately, the majority controls the process. This is a process  the majority chooses to embrace. It is not fair, and, again, it is now  the most closed process in the history of the United States of America.   Mr. Speaker, the infrastructure in our Nation is in dire need of  repair and maintenance. Reports are that Chairman Shuster is hoping to  release an infrastructure bill later this summer. This is good news,  but given the Republican majority's recent history, the American  taxpayers first need to know where our priorities with that bill lie.   The American people have good reason to be worried about whom such an  important bill would actually benefit. Just a few months ago the GOP  passed a tax bill that skewed nearly all of the benefits to the wealthy  and rich corporations leaving working class people behind. We can't  allow this same approach to trickle into an infrastructure  [[Page H4789]]  bill that could skew all the benefits to billionaires and Wall Street  banks looking to profit from the privatization of our infrastructure.   We need to send a clear signal that our priority in repairing and  upgrading our infrastructure is to not privatize these essential  resources to enrich a lucky few; but instead will prioritize creating  millions of living-wage jobs without selling off our roads and bridges  to private investors. Mr. Speaker, here is the Republicans' chance to  prove that they stand with hardworking Americans in fixing our Nation's  infrastructure and not with billionaires, Wall Street banks, and  foreign investors.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to bring up Representative Lieu's resolution, H.  Con. Res. 63, which outlines priorities for efforts to enact a bold  jobs and infrastructure package that benefits all Americans, not just  billionaires.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from California (Mr. Ted Lieu) to discuss our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Vermont (Mr. Welch).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire of the gentleman from  Georgia how many more speakers he has on his side?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, in spite of the fact that this is the most closed  Congress in the history of the United States, I believe in giving  credit where credit is due. This WRDA bill is a bill that is the  product of a bipartisan process. I applaud the chairman, Mr. Shuster,  and the Ranking Democrat, Mr. DeFazio, on working together, and all the  members of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure coming  together to try to come to an accommodation that resulted in this bill.    I regret very much that, despite their good work, in some backroom in  the Rules Committee somewhere, the majority decided to rip out a  bipartisan provision that the chairman and ranking member had agreed  on. Then, making that even worse, the chairman and the ranking member  had an amendment to try to at least have a debate on the floor and let  the Members decide that issue, but the Rules Committee decided not to  make that in order as well. Anyway, I don't want to be too picky.  Overall, the WRDA bill is good. It will get a bipartisan vote.   Of the three appropriations bills--this new approach where we bunch  everything together so we don't have a lot of time to talk about them-- two of the appropriations bills are fine. There would be, I think, a  pretty big bipartisan vote. The Legislative Branch Appropriations bill  would pass with a strong bipartisan vote. I think that is a good thing.  The Military Construction-VA bill would pass with a strong bipartisan  vote. That is a good thing. But  [[Page H4790]]  my friends are allergic to bipartisanship.   So, what they have to say is: You know what? Yeah, that is  bipartisan, that is bipartisan, but we are going to bunch it in with a  bill that is extremely partisan, that is filled with these horrific  anti-environmental riders in it. If you want the good stuff, you have  got to take this awful stuff as well.   We are not going to do that. You are not going to have a bipartisan  vote. I think if we were running this House, we would prefer to see a  bipartisan vote than simply a partisan vote on everything.   If this is the beginning of an appropriations process that you are  going to employ throughout the remaining time, I worry about how this  will all end up. My guess is, it will be what it usually is: this  massive, gigantic mess at the end where deals are struck behind closed  doors and things are put together, and we get a vote on one big,  massive bill, take it or leave it. And then we will find out what is in  it weeks and months later.   I think that we are at a point where we have to really decide how  this House should be run. I would just respectfully say to my  Republican friends that this is not the way we should do the  appropriations process. In general, this is not the way we should run  the House. We ought to be debating appropriations bills one at a time.  We ought to be encouraging bipartisanship, not trying to make it  impossible. We have to be more accommodating.   It shouldn't be a proud day for the majority to be able to break  their own record of being the most closed Congress in the history of  the United States. That is not the way this place is supposed to run. I  think it has become too convenient for my Republican friends to run it  in a way where they just put bills on the floor and say: Take it or  leave it, my way or the highway.   I guarantee you, if you are more accommodating, if you are more open,  you will have more bipartisan votes. You will have less rancor in this  Chamber. Maybe people will actually like Congress better if they see us  working together.   So I regret very much that I think my words are falling on deaf ears,  but it really is disappointing and I think it is a disservice to the  institution.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question so we  can bring up Mr. Lieu's bill. If that doesn't pass, I would urge my  colleagues to vote ``no'' on this rule. This is not the kind of process  we want to see move forward on appropriations. I think this is the only  opportunity for Democrats and Republicans to be able to express that,  by voting ``no'' on the rule.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
