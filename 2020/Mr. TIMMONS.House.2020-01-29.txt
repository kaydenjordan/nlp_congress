 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment is simple. It would require the  GAO to carry out a study on the compliance of consumer reporting  agencies with the underlying legislation proposed by my colleague from  Massachusetts. It would also study what effect the compliance of  reporting agencies would have on consumers.   This is important because if this bill were somehow able to become  law, the results would be disastrous not only for reporting agencies  but also for the average consumer.   The purpose of a credit score is to show an individual's  creditworthiness. This bill would significantly water down the  integrity of these credit scores.   If you are removing predictive data, if you are drastically  shortening the amount of time adverse yet accurate information remains  on a report, and if you remove medical debt from a report, then what  exactly is the purpose of a credit score? What will a credit score be  good for if this bill were to become law?   The bottom line is this bill would significantly weaken the process  for determining creditworthiness and would enable individuals to obtain  loans that they do not have the means to pay back.   It would also give the CFPB, an unaccountable government agency,  control over private credit scoring models.   It is imperative that we know exactly how compliance with this bill  would affect reporting agencies and, as a result, consumers.   Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I would inquire how much time is remaining.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. McHenry), the ranking member.    Mr. Chair, in closing, I would again urge all of my  colleagues to support this amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.
