 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the  Republican's tax scam that has been jammed through this Chamber without  normal order, without public debate, and without consideration for our  Nation's future.   I represent the heart of Las Vegas, a city that was one of the  hardest hit during the financial crisis. Many of my constituents are  just beginning to recover from the worst financial crisis since the  Great Depression, and this tax bill will greatly hinder their progress.   Some 20 percent of my constituents itemize their deductions, the vast  majority of whom earn under $75,000 per year. These families will all  see a tax hike if this bill becomes law because the deductions for  student loans, medical expenses, sales tax, and some mortgages will all  disappear.   The sad reality is, they won't just feel the hit on April 15, tax  day. They will feel it every single day. The deficit that this bill  will create will lead to State and local governments missing out on  needed Federal funding, and they will either have to slash vital  programs or raise taxes at that level. If the Senate has its way, they  will cut Medicare by $25 billion and repeal the ACA. This is not a tax  reform. It is a system that will be rigged.                            ____________________
