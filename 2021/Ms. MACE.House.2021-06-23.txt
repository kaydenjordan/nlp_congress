 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend an incredible effort  put forth in my State during the pandemic.   The Arc of South Carolina is a nonprofit organization that advocates  for the rights of people with intellectual and developmental  disabilities. Their work is critical in South Carolina and South  Carolina's First Congressional District, and they deserve to be  recognized for all of their efforts.   Like many organizations during the past year and a half, the Arc of  South Carolina has struggled to acquire PPE, hiring staff, and coping  with different social distancing guidelines, particularly given the  scope of their work.   Margie Williamson and her team had to continue providing services at  disproportionately high costs compared to businesses who received State  and Federal assistance. A staggering number of their staff fell ill to  COVID-19 during the pandemic, but their team and their organization was  able to provide superior support to all of these families with enormous  needs nonetheless.   I cannot begin to thank the staff, not only at the Arc of South  Carolina, but every worker across the State everywhere who persevered.  You are the heroes of South Carolina's pandemic story.   The Arc of South Carolina is dedicated to helping families, and I  wanted to highlight all they were able to accomplish during the most  challenging of times.  [[Page H3014]]                            Antonio Greene's Act of Kindness     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a local Amazon  driver named Antonio Greene, who learned that someone living along his  route was undergoing chemotherapy.   When Antonio learned this, he thought back to his own family. He lost  his parents and grandmother over the last couple years, and  occasionally he would buy cards and flowers for members of his family  to offer encouragement and support.   Greene, a North Charleston native, did the same last summer for  another individual in South Carolina's First Congressional District who  had been immunocompromised during the pandemic.   Antonio's act of kindness has landed him among seven people to be  recognized by the JFK Foundation, and I applaud all of those  individuals carrying out small acts of kindness during the pandemic. I  commend Antonio and anyone who has risked their own health and safety  to protect others during COVID-19. Those who showed compassion in ways  like this always deserve this kind of recognition.               Restaurants Overcame Uncertainty During Pandemic     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to restaurants  and the resilience of so many in this industry; specifically, Vintage  Lounge, Butcher & Bee, Harold's Cabin, and Chasing Sage in South  Carolina's First Congressional District.   These restaurants did not take any aid or receive any relief during  the COVID-19 crisis. They were even closed during the beginning of the  pandemic and they were unable to receive any restaurant relief funds as  well, but they survived despite these challenges.   Every restaurant owner with hopes of making it through the COVID-19  crisis had to choose a survival strategy that worked. I would like to  bring attention to all four of these restaurants, which are now open or  in the process of reopening post-pandemic. This is a major feat worth  celebrating, especially since they faced unprecedented challenges to an  already vulnerable industry.   In Charleston, in South Carolina's First Congressional District, our  hospitality and restaurant industry has been critically hit. These  companies and restaurants had to prompt guests to wear masks, in line  with city regulations; and if they weren't out by 11 p.m., they had to  go, by State order.   But so many were determined to uphold the same hospitality standards  they had in place prior to the pandemic. Vintage Lounge, Butcher & Bee,  Harold's Cabin, and Chasing Sage, among hundreds of other restaurants,  are now open for business again. I commend their stories of success  during the pandemic.                   Recognizing Tee Young and Preston White     Mr. Speaker, I rise today with great honor and pride to  bring awareness to two constituents in South Carolina's First  Congressional District for their fantastic effort they put forth in our  community.   Tee Young and Preston White helped facilitate the First Annual  Crosstown Basketball Tournament, which was held in Hampton Park this  last Saturday, just next door to my alma mater, the Citadel.   These young men arranged the tournament as a way to bring the east  and west sides of the city of Charleston together and provide a nice  evening for the community filled with food and basketball.   I cannot be more proud of Tee and Preston showing Charleston and  South Carolina and all of our communities how we are stronger and  better together and showing how strong Charleston is.   God bless these young men, the State of South Carolina, and the  United States of America.                            ____________________
