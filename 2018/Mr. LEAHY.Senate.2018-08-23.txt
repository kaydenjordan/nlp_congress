 Mr. President, as vice chairman of the Appropriations  Committee, and I am sure I can also speak for the chairman of the  Appropriations Committee, we appreciate this vote, so we can move  forward.   We have spent the last week on the Senate floor. But, what many  people have not seen are the hours and hours that Senators, both  Republicans and Democrats, have spent working together to get where we  are today. Many people have not seen the countless of hours more being  done by our staffs. Sometimes at 1 in the morning, they are still  negotiating parts of this bill.   We are just within an hour or so of doing something the Senate, as  Senator McConnell pointed out, has not been able to do in years.   I think we will pass a good, responsible and within-the-budget piece  of legislation. Both Republicans and Democrats had a voice in the  process. We held numerous votes in the Senate Appropriations Committee,  all of them overwhelmingly bipartisan, many of them unanimous--with the  exception of one or two votes--to get to where we are today.   I see some of the chairs from our subcommittees who worked very hard  to put together these bipartisan coalitions. I know a lot of people are  anxious to get out of here, and soon they will be headed to the  airport. Let's get this done. Let's show that the U.S. Senate is  actually doing its work. Let's do what we were elected to do, what we  know how to do, and what we can do.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, we have no objection.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the  Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and the waiver provisions of  applicable budget resolutions, I move to waive all applicable sections  of that Act and applicable budget resolutions for purposes of the  pending amendment.   I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, the reason I did that--and I rarely  disagree with my good friend from Wyoming; we are, after all, the only  two Irish Italians in this body. But people are hurting. It is hard  enough going to college, and cutting the Pell grant awards just adds to  it. The student debt today exceeds one-half trillion dollars, and that  is because of the erosion of Federal support.   I am stating my point of order, standing with the middle class in  this country, so their children and their families can be educated, and  I am ready to vote.    Mr. President, the Senate, and Congress as a whole, best  serves the American people when we reach real, bipartisan solutions.  Today, the Senate will pass its third bipartisan appropriations  package, completing Senate consideration of 9 of the 12 appropriations  bills reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee and accounting  for 87 percent of all discretionary spending.   We are proving that when we put partisan politics aside, we can do  the work of the American people. This progress would not have been  possible without my dear friend, the chair of the Appropriations  Committee, Senator Richard Shelby. Senator Shelby and I made a  commitment, along with Leader McConnell and Leader Schumer, to only  move forward on appropriations bills that have bipartisan support, are  at spending levels agreed to in the bipartisan budget deal, and that  reject poison pill riders and controversial authorizing language. This  allowed us to complete our bills committee and pass three  appropriations packages on the Senate floor.   I am disappointed that House Republicans have thus far rejected this  reasonable path in favor of partisan grandstanding by producing bills  that have no chance of passing the Senate, but I remain hopeful that  once they return from their 5-week recess, they will be ready to work  with the Senate on real solutions for the American people and to pass  these bills before the end of the fiscal year.   The Senate approach is what this bill represents: real, bipartisan  solutions for the American people. We adopted 52 amendments in a  bipartisan managers' package, allowing input on the floor from Members  outside of the Appropriations Committee on matters that are important  to them and to their constituents. We adhered to the bipartisan budget  agreement and turned those priorities into policy solutions.   We make good on our promise to families to invest in access to higher  education and child care. We make a second major investment in  addressing the opioid crisis. Everyone in this Chamber has experienced  the opioid crisis firsthand. Whether it is a friend, a family member or  a loved one, no one has escaped the grips of this scourge, and we put  the force of the United States Government behind the search for cures  to diseases like Alzheimer's, cancer, and diabetes by increasing  funding for the National Institutes of Health.   This bill invests in our military and their families, allowing the  men and women in our Armed Forces to carry out their missions safely  and effectively. By investing in both our immediate national security  needs and our long-term domestic needs, like education and health care,  this package recognizes the deep ties that run between defense and non- defense priorities.   Ask any military leader, and he will tell you an investment in  education is an investment in national security.   By combining these bills in one package, we increase the certainty  that they will be enacted into law, on time, avoiding the waste and  inefficiency produced by long-term continuing resolutions. I urge our  House counterparts to commit, as we have, to producing a conference  report that contains both bills so we can move swiftly toward final  passage and address the devastating consequences of sequestration on  both sides of the ledger.   I remain hopeful that we can continue the bipartisan momentum we have  built in the Senate into our conference negotiations with the House.   I want to thank Senators Blunt, Durbin, and Murray for their hard  work on these bills and, of course, Senator Shelby.   I also want to thank the Majority staff, Shannon Hines, David Adkins,  and Jonathan Graffeo, as well as the Defense and Labor-HHS subcommittee  staffs, for their hard work and cooperation on this bill.   And I want to thank my staff for their long hours over the last few  weeks, Charles Kieffer, Chanda Betourney, Jessica Berry, Erik Raven,  and Alex Keenan and all of the Defense and Labor-HHS subcommittee  staff.   This package, which represents 65 percent of all discretionary  spending, will improve lives in every State, and I urge an aye vote.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of all  Appropriations Committee staff, whose hard work made this bill happen,  be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Charles Kieffer        Chanda Betourney        Jessica Berry        Jay Tilton        Jean Kwon        Erik Raven        Alex Keenan        David Gillies        Brigid Houton        John Lucio        Andy Vanlandingham        Mark Laisch        Lisa Bernhardt        Kelly Brown        Catie Finley        Teri Curtin        Shannon Hines        Jonathan Graffeo        David Adkins        Brian Potts        Laura Friedel        Mike Clementi        Colleen Gaydos        Katy Hagan        Chris Hall        Hanz Heinrichs        Kate Kaufer        Jacqui Russell        Will Todd        Carlos Elias        Michael Gentile        Ashley Palmer        Jeff Reczek        Courtney Bradford        Jenny Winkler        Valerie Hutton        Bob Putnam     Mr. President, I yield back my time.    Mr. President, last week, on August 16, more than 300  newspapers across the Nation published editorials giving voice and  testament to the vital role of a free press in our American democracy.  It is such a crucial requisite of democracy that this role--this right  of a free people--is embedded in our Constitution.   The words, the actions, and the service of the free American press  are a daily counterpoint to the vile charges by many that the press is  ``the enemy of the people''--a smear that is commonly used by despots  in societies that do not have the freedoms that our Constitution is  intended to ensure and protect. It is all too clear today that each new  generation must renew the Nation's dedication to our founding  principles and ideals.   The Senate, on August 16, unanimously passed a resolution reaffirming  the vital and indispensable role of the free press. I was proud to  cosponsor that resolution. It is regrettable that such a resolution was  even needed--or even timely.   I am proud that several news organizations in Vermont participated on  August 16 in publishing editorials about the importance of a free  press. I call to the Senate's attention one of these, written by Steven  Pappas and published in the Times Argus of Barre, VT.   I ask unanimous consent that this editorial be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                   [From the Times Argus, Aug. 16, 2018]                           Yes, We Are the Enemy     [Editor's note: Across the nation today, U.S. newspapers and news     organizations are publishing, posting or broadcasting editorials  opposing press-bashing. The idea was sparked by Boston Globe editorial     page editor Marjorie Pritchard. What follows is our voice in that                           chorus of solidarity.]         We are the enemy. It's true. We say that with no       hesitation.        If you abuse power, we are the enemy.  [[Page S5910]]         When you use propaganda to mislead the people, you are the       enemy.        If a public official deliberately hides documents or closes       meetings, we are the enemy.        We will come after you if you are an oppressor of the       underprivileged.        We will never allow anyone to silence the voices and       opinions of others.        If you ignore laws and human rights, you are the enemy.        We will call out discrimination, any willingness or       eagerness to hate, narrow-mindedness.        We will exploit anyone who creates smoke to divert anyone       from the fires that you build.        We are the enemy of ignorance, all ignorance.        If you suppress, we are the enemy.        If you scheme, we are the enemy.        If you use conflicts of interest to gain leverage, you are       the enemy.        If you are, in any form, an enemy of the public trust,       then, of course, we are the enemy.        If you believe facts are subjective and truths should be       measured in shades of gray, then we are your enemy in black       and white.        And when you say there is no need for a free press, we are       absolutely, unequivocally, your enemy.        So now that we have established ourselves as your enemy,       know this: We are not the enemy of the people. Our readers       and the public are our allies against you. We represent the       communities we serve; we are their reflection--good, bad and       indifferent. They depend on us to collect, vet and present       information in spite of selfish motivations.        We are the watchdogs, sometimes the only ones who will       stand up and say, ``Hold on.'' We will say, ``I don't think       so.'' We can declare, ``Out of line.'' And we are not afraid       to say, ``You're wrong.''        We will kick over stones. We will ask hard questions. We       will separate facts from fiction.        We will challenge you to prove yourself. We will ask you to       think for yourself.        We will force you to say ``yes'' or ``no.''        We will make you uncomfortable.        We will hold on to certain issues like a dog with a bone,       until we are certain our investigation is complete.        We will also make mistakes. And we will own them and we       will correct them.        We will sometimes publish an incomplete story. But we try,       at all costs (and with far limited resources than ever       before), to avoid presenting something that could be       construed as ``fake news.'' That does not serve our interest       to be the vehicle for answers, information or truth.        And if we are doing our job well, no one is ever really       happy with us. But we earn respect.        To those who say journalists are the enemy, we definitely       are. We actually wear that charge as a badge of honor. We are       proud of the work we do and the purpose that we serve.        Because without us, or with even a hint of a state-run       media, facts have no value.        George Seldes was fond of quoting Abraham Lincoln, who,       during the Civil War, once famously said, ``I am a firm       believer in the people. If given the truth they can be       depended upon to meet any national crisis. The great point is       to bring them the real facts.''        Seldes was an investigative journalist, correspondent,       editor and author. He lived in Hartland Four Corners and died       in 1995 at the age of 104. Over the course of his career,       Seldes influenced many young people to become journalists. He       also was hated for standing up to authority, both in foreign       nations for his news coverage, and at home for his harsh       criticism of the American press. But he did journalism a       favor by being everyone's enemy and making us all squirm and       question roles--both as consumers of news and newsmakers.        James Russell Wiggins, a career journalist who worked for       The Washington Post and later retired to Maine, summarized       the thread of the Fourth Estate's purpose as this:       ``Americans will be tempted, in the years ahead, to sacrifice       the principles that have made their country what it is. It       will seem appropriate and convenient to meet the demands of       crisis by bending a little here and giving a little there. It       is an inclination that will have to be resisted at the first       trespass upon our freedoms, or other invasions of individual       rights will come swiftly upon us.''        That day is here, friends.                            ____________________
