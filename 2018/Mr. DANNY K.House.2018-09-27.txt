 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague.   Mr. Speaker, only 39 percent of Americans have enough savings to  cover an emergency costing $1,000. The median savings of workers  earning the median income of $54,000 in my congressional district is  only around $2,000. The median savings of women is $2,000. The median  savings of African Americans is $1,000, and of Latinos, it is $1,500.  Yet this bill bestows tremendous tax benefits on the wealthy who can  stockpile tens of thousands of dollars in multiple savings accounts,  leaving the working class out in the cold.   When hard work in one or two jobs isn't enough for most Americans to  escape poverty because wages have stagnated for decades and because  recovery from the Great Recession is concentrated in the small  percentage of Americans who invest in the stock market, when we know  that low- and moderate-income families have a harder time saving for  college because they have less extra cash available to put away in a  savings account, the Republican solution embraces the privileged and  fails the working families.   What is absent from this bill is telling.   The 529 plan does not cover childcare for apprentices, one of the  number one costs they face with training. This bill throws crumbs to  apprentices by allowing 529 plans to cover minor training expenses like  books and supplies.   Given that employers pay for the coursework of apprentices, the  remaining education costs are relatively small. That is why apprentice  advocates asked for and why the original bill included coverage for  childcare, yet childcare is not covered in this bill.   What also is absent is the Jenkins-Kind provision to help middle- class families save for college by allowing employers to match up to  $600 a year in 529 contributions, which could help families who can't  afford to put much aside for college or increase their savings.   I cannot understand how, when our citizens are struggling under  crushing student loan debt, the Republican solution is to allow the  elite, with impressive 529 plans, to pay off their student debt while  leaving the working class out in the cold.   Absent is a true investment in helping working and middle-class  families pay for college. Rather than helping working families, this  Republican bill additionally, ideologically attacks the reproductive  freedom of women by unnecessarily defining unborn children as  beneficiaries of 529s.   I agree that we should help families cover the cost of needed health  services to help students learn, such as speech and language services,  occupational therapy, or physical therapy.                                time  1500    Yet, rather than requiring that insurance companies cover these  health services that help students learn, the Republican solution is to  allow the privileged, with thousands of dollars in savings, to pay for  these costs, while working and middle-class families must forego the  services for lack of funds.   When 67 percent of Americans say that they will outlive their  retirement savings, the Republican solution to helping families pay for  expenses associated with a new child or adoption is to undermine these  families' retirement security. The Republican tax approach gives  corporations and millionaires tens of thousands of dollars directly,  but working Americans must take money from their retirement.   Government should strengthen the economic security of working and  middle-class Americans whose wages have stagnated, not the very  wealthiest. This bill fails that charge.
