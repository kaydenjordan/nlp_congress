 Mr. President, today I, along with 13 of my Senate  colleagues, am introducing the Presidential Trade Transparency Act of  2017. This bill establishes new reporting requirements directing the  President to disclose foreign income, assets, and liabilities when  initiating or continuing trade or investment negotiations with a  foreign country, taking or refraining to take certain trade enforcement  actions, or granting or modifying preferential tariff treatment under  statutory trade preference programs. Each of these decisions may have  significant commercial implications, both as to a foreign country's  economy as a whole and with respect to particular investments within a  foreign country. Given the complexity and lack of transparency with  respect to the President's finances, additional country-specific  reporting is necessary for Congress to properly exercise its oversight  responsibilities and assess whether the authority it has granted to the  President is the subject of undue influence due to a business  relationship between the President and one or more foreign entities.  Reporting of this information will also help address questions  regarding improper influence by foreign entities when the President  exercises trade authorities granted by Congress.   Americans have a right to know if the President is looking out for  the good of the country or just his own bottom line when he negotiates  a trade deal, decides whether or not to enforce our trade laws, or  decides whether to cut tariffs on imports from a developing country.  The President has business interests around the world, but he continues  to keep the full nature of those ties secret.   Under the Constitution, Congress is responsible for regulating  foreign commerce, including setting U.S. tariff rates applicable to  imports from foreign countries. However, Congress has granted the  President limited authority to modify U.S. tariffs in certain  circumstances, including to enforce U.S. laws protecting U.S. industry  from harmful trade or to address foreign trade barriers, to negotiate  trade agreements that eliminate foreign barriers to U.S. exports, and  to grant developing countries preferential access to the U.S. market.   In many instances, the President himself is granted this authority  and does not exercise it through a Cabinet official. While Congress has  granted such authority to the President, it retains the responsibility  to ensure that the President uses the authority in a manner consistent  with congressional objectives.   The bill directs the President to report to Congress information  regarding foreign income, assets, and liabilities, consistent with the  information required to be disclosed under the Ethics in Government  Act, specifically as to any country that is the subject of a trade  negotiation, trade enforcement action or inaction, or decision to grant  or deny tariff preferences, and to describe in detail the nature of the  connection between the income, asset, or liability and the foreign  country. The bill specifies deadlines for disclosure of the information  with respect to each action that generally track existing deadlines for  Presidential reporting under U.S. law.   Failure to timely submit a report would render without legal effect a  Presidential proclamation modifying U.S. tariffs with respect to the  country and, with respect to a trade agreement, would disqualify the  agreement from eligibility for expedited consideration under trade  promotion authority.   Passage of this bill would close a key loophole in congressional  oversight authorities over trade and shine much needed daylight on the  financial relationship between the President and America's trading  partners.   I thank my colleagues for their efforts on this bill, and I hope the  Finance Committee will consider our proposal quickly.                                  ______                                         By Mr. BOOKER (for himself and Mr. Portman):   S. 424. A bill to amend title 5, United Stated Code, to include  certain Federal positions within the definition of law enforcement  officer for retirement purposes, and for other purposes; to the  Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.    Mr. President, today I, along with 13 of my Senate  colleagues, am introducing the Presidential Trade Transparency Act of  2017.

I thank my colleagues for their efforts on this bill, and I hope the  Finance Committee will consider our proposal quickly.                                  ______    Madam President, last month I stood here to express my  serious concerns about the nomination of Scott Pruitt to lead the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency.   As the vote draws closer, I want to reiterate those concerns and give  voice to the thousands of individuals and groups in Oregon who have  sent letters and made calls and spoken up in my town hall meetings.  Oregonians have expressed their fears that Pruitt will steer us into a  ditch when it comes to protecting the environment and public health. I  share their concerns, and I cannot support this nomination.   In my view, the importance of the EPA cannot be overstated. The EPA  is  [[Page S1371]]  at the heart of maintaining clean air and clean water for every person  in this country, but Mr. Pruitt has made a career of denying climate  science, attempting to weaken or even get rid of worker protections,  air quality standards for toxic air pollutants, and basic environmental  standards. Those rollbacks would hurt us all.   One prime example of how the EPA has stepped in to protect Oregonians  is during a recent air quality scare in Portland. In 2015, researchers  with the U.S. Forest Service discovered that heavy metals including  cadmium and arsenic had been emitted for decades into the air of  Portland neighborhoods and schoolyards at dangerous levels.   I called on the EPA to take action, and within days they were on the  ground in Portland, testing the air quality and helping our community  wrap our heads around the public health risks. It wasn't long before  they identified the root of the problem and corrected course.   I am not confident that a Pruitt EPA would have jumped to the aid of  my community in a time when parents wondered if they had been poisoning  their own children simply by feeding them vegetables grown in their  backyards.   Mr. Pruitt's career is defined by repeated attempts to weaken or  eliminate health-based environmental standards, weaken or eliminate  limits on carbon emissions that would help address the challenge of  climate change, weaken or eliminate air quality standards to fight the  kinds of toxic air pollutants we saw in Portland. Those rollbacks hurt  us all.   Mr. Pruitt has a history of attacking the very Agency he now wants to  lead. As attorney general of Oklahoma, he has been involved in more  than 20 lawsuits against the EPA, and he has failed to give Congress  any kind of assurances that he would recuse himself from matters  related to those lawsuits.   Mr. Pruitt has clear connections with big businesses who profit from  polluting--oil and gas companies and coal-hungry electricity giants,  among others. He has a history of siding with these special interests  at the direct expense of the health of our families and communities.   According to news reports, as Oklahoma's Attorney General and head of  the Republican Attorneys General Association, Pruitt helped raise  millions from industries he is now expected to regulate.   More and more of this shadowy history is coming to light.  Particularly after a judge has ordered him to release thousands of his  emails as Oklahoma's Attorney General just days from now, the Senate  should not hold a vote on a nominee when more information may come to  light about an alarming association with the very industries he would  be regulating as head of the EPA.   However, Mr. Pruitt has until next Tuesday to release those emails--4  days after Senate Republicans are forcing a confirmation vote. In the  interest of transparency, the Senators should be able to read these  emails before voting so we can make a fully informed decision.   By jamming this nomination through today, Senate Republican  leadership is forcing the Senate to vote on a nominee without knowing  the content of the full background of this nominee. In my view, that is  legislative malpractice.   So I join my Democratic colleagues in asking that the vote on Mr.  Pruitt's nomination to lead the EPA be delayed until those thousands of  emails are released and Members of the Senate have the opportunity to  review their contents.   The American people are demanding that Senate leadership delay Mr.  Pruitt's confirmation until this important information is disclosed and  questions about his possible conflicts of interest are answered.   On even the most basic level, Mr. Pruitt has a troubling history. He  has denied the fundamental science that should be used to inform public  policy.   Time and time again, Mr. Pruitt has argued against the reality of  climate change, going so far as to dispute the EPA's rigorous science- based finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare.   The EPA cannot be run by an individual with a career founded on  alternative facts; yet that is much of what Scott Pruitt is promoting.   As I have said to Oregonians about this nomination and others,  policymakers ought to come together and find the truth, not fall back  on alternative facts.   Nearly 800 former employees of the U.S. Environmental Protection  Agency expressed opposition to Pruitt this week in an open letter.  These are 800 public servants who are dedicated to the Agency's core  mission.   I think Oregonians and the American people need to hear what is in  this letter. It states, in part:         Our environmental laws are based on a partnership that       requires EPA to set national standards attind gives states       latitude when implementing them so long as certain minimum       criteria are satisfied. This approach recognizes that       Americans have an equal right to clean air and water, no       matter where they live, and allows states to compete for       business without having to sacrifice public health or       environmental quality.        Our environmental laws include provisions directing EPA to       allow for a ``margin of safety'' when assessing risks, which       is intended to limit exposure to pollutants when it is       reasonable to expect they may harm the public health, even       when all the scientific evidence is not yet in. For example,       EPA's first Administrator, Bill Ruckelshaus, chose to limit       the amount of lead in gasoline before all doubt about its       harmfulness to public health was erased. His action spared       much of the harm that some countries still face as result of       the devastating effects of lead on human health. Similarly,       early action to reduce exposure to fine particle pollution       helped avoid thousands of premature deaths from heart and       lung disease. The magnitude and severity of those risks did       not become apparent until much later.        Mr Pruitt's record and public statements strongly suggest       that he does not share the vision or agree with the       underlying principles of our environmental statutes. Mr.       Pruitt has shown no interest in enforcing those laws, a       critically important function for EPA. While serving as       Oklahoma's top law enforcement officer, Mr. Pruitt issued       more than 50 press releases celebrating lawsuits to overturn       EPA standards to limit mercury emissions from power plants,       reduce smog levels in cities and regional haze in parks,       clean up the Chesapeake Bay and control greenhouse gas       emissions.        In contrast, none of Mr. Pruitt's many press releases refer       to any action he has taken to enforce environmental laws or       to actually reduce pollution. This track record likely       reflects his disturbing decision to close the environmental       enforcement unit in his office while establishing a new       litigation team to challenge EPA and other federal agencies.    These former EPA employees close the letter by stating:         The American people have been served by EPA Administrators,       Republicans and Democrats, who have embraced their       responsibility to protect public health and the environment.       Different administrators have come to different conclusions       about how best to apply the law in view of the science, and       many of their decisions have been challenged in court,       sometimes successfully, for either going too far or not far       enough. But in the large majority of cases it was evident to       us that they put the public's welfare ahead of private       interests. Scott Pruitt has not demonstrated this same       commitment.    I ask unanimous consent that the full letter be printed in the Record  at the conclusion of my remarks.   Americans ought to have confidence that the head of the EPA  recognizes what this job is all about--defending the health of our  communities, not the profits of energy companies or any other special  interest; yet Mr. Pruitt has given no such assurance. Like these former  EPA employees, I would not have that confidence in a Pruitt EPA.   And now, with the release next Tuesday of thousands of his emails  that may document an alarming association with the very industries he  is supposed to regulate, it seems particularly premature, even  irresponsible, to push for a vote on his confirmation today.   I share the concerns of the thousands of Oregonians and hundreds of  current and former EPA employees who have expressed their opposition to  Mr. Pruitt. I will vote against him today because I do not have  confidence in a Pruitt EPA.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                  February 15, 2017.      Subject: Concerns about Scott Pruitt's qualifications to           serve as EPA Administrator.       Hon. Ron Wyden,      Dirksen Senate Office Building,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Wyden, We write as former employees of the       Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to share our concerns       about Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt's  [[Page S1372]]       qualifications to serve as the next EPA Administrator in       light of his record in Oklahoma. Our perspective is not       partisan. Having served under both Republican and Democratic       presidents, we recognize each new Administration's right to       pursue different policies within the parameters of existing       law and to ask Congress to change the laws that protect       public health and the environment as it sees fit.        However, every EPA Administrator has a fundamental       obligation to act in the public's interest based on current       law and the best available science. Mr. Pruitt's record       raises serious questions about whose interests he has served       to date and whether he agrees with the longstanding tenets of       U.S. environmental law.        Our nation has made tremendous progress in ensuring that       every American has clean air to breathe, clean water to drink       and uncontaminated land on which to live, work and play.       Anyone who visits Beijing is reminded of what some cities in       the U.S. once looked like before we went to work as a people       to combat pollution. Much of EPA's work involves preserving       those gains, which should not be taken for granted. There are       also emerging new threats as well as serious gaps in our       environmental safety net, as the drinking water crisis in       Flint, Michigan, painfully demonstrates.        Our environmental laws are based on a partnership that       requires EPA to set national standards and gives states       latitude when implementing them so long as certain minimum       criteria are satisfied. This approach recognizes that       Americans have an equal right to clean air and water, no       matter where they live, and allows states to compete for       business without having to sacrifice public health or       environmental quality.        Our environmental laws include provisions directing EPA to       allow for a ``margin of safety'' when assessing risks, which       is intended to limit exposure to pollutants when it is       reasonable to expect they may harm the public health, even       when all the scientific evidence is not yet in. For example,       EPA's first Administrator, Bill Ruckelshaus, chose to limit       the amount of lead in gasoline before all doubt about its       harmfulness to public health was erased. His action spared       much of the harm that some countries still face as result of       the devastating effects of lead on human health. Similarly,       early action to reduce exposure to fine particle pollution       helpedavoid thousands of premature deaths from heart and lung       disease. The magnitude and severity of those risks did not       become apparent until much later.        Mr. Pruitt's record and public statements strongly suggest       that he does not share the vision or agree with the       underlying principles of our environmental statutes. Mr.       Pruitt has shown no interest in enforcing those laws, a       critically important function for EPA. While serving as       Oklahoma's top law enforcement officer, Mr. Pruitt issued       more than 50 press releases celebrating lawsuits to overturn       EPA standards to limit mercury emissions from power plants,       reduce smog levels in cities and regional haze in parks,       clean up the Chesapeake Bay and control greenhouse gas       emissions.        In contrast, none of Mr. Pruitt's many press releases refer       to any action he has taken to enforce environmental laws or       to actually reduce pollution. This track record likely       reflects his disturbing decision to close the environmental       enforcement unit in his office while establishing a new       litigation team to challenge EPA and other federal agencies.       He has claimed credit for an agreement to protect the       Illinois River that did little more than confirm phosphorus       limits established much earlier, while delaying their       enforcement another three years.        In a similar vein, Mr. Pruitt has gone to disturbing       lengths to advance the views and interests of business. For       example, he signed and sent a letter as Oklahoma Attorney       General criticizing EPA estimates of emissions from oil and       gas wells, without disclosing that it had been drafted in its       entirety by Devon Energy. He filed suit on behalf of Oklahoma       to block a California law requiring humane treatment of       poultry. The federal court dismissed the case after finding       that the lawsuit was brought not to benefit the citizens of       Oklahoma but a handful of large egg producers perfectly       capable of representing their own interests. To mount his       challenge to EPA's rule to reduce carbon pollution from power       plants, he took the unusual step of accepting free help from       a private law firm. In contrast, there is little or no       evidence of Mr. Pruitt taking initiative to protect and       advance public health and environmental protection in his       state. Mr. Pruitt's office has apparently acknowledged 3,000       emails and other documents reflecting communications with       certain oil and gas companies, but has yet to make any of       these available in response to a Freedom of Information Act       request filed more than two years ago.        Contrary to the cooperative federalism that he promotes,       Mr. Pruitt has suggested that EPA should refrain from trying       to control pollution that crosses state lines. For example,       he intervened to support a Farm Bureau lawsuit that would       have overturned a cooperative agreement between five states       and EPA to clean up the Chesapeake Bay (the court rejected       the challenge). When asked how a state can protect its       citizens from pollution that originates outside its borders,       Mr. Pruitt said in his Senate testimony that states should       resolve these disputes on their own, with EPA providing       ``informational'' support once an agreement is reached. But       the 1972 Clean Water Act directs EPA to review state water       quality plans, require any improvements needed to make waters       ``fishable and swimmable,'' and to review and approve plans       to limit pollutant loads to protect water quality. EPA's       power to set standards and limit pollution that crosses state       lines is exactly what ensures every American clean air and       water, and gives states the incentive to negotiate and       resolve transboundary disputes.        We are most concerned about Mr. Pruitt's reluctance to       accept and to act on the strong scientific consensus on       climate change and act accordingly. Our country's own       National Research Council, the principal operating arm of the       National Academies of Science and Engineering, concluded in a       2010 report requested by Congress that human activity is       altering the climate to an extent that poses grave risks to       Americans' health and welfare. More recent scientific data       and analyses have only confirmed the Council's conclusion and       added to the urgency of addressing the problem.        Despite this and other authoritative warnings about the       dangers of climate change, Mr. Pruitt persists in pointing to       uncertainty about the precise extent of humanity's       contribution to the problem as a basis for resisting taking       any regulatory action to help solve it. At his Senate       confirmation hearing, he stated that ``science tells us that       the climate is changing, and that human activity in some       manner impacts that change. The ability to measure with       precision the degree and extent of that impact, and what to       do about it, are subject to continuing debate and dialogue,       and well it should be.'' This is a familiar dodge--      emphasizing uncertainty about the precise amount of       humanity's contribution while ignoring the broad scientific       consensus that human activities are largely responsible for       dangerous warming of our planet and that action is urgently       needed before it is too late.        Mr. Pruitt's indulgence in this dodge raises the       fundamental question of whether he agrees with the       precautionary principle reflected in our nation's       environmental statutes. Faithful execution of our       environmental laws requires effectively combating climate       change to minimize its potentially catastrophic impacts       before it is too late.        The American people have been served by EPA Administrators,       Republicans and Democrats, who have embraced their       responsibility to protect public health and the environment.       Different administrators have come to different conclusions       about how best to apply the law in view of the science, and       many of their decisions have been challenged in court,       sometimes successfully, for either going too far or not far       enough. But in the large majority of cases it was evident to       us that they put the public's welfare ahead of private       interests. Scott Pruitt has not demonstrated this same       commitment.        Thank you for considering our views.        (All signatories are former EPA employees)
