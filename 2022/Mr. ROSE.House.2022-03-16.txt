 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to honor Roy and Wilma Brown,  who celebrated their 80th wedding anniversary this Monday.   Married on March 14, 1942, at the Cumberland County Courthouse, Roy  and Wilma have remained at each other's side ever since.   Through the ups and downs of raising five children on a family farm  in middle Tennessee, in the early days with no running water or  electricity, the Browns have been no stranger to hardship but have  always leaned on the Lord. On their 69th anniversary, Wilma said: ``God  has blessed us so much, and we are so thankful.''   Madam Speaker, today, I thank Roy and Wilma Brown for serving as a  reminder to all of us, both young and old, of the power and longevity  of true love. May both Roy and Wilma have a blessed 80th anniversary,  and may this day serve as an inspiration for generations to come.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding time  tonight.   Madam Speaker, despite what President Biden and congressional  Democrats have to say, higher prices at the fuel pump are not because  of a Putin price increase.   The price of a gallon of gas increased from $2.31 a gallon since  President Biden's inauguration to $3.48 the week before Putin's  invasion of Ukraine. That is a 50 percent increase before the invasion  of Ukraine even began.   But make no mistake, the Biden administration is doing everything  they can to blame the increase on Russia's invasion of Ukraine. They  have turned to their allies in the mainstream media to carry their  talking points.   But I urge all Americans not to let the headlines or TikTok  influencers fool you. This is a crisis caused by President Biden and  congressional Democrats' anti-energy policies, not Putin's invasion of  Ukraine.   Unfortunately, we all knew this was coming when President Biden said  on the campaign trail that he would ``transition away from the oil  industry.''   During his first days in office, President Biden declared war against  American energy. He moved his plan into action by canceling the  Keystone pipeline and other projects, imposing new regulations on the  oil and gas industry, and stalling new leases on oil and gas projects  on Federal lands.   If the President has a legitimate plan to lower energy prices and  fight inflation, we, the American people, would love to see it.   But until we do, I can only guess the President's plan is what he has  done since taking office: spend trillions of dollars and hope Americans  purchase expensive electric vehicles. That is not a plan. It is a pipe  dream.   The truth is that this is not the America President Biden inherited.  Under President Trump, America was energy independent, even a net oil  exporter. Inflation was well under control. Gas was less than $2.50 a  gallon, and our enemies were our enemies, not potential trade partners.   But the price of a gallon of gas, along with inflation, has increased  every single month since President Biden was inaugurated. The resulting  harm to our country has been mostly self-inflicted and largely driven  by Democrats' massive deficit spending and by the fact that the  President has declared war on the U.S. oil and gas industry from his  first day in office.   Every step he has taken to hinder the oil and gas industry diminishes  capitalism, the very engine of our economy and our relatively high  standard of living.   Whether it is in our schools or with our healthcare decisions,  President Biden's administration wants you to do what they say instead  of trusting what has made us the most prosperous country in the history  of the world.    Republicans in Congress stand ready to implement policies to make  America energy independent again. It is time for the President to  reverse the war against American energy and recognize that the solution  to his energy crisis exists right under our feet. Still, the President  refuses to pull his head out of the sand to tap into it.   He will stop at nothing to satisfy his leftwing base, even if it is  at the expense of everyday, hardworking Americans, who I am proud to  represent in middle Tennessee.
