 Madam President, yesterday something extremely rare  happened here in this Chamber, something so unusual that only a few of  us current Senators had ever seen it before--a rollcall vote that did  not include the name of our President pro tempore and distinguished  colleague from Iowa, Senator Chuck Grassley.   Before yesterday, the senior Senator from Iowa had not missed a  single vote in this body since 1993, when he was in Iowa helping with  historic flooding.   Since then, across 27 years and 8,927 votes, Senator Grassley had  shown up for every single one. It is by far the longest such streak in  Senate history.   Senator Grassley broke the previous record back in January of 2016  and obviously continued to extend it for almost 5 years.   This show of diligence and dedication is remarkable by any measure.  But because of who Senator Grassley is, it hasn't seemed remarkable at  all. That incredible commitment to serving Iowans and working around  the clock is just who our colleague is. That devotion is just his daily  routine.   This is the Senator who manages to visit all 99 counties in Iowa  every single year. We call it the ``full Grassley.'' Nearly 9,000  consecutive Senate votes must have seemed like a cakewalk by  comparison.   But yesterday, our colleague's streak had to be temporarily placed on  hold. On the advice of doctors, after close contact with someone who  had later tested positive for the coronavirus, Senator Grassley began  self-quarantining yesterday morning.   Later in the day, our colleague let us know he had tested positive  himself, underscoring why his good judgment to follow doctor's orders  while awaiting his test result was the right decision.   So our colleague's historic run has been put on pause for the same  reason that it was compiled in the first place--leadership, service to  others, and a determination to set the right example.   On Monday, in his floor remarks, our colleague reminded all Americans  of our duties in this moment:         Although promising vaccines for the coronavirus are on the       horizon, it is more important than ever to stop the surge. .       . . Wash your hands; limit your activity outside your       household; social distance; wear a mask. We are going to get       through this together, but we need everyone to do their part.   [[Page S7048]]     All of the Senate's thoughts and prayers are with our distinguished  colleague, who reported yesterday evening that he still feels fine. We  hope that will remain the case. Certainly, if any Member of this body  has the good health and stamina to kick the virus to the curb, it is  Senator Grassley.   So we will look forward to seeing him soon.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  cloture motion with respect to the McNeel nomination ripen at 5:30 p.m.  Monday, November 30.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S7061, November 18, 2020, second column, the following  appears:  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent  that the cloture motion with respect to the McNeal nomination  ripen at 5:30 p.m. Monday, November 30.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, for six decades, my dear friend Mira  Ball has been helping Kentucky families realize one of the cornerstones  of the American dream: owning their own home. Earlier this year, Mira  was honored for a lifetime of achievement in our Commonwealth with  Leadership Kentucky's Flame of Excellence Award. Today, I would like to  congratulate Mira for this latest recognition of her contributions to  our home State.   With her late husband, Don, Mira built Ball Homes into a respected  business helping improve the lives of Kentuckians for generations. Don  led the sales, and Mira kept the books. Together, they made a premier  team helping make home ownership a reality for families across the  region. The organization was made better still as their children, Ray,  Mike, and Lisa, took their own leadership roles. Today, the company  builds over 1,000 high-quality homes each year.   Mira's contributions to Kentucky extend far beyond her  entrepreneurial achievement. She is a trailblazing leader and  philanthropist with special emphases on the health and education of our  next generation. Saying she would only get involved in organizations  where she could really make a difference, this former schoolteacher has  helped steer the future of some of Kentucky's prominent institutions.  In fact, Mira was the first woman to chair the boards of trustees for  the University of Kentucky, Midway College, and the Lexington Chamber  of Commerce.   In 2018, Mira made the single largest scholarship gift in UK's  history of $10 million to help Kentucky students access higher  education and the opportunity for a better future. The scholarships  focus on students from Nelson and Henderson Counties, Mira and Don's  native homes, respectively. The gift is only one snapshot of years of  philanthropy that will benefit the school and all who rely on it.   Across our Commonwealth, families and communities can see the results  of Mira's work. Families living in homes built by the Ball have adapted  this year, turning kitchen tables into offices and classrooms. Students  supported by Mira's philanthropy were given an extra leg up. Anyone who  turns on Kentucky Educational Television, KET, or receives help from  the United Way has benefited from her vision and immense generosity.   So, it is my privilege to join the chorus praising Mira's leadership  in Kentucky. She has not only paved a remarkable path, but she is also  helping new leaders find their own. On behalf of my Senate colleagues,  I would like to congratulate Mira Ball for this award and wish her  years of continued success in Kentucky.   The Kentucky Builders Journal recently published a profile on Mira  Ball's career. I ask unanimous consent the article be printed in the  Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:             [From the Kentucky Builders Journal, Summer 2020]                   Mira Ball Honored for Her Life's Work         Earlier this year, the statewide leadership development       program Leadership Kentucky awarded its annual Flame of       Excellence Award to Lexington businesswoman Mira Ball. The       award is given to an outstanding Kentuckians who ``bravely       goes before and lights the way for others.'' Ball has       certainly led a life that fits that description. As a member       of the home building community, she is a role model to future       generations in areas of leadership, business management and       community involvement and service.        While the Ball name is well known in the Lexington area,       Ball and her late husband, Don, have both had impact across       the state. The couple incorporated Ball Homes in 1959 and       immediately focused on the first-time home buyer market with       their first model home in the Cardinal Valley neighborhood       off Versailles Road. Their goal was to build homes in a price       range that Lexington city police and firefighters could       afford. At the time, police and firefighters were required to       live within city limits.        More than 60 years later, the company remains family owned       and still prides itself on making home ownership a reality       for those who never thought it possible.        ``If you've got a heart for people, you want them to be       able to have an affordable home that they can live in and       enjoy,'' said Mira Ball. ``You see what's happening with       zoning and the availability of land, and you get very       concerned about the fact that the people who are the ordinary       workers can't afford to live there.''        Ball Homes has built more homes all over Lexington as well       as in the Louisville and Knoxville markets. Don was       passionate about affordable housing throughout his career,       and the Balls' daughter Lisa Ball Sharp shares her father's       interest and has served on Lexington's Affordable Housing       Task Force.        Ball is still involved in the business although the Balls'       three children, Ray, Mike and Lisa, have been leading the       company since the 1980s. Ray took over acquisition and       development, Mike oversees construction management, and Lisa       is in charge of property management and sale. Ball said that       even as her husband let go of the day-to-day decision-making       long ago, she stayed active in the business long after       because ``nobody wanted to do what I did.'' What Ball did was       make sure the bottom line always added up.                            accounting for success         Ball first took an interest in accounting and business       while attending the University of Kentucky, where she met her       future husband and worked in the Placement Service office.       Although she graduated with a teaching certificate and taught       junior high school students for one year, Ball left teaching       to stay home when her children were born. As the family and       the building business grew, she became the bookkeeper and       behind-the-scenes partner while her husband became the       business's public face.        ``Don was a good salesperson,'' said Ball. ``He had the       ideas. And I was the one who kept things straight.''        She said that while it's important to be ready for new       opportunities and challenges, good timing had a lot to do       with their success. Ball Homes has also benefited from new       ideas as her children began to lead. They expanded into new       markets, developed new neighborhoods and formed a property       management business within the company.        ``There's a lot of interaction between Ray, Mike and Lisa.       But they work well together,'' said Ball. ``The building       business is something that you can be very proud of; you're       furnishing homes for people.''        When asked how she had managed to raise children who wanted       to follow into the family business and shared their parents'       commitment to the community, Ball mentioned the example set       by her and Don's parents.        ``Our parents were really good examples for my children.       Hard work was expected and something you should enjoy and       helping other people was important. Some of that empathy came       naturally to Don,'' said Ball. ``I think you have to be       sincere and live your life like you should and be a good       example, but I also thank the Lord every day for my parents       and what they gave me. It wasn't wealth but they had good       values and that's what was more important.''        ``I'm sure too that having us both work in the business and       talking about things in front of [our children] made them       familiar with what went on in the building business, both the       ups and downs. There have been times when we thought we'd       never sell another house with interest rates at 18% and 19%.       They were aware of that growing up and understood it. Don       always understood the impact of high interest rates on       affordability, and Ray really gets that too.''                             focused on education         Her husband is remembered for his efforts to aid the       homeless and addicted across the state through his roles as       state representative and service on the Kentucky Housing       Corporation. Ball's own civic contributions have focused on       health and education. She has served with a wide variety of       organizations including the PTA, the American Cancer Society,       the United Way, Kentucky Baptist Homes for Children, the St.       Joseph Hospital Foundation, the Kentucky Historical Society,       the Governor's Mansion Preservation Foundation, and the       Kentucky Horse Park. In 1991, she became the first woman to       serve as chairman of the Lexington Chamber of Commerce. She       was also the first woman elected to the Kentucky Utilities       board of directors, the first woman chairman of the Midway       College board of trustees, and the first woman to serve as       chair of the University of Kentucky board of trustees. She       was appointed to the State Economic Development Task Force       and the Governor's Commission on Tax Policy. She continues to       serve on the Endowment Board of Kentucky Educational       Television.        ``I think I came along at a time when a lot of       organizations thought it's time for a woman. I wasn't going       to get involved with any organization if I wasn't going to       actually work on it,'' said Ball. ``There are so many things       in this world that you feel like you can't make a difference.       But education  [[Page S7070]]       is the No. 1 thing that will change Kentuckians for the       better. It's where you can really do more to help.''        One of the problems Ball has tried to address has been       lowering the attrition rate of returning students who can't       keep up with tuition costs. In 2018, she gave the University       of Kentucky $10 million to establish a scholarship fund that       will focus on students from Nelson County, where she grew up       and Henderson County, where Don was raised. It will fund       dozens of undergraduate and graduate scholarships in the two       counties and surrounding areas, focused specifically on       addressing unmet financial need.                           Impact on HBA membership         While her efforts have been highly publicized in the world       of higher learning, Ball recognizes the benefits of work       experience and involvement in organizations to promote       lifelong learning.        ``My work experience at UK was as valuable as any classroom       experiences I had,'' said Ball. ``I think experience is a big       educator, and sometimes you have to make your own. I enjoy       learning about new things all the time. That's the reason I       like KET so much.''        The Balls were active members of the home builders       association and were jointly named Builders of the Year by       the Lexington HBA in 1992. Attending meetings like the       International Builders Show was a source of ongoing learning       for her.        ``I used to go to those meetings, and there wasn't a time       that I didn't come back with something valuable. I went to       all the financial seminars, and I can still remember some of       the speakers and what they said,'' she laughed.        Ball points to her upbringing and her Christian faith for       prompting her to serve her community through the years. She       talked about a young minister who influenced her to see all       people as deserving of love and respect. As she describes how       she felt when she visited the Hope Center and other drug and       alcohol addiction recovery programs. Ball's compassion for       those who struggle in her community is evident.        ``You never visit those places without thinking how blessed       you are,'' she said. ``If you just go in and really talk to       people, you get the idea that you've just got to help.''                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of the following calendar bills  en bloc: Calendar Nos. 441, 443, 445 through 451, 494 through 497, 532,  and 534.
