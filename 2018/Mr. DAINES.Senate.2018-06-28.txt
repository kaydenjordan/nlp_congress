 Mr. President, I am very glad my Senate colleagues joined  me in supporting the Senate farm bill, in fact, with a very strong vote  of 86 to 11.   This farm bill is good news for Montana farmers and for Montana  ranchers, and it is going to help to provide certainty for Montana  agriculture in these most difficult times because agriculture is  Montana's No. 1 industry, and it supports tens of thousands of jobs in  our State. Yet, with more than 25,000 family farms and ranches in  Montana alone, it is clear that ag is more than just an economic driver  in our State; it is very much a way of life.   That is why, as Montana's Representative on the U.S. Senate Ag  Committee, I fought to ensure that this farm bill reflects the  priorities that Montana farmers and Montana ranchers have shared  directly with me. Some of these priorities are the crop insurance and  the sugar program; ag research funding at Montana State University, as  well as ag research stations all across Montana; and prioritizing rural  broadband for Montana's underserved communities, as well as supporting  and maintaining conservation programs that are important to our  farmers, to our ranchers, and to our sportsmen.   This farm bill is also critically important to the health of our  national forests. Last year in Montana, catastrophic wildfires harmed  numerous communities, and it cost our State millions of dollars. I am  glad to have secured important forest reforms that are critical to  healthy forests, to Montana timber jobs, and to wildlife habitat, such  as encouraging the coordination among the Forest Service and State  forestry agencies to restore our forests to reduce the risk of wildfire  and allowing the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management to  enter into agreements with counties, as well as with States and Tribes,  to implement forest management projects on national forests and public  lands. Additionally, there is a provision that will support more  innovation, as well as to develop new markets for Montana's timber  industry.   These are important wins, but I want to make something very clear  that there is still so much more we can do to help improve the health  of our forests and support Montana's farmers and ranchers. In fact, in  Montana, as well as across the West, we are seeing extensive  collaboration. Groups are collaborating--conservation groups, wildlife  groups, wood products stakeholders, along with our counties--and they  are working together to determine responsible forest management  practices.   These partners know very well that active management is critical to  restoring a healthy forest and that it helps to reduce wildfire risks.  It is important that we don't allow extremists to hinder this most  important work because, today, it takes 18 to 24 months to do many of  these environmental reviews. After that is done, many projects in  Montana are litigated, and this can add years of delay.  [[Page S4719]]    In fact, listen to this: There are 29 timber sales in Montana that  are currently impacted by fringe litigation. Just today, we were  informed that another timber project in Montana has been delayed by a  restraining order because of litigation. That makes 30. This project  was scheduled to start this coming Monday, July 2, and now those folks  will be out of work. Reducing redtape and combating chronic litigation  doesn't erode public trust. In fact, it safeguards it. It does so by  ensuring that the public feedback of the majority isn't obstructed by a  few extreme dissenters.   This disastrous Ninth Circuit Cottonwood ruling must also be  addressed because it imposed unnecessary paperwork that even the Obama  administration has said had the ``potential to cripple'' Federal land  management without conservation benefit.   My amendments would address this excessive redtape while continuing  to ensure that robust, science-driven environmental review and public  engagement would remain. Many similar provisions are found in the House  bill as well.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the inclusion of these  amendments as we work together now, with the House, in a conference of  the final farm bill.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Tom Labrie of Phillips County for his 18 years of serving  his community as the head chef at the Great Northern Restaurant.   Tom was born and raised in Malta. After graduating from Malta High  School, Tom began working at the Great Northern Restaurant where he is  a self-taught chef. He has since worked at the Great Northern  Restaurant for 18 years, working his way up the line to head chef. He  and his wife Anna have two kids and are active members of the Malta  community.   Tom's time at the restaurant stands out for two reasons: his hard  work and his skills in the kitchen. Although he is the head chef, he  does more than cook the food. Other employees and customers find him  filling in wherever help is needed, including cashing out customers.  While he is a self-taught chef, the food he creates makes the Great  Northern Restaurant and Hotel stand out in Malta and the greater  Phillips community.   Tom is the secret ingredient to the success of the Great Northern  Restaurant. The employees are grateful for his leadership and hard work  as it keeps the restaurant running smoothly.   Congratulations, Tom, on your successful career and impact on Malta's  community. I look forward to my next stop at the Great Northern  Restaurant to try your famous chicken fried steak.
