 Madam President, I rise in opposition to the  resolution by Congress to overturn a law that was duly passed and  enacted by the elected representatives of the people of the District of  Columbia.   I support self-determination. I support self-governance. I support  full democracy for the nearly 700,000 residents of the District of  Columbia. Citizens who pay more Federal taxes collectively than the  people in 21 States, citizens who serve their country in the Armed  Forces, citizens who live in the Capital of the oldest democracy  deserve the same rights to full democracy and self-determination as the  citizens who live in any other State or any other city in the United  States of America.   That is why I have long championed and supported the cause of DC  statehood. But I want to point out, that is a fight not only for voting  representation in the House and the Senate but also for the principle  of local economy, the principle of self-determination also known as  home rule.   In my view, this resolution is an attack on the democratic rights of  the people of the District of Columbia, which has its own duly elected  democratic representatives: the Mayor and the DC Council. Its residents  and citizens are fully capable of deciding their own law and deciding  their own future.   The Congress should not be overriding the will of the people of DC as  reflected in their elected representatives. This process of directly  overruling a law passed by the District of Columbia has not been used  for 30 years--not for 30 years--and we should not start it now.   This bill was passed by the DC Council. It was vetoed by the Mayor.  And I share some of the concerns that have been expressed by the Mayor.  But then, the city council overruled the Mayor's veto by a vote of 12  to 1. And here is what the Mayor of the District of Columbia says; that  while she had differences with what the council did, she strongly,  strongly encourages this Senate to uphold the larger principle of  democracy for the people of the District of Columbia.   Here is a letter she sent to all of us on February 23.         [A]s Mayor and the Chief Executive Officer of the District,       I call on all senators who share a commitment to basic       democratic principles of self-determination and local control       to vote ``NO''--    Vote no--       on any disapproval resolutions involving duly enacted laws of       the District of Columbia.    The Mayor points out in this letter that she is in a back-and-forth  with the council to try to address some of the concerns that she has  expressed, concerns which I understand and which I share. But she is  very clear that the U.S. Congress should not be bigfooting the  decisions made by the elected representatives of the District of  Columbia.   No other jurisdiction in the United States of America has its laws  subject to veto by the U.S. Congress. We all have Governors of our  State. We all have State legislators. We have cities with mayors and  elected councils. No one here would appreciate the U.S. Senate and  House of Representatives interfering and overturning decisions made by  their State representatives or their local representatives, even if we  might disagree with some of those decisions from time to time. And yet  that is what we are doing to the people of the District of Columbia  having elected their representatives, the Mayor and the council, to  represent them.   We must ensure that the people who live in the Capital of the world's  oldest democracy have the same democratic rights as the people who live  in every other part of the country.   Now, I do want to address some of the particulars here because we  have heard from lots of people, especially our Republican colleagues,  that what the DC Council did and the DC government did was so egregious  that we have really no alternative but to make a decision we haven't  made for 30 years, which is to overturn a law that was duly passed by  the DC government.   So let's take a look at it.   Even opponents within the District of Columbia acknowledge that the  majority--the great majority--of the revised Criminal Code is  noncontroversial, providing essential updates and clarification to a  criminal code that is in desperate need of modernization. The Mayor  herself who vetoed the legislation says she supports 95 percent of it  and has offered concrete proposals to address the other concerns that  she points out that even though she disagrees with 5 percent, that is  no reason for the U.S. Congress to overturn a law that was passed by  the government of DC.   Why did the District of Columbia revise its code? Because it is  hopelessly outdated and confusing. It was written in 1901, more than  120 years ago. Many of our States have updated our laws since then-- most of them, if not all of them--but in DC, while they made some  changes to some parts over that 120 years, they had never taken a  comprehensive look at the DC Criminal Code. We all know a lot has  changed since 1901.   And so the revised DC Criminal Code is the result of an exhaustive  effort led by the Criminal Code Reform Commission, an independent DC  agency established in 2016 and comprised of nonpartisan experts. The  commission drafted the code over nearly 5 years in a fully public  process that included 51 public meetings, extensive public feedback,  and robust negotiations.   The advisory group that unanimously approved the recommended changes  included representatives from the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the  District of Columbia and the Office of the Attorney General for the  District of Columbia.   The new code removes some obsolete provisions. It ensures that  sentences are more proportionate to the actual sentencing. It  simplifies overlapping charges and addresses missing and inconsistent  laws that create legal loopholes that people have been able to slip  through.   Now, while I may not have supported every one of these hundreds of  provisions in the revised Criminal Code if I were sitting on the DC  Council--I am not sitting on the DC City Council and  [[Page S691]]  neither is any Senator in this Chamber. None of my 99 other colleagues  were there to hear all the testimony that was heard by those who made  these decisions on behalf of their constituents as elected  representatives.   Let's dig a little deeper into some of the changes that were made  because listening to some of the public discourse, you would think--I  know my friend, the Senator from New Jersey, has heard this--you would  think that, boy, the DC Council just went wild with this leftist effort  to loosen the laws and let criminals run free.   Well, let's take a look at what they did. They raised some penalties.  In some cases, they looked at actual sentences, not just in DC but  other States, and lowered them, and in some cases, they closed legal  loopholes.   Here is where they raised penalties: attempted murder. The current  maximum sentence in the District of Columbia is 5 years in prison for  attempted murder; the maximum under the new DC law, 23\1/2\ years for  attempted murder.   How does this compare to other States?   Well, there are at least seven of our States that have maximum  penalties for attempted murder below the new DC maximum penalty for  attempted murder.   I see the Republican leader is not on the floor. The State of  Kentucky has a lower sentence for attempted murder than the revised DC  Code has. Maybe tomorrow I should introduce a piece of legislation to  raise the penalty for attempted murder in the State of Kentucky because  I just don't think that theirs is good enough for the people of  Kentucky. That is what we are doing here. We are substituting our  judgment for the considered judgment of the people of the District of  Columbia.   Let's look at another area: attempted sexual assault. The DC  government increased penalties for sexual assault from 5 years to 15  years. Again, I surveyed some of our other States. You know, we have  Senators from a number of States--at least six--that have lower  penalties for attempted sexual assault than the current, new, proposed  DC law, including, once again, the State of Kentucky. The State of  Kentucky has a lower maximum penalty for attempted sexual assault than  the new, revised DC law has.   For Federal assault on a police officer, they raised it from the  current max of 10 to 14 years. For misdemeanor sexual assault, the  maximum will now be 2 years, up from 180 days.   The statute also includes new offenses. As I say, we are modernizing  the code, including nonvehicular negligent homicide and reckless  endangerment with a firearm and new penalties, such as for offenses  against vulnerable adults, in order to strengthen public safety in the  District of Columbia after having listened to their constituents.   It also includes increased penalty enhancements for aggravating  factors--such as the presence of a firearm, such as property damage or  having prior convictions--in addition to the base penalties that are  established for various crimes.   Now, that is where they increase penalties, and that is where they  close loopholes, but when you are doing comprehensive reform, you look  at everything. You don't necessarily measure justice just because a  maximum penalty for something goes up. Sometimes you measure justice by  making sure that the penalty is proportionate to the crime.   We have had lots of debates on this floor, and the Senator from New  Jersey, my friend Mr. Booker, has been front and center in leading the  charge when it comes to criminal justice reform because we have an  absolute scandal in the United States of America about the mass  incarceration of people of color.   So when the DC Council passes some of these laws, people apparently  ignore all of the cases they are increasing penalties for--things like  attempted murder--and zeroing in on some areas where they are actually  bringing sentences in line with what judges are doing based on their  discretion.   A lot of attention has been given to the issue of armed carjacking  because, in this case, the DC government lowered the maximum penalty  for armed carjacking. They did that to bring the maximum penalty more  in line with what the actual sentencing was. The current carjacking  maximum after the change is 21 years. It went from 40 years down to 24  years.   Now, here is the thing: I looked again, as I know my friend from New  Jersey did, at what other States' laws are for armed carjacking, their  maximum penalties. Once again, in many cases, they are lower than the  new DC statute, the new DC penalty. In fact, a lot of States don't even  have armed carjacking statutes. So if you want a point of comparison  for those States, you would look at armed robbery.   When you look at States with armed carjacking statutes and when you  look at the penalties they apply for armed robbery in carjacking cases,  you will find that 15 States have lower penalties than the new, lower  DC maximum penalty for armed carjacking. Fifteen States represented by  Senators in this Chamber who want to override DC law have sentences for  armed robbery or armed carjacking lower than what DC's new penalty is.  Those States include Alaska; they include Kansas; they include North  Dakota; and yes, once again, they include the State of Kentucky. The  State of Kentucky seems to be an outlier here in terms of low sentences  for many violent crimes, lower than the newly revised code passed by  the DC government.   I am not going to go into all of the other details here. I think my  colleagues get the picture, which is that the elected representatives  of the District of Columbia, after an exhaustive review, made some  decisions about criminal justice reform. I don't agree with every  single one of them that they made, but I will tell you this: What they  did is entirely defensible, and it certainly doesn't rise to the level  of the U.S. Congress, for the first time in 30 years, bigfooting their  decisions.   That is also the testimony we received from a number of attorneys  general of our States. Everyone--including, I am proud to say, my  attorney general, Anthony Brown, a former Member of the House--wrote to  us all. They pointed out in their letter that the question of public  safety is best left to those who are closest to the community and who  are in the best position to decide these laws. They say: We know from  experience that each of our jurisdictions is very different and at  times requires different policy approaches.   A law that makes sense for one community may not make sense for  another. If the State of Kentucky wants to have lower criminal  penalties than the District of Columbia, that is their decision. As I  said, based on today's action, maybe I will get up tomorrow morning and  introduce a bill to change the criminal penalties in the State of  Kentucky.   The bottom line is this: The people who live in the District of  Columbia deserve the same right as the people who live in every other  part of our country--the right to self-determination and democracy.  That is what they did in passing this new law, and we should not be  substituting our judgment for that of the duly-elected representatives  of the people of the District of Columbia.   I now yield to the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Booker.
