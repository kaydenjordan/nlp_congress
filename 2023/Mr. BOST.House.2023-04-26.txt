 Mr. Speaker, there is a lot of talk on this floor and  actually outside the Chamber today from the other side of the aisle  about this bill cutting veterans. Well, I am going to tell you, as the  only veteran among the four VA committee leaders responsible for  ensuring veterans have the care and services they have earned, and as a  father of a veteran, a grandfather of a veteran, a grandson of a  veteran, a son of a veteran, and a nephew of a veteran, you better  believe that I am dead serious that we are not cutting veterans, and I  mean it.   I don't know how much clearer we can be. Speaker McCarthy has been  very clear; we are not cutting veterans. Chairwoman Granger has said we  are not cutting veterans. I, as the chairman of the Veterans' Affairs  Committee: We are not cutting veterans. The White House and Democrats  know.   We can get our fiscal house in order while ensuring our  servicemembers and veterans are taken care of. Yet, with no regard for  the impact of their words, they continue to speak lies about how House  Republicans are cutting veterans' benefits, and it is false. It is  dangerous rhetoric and you ought to be ashamed of yourselves.   Simply put, you are placing politics and playing politics with our  veterans and their lives and their concerns. Veterans are not political  pawns to advance an agenda.   CBO says that the Limit, Save, Grow Act will grow the economy and  save American taxpayers money, which is a good thing. At the end of the  day, our veterans--you know what, they are taxpayers, too. They are  grandmothers and mothers and grandfathers and fathers. You know what?  They are concerned about their children and grandchildren.   If you believe in building an America that is worth our veterans'  selfless sacrifice, I urge you to stop playing politics, come to the  table and support the bill.
