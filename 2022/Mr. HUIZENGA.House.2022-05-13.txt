 Madam Speaker, I rise today to welcome home Corporal  Laverne ``Dirk'' Van Dyke, who sacrificed his life during World War II,  and was finally laid to rest in his and my hometown of Zeeland,  Michigan, after nearly 80 years.   U.S. Army Air Force Corporal Dirk Van Dyke served as a flight  engineer on a B-25C aircraft in the Pacific theater when his plane went  missing. Corporal Van Dyke and six other crewmembers were last seen  departing an airport on the reconnaissance mission off the coast of New  Guinea on January 18, 1943.   Despite an extensive search, members of the Fifth Air Force were not  able to locate the plane or the airmen. Many years later the wreckage  was discovered in the mountains of Papua New Guinea, and the remains of  Corporal Van Dyke and others were seemingly identified but were  inconclusive. However, recently the Department of Defense officially  considered Corporal Van Dyke accounted for.   Madam Speaker, we will never forget the selfless actions, sacrifice,  and dedication to our country by these servicemembers and what they  displayed.   To Corporal Van Dyke's family, our entire Nation holds you in our  prayers as we get ready and prepare for Memorial Day, and as you  welcome Dirk home as an American hero. Rest easy, Corporal Van Dyke.  Rest easy.                            ____________________
