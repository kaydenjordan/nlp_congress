 Mr. Speaker, as we face the COVID-19 health and economic  crisis, childcare centers across our country are on the verge of  collapse. The consequences can be felt throughout our society: From  children, to childcare workers, to working parents--disproportionately  women--who were already struggling to stay afloat given the acute  national shortage of affordable childcare services. For these parents,  who depend on childcare in order to maintain their careers and pay  their bills, the answer is more affordable childcare, not less.   The Child Care Is Essential Act would provide direct financial  support for childcare providers during and after this crisis. The Child  Care for Economic Recovery Act would deliver crucial Federal  investments in childcare facilities. These are two immediate steps that  we can take on behalf of working families right now.   Once we pass this legislation, our focus must turn to addressing the  lack of affordability in childcare more so that we can finally ensure  that every working family who needs childcare can obtain and afford it.  We must support working families by expanding access to at-home  learning and childcare.                            ____________________
