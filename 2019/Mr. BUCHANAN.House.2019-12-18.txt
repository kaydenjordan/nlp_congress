 Madam Speaker, I will vote today against both Articles  of Impeachment because they are without merit and setting a dangerous  precedent for our country. This political vendetta is an abuse of the  impeachment process and would subvert the votes of 63 million  Americans.   Just because the President's opponents are afraid that he will win  reelection is no excuse for weaponizing impeachment. No President in  history has been impeached 10 months before an election.   Elections are the heart of our democracy. Our Founding Fathers  devised a simple way to remove a President if you disagree with him. It  is called an election, and we have one coming up in less than a year.   Madam Speaker, let's let the people decide this next November.
