 Mr. Speaker, I join my friend from Michigan. There  should be no one who rises to object, in spite of the fact that we know  there are challenges in this bill.   But I hear these words: ``We are scared. We are stressed,'' the words  of an emergency room doctor. These are the ones who are on the front  lines right now, today, when we have the largest number of cases as a  nation and over 1,100 dead.   Now we have $500 billion for industries, with oversight; $350 billion  for small businesses, which includes the microbusinesses, the gig  economy, and faith institutions and nonprofits. I will fight to make  sure all of our nonprofits get it. We also have direct payments for  individuals, as well as $100 billion for hospitals.   I watched as the Memorial Medical Center gave out over 1,100 tests, a  small hospital putting themselves on the front line.   Here are my words, Mr. Speaker: No man is an island. Each man's death  diminishes me, for I am involved in mankind.   We must get this passed for the people of the United States.   Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees on the Judiciary  and on Homeland Security, and founder and Co-Chair of the Congressional  Corona virus Task force, I rise in strong support of H.R. 748, the  ``Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act'' or ``CARES  Act,'' which is the third and latest bipartisan assistance and relief  package passed by Congress and provides more than $2 trillion to  address the adverse health and economic impacts of the COVID-19  pandemic.   I quote Dr. Megan Ranney, an Emergency Room Physician: ``We are  scared. We are stressed. And we're worried about what comes next and  about our ability to take care of our patients and our communities. As  well as our ability to take care of ourselves.''   Therefore, I rise to thank all of the First Responders all over the  nation--medical personnel are First Responders.   I specifically, thank my Hometown Houston local leadership--mayors,  the County Judge, School leaders and all volunteers--thank you.   COVID-19 is the great equalizer--we all can become ill from it--no  matter if we are rich or poor; the powerful or the powerless.   We will all succeed, or we will all fail--today we are here to make  sure that all of America succeeds.   Tens of thousands of medical personnel and professionals are on the  frontlines of a battle over the survival of tens of millions of people  in the United States.  [[Page H1834]]    We as a nation must place our trust and faith in these heroes as they  take to the battlefield of emergency rooms, ICUs and beyond to win this  war against COVID-19 because they are the only warriors capable of  waging a successful battle against this implacable foe.   The title of the Greatest Generation that ever was--is held by the  generation that fought World War II.   They did not bestow that title upon themselves--it was future  generations who looked back on what they had done and how their  sacrifices saved future generations from war, famine, and untold  horrors from authoritarian regimes.   Future generations will judge what we do in our moment of crisis to  save them from the effects of this pandemic and the consequences of  future pandemics that may threaten to emerge in the future.   Let us be judged as worthy to be on the list of Great Generations to  have guided this nation during some of its darkest hours into the light  of day--still shining as that beacon of freedom for the world.   The needs of families are three-fold: health maintenance, healthcare,  and financial.   This is just the third measure to address the needs of the American  people, but more will need to be done as this national--no global  disaster unfolds.   I and my fellow Democrats will man the ramparts of this nation and  keep a close eye on the frontlines of this battle to ensure that the  people in the fight have everything they need to win this war.   The economic and emotional stress that families and working people  are under in this nation during this crisis is tremendous and they need  the help that we Democrats have fought and won for them in each of the  bills passed so far and in this measure.   I join my fellow Democrats in supporting passage of each of the bills  that provide essential tools to local, state, tribal, territorial  governments and to individuals and families to help them weather this  storm.   I fought for cash payments for all Americans up to $3000 per adult  and $1500 per child and the bill provides for $1,500 per adult and  $7,500 for a family of five.   I sought relief for the entertainment industry including freelancers,  independent contractors and those in the music, dance, and visual  performing arts--the bill provides for enhanced unemployment  compensation of $600 a week for any worker affected by COVID-19 to be  combined with other benefits to replay 100 percent of wages for the  average worker.   I fought for the development of a small business grant program funded  through the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program by way of  H.R. 6292, ``The COVID-19 Recovery Small Business Grants Act.'' This  legislation is modeled after my Hurricane Harvey Relief legislation and  it should include enhanced support for restaurants and bars. Add $125  million dollars more to the CDBG account--the bill provides $500  billion in grants and interest free loans. I requested much needed  relief for non-profit organizations including faith-based institutions  who are closed due to the Coronavirus and the allows these entities to  access the $350 billion in funding provided to small businesses.   I fought for and will continue to fight for small businesses who  purchased business interruption insurance coverage are being told by  insurance companies that they will not cover the Coronavirus.   I wrote to the President requesting that he invoke the Defense  Production Act to fully implemented his authority to meet the need for  personal protective equipment, medical supplies and technology to save  lives.   I sought support for the aviation industry in the form of low  interest loans, and I will continue to work to include them in the next  aid package with the condition that they must agree to no employee  layoffs and no share buybacks.   I fought for $155 billion for hospital expansions to create more bed  space that will be needed for Coronavirus victims and the bill provides  for $150 billion for hospitals and $80 billion in low interest loans to  hospitals.   I also, sought a directive to be issued prior to mass testing for the  reimbursement to health providers who are providing free testing, the  cost of test should be fully borne by the Federal government and not  healthcare providers--the bill eliminates cost-sharing for COVID-19  treatments and vaccines for all patients.   In addition to these measures, I am working to include in the next  aid package: a prohibition on foreclosures or evictions for upwards of  3 to 6 months for all housed persons living within the United States;  utility restoration so that every American has access to potable water,  electricity, and where available natural gas while complying with stay  at home orders, quarantines, and telework requirements; and funding for  alternative facilities and relocation needs for prisoners to prevent  community spread within federal, state, and local prison systems.   The government is an umbrella on a stormy day.   The storm instead is not just hitting one community, region or state  it has it is hitting the entire country with every community,  neighborhood, and family with tremendous force that they need help that  only the Federal government can provide.   In 2008, it was said that some companies were too big to fail, well  today the American family is too important to the future of this nation  to fail and we Democrats will make sure that they have all that is  required to save as many lives as possible and assure not only physical  survival but your economic survival.   Some may wonder why the American family matters so much to our  nation.   According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, half of  federal revenue or 51 percent comes from individual income taxes.   Another 35 percent of revenue comes from payroll taxes, which are  assessed on the wage or salary paychecks of almost all workers and are  used to fund Social Security, Medicare Hospital Insurance, and  unemployment insurance.   Corporate income taxes make up about 6 percent of federal revenue,  with the remaining 8 percent coming from excise taxes, estate taxes,  and other revenue sources.   It is imperative that we are clear eyed about what we are doing with  the tax revenue of this nation--it is paid by working people.   Corporations, businesses and top one percent of the nation's  wealthiest people received a trillion-dollar tax cut last year.   Nothing in the COVID-19 emergency response measures has changed this  fact.   Given the state of the demand on the federal treasury the funds  provided to major corporations and businesses that so richly benefited  from the tax cuts should repay any funds paid to them from the  treasure.   This is only fair, right and just.   They may need funding a bridge to provide for stability over the  course of the year, but they will emerge in an economy with pent up  demand that once unleashed will create prosperity that is unheard of  and that point they should begin to reply what they received from the  treasury.   This is not the case for working people who will emerge basically  where they were and in need of consumable that were out of reach or  unavailable once the crisis ends.   The relief provided in this legislation is essential if we are  address and overcome the unique challenges posed to America and the  global community by the coronavirus outbreak.   Mr. Speaker, as of today, there were at minimum 552,598 cases of  coronavirus across the globe and 85,755 in the United States, resulting  in more than 25,042 deaths worldwide and at least 1,304 in the United  States.   On top of that, by taking the necessary measures to slow the pandemic  and ``flatten the curve'' so as not to overwhelm the nation's health  care system, economic activity in the United States has experienced a  severe shock to the system.   Yesterday, the Department of Labor reported that the number of first- time unemployment insurance claims exceeded 3.3 million, shattering by  nearly 500 percent the previous record of 700,00 set in 1982 after the  passage of Reaganomics.   In addition, on March 23, 2020, the Dow Jones Industrial Average  (DJIA) dipped to 18,321.62, which is even lower than it was on Election  Night 2016, and far below the 19,827 mark where it stood on January 20,  2017.   In other words, Mr. Speaker, all the gains that were made to the  stock market and heralded by this Administration as evidence of its  genius have been wiped out, depleting the retirement savings and 401ks  of millions of ordinary Americans.   So, Mr. Speaker, it is essential that this Congress act and act now  to put in place measure that will address the public health crisis,  stem the economic onslaught, and ameliorate the suffering and  deprivation of individuals and communities.   The coronavirus bill that Senate Republicans put forward this weekend  was a non-starter and put corporations first, not America's workers.   It gave big corporations billions in taxpayer dollars with no real  requirement to protect their workers' wages and benefits instead of CEO  pay, stock buybacks and layoffs.   It failed to provide meaningful support for Americans losing their  jobs or hours.   And it certainly did not satisfy the priorities that were so critical  to the constituents I represent in the Eighteenth Congressional  District of Texas, which were:   1. To provide increased funding for small, urban and rural hospitals  under 150 beds and for federally qualified health clinics;   2. Enhanced training and resources for CBP personnel where  international flights land beyond the originally designated airports;   3. Funding for airports that receive international travelers to allow  for quarantine facilities to be established and for medical personnel  to be onsite;   4. Funding for school districts to cover non-teaching personnel to  make sure cafeteria  [[Page H1835]]  workers, bus drivers and janitorial services have equal access to  resources if their schools are closed;   5. Financial support for state and county governments and school  districts;   6. Enhanced funding for protective equipment for Transportation  Security Officers; and   7. Reimbursement for telemedicine.   Thanks to the leadership of we Democrats, the Republican  corporations-focused proposal has been turned into a bipartisan  workers-first bill and has now been passed by the Senate.   Because of Democratic contributions, the legislation before us  contains bold, pro-worker provisions that are desperately needed to  protect the health and well-being of the American people.   For example, I fought for $155 billion in funding to help hospitals  in the fight against coronavirus, and won a $100 billion investment in  hospitals, health systems and health research, and $150 billion for  state and local governments in this agreement, to give them the  resources they desperately need during this emergency.   As a Democrat, I fought for and won for American workers a massive  $260 billion investment in Unemployment Insurance benefits to match the  average paycheck of laid-off or furloughed workers and secured an  additional 13 weeks of federally-funded benefits to be made available  immediately, defeating a last-minute attempt by Republican senators to  claw back the $600 in expanded Unemployment Insurance.   For small businesses, Democrats insisted on and won a $377 billion  infusion of fast relief for small businesses and made rent, mortgage  and utility costs eligible for SBA loan forgiveness.   For students, Democrats fought for and secured more than $30 billion  in emergency education funding and eliminated income tax on student  loan repayment assistance by an employer.   And to protect taxpayers and provide accountability and oversight,  Democrats opposed and defeated Republican attempts to create a $500  billion secret corporate slush fund controlled by the Treasury  Secretary.   This coronavirus legislation builds on the swift actions previously  taken by the House in response to COVID-19.   Three weeks ago, on March 4, 2020, the House passed H.R. 6074, the  ``Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act  of 2020,'' which provides $8.3 billion of entirely new funds and  commits more than $3 billion to the development of treatments and a  vaccine available to all, and protects against price-gouging of  medicines developed with taxpayer dollars.   This legislation also provided $2.2 billion in prevention,  preparedness and response measures, including nearly a billion dollars  to help state, local, tribal and territorial health systems and helps  families by extending telemedicine services regardless of where they  live and supports small businesses, with billions in low-interest SBA  loans to those affected.   Passage of the ``Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental  Appropriations Act of 2020,'' was followed 10 days later, on March 14,  2020, by H.R. 6201, the ``Families First Coronavirus Response Act,''  which ensures free coronavirus testing for everyone who needs a test,  including the uninsured and increases funding for Medicaid to support  local, state, tribal and territorial health systems, so that they have  the resources needed to combat this public health emergency.   In addition, this legislation provides two weeks of paid sick leave  and up to three months of family and medical leave for eligible workers  and enhances Unemployment Insurance and supports small businesses by  fully reimbursing them for providing leave.   Finally, the ``Families First Coronavirus Response Act'' promotes  food security for families by strengthening nutrition initiatives  including SNAP, student meals, seniors' meals and food banks.   Mr. Speaker, the COVID-19 pandemic reminds us once again how  interconnected our world is and how an action occurring in a faraway  place can reverberate around the world.   On December 31, 2019, the first cases of pneumonia detected in Wuhan,  China were first reported to the World Health Organization.   One week later, on January 7, 2020, Chinese authorities confirm that  they have identified the virus as a novel coronavirus, initially named  2019-nCoV by the WHO.   Four days later, on January 11, 2020, the Wuhan Municipal Health  Commission announces the first death caused by the coronavirus, a 61- year-old man exposed to the virus at the seafood market who suffered  respiratory failure caused by severe pneumonia.   On January 13, 2020, Thai authorities report a case of infection  caused by the coronavirus involving a Chinese national who had arrived  from Wuhan.   Three days later, January 16, 2020, Japanese authorities confirm that  a Japanese man who traveled to Wuhan is infected with the virus and on  January 20, 2020, China reports 139 new cases of the sickness,  including a third death.   On January 20, 2020, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National  Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, states that the National  Institutes of Health is ``in the process of taking the first steps  towards the development of a vaccine'' against the coronavirus.   The next day, on January 21, 2020, officials in Washington state  confirm the first case on United States soil.   From that first outbreak of coronavirus four months ago, the  coronavirus has made its way across the oceans and across the borders  of nation-states to the point where today it is present in more than  145 countries and all 50 states, including 1,456 cases and 17 deaths in  my home state of Texas.   As the poet John Donne wrote in ``For Whom the Bells Toll'':       No man is an island, entire of itself;      every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main;      if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as             well as if a promontory were, as well as if a manor of             thy friend's or of thine own were;      any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in             mankind, and therefore never send to know for whom the             bell tolls;      it tolls for thee.    So, Mr. Speaker, we must act.   No single one of us can do everything, but everyone can do something.  That is why I thank the unsung heroes, the grocery staff, delivery  persons, all essential workers; Thank You.   Here is how I proceeded to join with our community to sound the  alarm--so help could come earlier. But we will prevail, with hard work  and the American spirit.   On February 10, 2020, I held the first press conference on the issue  of the novel Coronavirus at Houston Intercontinental Airport where I  was joined by public health officials, local unions, and advocates to  raise awareness regarding the virus and the implications it might have  for travel to the United States from China and to combat early signs of  discrimination targeting Asian businesses in the United States.   On February 24, 2020, I held a second press conference on the  International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the World  Health Organization's declaration of a ``public health emergency from  the outbreak of the Coronavirus'' where I also released an Action Plan  calling for:   1. Enhanced production of N-95 masks;   2. Informing state health agencies and all federally qualified health  clinics to test all patients presenting with flu like symptoms for the  coronavirus;   3. Increasing the supply of flu vaccine and use public service  announcements to promote getting a flu shot to reduce the number of  persons with flu like symptoms;   4. The federal Coronavirus Task Force to name a single coronavirus  authoritative source for all federal information on the virus and  establish clear communication links to K-12 and post-secondary schools,  the media, and the public;   5. Require that the nation's airports, trains, and mass transit  systems, both small and large, have in place response teams as  necessary to deal with and treat the traveling public; and   6. Ensure the federal advisory task force makes public reports on the  status of the spread of the coronavirus, including by the development  of a computer app that provides up to date travel advisories regarding  certain countries and basic information on the virus   On February 26, 2020, I wrote the Chair and Ranking Member of the  Committee on Homeland Security, seeking a briefing from Acting  Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf to gain insight into the  preparedness of DHS to address a possible pandemic.   In early March 2020, I founded the bipartisan Congressional  Coronavirus Task Force with Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick of  Pennsylvania and Congressman Raul Ruiz of California and invited all  members to join; at last count over 25 members have signed on.   I have advocated to the President and congressional leadership on the  need for robust support and assistance that puts workers and their  families first.   And just yesterday, I announced the opening of a wing at United  Memorial Medical Center in Houston that will house 46 new beds to treat  coronavirus victims.   Mr. Speaker, let me list briefly several of the many of the other  salutary provisions of the legislation now before us:   1. $150 billion for a state and local Coronavirus Relief fund, of  which Texas is slated to receive $11.25 million;   2. 4 months of more unemployment insurance instead of 3;   3. $6.3 billion for the Strategic National Stockpile for critical  medical supplies, personal protective equipment, and life-saving  medicine;   4. $10 billion for SBA emergency grants of up to $10,000 to provide  immediate relief for  [[Page H1836]]  operating costs once a small business or non-profit has applied for an  Economic Injury Disaster Loan;   5. $17 billion for SBA to cover 6 months of payments for small  businesses with existing SBA loans;   6. $30 billion in emergency education funding and $25 billion in  emergency transit funding;   7. $30 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund to provide financial  assistance to state and local governments, as well as private  nonprofits providing critical and essential services;   8. $30.75 billion for grants to provide emergency support to local  school systems and higher education institutions to continue to provide  educational services to their students and support the on-going  functionality of school districts and institutions;   9. Prohibition banning stock buybacks for the term of the government  assistance plus one year on any company receiving a government loan  from the bill;   10. Robust worker protections are attached to all federal loans for  businesses;   11. Real-time public reporting required of Treasury transactions  under the Act, including terms of loans, investments or other  assistance to corporations;   12. Retention tax credit for employers to encourage businesses to  keep workers on payroll during the crisis;   13. Income tax exclusion for individuals who are receiving student  loan repayment assistance from their employer; and   14. Eliminated ``secret bailout'' provision that would have allowed  bailouts to corporations to be concealed for 6 months.   Mr. Speaker, in 1862 Annual Message to Congress, President Abraham  Lincoln wrote:         The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy       present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty and we       must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, we must       think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and       then we shall save our country.    Mr. Speaker, the occasion demands that we rise, and I urge all  Members to join me in voting to pass the Senate Amendment to H.R. 748,  the ``Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act'' or `CARES  Act.'                                       House of Representatives,                                                     Washington, DC.        Dear House and Senate Appropriators: Thank you for all your       strategic and important work on the Coronavirus pandemic for       which this nation has never faced in its modern history. As       we are aware, the Coronavirus is in all 50 states and any       financial response must be significant and long lasting. As a       result, I am recommending the following:        1. Cash payment for all Americans up to $3000 per adult and       $1500 per child. The criteria should be based on national       income levels already designated or for individuals and       families making under $85,000.        2. Relief for the entertainment industry including       freelancers, independent contractors and those in the music,       dance, and visual performing arts. This particularly impacts       those in the gospel music industry due to concert       cancellations and church closures. All these individuals are       most vulnerable as a result of cancellations and closures.       There should be a special account under the extended       unemployment insurance which will allocate an additional       $2,000 to the cash payment for these individuals whose income       is generated sporadically from project to project.        3. Development of a small business grant program funded       through the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program       by way of H.R. 6292, ``The COVID-19 Recovery Small Business       Grants Act.'' This legislation is modeled after my Hurricane       Harvey Relief legislation and it should include enhanced       support for restaurants and bars. Add $125 million dollars       more to the CDBG account.        4. Relief for non-profit organizations including faith-      based institutions who are closed due to the Coronavirus.       They should be funded through the CDBG program.        5. Small businesses who purchased business interruption       insurance coverage are being told by insurance companies that       they will not cover the Coronavirus. I am proposing a       legislative fix to include coverage for the Coronavirus under       the business interruption insurance coverage.        6. The President has now invoked the Defense Production Act       and it should be fully implemented after Members of Congress       insisted that production needs to be increased for personal       protection equipment and the Coronavirus tests. Increased       funding for Health and Human Services for these tests.        7. Any support for the aviation industry should be with low       interest loans. The airlines must agree to no employee       layoffs and no share buybacks. There should be increased       funding to help the nation's airports and the small business       concessionaires in the airports that have unique needs as       opposed other small businesses. Increase transportation       funding that is going to be used for the airline industry.        8. There must be increased funding to protect airport       personnel, including Transportation Security Officers,       through the purchase of gloves, masks, and other protective       equipment that they have not received. This is extremely       critical as they are nearing complete depletion. Also, there       must be additional funding for personal protection equipment       for Customs and Border Protection agents.        9. Requesting $155 billion for hospital expansions to       create more bed space that will be needed for Coronavirus       victims. In addition, we should use the United States       military to help supplement hospital capacity in case of       shortages. Specifically increase HHS funding for these       funding items.        10. Hospitals are indicating they will not have enough bed       capacity to take in the expected large numbers of Coronavirus       victims. Funding needs to be assured for increased hospital       capacity. Additionally, increased funding to hospitals and       healthcare providers for personal protective equipment for       their personnel. The President quickly use the Defense       Production Act. Specifically increase HHS funding for these       funding items.        11. Directives need to be in place for the reimbursement to       health providers who are providing free testing. Before mass       testing begins, healthcare providers must understand how to       utilize the reimbursement process. Physician owned hospitals       should also be covered for reimbursement for Coronavirus       testing.        12. There should be no foreclosures or evictions at this       time; upwards of 3 to 6 months. The President has indicated       that should be applied to HUD-properties, but it should also       apply to all potential evictions and foreclosures.        13. Funding for alternative facilities and relocation needs       for prisoners to prevent community spread within federal,       state, and local prison systems.        Thank you for your consideration of this request.            Very truly yours,      Sheila Jackson Lee,        Member of Congress, Chair, Congressional Coronavirus       Taskforce, Senior Member of the Homeland Security Committee.                  Proposals for Coronavirus Relief Package       To: Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Wendell Primus      From: Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, Senior Member of the           Committee on the Judiciary and Homeland Security           Committee and Member of the Budget Committee      Date: March 11, 2020         Below is my proposal for the Coronavirus Relief Package:        1. Enhanced funding for small, urban and rural hospitals       under 150 beds. Added resources for their standing emergency       rooms including training as necessary for patients without       mobility to be tested at the hospital.        2. Increased funding for federally qualified health       clinics. Resources to provide separate facilities which may       include blocking off certain areas of the facility to provide       for walk-in patients with Coronavirus symptoms.        3. Enhanced training and resources for CBP personnel where       international flights land beyond the originally designated       airports. More assessment is needed to prevent persons with       Coronavirus symptoms from leaving the airport into the       general population, before medical personnel can assess them.        4. Funding for airports that receive international       travelers to allow for quarantine facilities to be       established and for medical personnel to be onsite.        5. Funding for school districts to cover non-teaching       personnel to make sure cafeteria workers, bus drivers and       janitorial services have equal access to resources if their       schools are closed and financial support for those school       districts that have to close.        6. Financial support for state and county governments as       needed.        7. Enhanced funding for protective equipment for       Transportation Security Officers.        8. Telemedicine visits should be covered with       reimbursement.
