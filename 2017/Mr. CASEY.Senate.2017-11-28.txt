 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Mr. President, I rise this evening to talk about the tax  bill, which will come to the floor very soon. We have started debate,  and we will be debating it the next couple of days. There is a lot to  talk about, a lot of numbers, and a lot of data. I will try to limit  the numbers as best I can, but it is important to review some of the  numbers.   For tonight's purposes, I start with just two numbers. The first  number is 59,456, and the second number is 7. What do I mean when I say  59,456? It is in dollars. The average annual tax cut for those making  over $1 million a year in 2019 is $59,456. As many people know who have  been following the debate, the Senate bill delayed a corporate tax cut  by 1 year so most of the analysis starts in the year 2019 not 2018. So  there is $59,456 of a tax cut for those making over $1 million in the  first year of the bill, 2019.   What does 7 mean? Seven is also a dollar number. Seven dollars is the  average monthly tax cut for Americans making between $20,000 and  $30,000 a year in that same year, 2019.   If you wanted to compare the annual number of $59,456 to the annual  average tax cut for that income category for the same year, it would be  about $84. No matter which way you look at it, there is a basic  unfairness there. Even when you apply percentages, it is very clear  that folks in those lower income brackets don't get the benefit the  richest among us--the superrich people making more than $1 million-- get. Even if you drop down the number to over one-half million dollars  and up, those folks are getting sometimes double, even triple, the tax  cuts for people in the broad middle.   The one I just cited might be the most egregious example, people  making $20,000 to $30,000 a year getting just $7 a month in a tax cut.   One of the reasons the bill is so stingy and so unfair when it comes  to folks in the lower income brackets or even the middle-income  brackets is because so much has been given in the bill to big  corporations. Right? There is only a certain amount of revenue you can  move around in a bill like this.   Because the corporate--and I should say the permanent corporate tax  cut. The tax cuts for families is not permanent, but the permanent  corporate tax cut is $1.5 trillion, and by one estimate it is $1.414  trillion over 10 years. When you allocate that much to big corporations  and make it permanent, obviously, it limits your ability to help the  middle class in a robust or substantial way.   I think most Americans will ask: Why don't we limit any kind of  corporate tax break and apply, potentially, hundreds of billions--with  a ``b''--of dollars to a bigger middle-class tax cut? But the majority  so far, starting with the Finance Committee, has decided not to do  that.   I just leave that for people to consider. Is it fair, when you are  doing a tax bill, so-called tax reform, for the first time in three  decades, that people making over $1 million who don't need $59,456-- does it make sense to give them that and give the store away to  corporations in a permanent fashion and give folks making $20,000 to  $30,000 just 7 bucks a month or 84 bucks over the course of a year, on  average?   It gets worse. The numbers get even more egregious, even more  insulting. That same year, in 2019, 572,000 of our country's richest  households would get $34 billion worth of tax cuts. You heard that  right. In 1 year, a rather small group of Americans--572,000 of the  richest households--get $34 billion of a tax cut in just that 1 year.  That $34 billion in that 1 year for the richest among us gets even  higher if you add in other provisions, other tax cuts, but I will be  conservative and just limit it to the $34 billion.   Some people might ask: Well, what about the rest of the country or  most of the country? What is left? Well, if you compare that $34  billion for a relatively small group of the wealthiest, if you compare  that to 90 million--my arms don't stretch out far enough to compare 572  taxpayers with 90 million. What happens to 90 million taxpayers who  happen to make under $50,000? A couple of minutes ago I talked about  $20,000 to $30,000. Now we are talking about everyone below $50,000 in  a year. That is about 90 million people. What happens to them? Well,  they get a grand total of $14 billion, and some even see a tax  increase. So let's leave the tax increase for people making less than  $50,000 off the table for now because some will get a tax increase, and  some will get a benefit. So it is hard to comprehend that 90 million  people divvy up $14 billion, but a tiny fraction of that--572,000  people--get $34 billion just in 2019. Then you have 2020 and 2021, and  they keep getting those dollar amounts.   Some people might say: Well, you know, everyone should get a tax cut  in a bill like this, and even if the wealthy get a tax cut, that is the  way Washington works. I have described this bill this way over and over  again, and I will keep describing it this way. It is a giveaway. It is  a giveaway to the superrich. It is certainly a giveaway to big  corporations. They get $1.5 trillion, and it is permanent.    There have been a lot of analyses done of this bill, and there are  lots of stories to point to. I just point to one that came out just  yesterday. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities came out with a  report that is a little more than seven pages' worth. They do reports  like this on a regular basis, sometimes more than one report in a week.  I know folks can't read it from a distance, but here is what the  headline says: ``JCT Estimates''--Joint Committee on Taxation, that is  the acronym--Joint Committee on Taxation estimates ``Amended Senate Tax  Bill Skewed to Top, Hurts Many Low- and Middle-Income Americans.'' That  is what the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said yesterday. So  what they are analyzing is not the original proposal folks in the  Senate Republican caucus offered. This is the amended Senate bill.   Here is what they say, in pertinent part. I will just read maybe two  sentences.         Under the amended bill, in 2025 (when most of its       provisions would be in place), high-income households would       get the largest tax cuts as a share of after-tax income, on       average, while households with incomes below $30,000 would on       average face a tax increase. By 2027, when many of its       provisions would have expired, those at the top would still       get large tax cuts, but every income group below--   [[Page S7355]]     I will read that again.       --every income group below $75,000 would face tax increases,       on average.    You heard that right--tax increases on average. So whether you look  at it in the year 2019 for people making $20,000 to $30,000 or 2019 for  people making under $50,000 and compare that to the wealthiest among us  or whether you look at it in terms of what happens just a few years  later in 2025, you can see the basic unfairness of this.   Just at a time when we have this great opportunity to do a number of  things which would not only turbocharge the economy and potentially  lift families out of poverty--and certainly lift children out of  poverty--just when we have the opportunity to simplify the code, to  help middle-class families in a substantial and robust way, not the  stingy way the bill does it, to the point where some might get a tax  break one year that is very limited and then that goes away and their  taxes go up and others are losing healthcare because of the repeal of  the individual mandate--what is most egregious here is maybe not even  the giveaways. That is egregious enough. What is outrageous is, the  giveaways happen, and the debt is run up to do that. Then, on top of  all that, we miss an opportunity, as Washington often does. There is an  old expression that Washington never misses an opportunity to miss an  opportunity. This is an opportunity to give the middle class maybe a  record tax cut, but the majority has chosen not to do that. This is  also an opportunity to lift a lot more children out of poverty with a  much more generous child tax credit, a much more substantial commitment  to lifting kids out of poverty, because we have a bill that allows us  to do that, a big tax bill that only comes around once every couple of  decades, potentially. The last time this was done was 31 years ago. So  this is a critically important moment for the middle class, a  critically important moment for children--middle-income children but  also children from low-income families who don't get a lot of help  under current policy.   Now, some people might ask: Well, how have the rich done over the  last number of years? Maybe some might want to make the argument--the  ridiculous argument, but they might want to make it--that somehow the  rich need a little help. Well, let's see what has happened since 1980.  Since 1980, the richest 1 percent have seen their share of national  income almost double--double--from 11 percent to 20 percent in 2014,  the last time this was measured. So the richest 1 percent, in about 35  years, have seen their share of all national income almost double. So  the richest 1 percent have been doing pretty well over the decades  since 1980. Do they really need yet another tax cut? Do they really  need tens of billions of dollars split or divvied up among a very small  number of Americans? I don't think so, and I think most Americans would  agree with me.   According to the New York Times, no other nation in the 35-member  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development--the so-called  OECD countries, 35 countries, and we are one of them--no other country  has seen this widening of the gap between the richest and everyone  else. You could see it in the other example. The richest small number  in America get $34 billion, and then 90 million people have to split a  number that is less than half that. That is really an insult to who we  are as Americans.   That same JCT--the Joint Committee on Taxation--their estimate of the  Republican bill shows that households earning over $1 million would get  an average tax cut about 73 times larger than households earning  between $50,000 and $75,000 in 2019, that same year, the first year.   We can go on and on with these comparisons, but I want to go back to  the number I started with, that $59,000 number. If you keep the dollar  sign on it, and use it for another purpose, you have just arrived at  roughly the median household income for the United States of America.  So the median household income is about $59,000. That is the median  household income all across the country. That number happens to be  roughly the same number as the $59,456, the average annual tax cut for  those making over $1 million in 2019.   There are lots of other ways to describe the bill. The bill raises  $134 billion on the backs of hard-working Americans by changing how the  Tax Code measures inflation. Not many people are paying attention to  this, but the measurement is going to change if the bill passes. This  number only grows over time.   For someone who is just starting out in their professional life, they  would see this change haunt their paychecks for the next 50 years. So  they are going to change how the Tax Code measures inflation. Not many  people know that, and I think they are starting to find out.   If all of that wasn't enough, this bill would do a number of other  things which are particularly destructive. It will reward companies  that have outsourced jobs, it will increase healthcare premiums by an  average of an additional 10 percent a year, and it is going to give, at  the same time, obscene tax cuts to the superrich by, at the same time,  increasing taxes on the middle class.   So when I described this bill last week in the Finance Committee as a  thief in the night, I didn't choose those words casually; I meant every  word of it. It is a thief in the night because of what the adverse  impact on middle-class families and lower income families trying to get  to the middle class would be, compared to what happens to the  wealthiest among us. So it is robbing people of an opportunity to get a  better tax cut for the middle class and giving away the store to the  rich.   I will have more to say about this, but I see the majority leader is  on the floor.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I wish to go back to a point I made earlier  when I was describing--both in terms of the substance of the bill and  the process that has been undertaken to pass the bill--why, the week  before Thanksgiving, I used the expression that the bill was, in fact,  ``a thief in the night'' and what I meant by that. In the same bill, we  have these inequities that I just described where the wealthiest are  getting $34 billion in a tax cut--a giveaway, really, just in the first  year, and then that continues--and 90 million Americans get less than  half of that. That is, in my judgment, robbing those families of an  opportunity to get a bigger tax cut and to have the wealthiest among us  sacrifice a little bit for the middle class and for those trying to get  to the middle class. It gets worse from there because, in addition to  that, repealing of the individual mandate has a healthcare consequence.   We know that the Congressional Budget Office told us that because of  what would happen as a result of the repeal of the individual mandate,  4 million people would lose their healthcare in the first year and 13  million over the course of 10 years. So it is entirely possible--we  don't know the exact number, but it is entirely possible--that lots of  Americans would, in the same year or certainly over time, have two  adverse consequences. One, they would either not get much of a tax cut  or their tax cut or any tax change would turn into a tax increase, and  they would lose their healthcare because of the effects of one part of  the bill. So, at the same time, in the same bill, some will lose their  healthcare because of the bill and others will see their taxes go up,  or worse, maybe the same thing will happen to the same individual, the  same family. All that is happening in a bill that is speeding through  this Chamber.   Here is how defective the process has been. The Senate bill was  introduced on a Thursday, and then voted out of the Finance Committee  the following Thursday, and now the majority is trying to pass the bill  this Thursday. So from Thursday to Thursday to Thursday is the entire  consideration of a bill that has not had one hearing--not a single  hearing. Oh, yes, we had time in the committee the week before  Thanksgiving to pose questions to the Joint Committee on Taxation--tax  experts--or to staff, and that is part of the process. But a tax bill  like this, which comes around every three decades and will have an  impact, by one estimate, of $9 trillion to $10 trillion, doesn't have a  single hearing and doesn't have the kind of due consideration that  would allow people to examine it and allow taxpayers to examine the  detail of this bill and the consequences that would flow from that--the  adverse consequences--and be able to say: Hey, wait a minute. Maybe I  am one of those people. Maybe I am one of those individuals whose taxes  will go up or I don't get much of a tax cut and, on top of that, I lose  my healthcare. I think any American who would be so adversely affected  should have the time and the opportunity to examine this legislation,  either themselves or through the debate that is undertaken by Senators  or through reading news accounts.   The only good news here is that newspapers across the country,  especially, and think tanks who are analyzing this bill are providing  the American people information. But the debate is so limited that very  little of the debate here in the Senate will land on the kitchen tables  of Americans who will be affected.   So when I say that this is a thief in the night, I mean it by way of  the substance of the bill where people are robbed of healthcare,  potentially, and certainly robbed of an opportunity to either get a  substantial middle-class tax cut or, in some cases, they get no tax cut  at all because their taxes go up and, at the same time, they are losing  healthcare.   This whole process has been cloaked in darkness and has been infused  with secrecy. I got a letter the other day from a taxpayer who said to  me: I am worried about the impact on--it was from a mom talking about  her family--on my family and my children. She said: I don't know enough  about this. I can sympathize with her because Democratic Senators were  in a committee 2 weeks ago when this bill was presented to us, with not  a single hearing on the bill.   My colleagues may recall what happened in 1985 and 1986. President  Reagan came up with a proposal that was almost 500 pages in length.  There was a lot of detail about his administration's priorities on tax  reform. His proposal got 27 hearings in the Finance Committee. Later,  when the House passed a bill in--I guess it was in the beginning of  1986--they passed a tax reform bill that went to the Senate, and that  House bill in 1986 got six hearings in the Finance Committee. So if you  add the review of the detailed Reagan proposal--almost 500 pages--to  the actual hearings on a specific bill, we are talking about 33  hearings. That is the kind of review one would expect. I would settle  for 10 or 15 hearings on something this substantial.   So we are basically saying that we are supposed to accept a bill that  has gotten very little review and no hearing, and then wait for 20  years from now or 30 years from now to have another opportunity.   This is a joke. This is an insult to the American people, when we  have a bill that will have such an impact on every American and is  getting very little in the way of scrutiny.   I know the hour is late. I will just make a few more points,  especially when it comes to our children. There has been a lot of talk  about what this bill could do to help children. A lot of Americans know  about the child tax credit and the earned income tax credit. Those two  provisions alone in our law have lifted more children out of poverty  than almost anything we have ever done in the Congress in decades,  [[Page S7364]]  literally. It has had that kind of an impact. So shouldn't we use these  two vehicles that have lifted millions of children and families out of  poverty--the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit--and  strengthen them? Shouldn't we make them more robust so that more  children could be lifted out of poverty? The answer is yes.   We have an opportunity here. Senator Brown and Senator Bennet  introduced a bill that then became an amendment in the debate, which I  and so many other Democratic Senators joined them on, to strengthen the  child tax credit, as well as the earned income tax credit.   Here is the basic information about where we are with the child tax  credit. The proposal by some Republican Senators to strengthen the  child tax credit in the bill is also woefully deficient and woefully  short of what families should expect from a big tax reform bill that is  supposed to help folks with the child tax credit.   The Senate Republican plan increases the maximum child tax credit  from $1,000 to $2,000 per child. It sounds pretty good so far--$1,000  up to $2,000. It sounds pretty good so far, but because the bill limits  refundability, a mom working full time at minimum wage will only see an  additional $75 in the child tax credit, while a married couple earning  $500,000 would become newly eligible. So in the Republican bill,  wealthy families earning up to $500,000 of income are newly eligible  for help, with the child tax credit, for the maximum credit of $2,000  per child. The working mom who has a low income gets a child tax credit  of $75, which is not much help, but the family making $500,000 would be  getting a $2,000 child tax credit. Anyone knows that is woefully short.   We can do better than that. We are a great country. We have the  greatest economy in the world, we have the strongest military in the  world, and we have a lot of good tax policies that have helped lift  families out of poverty. Both parties have helped support those  provisions over the years. This isn't just a Democratic priority; a lot  of Republicans make this a priority as well.   This is the moment to do it. This is a big tax bill. We could make  the child tax credit so generous and so substantial that you could  turbocharge--use any word you want--you could turbocharge the effort to  get young children out of poverty. But the Republicans won't do it  because they are stingy on the child tax credit changes, just as they  are stingy on the middle-class tax cut.   The source I cited earlier for the November 27 report, the Center on  Budget and Policy Priorities--you can go to their website. It is easy.  Just type in four letters--CBPP--and you can find these reports. What  do they say about the child tax credit provisions? The Center on Budget  and Policy Priorities says that 10 million children live in families  who would get $6.25 or less per month in additional child tax credit  help--less than 1 hour of work at the minimum wage. So for 10 million  children, this brandnew proposal on the child tax credit adds up to  $6.25 or less per month. Even in a very low-income family, $6.25 a  month doesn't get you much in terms of help for your children.   We have a lot to do in a short timeframe to let the American people  know what is in this bill. Whether it is very limited tax relief for a  lot of middle-class families or whether it is the outrage that so many  Americans' taxes will go up--over time, especially--or whether it is  the giveaways to the richest among us, there are so many outrages and  so many insults in one bill, it is difficult to catalog all of them.   I hope that if we have a vote on the Senate floor, this bill will be  defeated. Guess what can happen then. We can get to a different chapter  on tax reform, just like we started to get to on healthcare. After the  healthcare bill was voted down in July, everyone said that somehow  there would be no engagement on healthcare after that, that the two  sides would go into their corners and there would be no discussion.  Within hours, if not days, of that happening, Democrats and Republicans  came together on healthcare. On that topic on which there is supposed  to be very little, if any, consensus or cooperation or bipartisanship,  they came together and then had hearings in early September. People  forget this, but it happened. In the first 2 weeks of September, we  listened to Governors from both parties, insurance commissioners, and  healthcare policy experts. Guess what we got. We got a bipartisan bill  to help stabilize the market, to make sure we were coming together to  try to solve at least one substantial problem in our healthcare  system--not to cure every problem but to come together in a bipartisan  way to fix the problem.   We could undertake a similar process on tax reform. We could start in  December or January--whenever the majority wants to start--have lots of  hearings, examine these issues, and figure out whether there is a  bipartisan way to make the child tax credit more generous.   We have a moment here. We have a big bill. We could lift a lot more  children out of poverty. Isn't there a way to make the middle-class tax  relief much more robust and substantial? Instead of giving a $300 or  $400 tax cut, maybe we could say: Let's come together on a bipartisan  bill and give a tax cut that is worth $1,000--or maybe several thousand  dollars--to the middle class and to middle-class families. We could do  that. Democrats and Republicans could come together.   We could even come together on providing corporate relief. No one on  our side doesn't believe that corporations should get a break, but when  you reduce a corporate tax rate from 35 to 20--just do the math. It is  $100 billion per point, so that is $1.5 trillion. That forecloses the  option of making middle-class tax cuts even more generous. It limits  the options to help families who are struggling to get into the middle  class, who are going to work every day, sometimes working two jobs,  making the minimum wage or higher than minimum wage, and they need a  little bit of help with the child tax credit or other provisions.   We have an opportunity here to do tax reform the right way--not in  the dark of night, not a one-party fiat or a one-party bill that gets  rushed through and then we are supposed to accept this as good tax  policy for the next 10, 20, 30 years. That is not the way to do tax  reform. That is not the way it was done when Ronald Reagan was here,  working with Democrats and Republicans. That is not the way we should  do it.   We will have more to say later in the week.   At this time, I yield the floor.                            ____________________
