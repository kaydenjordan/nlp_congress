 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of D.C.  statehood. Today's affirmative vote in the House of Representatives to  admit the State of Washington, Douglass Commonwealth as the 51st state  in the Union is long overdue for the more than 700,000 disenfranchised  American citizens who currently live in the District of Columbia. This  is the first time a chamber of Congress has voted to approve D.C.  statehood. I have long been a proponent of D.C. statehood and was the  only member of the Virginia delegation to vote for D.C. statehood the  last time it came before the House in 1993. And during my service as a  member of the Virginia House of Delegates, I introduced the resolution  for Virginia to ratify the Constitutional Amendment to grant full  Congressional voting rights to the District of Columbia. Unfortunately,  neither my resolution nor the Constitutional Amendment were ultimately  successful.   Today's vote marks a historic victory for the indefatigable advocates  for statehood including my colleague, Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes  Norton, who has been a tireless advocate for the disenfranchised  citizens of our nation's capital. Supporting D.C. statehood is about  our nation's core constitutional principles of self-determination,  opposition to taxation without representation, and giving an equal  voice to all Americans regardless of where they live. I hope my  Republican colleagues in the Senate put aside politics and pass this  bill and finally end the historic injustice that has persisted for more  than 200 years for the people of Washington, D.C.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of overriding the President's veto of  H.J. Res. 76, a bipartisan Congressional Review Act resolution that  would stop the Department of Education's harmful borrower defense rule  from going into effect.   Mr. Speaker, I first want to recognize the hard work of the  gentlewoman from Nevada, Representative Susie Lee, for her tireless  efforts in protecting students, particularly student veterans, from  predatory schools.                                time  1145    Borrower defense is a valuable tool to provide relief to student  borrowers who are defrauded by predatory institutions. Unfortunately,  instead of using the Department's authority to make borrowers whole and  give students a second chance at a quality education, it has gone out  of its way to prevent victims of fraud from getting relief.   The Department's rewrite of the borrower defense rule, which is set  to go into effect on July 1, will mean that a vast majority of  defrauded student borrowers will get virtually no relief. Even in cases  where a school clearly violates the law, defrauded victims can still be  denied relief under the rule if they can't show that the school  intentionally defrauded them or they can't file their claim fast enough  or they can't document, according to the flawed Department methodology,  exactly how much harm they suffered due to fraud.   Even those student borrowers who do receive partial relief will  receive significantly less relief than before. Under Secretary DeVos,  the average loan discharge amount for approved borrowers has dropped  from about $11,000 to about $500, and for many students zero relief  will be available even though they can prove massive fraud.   Class actions are not allowed under the rule. Each student must bring  an individual case even though the school may have been found to have  been guilty of egregious systemic fraud.   Democrats and Republicans came together earlier this year to pass a  Congressional Review Act resolution that rejects this rule and prevents  the Department of Education from denying borrowers the relief they  deserve. A broad coalition, including veterans and military groups,  consumer advocates, student advocates, and civil rights groups, called  on the President to sign the congressional resolution and protect  student borrowers from predatory schools; but, while the President  initially indicated support for the resolution, he ultimately chose to  veto it.   Today the House has one final opportunity to ensure that defrauded  students get the relief they deserve by overriding that veto.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote to override the President's  veto.   Mr. Speaker, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from  North Carolina (Ms. Foxx), who is the ranking member, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Nevada (Mrs. Lee), who is the sponsor of the  resolution and a hardworking member of the Committee on Education and  Labor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Davis), the chair of the Subcommittee  on Higher Education and Workforce Investment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney), a distinguished member of the  Committee on Education and Labor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici), the chair of the Subcommittee  on Civil Rights and Human Services.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Takano), a member of the Committee on  Education and Labor, but more importantly, chair of the full Committee  on Veterans' Affairs, because so many veterans have been implicated by  fraud on these institutions.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Adams), the chair of the Workforce  Protections Subcommittee and also chair of the HBCU Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Jayapal), a distinguished member of  the Committee on Education and Labor.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman  [[Page H2553]]  from Pennsylvania (Ms. Wild), a distinguished member of the Committee  on Education and Labor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Harder), a distinguished member of the Committee  on Education and Labor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Waters), the chair of the Committee on Financial  Services.                                time  1230     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), the chair of the  Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services,  Education, and Related Agencies.    Mr. Speaker, before I yield to the gentleman  from Rhode Island, I would like to remind  [[Page H2554]]  our colleagues that just yesterday a Federal court ruled that the  Department of Education must provide full relief for 7,200 defrauded  Massachusetts student borrowers who attended Corinthian Colleges.  Unfortunately, there are still borrowers around the country still  waiting for relief.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr.  Cicilline), a member of the House Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Porter), a member of the Financial  Services and Oversight and Reform Committees.    Mr. Speaker, could you advise how much time is  remaining on each side?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Iowa (Ms. Finkenauer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Tlaib), a member of the Financial  Services Committee and Oversight and Reform Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, we have heard a lot about $11 billion. Let me tell you  exactly what that is. That is $11 billion  [[Page H2555]]  that students who have been defrauded will now have to pay if this  resolution fails.   According to the fraud formula from the Department of Education, even  those who can prove fraud can expect relief, on average, to go from  about 50 percent of their debt down to 3 percent of their debt. Many,  because of that formula, will get absolutely nothing.                                time  1245    Mr. Speaker, now is the time that we have a choice. We can give  relief to students, especially veterans who have been defrauded by  predatory colleges, or make them pay student loans even though they  received a worthless educational experience.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to side with the students and vote  ``yes'' on this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
