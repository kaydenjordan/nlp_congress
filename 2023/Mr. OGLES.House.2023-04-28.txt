 Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on the bill I will introduce  today, the TEACH Act, the Teachers Empowered Against Classroom Harm  Act. This bill would ensure that those who choose to protect children  from armed intruders have the opportunity to do so.   We are all aware of the tragedy that took place at the Covenant  School in my district a month ago. These types of tragedies are  indicative of the evil that exists in our world. While we will never be  able to ban the intentions of evil people, we can allow men and women  to equip themselves in order to protect our children and stop bad  actors in their tracks.   The TEACH Act would take money from the Education Secretary's slush  fund, over $27.5 million, and use that money to provide defensive  training programs designed to protect schools and our most precious  asset, our children.   There are untold numbers of humble, patriotic men and women serving  in our schools who would take steps to protect our children. The  Teachers Empowered Against Classroom Harm Act, the TEACH Act, would  help make our students, our educators, and our classrooms safer.                            ____________________
