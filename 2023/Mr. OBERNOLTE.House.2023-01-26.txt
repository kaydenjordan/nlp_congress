 Mr. Speaker, my constituents already pay amongst the  highest prices for energy in the entire country and yet, this winter,  their suffering is particularly acute because some of them are being  forced to pay over twice as much to heat their homes as they were just  a year ago.    One of the primary drivers of this spike in energy prices is the  policies of our own Federal Government which actively restrict the  production of energy in America.   Any economist will tell you that when that supply is constrained,  prices go up and, Mr. Chairman, that is exactly what is occurring this  winter.   This bill, H.R. 21, will make a meaningful contribution to fixing  that problem by requiring the Federal Government to permit new energy  exploration at least sufficient to replace the petroleum that is being  released from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve.   Mr. Chairman, it is unconscionable to force my constituents to choose  between heating their homes and putting food on the table for their  families, and this is exactly what has been happening for the thousands  of people that I represent.   This bill is a meaningful step toward solving that problem and will  improve the lives of people across our country, and I urge its  adoption.
