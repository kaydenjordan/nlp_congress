 So you have been working on it for 6 years. My  information is that you posted this bill at 8 last night. The  Congressional Budget Office has not given it a score. They have not  told the American people how much it is going to cost or how many  people it is going to affect.   You have skyrocketed premiums for hardworking Americans who have  preexisting conditions, and that is what my colleagues need to  understand.   If you are an average 40-year-old adult with a preexisting condition  and have diabetes, it is estimated your premiums will rise $400 a  month. If you have rheumatoid arthritis, $800 a month. And heaven  forbid if you have some preexisting condition involving cancer; the  numbers just go off of the chart.   You know and I know this bill will not see the light of day in the  Senate. This is a political stunt to save face with your rightwing  base. You know it and we know it.   If this wasn't so serious, affecting the economy and the  affordability of insurance, I would say just go on and do it, because  you will lose your opportunity to serve in this House and you will  ultimately lose the majority.   Don't do it. Forget about politics. Think about the 24 million  Americans who will not be able to afford health insurance coverage.   That is why the American Medical Association, AARP, American Nurses  Association, and all of the other stakeholder groups have pleaded with  you. They have called your office. They have written you letters. They  have written us letters.   Don't do it. I ask you to vote ``no'' on this ill-conceived  legislation.
