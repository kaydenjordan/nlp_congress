 Mr. Speaker, 30 years ago in the Gulf war, Israel  endured 31 scud missile strikes from Iraq; its population effectively  defenseless.   Fifteen years ago in the second Lebanon war, Hezbollah fired 4,000  rockets at Israel in 34 days. Again, Israel had no active defense.   Five months ago over the course of just 11 days, Hamas and other  terrorist groups in Gaza launched more than 4,500 rockets at Israel,  but because of Iron Dome, Israel is no longer defenseless. Iron Dome  has saved lives both Israeli and Palestinian.   America's commitment to Iron Dome is rock solid. Today's vote will  make that clear in spite that some on both sides of the aisle will seek  to make Israel and our unyielding support for the U.S.-Israel  relationship a wedge issue.   There are so many reasons for hope in the region. Israel has a new  government with the broadest imaginable governing coalition, including  Arab parties. Israelis and Palestinians are talking to each other  again. The Abraham Accords are changing the dynamic between Israel and  her Arab neighbors. Progress in all these areas starts with and depends  on security.    Progress in all these areas starts with and depends on  security, and security starts with and relies on Iron Dome funding.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this critical funding  and hope the Senate will take it up immediately.
