 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in opposition to H.R. 842.   Like many other bills in this Congress, the majority has rushed this  bill to the floor with no deliberation in committee.   To be clear, I have never opposed union rights to organize. In fact,  I have worked with them on some valid issues. However, this bill, among  its many concerning provisions, denies States' rights.   As a former State senator, I believe it is unconstitutional to deny  my State of Indiana and our constituents the ability to decide for  themselves whether to join a union.   In short, the PRO Act is an antibusiness, antiworker, and antifree  enterprise socialist agenda. I urge my colleagues to vote against this  radical bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to call up H.R.  682, the Reopen Schools Act, to get our kids out from behind screens  and back in the classroom.    Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule.   I am not going to talk much about the underlying bill since it will  not  [[Page H1170]]  change anyone's vote at this point. I would just summarize it as  advancing a socialist agenda by putting temporary bandages on old  problems without fixing them, at the expense of the middle class and  the future of our children.   Madam Speaker, I mainly just wanted to express my strong  disappointment with how broken our legislative process is and how  dysfunctional Congress is. If we do not fix it soon and have some  common sense, we are going to destroy our great Republic. We should be  embarrassed to call ourselves policymakers.
