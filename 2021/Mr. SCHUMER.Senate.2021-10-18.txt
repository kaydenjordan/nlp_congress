 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I begin today with the news that  General Colin Powell, who served our Nation as the first African- American Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the first African- American Secretary of State, passed away this morning at 84.   General Powell leaves behind a distinguished trailblazing legacy.  Born in Harlem to Jamaican parents, he grew up with a sister and his  parents in South Bronx. He graduated from Melrose High School in the  Bronx in 1954. At City College, his life changed forever when he joined  the school's ROTC program, quickly becoming a standout member and  earning his commission as Second Lieutenant in the Army after  graduation.   From humble beginnings, General Powell's career broke one glass  ceiling after another. His life was a manifestation of the American  dream, a true American success story.   I join all Americans in remembering General Powell's life and his  dedication to the country we love.   My thoughts are with his wife Alma, his three children, and his  entire family.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 414.
