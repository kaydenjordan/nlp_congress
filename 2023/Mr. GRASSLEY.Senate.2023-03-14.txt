 Mr. President, I come to the floor today to commemorate  Sunshine Week. Sunshine Week coincides each year with March 16, one of  our Founding Fathers' birthdays: James Madison. Madison is widely known  as the father of open government.   The sunshine I am talking about isn't the kind that helps the corn  grow in Iowa. Sunshine Week is dedicated to promoting government  accountability to the source from which all government derives its  power: the people. Before joining the Supreme Court in 1916, Justice  Louis Brandeis wrote: ``Sunlight is said to be the best of  disinfectants: electric light the most efficient policeman.'' As a  longtime champion for an open, accessible government, I speak today in  support of those enduring principles.   In great works of literature, readers often remember a novel's  opening line even if they forget the rest. When one hears that line, it  immediately calls to mind the entire book. Well the same is true of our  Constitution, a document that both defines the powers of the  [[Page S768]]  Federal Government and, at the same time, carefully limits those  powers.   ``We The People.'' These are not the opening words of a novel, but  they are just as memorable as the best opening lines in literature.  These solemn words form the opening line of our framework of our  government, the Constitution.   This is not an accident. Our Founders and Framers made a conscious  choice to open our sacred charter by calling to mind the source of all  government powers, from local school boards to the deliberations of  this Chamber: the people of our United States, as James Madison said,  acting in their sovereign capacity. These are truths we must repeat  often, so that we never forget them. The people in this framework are  in control. To use the analogy of the sun, whatever promotes self- governance, spoken of in our Declaration of Independence, is sunshine.  Whatever hinders the people in their right to govern their communities  is darkness.   As the Federal Government has grown in size and scope, all too often  bureaucrats prefer to live in the shadows of the bureaucracy. They  forget that they are ultimately accountable to the people. Because of  this, Congress has passed a series of laws requiring openness and  accountability to citizens and taxpayers. Just like we need information  from government agencies to decide how to cast many of our votes in  Congress, so too do the American people need this information to  fulfill their role, and to cast theirs.   This week is meant to draw attention to this need for openness,  especially the Freedom of Information Act, which requires government  Agencies to produce documents enlightening citizens as to what Agencies  are doing. There is also the inherent constitutional power that Members  of Congress have to conduct oversight and launch investigations.   Despite this framework of laws and the bedrock principles of our  Constitution, Agencies day in and day out fight tooth and nail so they  won't have to turn over records when people file Freedom of Information  Act requests and even when Members of Congress make requests for  information. The Freedom of Information Act is a key law for providing  transparency in government. Exemptions that allow records to be  withheld should only be used when necessary and not as an excuse to  withhold potentially embarrassing information. Federal Agencies must  also reverse the trend of ever-increasing FOIA backlogs.   For example, according to annual FOIA reports, the Department of  Homeland Security saw its FOIA backlog double at the end of fiscal year  2022 from the previous fiscal year. They are not alone. The Justice  Department, Defense Department, and State Department all saw increases  in their FOIA backlogs from the prior year. Federal Agencies need to do  better.   I continue to work for laws that strengthen the Freedom of  Information Act and other measures that will ensure the people's  business is conducted in public, not in private. I am planning to  reintroduce a bipartisan bill to ensure FOIA remains a useful public  tool and to push back against recent case law that erodes greater  transparency. This bill will restore pro-transparency principles and  will make it crystal clear where Congress stands on the public's right  to know what our government is doing.   To mark ``Sunshine Week,'' I am also introducing the bipartisan  Sunshine in the Courtroom Act, which would permit and encourage all  Federal courts to welcome cameras into the courtroom. I am also  cosponsoring, with Senator Durbin, a companion bill which would require  the U.S. Supreme Court to televise the arguments heard before them. I  thank my Senate colleagues who are joining me as cosponsors on these  important pieces of legislation.   I have supported the long overdue release of records on the  assassination of President Kennedy. I support efforts and conduct  oversight on a daily basis that bring information on our government's  operation to the light of day. I have also long supported  whistleblowers, who play a vital role in shining the light on waste,  fraud, and abuse.   By reintroducing the SEC Whistleblower Reform Act, I am working to  ensure whistleblowers who report possible violations of our Federal  securities laws are fully protected, whether they take their concerns  to the SEC or to someone in their company. My office has worked with  whistleblowers and groups protecting their rights for decades. It is an  essential part of our work. As Agencies all too often resist turning  over the information we need to do our jobs, whistleblowers fill that  gap with firsthand accounts of potential wrongdoing. To those  whistleblowers: You are true patriots.   Corruption is a problem in our own government, but it is also a  global problem. I support the rights of whistleblowers everywhere in  their efforts to bring sunshine to corruption and aid people in their  rightful quest to govern themselves.   Finally, I have been a long-time supporter of the False Claims Act.  Since 1986, when I led the effort to update the False Claims Act, that  law has helped the government recover $72 billion in taxpayer money  from fraud and likely saved billions more by deterring would be  fraudsters. The False Claims Act is a tool by which we can--and must-- hold fraudsters accountable.   That is why I also reintroduced the bipartisan Administrative False  Claims Act again this Congress. That legislation raises the statutory  ceiling on claims that can be handled with administrative procedures  from $150,000 to $1 million, expands the number of Justice Department  officials who can review these claims, and allows the government to  recoup costs for investigating and prosecuting these frauds. The  legislation makes pursuing fraudsters more efficient.   We need to take all possible steps to let the sunshine in. If we do,  we will have a better and more accountable government that serves the  people as it should.                            ____________________     Mr. President, last Congress, I spoke of my strong  opposition to the nomination of Eric Garcetti to be Ambassador to the  Republic of India. I opposed the nomination due to the serious and  credible allegations that he enabled sexual harassment and racism to  run rampant in the Los Angeles mayor's office. When the nomination  expired, I had hoped President Biden would recognize his egregious  mistake, believe the victims, and change course.   President Biden failed to do so. Indefensibly, at the same time the  Biden administration decries sexual harassment and racism, it has now  twice nominated an individual to represent our country abroad who has  enabled those very same disgusting acts. Accordingly, I continue to  oppose Garcetti's nomination and ask this question: What will it take  for the Biden administration to believe the victims? That same question  should be posed to every Member in the Senate that is considering  voting for him.   During my career, I have prioritized protecting victims of sexual  harassment and abuse. In 2005, I cosponsored the Violence Against Women  Act. That bill provides vital aid to the Justice Department's Office on  Violence Against Women and to law enforcement to protect victims of  sexual harassment and abuse. Last Congress, I cosponsored bills  introduced by Senator Gillibrand to protect and defend victims of  sexual harassment and sexual misconduct. I cosponsored resolutions  introduced by Senator Feinstein to raise awareness of sexual assault.  These include the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and  Sexual Harassment Act of 2021, the Military Justice Improvement and  Increasing Prevention Act of 2021, the Speak Out Act, the Campus  Accountability and Safety Act, and a resolution supporting the goals  and ideals of National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month.   This Congress, I have sent several bipartisan letters to the  Department of Justice seeking information regarding sexual misconduct  by Bureau of Prisons personnel and inmates against staff. With Senators  Durbin and Padilla, I met with the Bureau of Prisons Director to  further investigate sexual misconduct and discuss reforms to enhance  prevention, reporting, investigation, prosecution, and discipline of  these matters.   With respect to Mayor Garcetti, I have made clear to my colleagues  and  [[Page S769]]  the American people that credible whistleblowers approached my office  about concerning allegations that he was aware of and enabled his  deputy chief of staff, Rick Jacobs, to sexually harass several  employees within the mayor's office. These men and women alleged that  Rick Jacobs engaged in inappropriate and degrading physical contact  without their consent. They alleged that Rick Jacobs made crude sexual  remarks and gestures towards staff and others. They alleged that he  made blatantly racist remarks towards Asians and other minorities.   These allegations have also been publicly reported by many news  outlets. Text messages made public by the Los Angeles Times indicate  that these incidents were common knowledge among Garcetti's staff. A  now infamous picture shows Jacobs inappropriately touching an  individual next to him. In the picture, Mayor Garcetti is standing on  the other side of Jacobs.   Mayor Garcetti said under oath during his nomination that ``I want to  say unequivocally that I never witnessed, nor was it brought to my  attention, the behavior that's been alleged, and I also want to assure  you if it had been, I would have immediately taken action to stop  that.''   How can that statement be true when there is a photo with Jacobs  inappropriately touching an individual next to Garcetti? How can that  statement be true when text messages exist from his own staff  discussing the toxic work environment within the mayor's office?   In total, my office identified over 19 individuals who have either  witnessed Jacobs' behavior or were the victims of it. So who are these  brave and courageous individuals who made these allegations? Are they  Republican operatives? No. They are his former communications director,  senior staffers, junior staffers, businessmen, civic leaders, and a Los  Angeles Police Department officer assigned to protect him. This isn't a  political hit job. This is a bipartisan endeavor to stop an inadequate  nominee.   To defend himself, Mayor Garcetti has pointed to a report which  inconceivably purports to clear Jacobs of any wrongdoing. The report  was conducted by a law firm hired and paid for by the city of Los  Angeles. Mayor Garcetti and the city of Los Angeles would be liable if  the report concluded sexual harassment occurred. The report was also  delivered to the city of Los Angeles under attorney-client privilege,  apparently in the hope that no one outside the city would ever see it.   The report failed to interview multiple firsthand witnesses. The  interviews weren't taken under penalty of perjury. The report focused  exclusively on allegations of sexual harassment made by the Los Angeles  Police Department officer and failed to give due weight to other  witnesses. For example, the report includes an interview with Jacobs in  which he admits to using racist language, kissing, hugging, and  squeezing people's shoulders. The report also identifies the individual  in the lewd photo I mentioned earlier. The report says that the  individual stated that Jacob's actions weren't funny and embarrassed  that person. That makes it clear nonconsensual physical contact  occurred. It is evidence that sexual harassment occurred. And it  literally occurred right next to Mayor Garcetti.   The last time I spoke about this matter was right after President  Biden signed the Speak Out Act into law. I cosponsored that bill, which  Senator Gillibrand led. The law enables survivors to speak out about  workplace sexual assault and harassment.   So, on the one hand, the Biden administration says it supports  victims. Yet, on the other hand, the Biden administration supports a  nominee who enables misconduct that creates more victims. The Biden  administration's positions are irreconcilable. They are the very  definition of tone deafness. The Biden administration and all those who  support this nomination have sent a message that victims will only be  believed when politically convenient. The Biden administration has no  credibility when it comes to protecting victims of sexual harassment.  To my Senate colleagues, do you support victims of sexual harassment  and racism or a man who enabled it for years, leaving many victims in  his wake? You can't support both.   Mayor Garcetti's own staff have spoken out to stop this nomination at  a risk to their careers. One of them is Naomi Seligman, who was Mayor  Garcetti's former communications director and one of the many  whistleblowers who worked with my office regarding this nomination. She  said that Garcetti's vote out of the Foreign Relations Committee ``on  International Women's Day no less, shows a real disconnect between the  rhetoric we hear from elected leaders who claim to support victims of  workplace sexual harassment and the pass they give to party loyalists  in the next breath. It's disheartening to say the least.''   I agree. Mayor Garcetti is incompatible with the office that he  seeks. I, again, strongly encourage my colleagues--Democrats and  Republicans alike--to review the evidence found in my investigative  report, as well as in the press. Most importantly, listen to the  victims. The facts and the evidence compel me to vote no, and my  colleagues must join me in doing the same.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I intend to object to any unanimous  consent request relating to the nomination of Joshua D. Jacobs, to be  Under Secretary for Benefits at the Department of Veterans Affairs,  PN195.   Mr. Jacobs, if confirmed, would lead the Veterans Benefits  Administration at VA. This VA component is at the heart of my many  congressional oversight requests dating back 2 years, which the VA has  failed to adequately respond to. The whistleblower allegations raised  in my oversight inquiries that the VA Office of Inspector General-- OIG--investigated have been vindicated, with the OIG issuing a report  last year identifying potential conflicts of interest by the senior VA  official at issue, Ms. Charmain Bogue. That official left Federal  service and failed to cooperate further with OIG, as did the  organization her husband worked for, Veterans Education Success, which  had business before VA. This leaves questions open that VA has yet to  resolve.   I raised other issues as well that the OIG did not investigate, but  which VA needs to respond to. This includes allegations that VA failed  to protect sensitive and confidential information about publicly traded  companies. The OIG decided that this was more properly investigated by  the Securities and Exchange Commission, but to my knowledge, they have  not investigated the matter either. It falls upon VA to provide  transparency on the issue.   I have also raised questions regarding FOIA records that show a  senior VA official, Mr. Thomas Murphy, admitting to firing the person  he suspected of being a whistleblower to my office in 2021. VA has not  adequately responded to this apparently egregious violation of  whistleblower-protections laws. I have raised serious additional  questions as to what knowledge VA officials had of the underlying  conflicts of interest at issue in my inquiry, how those conflicts were  allowed to exist, why VA obstructed my investigation, and like issues.   To date, VA has failed to provide a full and complete response to any  of the five oversight letters I have sent to them since April 2021. And  today, I am sending two more, to the VA and OIG, raising allegations  whistleblowers have brought to my office concerning potential contract  irregularities and illustrating the VA's failure to answer the many  outstanding questions I have raised in the past. There are at least 27  outstanding requests and questions raised in these letters that VA has  inadequately addressed and, in many instances, not addressed at all. In  instances where they have provided records, those have been heavily  redacted with citations to FOIA exemptions, even though FOIA does not  apply to Congress. In some instances, I have even had to rely upon  third-party FOIA productions to provide information. It was only  through a FOIA production, for example, that I learned that VA had  begun drafting a response to me soon after my initial oversight letter,  but never sent it. Instead, VA waited nearly 9 months to respond and  even then declined to answer any of my questions other than requests  for records, which it heavily redacted, and many of which it withheld  in full. In  [[Page S770]]  other words, the draft response that I would have never received but  for FOIA included more information than what VA eventually sent me.   Because of my concerns with VA's obstruction and because the  nomination relates to a position at the center of my oversight  requests, I submitted questions for the record to Mr. Jacobs. Although  I appreciate his response to my questions, I found a number of his  answers unsatisfactory. For instance, he was provided with sufficient  background in my questions with respect to my VA inquiry. I asked him,  given the fact that he currently is exercising the powers of Under  Secretary for Benefits, if he would commit to opening an investigation  now into the serious questions I raised. He declined to respond,  instead stating what he would do in certain hypothetical circumstances,  even though the questions pertained to matters directly under his  current purview. After I provided the names, dates, and specific  allegations that need to be addressed but have failed to be for the  past 2 years and after repeating many of those details in my questions  to Mr. Jacobs, it was unacceptable for him to answer in hypotheticals.  Many of his other responses were equally disappointing.   My staff has also identified at least one document that seems to  contradict Mr. Jacobs' claim that he did not play ``any role'' in VA's  response to my inquiry. While I make no claim that Mr. Jacobs  intentionally misled me in his responses, this document at least raises  serious questions as to the accuracy of his blanket assertion. In the  document, Mr. Jacobs reaches out to a senior VA legislative affairs  official, multiple officials from VA's Office of General Counsel, and  others, relaying information on a call he received about a matter  related to my oversight, which he believed was the same issue that  prompted my letters. This shows that he took at least one phone call on  what he thought was the same matter and provided this information to  those preparing a response to me. It is difficult to imagine that  nobody ever responded to Mr. Jacobs, either by email or in-person  conversations, in which he would have had additional conversations  about VA's response. Accordingly, the email undercuts his assertion  that he did not play ``any role'' in the matter. Moreover, VA's  redaction-filled productions make it difficult to bring transparency.   Because of VA's lack of transparency on these critical issues and Mr.  Jacobs' evasive answers on a number of my questions, I must therefore  object to any consideration of this nominee. I am more than willing to  discuss with the VA and Mr. Jacobs how they can remedy the deficiencies  in their responses.   This hold is a reminder that executive agencies have an ongoing  obligation to respond to congressional inquiries in a full and timely  manner.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have been glad to see that Lena Santos  Ferguson is finally gaining recognition for her work to desegregate the  Daughters of the American Revolution. In 1980, Mrs. Ferguson was turned  away when she tried to join DAR. She was discriminated against even  though she could trace her ancestry to Jonah Gay, who had supported the  Revolution through the town committee of Friendship, ME.   According to the Washington Post, one of Ferguson's White sponsors  was told that, if Mrs. Ferguson was admitted, the DC chapter ``will  probably fall apart.'' However, last month, the DAR renamed its  Washington, DC, nursing scholarship as the ``Daughters of the American  Revolution--Lena Ferguson Scholarship,'' doubled its size, and  announced the upcoming placement of a plaque in honor of her work.   It is a testament to the work of those such as Ferguson that the DAR  has gone from threatening dissolution to naming a scholarship in her  honor.   Ferguson represented a much larger group of under-recognized Black  Revolutionary War patriots. In 1984, when Ferguson was finally allowed  to join the DAR, the settlement agreement had an impact well beyond one  woman's effort for recognition. It led to new research and the  identification of over 5,000 of the estimated 10,000 Black  Revolutionary War participants.   However, highlighting the contributions Black patriots made in the  American Revolution does not end with DAR. That is why I worked with  Senator Murphy to pass into law the National Liberty Memorial  Preservation Act. Our bipartisan bill allows the National Mall Liberty  Fund D.C.--a group founded by Maurice Barboza, Ferguson's nephew--to  continue its work getting a monument to Black patriots on or near the  National Mall in Washington, DC.   Both this monument and the work of Mrs. Ferguson display the founding  purpose of our Nation. Unlike almost every other country on Earth,  Americans are not bound together by a common ethnicity or geographical  ancestry. We are all Americans because we believe in the principles our  country was founded upon. This is the common heritage of all Americans  of all backgrounds. It is vital that we do not forget that bond and  even more vital that we preserve the principles themselves and honor  those of all backgrounds who fought for them.   The construction of the National Liberty Memorial by July 4, 2026-- the 250th anniversary of our Nation's founding--would serve as another  important reminder of that bond we share as Americans. I urge my fellow  Americans to come together around that goal.                            ____________________
