 Mr. President, today, the Senate has a packed schedule.  By the end of the day, the Senate will have confirmed another three  members of President Biden's Cabinet.   First up is Representative Marcia Fudge to serve as the 18th  Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. What an excellent choice  for the job. She represented the people of Ohio in Congress since 2008  and, before that, served as the first African American and first female  mayor of Warrensville Heights in Ohio.   She has a difficult job ahead of her. Millions of Americans are  behind on the rent and 3 million homeowners are in forbearance. At the  same time, we are on the verge of passing major assistance for renters  and for homeowners. As the incoming Secretary, I know Representative  Fudge will implement that assistance with alacrity. And, of course, I  will be focusing, among other issues in housing, on public housing,  which I know she cares about a great deal as well.   Later this afternoon, we will move to the confirmation of Merrick  Garland to become Attorney General. After Donald Trump spent 4 years, 4  long years, subverting the powers of the Justice Department for his own  political benefit, treating the Attorney General like his own personal  defense lawyer, America can breathe a sigh of relief that we are  finally going to have someone like Merrick Garland leading the Justice  Department, someone with integrity, independence, respect for the rule  of law, and credibility on both sides of the aisle. He understands that  the job of Attorney General is one to protect the rule of law, unlike  the previous Attorneys General under President Trump who, too often,  just bowed to his whim and his will when it was against rule of law.   It is confounding, in light of all of that, that Republicans have  chosen--some of them anyway--to delay his nomination, particularly in  the aftermath of the Capitol attacks, but he will be confirmed today,  despite their attempts to stonewall the process.   Finally, Mr. President, the Senate will confirm Michael Regan to  serve as EPA Administrator. Once again, the change between the previous  administration and the incoming Administrator will be dramatic. Under  Donald Trump, the EPA weakened environmental protections, fudged the  science, and completely ignored climate change to potentially,  unfortunately, disastrous effect.    It is high time the Senate confirmed someone like Michael Regan, who  has made environmental protection the cause of his career, to lead the  Agency and set it back on its proper footing.   Once we finish with the confirmations of these three nominees, the  Senate will have confirmed 16 Cabinet-level officials. That is in  addition to passing a massive COVID bill and conducting an impeachment  trial of the former President--despite getting a late start to our work  thanks to a delay in the organizing resolution. The Senate is going to  keep up the pace.  [[Page S1434]]  President Biden deserves to have his team in place, working for the  American people.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on the American Rescue Plan, later  today, the House of Representatives is set to approve the American  Rescue Plan and send it straight to President Biden's desk for his  signature, capping a monthslong effort by the Democrats to pass bold  COVID relief to defeat the pandemic and boost our economy. Once  President Biden signs the bill into law, it will immediately become the  most sweeping Federal recovery package in recent history.   Even a cursory reading of the headlines gives you a sense of the  historic nature of this bold and so helpful legislation.   Here is one from yesterday from the New York Times:         Growth in the U.S. could surge on the stimulus plan and a       rapid vaccine rollout.    Wouldn't that be great? We think there is a very good chance of its  happening.   Forbes:         U.S. Economy Will Recover Twice as Fast Thanks to $1.9       Trillion Stimulus.    That is from Forbes, a conservative publication.   The Associated Press:         COVID bill to deliver big health insurance savings for       many.    This is something so many Americans desperately need and want.   Here is another from the New York Times:         In the Stimulus Bill, a Policy Revolution in Aid for       Children.    A policy revolution.   Simply put, the American Rescue Plan is one of the most significant  Federal relief efforts that Congress has seen in a very, very long  time. I am greatly looking forward to its becoming law.   Now, I have spent a lot of time talking about all of the different  provisions of the bill today and in previous remarks on the floor of  the Senate. That is because the American Rescue Plan is a truly  comprehensive effort. COVID-19 has impacted nearly every aspect of  American life. So we had to craft legislation that spanned the gamut:  schools, businesses, families, jobs, healthcare. Because this bill is  so wide-ranging, I haven't spent enough time on the significance of the  individual programs.   I want to rectify that over the next several weeks. This morning, I  want to focus on two initiatives: first, the child tax credit and,  second, agricultural assistance for disadvantaged farmers.   According to the most recent data, more than 10 million children live  below the poverty line in America--10 million children. A child  starting out in life, through no fault of his or her own, lives below  the poverty line, and we know what that means in terms of food and  healthcare and housing and education. Compared with other nations  around the world, the United States dedicates a relative pittance--a  pittance--to fixing that terrible injustice.   Listen to this. This is something that should make us both ashamed  that the United States has been in this position for so long and proud  that the American Rescue Plan will help rectify that injustice. Here it  is: The United States ranks next to last among the world's 37 most  developed economies in terms of family benefits--barely ahead of  Turkey--nothing that can make Americans proud.   Of course, the pandemic has made the problem of child poverty even  worse. It has forced parents to serve as childcare providers and  surrogate teachers while trying to keep up with their own jobs. For  millions of Americans who lost their jobs through no fault of their  own, the pressure only increased. The difficulty of childcare during  the pandemic is likely one of the main reasons there has been a  disproportionate share of women who have fallen out of the workforce.  The pandemic has left mothers and fathers with impossible choices,  between keeping their jobs and incomes or leaving work to care for  their children, stuck at home, whom they so dearly love   Democrats decided to tackle this problem head on in the American  Rescue Plan. We expanded the child tax credit to provide up to $3,000  per child, ages 6 to 17, and $3,600 per child under the age of 6 for an  overwhelming majority of families in this country. Analysts predict  that this policy will cut childhood poverty in half--in half. That is  an astounding statistic. It will cut childhood poverty in half. A goal  of so many who have studied the frailties in some of our policies for a  decade, for a generation, has been to remove people--young children-- from poverty, and half will be so removed.   That is just one reason reviewers have called the American Rescue  Plan one of the ``most far-reaching anti-poverty efforts in an [entire]  generation.''   A salute to Sherrod Brown, Michael Bennet, and Cory Booker, who  really spearheaded this, along with Congressman Neal in the House; Ron  Wyden and his committee that worked on drafting it; and my staffers who  spent so much time on making this work as well. A salute to them.   Now, another provision that has received too little attention is the  support this bill will provide to disadvantaged farmers. Across nearly  every statistic, farmers from socially disadvantaged communities fare  worse than their White counterparts, suffering from generations of  systemic discrimination, land loss, and what Secretary Vilsack calls a  ``cycle of debt.'' It is almost something that recalls the days of  slavery and sharecropping and tenant farming. Recently, these farmers  have suffered again, disproportionately, from COVID-19.   The American Rescue Plan provides more than $10 billion to support  our Nation's agriculture and sets aside, roughly, half of it--half of  it--for disadvantaged communities, particularly Black farmers, for debt  relief, education, training, and land acquisition. Though it is only a  small fraction of the overall bill, experts have called the American  Rescue Plan ``the most significant legislation for Black farmers since  the Civil Rights Act.''   It is amazing what we can do when we put our minds to it. The  hangover from the horrible treatment that rural African-American  farmers have gotten since the days of slavery can, in part--in decent  part--be undone by this legislation.   I want to thank some of my fellow Senators who did such work on this  bill. The provisions I have mentioned owe a great deal to the members  of the Agriculture Committee and the Finance Committee. Senator  Stabenow was relentless in pushing this issue. Senator Wyden, chair of  the Finance Committee, helped out a great deal, and Senators Warnock  and Booker pushed very hard as well.   The American Rescue Plan is going to have an immense impact on nearly  every community in America. In the weeks and months to come, I will be  highlighting how much good it will do.   I have a few housekeeping things to do.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the senior  Senator from New York be authorized to sign duly enrolled bills or  joint resolutions on March 10.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions be discharged from  further consideration of S. 320 and the Senate proceed to its immediate  consideration.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read  a third time.  [[Page S1435]]    The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read  the third time.    I know of no further debate.    I ask that the motion to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions be discharged from  further consideration of S. 415 and the Senate proceed to its immediate  consideration.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read  a third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 102, submitted earlier today.    It was a very good film, I must add.   I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to; that the  preamble be agreed to; and that the motions to reconsider be considered  made  [[Page S1436]]  and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote  that was set for 5:23 begins right now.   I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that with respect  to the Regan nomination, the motion to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table and the President be immediately notified of  the Senate's action.    Mr. President, first, let me explain to the public and  the Senators what we are doing here. In the bipartisan agreement we  faced under a 50-50 Senate, the rules say that if there were a tie  vote, the majority leader has the ability to discharge the nomination  from committee and then there be a vote on the floor.   In this case, the nomination of Xavier Becerra to be Secretary of  Health and Human Services, there was a tie vote in the Finance  Committee. And what I will be doing in a moment is invoking that rule  so that there can be 4 hours of debate on the motion, equally divided,  and we will debate whether Becerra should be approved. Obviously, he  only needs approval with 50 or 51 votes if the Vice President comes to  break the tie.   I will say a brief word here. It is confounding to me that Mr.  Becerra, Xavier Becerra, did not get some votes from the other side of  the aisle. He is an eminently qualified member. He was an outstanding  Member of Congress. He was a very good Attorney General, and he has led  the charge to keep people's healthcare. When he was Attorney General,  he was involved in the lawsuits of those who wanted to repeal the ACA.  And if that is the reason our Republican colleagues are objecting-- because he wants to keep and preserve the Affordable Care Act, which is  very popular with the American people and very needed--I am surprised.  It is yesterday's news.   I know in 2010 a lot of people came here, ``Repeal ACA,'' but as the  public got to know the ACA, they saw how good it was. And there is not  much groundswell out there, except among some, the hard right, to  repeal it. So I am surprised. And then we heard: Well, he is not a  doctor. I would remind my colleagues that the last nominee for HHS they  supported was a drug company executive. Are our Republican friends  saying they would rather have a drug company executive who was not a  doctor either than somebody who has been a very careful, smart attorney  who has been fighting for people to get better healthcare? I am  surprised.   So I hope that we may get a few of our colleagues to join us tomorrow  and vote for Mr. Becerra. I don't think it will serve the country well  or the Republicans well to be so adamantly opposed to him. But let me  now proceed.                            ____________________     Mr. President, pursuant to S. Res. 27, the Committee on  Finance, being tied on the question of reporting, I move to discharge  the Senate Finance Committee from further consideration of the  nomination of Xavier Becerra, of California, to be Secretary of Health  and Human Services.    Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, we  expect a vote on the motion to discharge to occur at approximately 12  noon on Thursday, March 11, 2021.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10:30 a.m.,  Thursday, March 11; that following the prayer and the pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of  morning business, the Senate proceed to executive session and resume  consideration of the motion to discharge the nomination of Xavier  Becerra from the Committee on Finance, with the time expiring at 12  noon; further, that upon disposition of the motion to discharge, the  Senate resume consideration of the nomination of Debra Haaland to be  Secretary of the Interior; finally, that the cloture motion on the  Haaland nomination ripen at 1:30 p.m.    For the information of Senators, there will be two  rollcall votes during Thursday's session of the Senate at 12:00 noon on  the motion to discharge the Becerra nomination and at 1:30 p.m. on the  motion to invoke cloture on the Haaland nomination.                            ____________________     Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order, following the remarks of Senator Sullivan.
