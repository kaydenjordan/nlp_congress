 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the so-called Right to  Try Act.   This ideologically driven legislation is trying to solve a problem  that simply doesn't exist.   Every single Member of this body supports allowing terminally ill  individuals to seek access to experimental treatments that could be  potentially lifesaving. However, we have to do so in a structured way  that won't undermine the role of the FDA in guaranteeing that the  medications we all use are safe and are effective.   I believe the FDA's current expanded access program meets that test  by ensuring proper informed consent and adverse event reporting and  establishes the appropriate safeguards around access to experimental  drugs.   The legislation before us would take the FDA out of the process  completely and would allow a black market of snake oil salesmen to  emerge, with unscrupulous companies selling untested drugs to a broad  array of individuals, including those with manageable chronic  conditions like diabetes.   Make no mistake about it: this legislation offers false hope to  seriously ill individuals and will put patients at risk.
