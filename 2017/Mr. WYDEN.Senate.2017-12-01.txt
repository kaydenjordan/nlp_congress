 Mr. President, I want to pick up where Senator Murray left  off and emphasize to colleagues that not only would this bill raise  taxes on millions of middle-class families, but it would also be a  dagger in the heart of the Affordable Care Act, causing millions to  lose their coverage and raise costs for millions more. By gutting the  personal responsibility portion of the Affordable Care Act, this  legislation is going to take America back to the days when healthcare  was for the healthy and wealthy because it will green-light once more  discriminating against those with preexisting conditions. It will say  the insurance companies can go out and beat the stuffing out of  somebody who has a preexisting condition.   If that is not enough, evidence this morning in the paper shows that  this will trigger a new wave of health insurance scams and rip-offs  that are going to harm our people. This morning in the paper, they  talked about how this is going to encourage these cheap, junk, short- term health insurance policies, which often lack consumer protections  and in so many instances have been a magnet for fraud and unscrupulous  sales practices.   For example, the paper this morning talked about how--I will read it.  ``Examples abound of people who are dumped from such policies''--these  short-term policies--``or denied coverage, mired in debt and medical  bills totaling thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars.'' It  documents the various sales tactics used to rip people off. I remember  what those tactics were like. When I was director of the senior  citizens, the Gray Panthers, at home, it was common for agents to sell  policy after policy that was not worth much more than the paper it was  written on. It sure sounds to me as though these short-term policies,  while a different time, are going to encourage the same kinds of rip- off practices that are going to harm our people.   As we have touched on, we have heard from Senators on the other side  that they think that if they vote for this bill, what they are going to  be able to do is get two other bills that somehow will mitigate, will  eliminate a lot of the harm this horribly flawed bill is going to do.  It is going to harm millions of middle-class families who don't get a  fair shake in the marketplace and then inflict all this damage on  healthcare that I just described.   I happen to think these two bills are constructive bills. The  Alexander-Murray bill will make payments that will help limit the  amount low-income Americans pay for health insurance. Our colleagues,  Senators Collins and Nelson, have another constructive idea-- reinsurance money. That helps to stabilize the insurance market, which,  by the way, the President of the United States has worked so hard to  destabilize. The fact is, the Congressional Budget Office, which is the  nonpartisan group of experts we use, has made it clear that these two  bills will not even come close to wiping out the disastrous  consequences of the health provisions in this bill that the Senate is  about to vote for.   I want to be clear. This is not just a tax bill, not just a bill with  handouts to multinational corporations and a grab bag full of goodies  for campaign supporters and powerful, well-connected interests. It is  not just that. It is a big step backward in the cause of making sure  that all our people have affordable, accessible healthcare.   What we ought to be doing is looking at ways to come together and  find common ground on provisions that we know are cost-effective,  things like the children's health bill, which if I had my way would  have been passed a long time ago, and community health centers and  other vital provisions. We should be building on what we have, such as  holding down the cost of pharmaceuticals, for example, targeting the  middlemen who are at the heart of the problem. That is what we ought to  be doing.   We should not be doing what is on offer this morning. What is on  offer this morning is turning back the clock on American healthcare,  turning back the clock to those dark days when the insurance companies  could beat the stuffing out of somebody who had a preexisting  condition. We are better than that. We still have time. As I have said  on the floor, as the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee, we  still have time to choose a different course. A few days ago, 17  Democratic Senators--led by Senators Manchin, Kaine, Donnelly, and  Heitkamp--came together and said: We want to find common ground on  taxes. I have written two bipartisan, comprehensive Federal income tax  bills, the most recent one with a member of the President's Cabinet.   We don't have to go this route. We don't have to go this route on  taxes. We certainly don't have to do it on healthcare. There are  approaches that would bring us together, and I have just described  several of them. What I know we shouldn't do is turn back the clock to  the days when healthcare in America was for the healthy and wealthy.  That is what you get when you green-light discrimination against people  with preexisting conditions. If they are healthy, no problem. If they  are wealthy, they can take care of it. We should reject this bill and  especially the provisions that relate to healthcare and that take  America back to dark days, horrible days when healthcare in America was  essentially for the healthy and wealthy.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.    I am very pleased that my colleague from Vermont is  discussing this issue on the floor. The Finance Democratic staff has  been looking into this and has been working also with the Senator's  staff, and I think that it would be fair to say that every few hours,  this bill just seems to get worse. I mean, we don't know if, in the  middle of the night, somebody will add another round of favors for the  powerful interests, the politically well connected. What I can tell the  Senator is what we have been able to put together as of now.   In 2004, legislation was written that we were very much involved in  that helped eliminate the loophole by requiring U.S. citizens to be  bona fide residents of the Virgin Islands and imposing U.S. tax on  income effectively connected with the United States. Now, in the dark  of night, as I have indicated, it appears that we have a provision that  is relaxing this rule.   From our conversations, I know the Senator understands that we all  want to help the people of the Virgin Islands after a devastating  hurricane. Are we helping people by creating a huge, new loophole,  possibly for a handful of those people who are especially well  connected and can get to the Finance Committee? I am convinced that if  one looks at the Paradise Papers and the Panama Papers, what they were  warning about in those papers was of all of these efforts to stash  money and create new options for people to wheel and deal in offshore  accounts.   So my colleague is right. I continue to wonder why, when we want to  ask these really important questions about special interest favors and  when we look to the other side, we have this barrier between both sides  of the aisle. We need somebody here to explain to us and explain to the  American people how this has seemed to just fly out of the sky.   I am very appreciative of the Senator's raising a question about what  looks like yet another scam that has come into a process that has been  one big sham from the beginning. I appreciate my colleague's question.    If my colleague will yield, there is no question he is  correct that in terms of stacking the deck, this is not just stacked to  the top but to the top 1 percent or a fraction of the 1 percent.    If my colleague will yield, there is no question he is  correct that in terms of stacking the deck, this is not just stacked to  the top but to the top 1 percent or a fraction of the 1 percent.    There is absolutely no question about that. We are looking  at something like half of the middle class to be paying more in taxes  come 2027.    Not for a minute.   The reason my colleague's questions are so important is that this is,  certainly, an example of what seems to turn up every few hours,  practically in the middle of the night.   My colleague raised a very good point with respect to the development  of this bill. I mean, we are talking about making $10 trillion worth of  changes in tax policy on the fly--without a hearing. The Senator's  colleagues have said--Chairman Enzi and the Budget Committee--and I  have heard it several times on the other side--that there were 70  hearings on this bill. There was not one on this piece of legislation.  It certainly didn't examine this issue. It didn't examine the question,  for example, of what is going to happen to people with this dagger to  the Affordable Care Act.   I can tell this to my colleague because he is right to talk about how  one brings parties together. I know my colleague did that as part of a  major bill on the Veterans' Affairs Committee with Senator McCain. Our  former colleague Bill Bradley mentioned that when he wrote a tax bill,  he flew all over the country to work with Republicans. In this case,  apropos of my colleague's question, not only did no one do that sort of  thing, but they wouldn't even walk down the corridor to talk about  working with the other side.    Will my colleague yield for a moment?    Will my colleague yield for a moment?    Will my colleague yield for a moment?    I want to ask the Senator a question because I am not sure  that we have really laid out the timetable of what is ahead. My  colleague, of course, who is our ranking Democrat on the Budget  Committee, is very up on this.   We have all been concerned because we have seen it before. You pass  these big tax cuts. You get on a sugar high for a relatively short  period of time. Then the deficits start rolling in. What we see next  are the cuts in the programs that are a lifeline for millions of  people--the anti-hunger programs, Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security.   I saw comments in the paper that what my colleague is concerned about  has already been announced by the Speaker of the House. I understand  that what the Speaker of the House has said is that his next plan is to  take up the issues of what he calls entitlement reform. They are not  talking about the things that the American people care about and that I  am going to hear about at townhall meetings at home this weekend-- holding down the costs of prescription drugs. They are talking about  rolling back the safety net--Medicaid and the anti-hunger programs and  Social Security.   Is that my colleague's understanding?    Reserving the right to object, if I could, I don't think  the UC was granted.    Well, I would like to reserve my right to object at this  time.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?    Reserving my right to object, and I will not object. I  would just like to make sure that our colleague from Oklahoma and our  colleague from Washington are both accommodated in this matter.   Senator Sanders and I have finished. I believe Senator Cantwell said  that Senator Inhofe will go ahead. We thank Senator Cantwell for her  usual collegiality.   Senator Inhofe will go first and I ask unanimous consent that Senator  Cantwell follow Senator Inhofe, and I will withdraw my reservation.   I withdraw my reservation and I ask unanimous consent that Senator  Cantwell follow Senator Inhofe.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator  Cantwell and Senator Van Hollen be allowed a total of 15 minutes to  discuss some very important issues.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.   The Senator from Washington.    Reserving the right to object.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.    Mr. President and colleagues, the Senate is looking at  making $10 trillion of changes in tax policy on the fly. This is the  biggest change in Federal income tax policy in more than three decades.  This is legislation that will determine our country's economic future  for a generation, and, at this time, the Senate does not have the  language the Senate will be voting on. My colleagues have been saying  that they are out looking for it.   I have a couple of questions I would like to ask the distinguished  majority leader.   When will the Senate be able to actually see the full text of this  legislation?   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would say to my friend from Oregon  that there will be plenty of time for him to read it.    Again, through the Chair, we are talking about complicated  materials. We are talking about extraordinarily difficult, technical  issues under the best of circumstances. While I respect the majority  leader, to just be told we will have plenty of time to read it, what I  can say--coming on top of the fact that we didn't have a single hearing  on the actual legislation, nothing with regard to specifics--I think on  this side of the aisle we have a right to some sense of when we will  actually be able to see this. It strikes me as a reasonable and pretty  straightforward request, given the fact that the American people have  been kept in the dark about this for so long.   So, again, I respectfully ask the majority leader: When will it be  possible to see the full text of this bill?   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my good friend from Oregon,  there were 4 days of hearings on the bill in committee with the  committee report sent out at least 2 weeks ago. I am totally confident  our friends on the other side are fully familiar with almost all  aspects of this. He will certainly have an opportunity to read the  final version, but he is very familiar with the various parts of this.  There was plenty of time to look at it in committee, and, as I said,  there will be plenty of time to read the final version of it before we  vote.    Further reserving my right to object, I know that on the  other side there has been discussion of scores and scores of hearings.  I would say to the distinguished majority leader, there was not one  single hearing--not one--on the specifics with respect to this  legislation. There was not one single hearing on the health changes the  majority seeks to make that put a dagger into the heart of the  Affordable Care Act.   So I will ask my colleague once more, and if we don't get a sense of  what time we are actually going to see this bill, I intend to object.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.    Will my colleague yield for a question?   Could my colleague tell me when the hearing was held on the health  changes envisioned in this legislation?    Will my colleague yield?    Will my colleague yield?    Will my colleague yield?    Will my colleague yield?    Will my colleague yield?    Will my colleague yield?    Will my colleague continue to yield?    In just one moment.   Will my colleague yield for a question?   I believe I have the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to----    Reserving the right to object.    It is my intention, Mr. President, to come back every 30  minutes until we get an answer to the question. I just asked my  colleague from South Carolina if there was a hearing on the sweeping  changes that are being proposed in this bill, the Affordable Care Act.  I asked him for a date. He said nothing with respect to----    Mr. President, we will be back in 30 minutes to continue  this.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   There will now be 30 minutes of debate.   The Senator from Colorado.    Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cruz). The majority controls 1 minute, and  the Democrats control 1\1/2\ minutes.    Mr. President, I will take our 1\1/2\ minutes.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.    Mr. President, I will take our 1\1/2\ minutes.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.    We have just a minute and a half. The hour is late. I want  to repeat once again that we still do not have this bill. We have seen  apparently, in the last few hours, tax changes that involve billions  and billions of dollars. The American people have a right to know what  is in this proposal, and certainly we on this side of the aisle have a  right to know about it.   I am struck by the comments of my colleagues on the other side that  learning the facts about what the Joint Committee on Taxation had to  say about the Republican proposal--0.8 percent growth, $1 trillion  short in spending--has had absolutely no effect on the discussion we  are having from the Republican side.   I see my friend the distinguished majority leader here, and I believe  he will propound a unanimous consent request. As he knows, I will have  another reservation, and we will discuss this some more.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there now  be 30 minutes equally divided for debate only, with no amendments or  motions in order and with the majority leader being recognized at the  conclusion of that time.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?    Reserving the right to object.   Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.   Is there objection to the majority leader's unanimous consent  request?    Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I understand  that we are going to get the proposal from the majority shortly. I come  back again to the fact that there are changes apparently worth billions  and billions of dollars, like the passthrough provision. We need to be  able to see these. The American people have a right to know.   I believe the majority has indicated that we will get this shortly,  and I withdraw my reservation and will point out that if we don't get  it shortly, I will stay at my post and keep objecting because the  American people have a right to know that tax policy is being made in  the dark.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   Who yields time?   The Senator from Colorado.    Mr. President, will my friend from Pennsylvania yield  briefly?    Mr. President, will my friend from Pennsylvania yield  briefly?    He is a very fine member of the Finance Committee.   I don't remember any discussion in our committee about how this  specific legislation affects children. My colleague is really the  expert on the subject, and maybe he can tell me if he recalls such a  thing with respect to this specific legislation and what it means for  children. I don't remember such a discussion.    Mr. President, I would just like to respond briefly to the  Senator from Pennsylvania, who is baffled by why we are so opposed to  the health provisions of the bill. The Congressional Budget Office says  that the majority's provisions will cause 13 million people to lose  coverage and premiums to go up 10 percent. This morning's paper makes  the point that it will bring back junk insurance, which once again will  allow discrimination against people with preexisting conditions.   I will use the last 30 seconds that I have, as we await the majority  leader, to say, once again, that the American people and the Congress  are actually going to find out some information about what is being  offered.   I would just like to close my use of the minute by pointing out now  another double standard. It sure looks like lobbyists on K Street have  more and better information about what is about to be offered than do  Democrats in the Senate. So what we are talking about is that we have  seen one double standard after another. The tax breaks for the middle- class are temporary, and the wealthy get permanent ones.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.   All time has expired.   The Senator from Pennsylvania.    Mr. President, here we are now at 4:15. We still have not  seen this bill--a $10 trillion bill, the biggest tax bill in more than  three decades, with changes involving billions and billions of dollars  made, apparently, overnight.   I have made it clear that when the leader, Senator McConnell, comes  back down, we expect to see this bill. We were told essentially an hour  ago that we would see this in a matter of minutes.   The American people have a right to know that even though the  majority wants to make $10 trillion worth of tax policy changes on the  fly, this side of the aisle is going to insist on knowing what is in  the bill.   My colleague has been very patient, and I wish him to be recognized  on our time now.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.    Mr. President, I have just seen an air-dropped list of  provisions--there seem to be upwards of 30--and it sure looks as if the  lobbyists have been working overtime. They must have earned a holiday  gift with this new bonanza of goodies.   We still await a bill that we are going to read, although I saw  something that might actually be a bill. So we are going to use this  time so colleagues can get into some of these questions about this  array of treats that the lobbyists seem to have figured out how, in the  last few hours--perhaps overnight--to carve out for their benefit.   To start our discussion for our 15 minutes, I believe my friend and  colleague Senator Merkley is going to start.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.    Will the Senator yield?    I think my colleague--my seatmate--is making a very  important point. Of course, people always wonder, well, is this kind of  a Democratic position or a Republican position? I want to make it clear  that I believe that Tom Barthold, the head of the Joint Committee on  Taxation, which is our independent tax umpire, essentially agreed with  you. In committee, I believe we asked him whether he thought this huge  reduction in the corporate tax rate would translate into $4,000 in the  pockets of working families in Michigan and Oregon. Is that my  colleague's understanding?    Will my colleague yield for a question?    My understanding is that you and Senator Casey in  particular have been out here--and we are so glad to have our colleague  from Connecticut--wondering when in the world we would actually get to  see this legislation.    This pile of papers, for all practical purposes, is what  we have been waiting for for days.    I am going to try to do some, but as far as I can tell, it  sure looks like a lobbyist's wish list. There are going to be a lot of  folks happy on K Street as they try to shop for the holidays because of  the fees they have put together in working to get these changes into  the Republican proposal.   I appreciate my colleague for giving me the opportunity to make sure  that the public knows now that, at this late hour, we are finally  getting, after days, the opportunity to see the bill that is actually  the bill.    I think 30 minutes is what we have been talking about and  that it is appropriate.    I think 30 minutes is what we have been talking about and  that it is appropriate.    Mr. President, will my colleague yield for a question  before he yields?    I am just curious. I am heading home for townhall meetings  in Oregon over the weekend. I am the ranking Democrat on the committee,  the storied committee, as my colleagues know, that works in a  bipartisan way.   Bill Bradley tells this story about how he flew all over the country  to meet with Republicans to talk about how you could find common ground  to deal with tax reform. At this time, we haven't been able to get the  majority to even walk down the corridor in an effort to try to get a  bipartisan bill. As I told my colleagues, I have written two of them.   My question to my friend is, when you have your community meeting,  how do you think people in Connecticut are going to react to the idea  that we had maybe an hour or so to try to make our way through a bill  that is actually the biggest tax bill in 31 years? I know my colleague  tries very hard to be straightforward with his constituents, and he  will tell them: I got it with insufficient time to get into it. How  will they react to that?    Mr. President, I am going to yield to my colleagues in a  minute.   I just think it is important to make sure that the public understands  exactly what some of the facts are behind the Republican proposals.   My colleague from Ohio just talked about how the Republican proposal  is going to create many more jobs in the United States and certainly  isn't going to keep the system that makes it attractive to do business  overseas. Yet my understanding is, all the previous versions--and we  are going through the 500-plus pages now--are based on territorial  taxation.   I don't imagine too many folks in coffee shops are up on what  territorial taxation is, but it is an express lane for shipping jobs  overseas. The fact is, a number of the proposals earlier from the other  side have made it more attractive to do business overseas than in the  United States.   Here are a couple of other points. My colleague said that 70 percent  of the corporate tax reduction would go to the workers. That is not  what Tom Barthold, the head of the Joint Committee on Taxation, said.  He said specifically that he didn't see anything resembling that kind  of benefit going directly to workers. He speaks a special language  known as economics, but he has made it clear he didn't envision  anything like that.   Two other points, and then I have a question for my colleague from  Maryland.   We still do not have an analysis in two areas: No. 1, the cost of the  bill, and No. 2, what is going to be the fate of middle-class families  with respect to this new proposal? What is it going to mean for their  taxes, and by what amounts?   If I can engage my colleague from Ohio on this--what can we be told  at this point we are going to get, if anything, with respect to an  analysis of this particular bill, the 500-plus pages? Will we be  getting anything tonight before we vote?   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.    What analysis would it be, for example, with respect to  what the new bill--the bill we are actually going to vote on--means for  middle-class families? We have millions of middle-class folks who are  trying to sort out what this means for them.   We have just gotten a brand new bill. We would like to know what the  new bill means with respect to the taxes paid by middle-class folks.  Are they going to get ahead or, as we have seen in so many of the  previous iterations, fall behind, particularly after 2027?   Will we get a new analysis on this new proposal that we will actually  vote on with respect to what it means for middle-class families?    Of course.    Of course.    What I would say to my colleague is, we don't have any  evidence of that. My colleague has certainly made laudatory claims  about his bill, but we don't have any evidence of them. In fact, the  comment made by my colleague highlights my concern. What we have seen  thus far for middle-class families after 2027 is that upward of half of  them would pay more in taxes.   I think, rather than continue this, I will just ask my colleague to  see if his side can produce an actual document--even a summary--of what  this new bill is actually going to mean for middle-class families who  are concerned, based on the earlier versions, about seeing their taxes  go up, particularly after 2027.   I have one question for my colleague from Maryland because he has  been talking about the State and local deduction, which is enormously  important to folks in my State and in my colleague's as well.   My question is, when the first income tax was enacted in 1861, it was  to finance the cost of the Civil War. It included only one deduction at  that time for State and local taxes, and that was really composed to  respect the States' ability to make their own fiscal decisions. It was  the first deduction more than a century ago. So does that seem like a  special interest tax break compared to this list of more than 30 breaks  that we have managed to excavate from various corners of K Street?    I will.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.    Mr. President, I thank my friend, and I know the Senator  from West Virginia and the Senator from Connecticut have both been  patient. Why don't we yield time to the Senator from West Virginia now.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.    Mr. President, before we go to Senator Blumenthal----   The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 36 seconds left.    I thank my colleague from West Virginia. I believe we are  going to propound another 30-minute unanimous consent request.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. First, the other side has 15 minutes.    Oh, they have 15 minutes.   We will let Senator Toomey start the 15-minute time allotment for  Republicans. Then, when our turn is next, we will go to Senator  Blumenthal.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.    Mr. President, to start our portion of the 30 minutes,  Senator Blumenthal has been very patient, so I wish to start with the  Senator from Connecticut.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.    Mr. President, for this tranche, I believe we will have  Senator Durbin lead off for us and then Senator Nelson and Senator  Bennet. Each is going to try to take around 5 minutes.   Senator Durbin.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Durbin.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from Illinois  for a very insightful analysis, and his skills as a handwriting expert  may be necessary as the Senate Finance Committee tries to divine what  that particular page actually means. I thank my colleague for trying to  unpack a byzantine area of subchapter S tax law.    Their eyes are being strained as we speak.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.    I yield to the Senator from Florida.    I yield to the Senator from Florida.    Mr. President, my colleague has a parliamentary inquiry,  and then we will go to Senator Bennet.    Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.    Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.    When this is filed, we want the American people to know  what has actually been written on the side.   Will it be possible, as part of Senator Durbin's statement, to add  this ``written on the side'' portion as part of his statement so that  the American people will actually know how outrageous this process is  and that it at least states, as part of his speech, what is written in  the margin? Can that be stated as part of his statement?   Would the Chair answer the question?   My question is, when the amendment is filed, I would like to ensure  that the important point my colleague has made about what is written in  the margin could be included as part of his written statement that will  be entered into the Record so that the American people can get some  sense of what kind of flimflam is actually taking place here.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. When the amendment is filed----    Thank you.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The text will appear in linear format with any  errors that may be in it.    Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Colorado.    Mr. President, just before we wrap up, I have heard  Republicans talk constantly about how this process is being conducted  by regular order. I have never seen in my time in public service, when  talking about $10 trillion worth of tax policy changes and the biggest  tax bill in three decades, something along the lines of the flimflam  that we have been talking about, with handwritten changes in the  margins about something that conceivably will affect vast sums of  taxpayer money.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?   The Senator from Florida.    Mr. President, we are going to have several of our  colleagues on our side, and we will start with Senator Sanders.    Mr. President, we are going to have several of our  colleagues on our side, and we will start with Senator Sanders.    Mr. President, I would just like to set the record  straight on a couple of points. I have a response to my colleagues who  continually say this corporate tax cut is going to raise workers' wages  by $4,000.   Now, I asked the head of the Joint Committee on Taxation whether that  was the case. He essentially said, no, he did not believe it was the  case and referred us to tables that document it.   Perhaps even more egregious is tonight we heard our colleague from  Ohio say that a Congressional Budget Office report claims that workers  are going to get 70 percent of the benefits from a corporate tax cut so  it was raised even higher.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  a portion of the report from the Congressional Budget Office, making it  clear on the cover where it says the analysis and conclusions expressed  there should not be interpreted as those of the Congressional Budget  Office. It directly contradicts the comments made by the Senator from  Ohio on wages and corporate tax cuts.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:    Working Paper Series, Congressional Budget Office, Washington, D.C.             International Burdens of the Corporate Income Tax    William C. Randolph, Congressional Budget Office, Washington, D.C.,                           August, 2006, 2006-09         Working papers in this series are preliminary and are       circulated to stimulate discussion and critical comment.       These papers are not subject to CBO's formal review and       editing processes. The analysis and conclusions expressed in       them are those of the authors and should not be interpreted       as those of the Congressional Budget Office. References in       publications should be cleared with the authors. Papers in       this series can be obtained at www.cbo.gov (select       Publications and then Working Papers).                                   Abstract         This study applies a simple two-country, five-sector,       general equilibrium model based on Harberger (1995, 2006) to       examine the long-run incidence of a corporate income tax in       an open economy. In equilibrium, capital is assumed to be       perfectly mobile internationally in the sense that the       country in which a real investment is located does not matter       to the marginal investor. In addition, each country is       assumed to produce at least some tradable corporate goods for       which the country cannot affect world output prices. Like the       original Harberger (1962) model, the worldwide stock of       capital and the supply of labor in each country are fixed.       Under those assumptions, the model provides closed form       solutions and easily understood predictions about its       comparative static equilibria. As with any simplified model,       the analysis is silent about some potentially important       issues--such as the effect of the corporate tax on savings,       growth and other dynamics--that may also have important       effects on corporate tax incidence.        The analysis shows how the domestic owners of capital can       escape most of the corporate income tax burden when capital       is reallocated abroad in response to the tax. But, as in       Bradford (1978), capital owners worldwide cannot escape the       tax. Reallocation of capital abroad drives down the personal       return to investment so that capital owners worldwide bear       approximately the full burden of the domestic corporate       income tax. Foreign workers benefit because an increased       foreign stock of capital raises their productivity and their       wages. Domestic workers lose because their productivity falls       and they cannot emigrate to take advantage of higher foreign       wages. Under basic assumptions of the numerical application,       the outcome is also similar to the implications of the       simpler model of Bradford in that the full worldwide burden       falls on domestic owners of productive inputs. That outcome       changes, however, under alternative assumptions.        Burdens are measured in a numerical example by substituting       factor shares and output shares that are reasonable for the       U.S. economy. Given those values, domestic labor bears       slightly more than 70 percent of the burden of the corporate       income tax. The domestic owners of capital bear slightly more       than 30 percent of the burden. Domestic landowners receive a       small benefit. At the same time, the foreign owners of       capital bear slightly more than 70 percent of the burden, but       their burden is exactly offset by the benefits received by       foreign workers and landowners. To the extent that capital is       less mobile internationally, domestic labor's burden would be       lower and domestic capital's burden would be higher. Burdens       can also be affected by the domestic country's ability to       influence the world prices of some traded corporate outputs.       But the signs and magnitudes of those effects on burden       depend upon the relative capital intensities of production in       the corporate sectors that produce internationally tradable       goods.     Mr. President, if I could have the attention of my  colleague from Pennsylvania, I would like to pose a question to him on  a matter. We, as we have indicated, have been digging through the  amendments. As far as I can tell, what we have is the earlier language  that imposes a new excise tax on the investment income of large  university endowments. That has been in the bill, so be it.   Now, there seems to be a new exception on page 289. The bill says  that the new tax does not apply to a university otherwise subject to  the tax if it is described in the first section, which is 511(a)(2)(B),  and which does not receive Federal funds.   This is new, and I am trying to figure out why there is this special  exemption. I can't seem to find other people who are getting it or whom  it benefits. I thought perhaps my colleague from Pennsylvania could  enlighten me on this.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.    Mr. President, if my colleague would yield further, what  is your analysis of how many colleges would benefit from this? The  reason I ask is, in my view, there are a lot of deserving Oregon  schools--and I seem to remember quite a few colleges in Pennsylvania-- that also are very deserving, they would not benefit from this, and I  would like my colleague's assessment of how many colleges would benefit  from this particular provision.    So is this Hillsdale College--because that is what I have  been led to believe--and I would like my colleague's analysis of  whether they would benefit.    I am just not aware of any.    I am just not aware of any.    I am just not aware of any.    I am just not aware of any.    I am reclaiming my time.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic time has expired.    I am reclaiming my time.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic time has expired.    I ask unanimous consent for 3 additional minutes to  complete this one question.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    I thank the Chair.   I was concerned at the beginning because there are so many deserving  schools in Oregon and Pennsylvania  [[Page S7695]]  and elsewhere that don't get this special treatment, and obviously you  have heard my colleagues express their concern, and I think it  transcends somebody's politics.   So my question now would be--the perfecting amendment has not yet  been filed. Would my colleague be willing to take his provision out of  the perfecting amendment and offer it as a separate amendment so we can  actually have an up-or-down vote? And perhaps by that time, we will  know how many colleges, if any other than this one, benefit.    The answer is no.    The answer is no.    The answer is no.    Let the record show that my colleague has said no. And I  can't find anybody else in America who benefits from this particular  provision, and that doesn't strike me as right, to have it airdropped  at the last minute into a bill.   Mr. President, I believe I am out of time on my consent request.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.    Mr. President, how much time remains on our side in the  tranche?   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven minutes.    I would like to yield 5 minutes of my time to the Senator  from Ohio, Mr. Brown.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my motions to  commit be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Mr. Wyden moves to commit the bill H.R. 1 to the Committee       on Finance with instructions to report the same back to the       Senate in 3 days, not counting any day on which the Senate is       not in session, with changes that--  [[Page S7699]]         (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) make permanent the tax cuts for individuals and small       businesses and eliminate middle class tax increases,       including reinstating the full State and Local tax deduction,       paid for by sun-setting tax cuts for domestic and       multinational corporations.     Madam President, with this amendment, Senators Rubio and  Lee stopped far short of meaningful relief for millions of vulnerable  American families and leave out altogether so many deserving children  like the Dreamers.   After 2025, Rubio-Lee offers a double standard. Their child tax  credit expires, even while multinational corporations get permanent tax  breaks for shipping jobs overseas. Democrats want to provide strong,  permanent protection for all working families, rather than temporary  protection for some like Rubio-Lee. The best way to protect these  families is not through a puny bandaid approach but through permanent  help that America's struggling families richly deserve.   Madam President, I make a point of order that the pending amendment  violates section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.    Mr. President, Senator Cruz's amendment expands tax  subsidies for upper income households to aid private or parochial  schools by allowing 529 account balances to spend up to $10,000 a year  on private or parochial school tuition and supplies.   Colleagues, this is nothing less than a backdoor assault on the  public K-12 education system. The real goal seems to be to take more  and more children from the public schools and put them into private  schools and shrink the funds that would be available to the public  schools that give all of America's children the chance to get ahead.   Members should oppose the amendment because it undermines America's  public education system.   I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The question is on agreeing to the amendment.   The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk called the roll.   The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 50, nays 50, as follows:                        [Rollcall Vote No. 298 Leg.]                                  YEAS--50       Alexander      Barrasso      Blunt      Boozman      Burr      Capito      Cassidy      Cochran      Corker      Cornyn      Cotton      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Enzi      Ernst      Fischer      Flake      Gardner      Graham      Grassley      Hatch      Heller      Hoeven      Inhofe      Isakson      Johnson      Kennedy      Lankford      Lee      McCain      McConnell      Moran      Paul      Perdue      Portman      Risch      Roberts      Rounds      Rubio      Sasse      Scott      Shelby      Strange      Sullivan      Thune      Tillis      Toomey      Wicker      Young                                  NAYS--50       Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Booker      Brown      Cantwell      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Collins      Coons      Cortez Masto      Donnelly      Duckworth      Durbin      Feinstein      Franken      Gillibrand      Harris      Hassan      Heinrich      Heitkamp      Hirono      Kaine      King      Klobuchar      Leahy      Manchin      Markey      McCaskill      Menendez      Merkley      Murkowski      Murphy      Murray      Nelson      Peters      Reed      Sanders      Schatz      Schumer      Shaheen      Stabenow      Tester      Udall      Van Hollen      Warner      Warren      Whitehouse      Wyden   The VICE PRESIDENT. On this vote, the yeas are 50, the nays are 50.  The Senate being equally divided, the Vice President votes in the  affirmative, and the amendment, No. 1852, is agreed to.                              Amendment No. 1846    The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). There will now be 2 minutes of  debate, equally divided, prior to a vote on Kaine amendment No. 1846.   The Senator from Virginia.    Mr. President, millions of Americans must be watching in  stunned disbelief tonight as the Republican Senate betrays the middle  class for the benefit of faceless, multinational corporations.   Colleagues, how many middle-class families need to see their hard- earned pay snatched away in tax hikes before these corporate handouts  are no longer worth it? How many more Americans need to see their jobs  shipped overseas before corporate paymasters no longer call the shots?  How many Americans need to lose their healthcare or see their premiums  shoot sky-high before this is stopped?   What is happening tonight is the worst of the U.S. Senate. There is a  trail of broken promises--broken promises to working families in the  mad dash to pass this bill. The American people understand this is the  first step of continuing attacks on Medicare, on Medicaid, and on  Social Security. This vote will not be forgotten.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield back the time on this side.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the  question is, Shall the bill pass?   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk called the roll.   The result was announced--yeas 51, nays 49, as follows:                        [Rollcall Vote No. 303 Leg.]                                  YEAS--51       Alexander      Barrasso      Blunt      Boozman      Burr      Capito      Cassidy      Cochran      Collins      Cornyn      Cotton      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Enzi      Ernst      Fischer      Flake      Gardner      Graham      Grassley      Hatch      Heller      Hoeven      Inhofe      Isakson      Johnson      Kennedy      Lankford      Lee      McCain      McConnell      Moran      Murkowski      Paul      Perdue      Portman      Risch      Roberts      Rounds      Rubio      Sasse      Scott      Shelby      Strange      Sullivan      Thune      Tillis      Toomey      Wicker      Young                                  NAYS--49       Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Booker      Brown      Cantwell      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Coons      Corker      Cortez Masto      Donnelly      Duckworth      Durbin      Feinstein      Franken      Gillibrand      Harris      Hassan      Heinrich      Heitkamp      Hirono      Kaine      King      Klobuchar      Leahy      Manchin      Markey      McCaskill      Menendez      Merkley      Murphy      Murray      Nelson      Peters      Reed      Sanders      Schatz      Schumer      Shaheen      Stabenow      Tester      Udall      Van Hollen      Warner      Warren      Whitehouse      Wyden   The bill (H.R. 1), as amended, was passed.
