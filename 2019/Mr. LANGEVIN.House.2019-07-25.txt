 Madam Speaker, tomorrow we celebrate the 29th  anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, a groundbreaking  civil rights law that has improved the lives of millions across the  Nation, including my own. However, the fight for equality and inclusion  is not over.   Over the past year, I have collaborated with disability advocates and  lawmakers from both sides of the aisle to pass bills that strengthen  protections for airline passengers with disabilities, expand caregiver  services for disabled veterans, and establish a more inclusive  emergency preparedness and disaster planning process.   I have also called for the Federal Government to account for its  hiring and retention of disabled workers, increased funding for spinal  cord injury research, co-led legislation to help small businesses break  down accessibility barriers and passed a bill in the House to authorize  $200 million for respite care services.   Madam Speaker, these efforts are only the beginning, and I cannot and  will not stop fighting until we achieve the goal of equal opportunity,  full inclusion, and economic self-sufficiency for people with  disabilities everywhere.                            ____________________
