 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the Senate is going to soon vote on the  nomination of Bernard McNamee to be a Commissioner of the Federal  Energy Regulatory Commission.   If Mr. McNamee takes a seat on the Commission, it will mean that  Christmas is coming early for the executive who wants big, dirty energy  bailouts.   Mr. McNamee has had for some time a plan to bail out some of the  oldest, dirtiest plants in America, and he wants typical Americans to  pay for it with higher utility rates. That is right--a bailout for some  of the dirtiest, oldest facilities--and a pretty small number of them  at that--and then a big spike in rates for working families and seniors  across the country. We shouldn't sugarcoat the McNamee plan. It is a  rip-off, plain and simple.   All of this doesn't come out of thin air. Mr. McNamee, in fact, was  directly responsible for this miserable proposal while he was at the  Trump Energy Department. The plan was to interfere with utility  companies' private business decisions, to force them to actually  prevent utility companies from shutting down those dirty, old  powerplants--some of them coal plants--even when the utilities wanted  to move to cleaner, newer plants. So much for the free market. The  utilities actually wanted to move to cleaner plants. Yet this would  have prevented them from shutting down dirty, outdated plants to go to  the more efficient, newer ones. So much for the free market. So much  for protecting consumers.   This proposal was so flawed that every member of the Commission  joined in a vote to reject it. Let me repeat that. Every member of the  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that Mr. McNamee is so eager to  join voted against his plan to stick it to all the consumers with a  rate spike.   For a period, I chaired the Energy and Natural Resources Committee,  and we always saw that, traditionally, if a flawed proposal gets met  with enormous rejection, the typical person in a rational way says:  Hey, we had better get back to the drawing board and take a different  tack. That is not so with the Trump administration.   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission wouldn't green-light Mr.  McNamee's rate-hiking plan to prop up the executives at these dirty  facilities. So the President wants to put Mr. McNamee on the inside and  give him a seat on the FERC. I have to say that I haven't seen anything  like this sort of deliberate effort to hijack sound market-oriented  principles that would naturally take you to cleaner power rather than  to dirty old coal facilities. But what we have here is, in effect, an  individual who has shown a track record of wanting to do the bidding of  special interests.   FERC is supposed to be an independent, apolitical energy regulator.   As I said during the committee's hearing on this nomination, this is  not a question of the fox guarding the henhouse. This is a question of  putting the fox inside the henhouse. That is what this will do if the  Senate makes a flawed judgment to approve this nomination. Several of  us at the Energy Committee hearing--myself and other colleagues--asked  Mr. McNamee if he would recuse himself from matters that he worked on  that relate to this flawed bailout for dirty, outdated plants. He  refused to commit to that.   Since the hearing, new evidence of his energy policy biases has come  to light in the form of video footage where he candidly expresses that  he is just plain, old biased against renewable power. The video reveals  Mr. McNamee speaking frankly about his skepticism of wind and solar  power. He basically says: You shouldn't regulate carbon dioxide as a  real pollutant. His comments, joined with his recent actions, which I  have described as the ``Trump Energy Department,'' make it clear to me  that he is not going to bring the judicious, objective approach, if he  is confirmed as FERC Commissioner, to these critical issues. He  certainly is not in this to protect the American  [[Page S7301]]  consumer, because his policies would pick their pocket with higher  rates.   Finally, the nomination comes at a particularly troubling time, just  after the scientists for the Federal Government released the ``National  Climate Assessment.'' The report warned that without substantial and  sustained measures to reduce emissions, climate change and worsening  climate change would wreak havoc on our economy. Yet juxtapose or put  right next to what the Federal scientists said about climate change  worsening and then say: Here is going to be a Trump nominee who, if  chosen for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, is going to say:  Let's double down on support for the dirty, outdated facilities for  generating electricity.   It doesn't sound very viable to me in terms of our economic future.  On the entire matter of confronting the imminent threat of climate  change, I think we have to recognize that this administration is  defying the will of the American people. We are no longer talking about  far-off theories.   In Oregon and across the country, we have seen Americans watch fires  getting bigger and hotter. They are ripping through populated areas.  They are not your grandfather's fires. In our part of the world, we saw  a fire leap over the Columbia River. We have seen hurricanes making  landfall with Biblical, unprecedented winds. Each year almost sets a  new high mark for the hottest year on record.   The policies that this nominee is advancing are misguided. They would  accelerate the problems that the scientists for the Federal Government  cited last week.   I will close by way of saying that what the scientists said last week  is that dealing with cleaner, more efficient energy and promoting it is  urgent business right now because there is no time for going backward.  What the McNamee nomination is all about, in one concept, is this: It  is going backward--backward to bailouts and backward to supporting  dirty, outdated plants.   We ought to be going forward.   Mr. President and colleagues, I urge that this nominee be rejected.   I yield back.    Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in recognizing  Arlington High School in Oregon and its remarkable career and technical  education program. Thanks to the leadership of district staff and the  support of the community, students at Arlington High are better  prepared for their post high school careers.   Career and technical education provides students of all ages with the  academic and technical skills, knowledge, and training necessary to  succeed in future careers. Students participating in career and  technical education programs graduate high school at higher rates than  average and are better prepared to get good-paying jobs beyond the  classroom.   The HonkerTech Center at Arlington High School offers many  disciplines to its students, based on interests and career choices.  These include metal fabrication, digital design and production, and  mechanics. Students learn business concepts and skills, like developing  a project budget and writing a proposal and using accounting software.  Students are accountable and responsible for designing their projects.  They also have an opportunity to gain practical, real-world experience  working with regional and international customers on custom products.  The impact of this program extends beyond the classroom, making sure  that students have the skills they need to become lifelong learners,  even after they graduate.   I am proud to recognize the career and technical education program at  Arlington High School and the good work being done to prepare Oregon  students for success after graduation. This is what I call doing things  the Oregon way.                            ____________________
