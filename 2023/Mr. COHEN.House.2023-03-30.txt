 Madam Speaker, on Monday, the horror, the terror, and the  insanity of mass shootings came to our capital city, Nashville,  Tennessee--most directly, the Covenant Presbyterian School.   Six innocent victims passed.   Three were children: Evelyn Dieckhaus, William Kinney, and Hallie  Scruggs. All were 9 years old. All were loving students, friends,  brothers, sisters, and parents.   The three adults were Mike Hill, a beloved custodian of 14 years, a  father, and a grandfather; Katherine Koonce, the headmaster referred to  as a saint; and Cynthia Peak, a substitute teacher who had a light that  shone wherever she appeared.   Madam Speaker, for all those victims and the other victims--the  classmates, the friends, and the staff of Covington Presbyterian and  the city of Nashville--I ask that we have a moment of silence in their  memory and their honor.                            ____________________
