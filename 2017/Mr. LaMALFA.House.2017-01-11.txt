 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in sadness to honor the life  of a friend, Paul Stewart Shaner, known as ``Stu'' around Oroville. He  passed away just recently, December 13, at the age of 76.   A resident of Oroville, California, since age 5, Stu was a prominent  member of the community known for his civic engagement and a true  passion for his small town, the one I grew up in as well.   While poor eyesight prevented Stu from joining the military, he went  out of his way to serve in many other ways, serving veterans, serving  his community, and making veterans feel treasured. He served his  community in so many different ways, it is not hard to think of Stu as  the main fiber of our town of Oroville.   One of Stu's life goals was to erect a memorial park for veterans in  Oroville. He worked very hard to accomplish this, serving as co-chair  for the Veterans Memorial Park for over a decade.   When you heard from Stu, you heard from him. He was going to get this  done, and we were all determined to be helpful for him. He was  relentless. The new park is under construction this very moment.   In the words of everyone who knew Stu, he was one of the good guys  who loved his family, his town, and the veterans who served his  country.   God bless Stu Shaner's family. We will miss him.                            ____________________     I really want to thank Chairman Walker of the RSC, the  Republican Study Committee. I greatly appreciate the gentleman's  leadership on this event here tonight as well as the great job the  gentleman is doing on the Committee.   Mr. Speaker, we have had alternatives to the Affordable Care Act ever  since I have been here. The American Health Care Reform Act, as put  forward by the Republican Study Committee, has many of the elements we  have all been talking about for several years: with the Affordable Care  Act being forced upon Americans not in a bipartisan effort but strictly  by the votes of one party when they had the majority--the ability--to  force it  [[Page H379]]  through. We are suffering the effects of that now.   One of my colleagues earlier was talking about: Why isn't this being  reported? Why isn't this being talked about in the broad sense of how  it is really affecting the Americans who are paying for it?   People in my district, ever since I have been a Member of this House,  have been pleading with us to do something about these high premiums,  about the high deductibles, about the lack of access they have,  especially in rural areas. Why are the proponents continuing to prop  this up? It is clear that it doesn't work: higher costs, fewer options,  unworkable plans. The exchanges--we have watched in several States-- most of them, after billions in investment, are shuttering; they are  closing up shop. Where do those billions go that we have invested as a  country into these exchanges?                                time  1945    But on a patient level, it is putting even more of our most  vulnerable patients on a system already known to be unsustainable  without even ensuring access to quality care. In some cases, no care at  all.   How are people defining that as a success?   We know that the main reason why so many people are uninsured is the  high cost of coverage. But instead of investing vast amounts of money  to bring more people into a broken system, let's take this opportunity  to start fixing the root of the problem.   One, this is done by increasing competition, giving patients more  options, choices. Mr. Speaker, give them a menu of options they can  pick themselves, tailor the plan to what they need. A 20-year-old young  man has a completely different need than a 30-year-old mom and her  family. Let them have the choices.   Also, let's get rid of the costly mandates, the taxes. There are  taxes on everything, it seems, to help prop up ObamaCare, the  Affordable Care Act, including the cost for students for college. They  are paying for some of that.   Then let's build off successes that we have seen in the past and that  are part of the proposal of the Republican Study Committee and the  American Healthcare Reform Act. That could help fill our gaps in the  healthcare delivery system.   Community health centers, for example, is a model that is both cost  effective and efficient in expanding access to care services in  underserved areas, very rural ones, such as my own district at home.   Healthcare reform affects the lives of every single person in this  country, which is why it is high time that we put the health and well- being of the American people ahead of partisan politics and legacies.   Let's get to work and deliver actual solutions that empower patients,  drive down the costs, and increase access to care in every part of the  country. Let's give back to Americans: ``Keep your plan that you like,  keep your doctor that you like.''   So it is time to stop the partisan squabbling over it and the  deception that has gone on for what is indeed for some a bad legacy of  the American people.
