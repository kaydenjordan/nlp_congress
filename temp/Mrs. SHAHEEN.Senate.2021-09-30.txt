 Mr. President, I think the Senator from Ohio is  mistaken. In fact, this would--the Afghan refugees who are coming here  are going to be properly vetted.   In a September 2 letter led by Senator Cotton, he said that ``[o]ur  immediate priority is the safety and well-being of American citizens,  permanent residents, and allies who were left behind in Afghanistan.''   But it seems that that concern for our allies only extends so far for  Senator Cotton and this amendment. As our Afghan allies are being  brought into the United States on humanitarian parole, he wants to  limit their ability to settle into a new life.   We need to vote no on this amendment.
