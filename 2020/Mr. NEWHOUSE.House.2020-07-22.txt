 Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from  Utah for letting me weigh in on this important subject.   Mr. Speaker, the hunters and anglers, farmers and ranchers, and  hikers and recreationists of central Washington are passionate  advocates for access to public lands.   I strongly stand behind my constituents in supporting the restoration  of our national parks, our public lands, and Federal infrastructure.  That is why I am proud to cosponsor the Restore Our Parks and Public  Lands Act to address our country's deferred maintenance backlog in  those areas. If that bill were brought to the floor before us today, I  would be a resounding ``yes.''   Unfortunately, that is not the bill that we are debating here this  afternoon. So while I agree with many provisions within the Great  American Outdoors Act, I fear that the sweeping nature of this  legislation will have unintended consequences for rural communities  like mine in Washington's Fourth District.   Mr. Speaker, just 2 weeks ago, I was honored to welcome Secretary of  the Interior David Bernhardt to the north-central region of my district  in central Washington. These were the two main takeaways from the  conversations that we had with citizens in that region: one, a lack of  trust with the Federal Government; and, two, the need for hope in the  face of many challenges facing rural communities.   While I believe the intentions behind this legislation are grounded  in the desire to improve our public lands, too many of my constituents  think the approach within this bill is indicative of the same tired  notion that we have all heard before: I am from the government, and I  am here to help.   We have already determined the Federal Government's culpability in  creating a $20 billion maintenance backlog problem on our public lands.  So the response is to permanently spend $900 million a year, most of  which will be spent on what? Get this, Mr. Speaker: purchasing more  Federal land.   The farmers, ranchers, and hardworking men and women of my district  support local management and control of our lands. We have seen  firsthand the delinquency of the Federal Government, and I think we  should work to continue to support our national parks but vote this  bill down.    Mr. Speaker, today, I rise with a heavy heart to honor  the life of the distinguished Congressman from Georgia's Fifth  District, John Lewis.   Few members of this body have had such a profound impact on the  fabric of our Nation as John Lewis. He was a man of honor, a freedom  fighter, and one of the truly great leaders of the civil rights  movement.   From the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, where he marched  with the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., to demand an end to  segregation to the Halls of the Congress of the United States of  America where he dutifully and faithfully served his constituents,  Representative Lewis spent a lifetime showing Americans what it means  to stand up for what is right, even at great personal cost.   He understood something that is all too often forgotten: that the  work of creating a more perfect union and the pursuit of liberty and  justice for all is never finished, but it is an ongoing and often  frustrating process. Nevertheless, he demonstrated both to the Members  of this body and to the American people the value of compassion,  dedication, and civility.   The world is a better place because of John, and it was an honor to  serve alongside him in Congress. May he rest in peace, and may we  always honor his example.                            ____________________
