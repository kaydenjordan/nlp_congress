 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart at the  passing of former Naperville, Illinois, Mayor George Pradel.   Mayor Pradel was an extraordinary public servant who was universally  loved. He was also a great mentor to me. Throughout my career in public  service, George was always an insightful counselor and beacon of much- needed encouragement to me and to so many others, and I am very  grateful for his faithful prayers for me and my family over the years.   George had a tremendous impact on every individual he met, and he  himself lived an extraordinary life.   A Naperville native, George served his family, community, and country  as a dedicated community catalyst, soldier, police officer, father, and  mentor.   As mayor, George served Naperville for two decades, from 1995 until  2015. His tenure ushered in a period of tremendous growth. Mayor Pradel  was Naperville's number one cheerleader. His unbelievable energy and  exuberance were infectious.    I will miss George as a man I admired and a public servant I sought  to emulate. He truly had a servant's heart.   Today, we honor a life well lived. George Pradel embraced each day by  celebrating the loves of his life: his God, his family, and his  community; and I know his savior welcomed him, saying: ``Well done,  good and faithful servant.''                            ____________________
