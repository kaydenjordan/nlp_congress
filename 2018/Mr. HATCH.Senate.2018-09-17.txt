 Mr. President, I rise today to speak on three very  important topics: first, today's celebration of Constitution Day;  second, the signing of the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill Act; and finally,  tonight's vote on the Opioid Crisis Response Act.                               Constitution Day    Mr. President, today marks 231 years since the Founding Fathers  signed a charter that would forever alter the course of human history:  the U.S. Constitution. This document serves as the foundation of our  government, and we rightly celebrate its anniversary each year with  Constitution Day.   The Constitution establishes guiding principles that have served the  American people very well. The separation of powers, the rule of law,  and our system of federalism work together toward the goal of  preserving liberty. They have worked to secure individual rights  against encroachment by the government.   The Framers of the Constitution recognized that the government  derived its power from the people themselves. The Constitution  overturned the prevailing wisdom that men are made for governments,  declaring instead that governments are made for men. These principles  and our Nation's dedication to them are core to our American ethos.  Today, they set our country apart as a symbol of freedom and prosperity  across the globe.   The Constitution is the culmination of centuries of human progress.  We have a charge to fulfill its promises. We have a duty to uphold its  principles. May we commit ourselves today and every day to defending  the truths so eloquently and essentially articulated in the  Constitution of our United States.                    Miscellaneous Tariff Bill Act of 2018    Mr. President, before I yield the floor, I would like to address the  passage of the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill Act of 2018, an important  piece of legislation that was signed late last week by the President.  Senator Wyden and I introduced the bill on a bipartisan and bicameral  basis, and it passed unanimously--a great example of how both parties  feel about relieving Americans from the burdens of job-killing tariffs.   The Miscellaneous Tariff Bill was designed to help both importers and  producers by suspending or reducing burdensome tariffs that  unnecessarily increase manufacturing and operating costs for American  companies. A Miscellaneous Tariff Bill has not been enacted since 2010,  and our businesses and manufacturers have been forced to wait too long  for Congress to act.   I am pleased that we were finally able to end that wait. I am also  pleased to report that this is the first MTB, or Miscellaneous Tariff  Bill, to be enacted in the new process set out in the American  Manufacturing Competitiveness Act of 2016. This new process was crafted  to provide a robust consultation that is consistent with both House and  Senate rules and that would be transparent and open to all.   The International Trade Commission and the Department of Commerce  vetted each petition to determine eligibility based on this new  criteria. Each of these agencies made great efforts to  [[Page S6160]]  evaluate each one of the thousands of petitions against the high  standards set out in the AMCA. I would like to thank all of the staff  that worked diligently to do so.   Senator Wyden and I also worked closely with our colleagues  throughout this entire process to resolve any concerns that they may  have had with any of the included products. In the end, I think we  crafted a bill that we all can be proud of because it will help  American businesses compete around the world.   The passage of the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill Act, in conjunction with  the successful implementation of tax reform, will continue to expand  the American workforce, improve the American economy, and keep America  competitive.                               Opioid Epidemic    Finally, Mr. President, I am also here to talk about the passage of  an incredibly important bill that will aid individuals, families, and  communities confronting an epidemic that is overwhelming our country.  This is not the first time I have been talking about the opioid  epidemic, and, unfortunately, it will not be my last. But I am happy to  say that today's remarks will highlight some very good news.   As part of a coordinated effort with four other committees, the  Senate Finance Committee's package will be voted on tonight as a part  of the Opioid Crisis Response Act, but before I get to what is in that  bill, I want to give some details of the unfortunate reality our  country is facing.   Last year, more than 72,000 Americans died from a drug overdose. The  majority of these overdoses involved prescription opioids or illicit  opioids like heroin or fentanyl. I have spoken to many families who  have witnessed the devastating effects of these addictions firsthand,  and I have been sadly impressed by the pervasiveness of this rampant  epidemic. Truly, I promise you that you have more friends, family, and  coworkers who have been affected by this epidemic than you probably  realize.   My home State of Utah continues to be hard hit by this crisis. An  alarming number of Utahns have undergone hospital stays and emergency  room visits due to opioid overdoses. In 2017 alone, over 450 Utahns  died from an opioid overdose.   As the Presiding Officer may have noticed, Congress has recognized  this problem for some time. While this package is a significant step  forward, it isn't the first thing we have done, nor will it be the last  thing we do.   Take, for example, the bipartisan Family First Prevention Services  Act, which was enacted earlier this year in February. Our committee  also worked together to realize a 10-year extension of the Children's  Health Insurance Program, which, as a part of its mission, helps moms,  babies, children, and teenagers struggling with addiction or its  impacts on families across the country.   Our work did not stop there. We proceeded to work on ways that our  committee, with its jurisdiction over Medicaid and Medicare, family  services, and customs, could work to improve the lives of the millions  of Americans who have been impacted by this devastating epidemic.   There are simply too many pieces of this bill to cover them all in  one speech, but I wish to give some highlights. The bill will make a  real difference in Medicare, a program in which one in three  beneficiaries is prescribed an opioid. It will empower patients through  information on pain treatment alternatives. It will expand treatment  options for patients suffering from addiction, including through  increased access to care via telehealth and a pilot program that will  allow Medicare to cover methadone and wraparound services to treat  addiction for the first time. The bill also increases the ability to  track opioid prescriptions to prevent misuse and diversion, while also  ensuring that beneficiaries promptly get the medications they need.   We know that many children are in foster care as a result of the  opioid epidemic, and this bill supports programs that will help parents  complete treatment for opioid addiction and reunite with their children  more quickly. It will also increase the availability of family  residential treatment programs, allowing more parents to receive help  while still caring for their children in a supervised setting.   For the first time since Medicaid became law in 1965, pregnant women  can receive Medicaid coverage for prenatal and postnatal care while  seeking treatment at institutions for mental disease. New and improved  prescription-drug monitoring programs allow States to better understand  the full scope of an individual's prescription use across payments and  insurers. This bill brings that data into the hands of providers and  insurance plans to help them develop care plans for those with  substance use disorders.   Additionally, this package is not limited to fixes in the healthcare  space. We also worked with Senator Portman to craft the bipartisan STOP  Act, which has also been incorporated into this package. That bill sets  new requirements for the U.S. Postal Service to obtain advance  electronic data that allows for U.S. Customs and Border Protection to  effectively target and stop fentanyl and other illegal substances from  entering the country through our postal system. Getting our law  enforcement this additional data will bolster efforts to stop dangerous  opioids at the border and keep them away from American families.   In short, the Finance Committee's portion of this larger effort is an  important step forward, but it is made that much more meaningful given  the wide-ranging provisions included from the Judiciary, Commerce,  Banking, and HELP Committees. Together, this bill will provide the  resources, capacities, and direction to State, local, and Federal  Governments to better assist those who are in such great need right  now.   Additionally, I thank the leader, the chairman, the ranking members,  and all other Members of the four other committees who have been  involved in this great undertaking. There has been no shortage of  effort or genuine concern from both sides of the aisle to address this  painful issue that has hurt so many American families. I appreciate  this bipartisan push to create a successful piece of legislation. I  think this bill represents Congress at its best.   I encourage all of my friends, on both sides of the aisle, to vote  for this important piece of legislation tonight, and I look forward to  working with my colleagues in the House to advance a bill that  addresses the opioid epidemic to the President's desk.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
