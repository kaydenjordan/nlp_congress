 Madam Speaker, this is a sad day for our country and for  our democracy. The President has abused the powers of his office,  betrayed the public trust, and undermined America's national security  by pressuring a foreign government to interfere in our elections for  his own political gain.   In this moment in our history, the Constitution is clear: The remedy  for such misconduct by a President is impeachment.   I didn't come here to Congress to impeach a President of the United  States, but, sadly, the President's misconduct leaves us no choice but  to follow the Constitution.   I have two grandchildren. My granddaughter, Caitlin, is 8, and my  grandson, Colin, is 4. Some day a long time from now, they will ask me  about this day. They will ask about the time a President put himself  above the law, and they will want to know what I did to stop him. And I  will have an answer for them.   Today, I vote to uphold the Constitution. I will vote to impeach  Donald Trump.
