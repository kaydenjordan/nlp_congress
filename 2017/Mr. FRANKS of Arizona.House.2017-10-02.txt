 Mr. Speaker, tomorrow the House of  Representatives will vote on the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection  Act, and before that occurs, Mr. Speaker, I wanted to come to the floor  tonight and just remind all of us that the United States of America is,  indeed, a unique nation that is premised on the foundation that we are  all created equal and that each of us is endowed by our creator with  the unalienable right to live.   But 2 years ago, Mr. Speaker, numerous video recordings were released  that incontrovertibly documented corporate officers and employees of  Planned Parenthood casually discussing their rampant practice of  harvesting and selling the little body parts from many of the hundreds  of thousands of innocent babies they are guilty of killing in their  abortion clinics across this Nation every year.                                time  1930    Now, these videos irrefutably reveal officers of Planned Parenthood  haggling over the price of these little organs and body parts and  casually describing ways of killing these little babies, often using  much more painful methods, like partial-birth abortion, to make sure  that the saleable organs of these little babies remained undamaged.   One of these videos described an incident where one of Planned  Parenthood's employees calls one of the younger employees over to  witness something that was ``kind of cool;'' that one of those baby's  hearts was still beating. The older employee said: ``Okay. This is  really a good fetus, and it looks like we can procure a lot from it. We  are going to procure a brain.''   Then, using scissors, together the two employees, starting at the  baby's chin, cut upward through the center of this child's face and  then pulled out the baby's little brain and placed it in a container  where it could later be sold.   Mr. Speaker, I find it so crushingly sad that the only time this  little baby was ever held by anyone in his very short life was by those  who cut his face open to take his brain.   Have we forgotten that, not so long ago, authorities entered the  clinic of Dr. Kermit Gosnell, and there they found a torture chamber  for little babies that defies, within the constraints of the English  language, any description. The grand jury, at that time, reported:  ``Dr. Kermit Gosnell had a simple solution for unwanted babies. He  killed them. He didn't call it that. He called it ensuring fetal  demise. The way he ensured fetal demise was by sticking scissors in the  back of the baby's neck and cutting the spinal cord. He called it  snipping. Over the years, there were hundreds of snippings.''   Ashley Baldwin, one of Dr. Gosnell's employees, said she saw babies  breathing, and she described one as 2 feet long, that no longer had  eyes or a mouth, but were, in her words, making like, this ``screeching  noise.'' And she said it ``sounded like a little alien.''   For God's sake, Mr. Speaker, this can't be who we truly are. The fact  is that more than 18,000 late-term, pain-capable, unborn children were  torturously killed, without anesthesia, in America in just the last  year. Many of them cried and screamed as they died, but because it was  amniotic fluid going over the vocal cords, we couldn't hear them. It is  the worst human rights atrocity in the United States of America.  [[Page H7655]]    Now, I know that many of those on this floor and the American media  will hold to the standard line and try to cloak all of this in the name  of freedom of choice; but I would beg them, Mr. Speaker, to open their  hearts and ask themselves what is so liberating about brutally and  painfully dismembering living, helpless little human babies.   In spite of all the political noise, protecting these little,  helpless, pain-capable, unborn children and their mothers is not a  Republican issue, and it is not a Democrat issue. It is a basic test of  our basic humanity and who we are as a human family.   Mr. Speaker, the sands of time should blow over this Capitol dome  before we ever give Planned Parenthood one more dime of taxpayer money.  And in the name of humanity, Democrat Senators should not be allowed to  filibuster the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act in the Senate  because passing it would prevent the vast majority of these ongoing  evil acts of torture against helpless, little, pain-capable human  babies that these videos have now shown so clearly to the entire world.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith),  one of the greatest pro-life champions in the history of the United  States and a precious friend.   Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for  yielding, for his passion, for his courage, and for authoring the Pain- Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, and for doing so so informed.  Trent Franks has been an incredible defender of life, and I want to  thank him for his leadership on this extraordinarily important human  rights piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, overwhelming majorities of Americans, some 60 to 64  percent, according to the pollsters, support legal protection for pain- capable unborn children.   Today, we know that unborn babies not only die but suffer  excruciating pain during dismemberment abortions, a cruelty that rips  arms and legs off of helpless children.   A former abortionist, Dr. Anthony Levatino, testified before  Congress, before Trent Franks' committee. Here is a man who has  performed 1,200 abortions, over 100 late-term abortions up to 24 weeks;  and he said, and I quote in part: ``Imagine if you can that you are a  pro-choice obstetrician/gynecologist like I was.'' Using a sopher 13  clamp with rows of ridges or teeth, ``grasp anything you can'' inside  the womb. ``Once you've grasped something inside, squeeze on the clamp  to set the jaws and pull hard, really hard. You feel something let go  and out pops a fully formed leg about 6 inches long. Reach in again''-- he goes on--``and grasp anything you can and out pops an arm.''    He noted that a ``second trimester D&E abortion is a blind  procedure.'' So he says: ``Reach in again and again and again with that  clamp and tear out the spine, intestines, heart, and lungs.''   Mr. Speaker, even swing vote Justice Anthony Kennedy, in his dissent  in the Stenberg v. Carhart decision, said about dismemberment  abortions: ``The fetus, in many cases, dies just as a human adult or  child would: It bleeds to death as it is torn limb from limb. The fetus  can be alive at the beginning of the dismemberment process and can  survive for a time while its limbs are being torn off.''   Mr. Speaker, even if pain wasn't present, dismembering a child is  violence against children, and it is inhumane. But these babies  actually suffer in this process.   Dr. Robert White, professor of neurosurgery at Case Western Reserve,  has said an unborn child at 20 weeks' gestation ``is fully capable of  experiencing pain . . . without question, abortion is a dreadfully  painful experience. . . .''   Dr. Anand wrote, and he is an expert on pain: ``The human fetus  possesses the ability to experience pain from 20 weeks' gestation. . .  .'' He points out that it is even worse for an unborn child at that  time period because ``the highest density of pain receptors per square  inch of skin in human development occurs in utero from 20 to 30 weeks'  gestation. Thus, a fetus at 20 to 32 weeks' gestation would experience  a much more intense pain than older infants or children or adults.'' We  have known this for some time, Mr. Speaker.   In 2006, I authored the Unborn Child Pain Awareness Act that garnered  250 votes in favor--including 40 Democrats--to 162 against. I remember  thinking on that day of the vote: How can anyone refuse to make child  pain information part of an informed consent?   Congressman Trent Franks has authored four--count them, four-- extraordinarily important human rights bills over the years to actually  protect pain-capable babies in Federal law from the violence of  abortion, including the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act that  passed the House in 2013 and again in 2015. Tragically, President Obama  vowed to veto this child protection legislation, and the Senate failed  to pass it.   However, this year, we have a President who said, and he put out a  Statement of Administration Policy: You present this legislation to me,  and I will sign it.   Finally, not only will babies be protected by Trent Franks' law at 5  months, and the pain suffered by these babies will be averted, but H.R.  36 requires that a late abortion, permitted under very limited  circumstances, provide ``the best opportunity for the unborn child to  survive'' and that ``a second physician trained in neonatal  resuscitation'' be ``present and prepared to provide care to the  child'' to the same degree as the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of  2002 prescribed.   Following the care required to be rendered, the born-alive child  shall immediately be transported and admitted to a hospital.   Sixteen States have passed legislation that resembles this important  legislation that we will have before us on this House floor.   My good friend and colleague talked about Dr. Gosnell. Four years  ago, Dr. Gosnell was convicted of murder, conspiracy to kill, and  involuntary manslaughter, and sentenced to life imprisonment.   Even though the news of Gosnell's child slaughter was largely  suppressed by the mainstream media, many of my colleagues may remember  that Gosnell operated a large Philadelphia abortion clinic where women  died and countless babies were dismembered, all gruesome procedures  causing excruciating pain to the victim.   This is a humane bill, a major human rights bill, and, again, I want  to thank my great friend and colleague for his leadership. It is  extraordinary.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Johnson.)   I am very grateful that you are here tonight, sir.    Mr. Speaker, I so sincerely thank the  gentleman.   I yield to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King), my precious friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Biggs), my very good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Biggs), my very good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr.  Jenkins), and I thank him for coming to the floor tonight.   Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Arizona and all those who have spoken, obviously, so emotionally and so  passionately about protecting the unborn.   Mr. Speaker, I am a proud cosponsor of H.R. 36. I am a strong  believer in the sanctity of life. I believe each and every person, born  and unborn, is a child of God.   Our children are our future and a gift to all of us, and respecting  the right to life is one of the strongest values we hold as Americans.  That is why I come to the floor today to urge my colleagues to support  the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would stop late- term abortions.   Studies have shown that unborn children can feel pain in the womb 20  weeks after pregnancy, an agonizing fact with disturbing indications  that we know that this is a gruesome act against the unborn.   As a proud father of three, we know, when those babies come into this  world, that their cries are cries of joy; it is a cry of life. That is  what we are protecting. No child of God should be subjected to the  torturous pain that comes as a result of a late-term abortion.   Mr. Speaker, it is clear that my constituents sent me to Washington  to promote a culture and respect for life. They know as well as I do  that it is vital for us to fight for those who have no voice and cannot  be heard.   This bill shows the world that America will stand up to protect the  most vulnerable amongst us. I strongly urge my colleagues to support  the passage of the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.   Let this Congress and the vote of each and every Member be known as  the one who stood up for life by speaking out against the horrors of  abortion.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  remarks.   It is now my honor to yield to the honorable gentlewoman from South  Dakota (Mrs. Noem).    Mr. Speaker, I sincerely thank the gentlewoman  for her remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr.  Norman).    Mr. Speaker, I sincerely thank the gentlewoman  for her remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr.  Norman).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very  sincerely for his remarks. I am glad he came this way here recently.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my very good friend from  Texas very much for speaking on the floor tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Banks).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Banks very  much for his remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Rothfus).    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I simply say that  sometimes I think we kind of get caught up in things and we grow used  to something that otherwise would horrify us.   Before the sun set this evening, we saw 3,000 unborn little Americans  die a tragic and lonely death. That is in the land of the free and the  home of the brave.   Mr. Speaker, each time that took place, not only did a nameless  little baby die a lonely and tragic death, but the mother was never the  same again. All the gifts that that child might have brought to this  world are now lost forever.   So, Mr. Speaker, I pray that somehow in this debate we would put  aside which people are right and ask: What is the right thing for  America?   The very creed of this country is the notion that all of us have the  Imago Dei, or the image of God, stamped on our souls. If that is true,  Mr. Speaker, then there is a far greater question here than we can ever  imagine.   Mr. Speaker, I think if we ask ourselves the truest and deepest  question, then perhaps we will begin to see the winds of change begin  to blow in this country. That is very simply without all of the  rationalization, without all of the gotchas and the what-ifs and the  avoiding of the subject, and if we just ask ourselves one basic  question: Does abortion kill a little baby?   If it does not, Mr. Speaker, then I sincerely am one that can get up  out of this Chamber and never speak of it again. But if abortion really  does kill a little human child, then those of us standing here in the  seat of freedom, the greatest Nation in the history of the world, also  stand here in the midst of the greatest human genocide in the history  of the human family.   Mr. Speaker, that is not what we are called to do in this world, as  the greatest Nation that ever had the chance to exist on this Earth.   Mr. Speaker, I hope that, as we debate the bill tomorrow, we can put  aside anything but the truth and just examine in our own hearts who we  really are. If we do that, I believe we will pass the Pain-Capable  Unborn Child Protection Act on October 3, 2017. By the grace of God, it  will go over to the Senate and they will find a way to bring this bill  to the floor and send it to President Trump, who I have every  conviction will sign the bill, and for which I am very grateful.   Mr. Speaker, God bless America, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
