 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 71, I call  up the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 41) providing for congressional  disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of a rule  submitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to  ``Disclosure of Payments by Resource Extraction Issuers'', and ask for  its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and submit extraneous materials on the joint resolution under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.J. Res. 41,  introduced by the gentleman from Michigan, (Mr. Huizenga), the chairman  of the Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government Sponsored  Enterprises of the Committee on Financial Services.   This resolution disapproves a burdensome and controversial Securities  and Exchange Commission rule that places an unfair burden on American  public companies that is not applied to many of their foreign  competitors.   Virtually every day we hear from many Americans about how this  economy is just not working for them. It is just not working for  working Americans like Keith from Dallas in my district who wrote me:  ``I am 53. I have a grown son who lives with me. It seems like the cost  of everything keeps going up, yet wages do not keep pace.''   The economic opportunities of Keith and millions of Americans like  him are not helped by top-down, politically driven regulations that  give many foreign companies an advantage over American public  companies.   That is exactly what this Securities and Exchange Commission  regulation that we are talking about today does. It forces American  public companies to disclose inexpensive proprietary information that  can actually be obtained by their foreign competitors, including state- owned companies in China and Russia. This is just one regulation out of  thousands and thousands that are burdening our companies, our job  creators, and are costing our households, by one estimate, over $14,000  a year, Mr. Speaker.   Even though this is a Securities and Exchange rule, section 1504 of  Dodd-Frank has nothing to do with investor protection nor anything else  we were told the Dodd-Frank Act was supposed to do. As the acting  chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission has said, this rule  ``neither reforms Wall Street nor provides consumer protection and it  is wholly unrelated, and largely contrary, to the Commission's core  mission.''   In addition, Mr. Speaker, the SEC estimates that ongoing compliance  costs for this rule could reach as high as $591 million per year. It is  just an outrage, Mr. Speaker. That is $591 million every year that  could better be used to hire thousands more Americans in an industry  where the average pay is 50 percent higher than the U.S. average.  Literally we could be talking about 10,000 jobs on the line for this  ill-advised rule. This is significant, given that millions of  Americans, like Keith from my district, have not seen their wages  increase while our economy has been stymied under the Obama  administration.   Now, for those who claim that somehow by rolling back this rule, that  this undermines anticorruption efforts, let me remind everyone that Mr.  Huizenga's resolution, that the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which  the SEC and the Department of Justice administer, already makes it  illegal to pay former government officials when it comes to winning or  maintaining business opportunities.  [[Page H849]]    To further prove the point, Mr. Speaker, just this year the SEC has  brought enforcement actions or settled four separate cases for  violations of this anticorruption law. So even without this SEC rule,  fraud will still be fraud, corruption will still be corruption, and  both will still be illegal. The SEC and the Department of Justice will  still have the authority to vigorously pursue those who break the law  and hold them accountable, as they well should. So no one, Mr. Speaker,  should fall for this false argument of our opponents.   Let's also remember that this joint resolution does not repeal  section 1504 of Dodd-Frank. I wish it did, but it doesn't. Rather, it  vacates a flawed SEC rule that mimics a previous rule that was already  struck down by a U.S. District Court. It is a rule that by the SEC's  own estimates has taken 51 employees over 20,000 hours to promulgate,  defend, and repromulgate. Fifty-one employees, 20,000 hours that could  have been directed at rooting out Ponzi schemes, that could have been  used to promote capital formation or make our capital markets more  efficient.                                time  1515    Furthermore, this rule still goes far beyond the statute passed by  Congress and mandates public specialized disclosures that cost more and  more, and is more burdensome than the law requires.   So, Mr. Speaker, for those who religiously defend the Dodd-Frank law,  they should be in vigorous support of what Mr. Huizenga brings to the  floor today because the rule flies in the face of the Dodd-Frank Act.  So when an agency exceeds its statutory authority, it is no longer  regulating, Mr. Speaker, it is legislating. And all of us, Republicans  and Democrats alike, should be able to agree that when the executive  branch acts in such a manner, Congress has a duty, a duty under article  I of the Constitution, to check this executive overreach.   As such, this House should wholeheartedly support Mr. Huizenga's  resolution. It simply tells the SEC to go back to the drawing board,  comply with the Dodd-Frank Act, and come up with a better role that  will not put American public companies at an unfair disadvantage and  cost us jobs.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), the chairman of our Capital Markets  Subcommittee and the author of H.J. Res. 41.    I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner), the sub-chairman of our Oversight and  Investigations Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Barr), the chairman of our Monetary Policy and Trade  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Tipton).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Williams).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Hill).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Trott).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Budd).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from New York (Ms. Tenney).    I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close. I have no other  speakers at this time.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I certainly hope that the American people are watching  this debate because it will certainly confirm their decision to deny  Democrats control of the House, to deny them control of the Senate, and  to deny them control of the White House.   Now, Mr. Speaker, their words may claim they care about jobs, but  their policies don't. That is what we are here to talk about, Mr.  Speaker, is jobs, and we are talking about a rule promulgated by the  Securities and Exchange Commission that can cost $591 million a year  and can cost us 10,000 jobs.   My friends on the other side of the aisle have been clearly tone deaf  to the pleas of the American people. They want to go back to work. They  are tired of part-time jobs. They are tired of stagnant paychecks. They  are tired of decimated savings. That is why they have turned to the  Republican Party, and that is why we are going to help give them a  healthy economy with policies, including rolling back this foolish rule  from the Securities and Exchange Commission, a rule that in a previous  iteration has already been struck down by courts.   Now, you listen to the other side of the aisle, Mr. Speaker, and you  hear all this talk about corruption. It appears that some of my friends  on the other side of the aisle are ignorant that the Foreign Corrupt  Practices Act is already in the Federal code. For those who do not  know, I have done the homework for you: 15 U.S.C. 78dd-1. Look it up  yourself.   So, Mr. Speaker, this has nothing to do with corruption. Rarely has  more of a red herring come across the House floor. Let me tell you what  this is really about, Mr. Speaker. It is about a radical, leftist, and  elitist agenda that promotes narrow special interests and has declared  war on carbon-based industry and energy and the industry and jobs that  are represented by it. That is what this is really about.   By the way, why is the Securities and Exchange Commission involved in  this? Why isn't this--listening to them--part of the Homeland Security  Department or maybe part of the Department of Defense? What will they  have the SEC do next, deliver the mail? Will they become our air  traffic controllers?   Meanwhile, there are Ponzi schemes taking place in America.  Meanwhile, we have markets that are not efficient creating the jobs  that the American people demand.   Let's vote for jobs. Let's vote to get America back to work. Let's  vote down this leftist, elitist agenda declaring war on carbon-based  jobs. Let's vote for H.J. Res. 41.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
