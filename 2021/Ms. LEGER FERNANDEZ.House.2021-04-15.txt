 Madam Speaker, it has been 58 years since the  enactment of the Equal Pay Act, yet still women don't earn equal pay  for equal work.   In my district, women only earn 78 cents for every dollar a man  earns. The wage gap is even wider for Latina, Black, and Native- American women.   This isn't simply a women's issue. This is a family issue. When women  earn too little, their families are shortchanged, too.   This is a civil rights issue. When employers discriminate against a  woman, they undermine justice for everyone.   The Paycheck Fairness Act will give women the tools we need to  challenge sex-based pay discrimination. It will give employers the  guidance they need to pay their employees what they deserve.   I ask my colleagues in the Senate to step up. Let this be the year  that we work together to pass this landmark bill and send it to the  President for his signature.                            ____________________
