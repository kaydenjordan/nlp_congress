 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week, I  recognize an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the  American entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to  recognize a woman-owned small business, Lad n' Lassie Children's  Boutique of Prestonsburg, KY, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.   In 1965, Dorothy Marshal founded Lad n' Lassie Children's Boutique.  Noticing the lack of children's clothing retailers, Dorothy seized the  opportunity to fill a gap in the local market. Over the next 32 years,  Dorothy's boutique sold the finest children's clothing, shoes, and toys  to her customers. She retired from Lad n' Lassie in 1997, selling the  business to longtime family friend and Prestonsburg native, Cheryl  Leslie.   In 2021, Lad n' Lassie Children's Boutique continues serving Floyd  County. The store moved to a new location in downtown Prestonsburg in  1999, where it remains today. Under Cheryl's leadership, inventory  expanded to include educational products and gifts. Lad n' Lassie  supports small businesses, featuring locally and regionally made items.  Customers are regularly greeted by name and treated like family. The  store hosts community events, including workshops with visiting  artists, and participates in downtown holiday  [[Page S7152]]  events and festivals. Lad n' Lassie is a go-to for local baby shower  gift registries, supporting generations of Kentuckians as they grow  their families and welcome children into the world.   Like many small business owners, Cheryl is actively involved in her  community. She is a member of the chamber of commerce and regularly  meets with local merchants to discuss business development. For years,  Lad n' Lassie has contributed to a wide range of local philanthropic  organizations, sponsoring events such as the Appalachian Hospice Care's  Annual Veterans' Appreciation Luncheon. They regularly support local  school district events and organizations, including the sponsorship of  dance, cheerleading, and sports teams. During the holiday season, Lad  n' Lassie sponsors the annual Prestonsburg Police Department's ``Shop  with a Cop'' event, providing holiday care packages and gift for  children in need. Additionally, they sponsored Mountain Comprehensive  Care Center's--MCCC--Royal Christmas Ball, which helps children  impacted by behavioral health issues, developmental and intellectual  disabilities, and addiction. Over the years, the boutique's outstanding  service and community involvement have been recognized by local  publications and organizations. Most recently, Lad n' Lassie was named  the ``Best of the Best'' children's clothing store in 2021 by the local  newspaper, the Floyd County Chronicle & Times.   Lad n' Lassie Children's Boutique is an outstanding example of the  critical role small businesses play in uplifting and advocating for  their communities. Congratulations to Cheryl and the entire team at Lad  n' Lassie. I wish them the best of luck and look forward to watching  their continued growth and success in Kentucky.                            ____________________
