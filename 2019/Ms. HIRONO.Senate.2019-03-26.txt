 I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today to denounce the  majority leader's sham debate on the Green New Deal.   Let's be clear. The majority leader did not call up this resolution  for a vote because he thinks climate change is an urgent threat to our  country. In fact, he has opposed nearly every congressional effort to  combat the climate crisis.   The Republican Party's political and financial ties to the fossil  fuel industry are well known. This latest effort to attack Senators  demanding action on climate change with cries of socialism is  reminiscent of the Red Scare, in my view.   Give me a break. The Green New Deal is an aspirational plan to combat  climate change, create high-paying jobs, and develop a more sustainable  [[Page S1990]]  economy that allows communities, families, and individuals to thrive.  This isn't radical. This isn't socialism. This is basic common sense.  The truly radical position is the majority leader's insistence that we  stick our heads in the sand, follow the lead of corporate-backed  interests funding Republican campaigns, and do nothing to tackle  climate change.   The status quo might benefit the majority leader, the Republican  Party, and their allies in the fossil fuel industry, but it is deeply  dangerous for our country. Climate change is already impacting our  lives and damaging our economy.   Annual weather-related natural disasters have more than tripled  worldwide since the 1960s, when scientists at the Mauna Loa Observatory  on the big island of Hawaii first confirmed that carbon dioxide levels  in the atmosphere were steadily rising due to the burning of fossil  fuels. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration, NOAA, the United States has sustained 139 weather and  climate disasters--beginning with Hurricane Katrina in 2005--where  damages exceeded $1 billion. The total cost of these 139 disasters?  Nearly $1.1 trillion.   Last year, in 2018, the United States experienced the fourth highest  number of weather disasters in our history at the tremendous costs of  247 lives lost and $91 billion in damages. In Hawaii last year, we  registered recordbreaking flooding on Kauai and Oahu that resulted in  more than $125 million in damages. That storm generated the largest 24- hour rainfall accumulation in American history at nearly 50 inches on  Kauai's North Shore in a very short period of rainfall time.   Residents of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands also  felt the devastating impact of Typhoon Yutu--the worst storm to hit any  part of the United States since 1935. It certainly isn't a coincidence  that 2018 was also the fourth hottest year on record, surpassed only by  2016, 2015, and 2017.   We have already seen the devastating cost of climate-driven disasters  in the first 3 months of 2019. Eleven days ago, Tropical Cyclone Idai  devastated Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Malawi, killing hundreds of  people. It is already being called one of the worst weather-related  disasters ever in the southern hemisphere.   Closer to home, the Missouri River has already set record levels of  flooding in Nebraska, Iowa, and South Dakota. Under current estimates,  this historic flooding in the Midwest will cost at least $3 billion in  damages to roads, farms, homes, and businesses. According to Texas A&M  University climate scientist Andrew Dessler, climate change is  exacerbating the flooding. He said: ``You can think of climate change  as steroids for these rain events.''   More is on the way. According to the spring weather outlook NOAA  released last Thursday, more than 200 million Americans are at risk for  some kind of flooding, with 13 million of them at risk of major  inundation.   Given the increasing intensity and frequency of severe weather  events, many more States and communities will need disaster relief,  something we are about to vote on later this week. Disaster relief is  something we cannot, and should not, play politics with. Every  community impacted by natural disasters should receive assistance in  the upcoming supplemental appropriations bill, including Puerto Rico,  the Northern Mariana Islands, and other territories.   While these extreme weather events will continue to impact local  communities and the American economy, climate change also threatens our  national security. Like a large majority of the American people, senior  national security and Department of Defense officials understand we  can't just follow the majority leader's example and stick our heads in  the sand to avoid the painful truth of climate change.   In 2017, for example, then-Secretary of Defense James Mattis told the  Senate Armed Services Committee: ``Climate change is impacting  stability in areas of the world where our troops are operating.'' He  also stated that ``climate change is a challenge that requires a  broader, whole-of-government response.''   In February, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats issued a new  worldwide threat assessment that concluded that climate hazards like  extreme weather, wildfires, droughts, and acidifying oceans are  ``threatening infrastructure, health, and water and food security''  around the world. This means there will be more threats to our national  security in an increasingly unstable world environment.   Faced with a global problem that threatens our national security,  President Trump, with the support of Republicans in Congress, announced  he would withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord. He  has, in effect, abdicated America's global leadership role in the  climate crisis, alienated our allies, and created new opportunities for  near-peer competitors like China. At the same time as the United States  embraced climate denial on the international stage under Donald Trump,  China has stepped up to fill the diplomatic void.   After the latest round of international climate talks in November,  Canada's Minister of Environment, Catherine McKenna said:         When the U.S. stepped back, China decided to step up. The       role China plays around the negotiating table can't be       underestimated.    In addition to its diplomatic efforts, China has made significant  policy changes to reduce its coal use from its 2013 peak and to scale  up low carbon alternatives. China is now the world's leading producer,  exporter, and installer of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and  electric vehicles.   China isn't the only country on the global stage acknowledging the  reality of climate change and taking steps to combat it. German  Chancellor Angela Merkel, for example, has said: ``Climate action is a  matter of both ecological necessity and economic rationality.''   Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said:         The effects of climate change are everywhere, and they are       a constant reminder of the need to act now. While climate       change is the biggest challenge of this generation, it also       provides the opportunity to do better while growing the       economy.    Under the previous 2 years of their unified control of the White  House and Congress, Republicans have repeatedly blocked any efforts to  combat climate change. With Democrats now in control in the House, I am  looking forward to working with like-minded colleagues to demonstrate  there are those of us ready and willing to act.   Today, I am joining Representative Barbara Lee of California to  introduce the Women and Climate Change Act of 2019. This bill  recognizes that while the negative impacts of climate change often  impact women the most, they too often don't have a seat at the table  when it comes to developing policy.   Our bill creates a Federal interagency working group that will  collect data and develop policies and strategies to address the effects  of climate change on women both at home and abroad. We need to empower  women to tackle climate change. They need seats at the table.   So long as Donald Trump and his Republican allies in Congress  obstruct meaningful debate and action, States and local communities are  taking their own decisive steps to combat climate change.   Almost every State in the country has begun to experience the impact  of climate change. But as an island State, Hawaii is poised to  experience some of the harshest consequences of climate change. Rising  sea levels, combined with increased storm runoff, will increase coastal  flooding and erosion, damaging sensitive ecosystems, infrastructure,  and agriculture.   According to research from the University of Hawaii Sea Grant  Program, 70 percent of beaches in Hawaii are eroding and 13 miles of  public beaches that once were present no longer exist. Waikiki Beach  alone generates $2.2 billion of Hawaii's economy every year and could  be completely submerged by the end of the century. A warming ocean will  increase bleaching and disease outbreaks on coral reefs, which  currently support $360 million in economic activity each year.   For Hawaii, a sea level rise of 3.2 feet--which could happen as early  as 2060--will result in $20 billion in damage, the chronic flooding of  38 miles of major roads, 25,000 acres of land, 6,500 structures  rendered unusable or lost, and 20,000 residents displaced.   The prospect of such widespread climate change-driven devastation has  spurred the State of Hawaii to action.  [[Page S1991]]  We have made a commitment to become carbon-neutral and generate 100  percent of our electricity from renewable energy sources by 2045, and  we became the first State to separately ratify the Paris climate  agreement. Eighteen States and Puerto Rico have since followed suit.   In addition to efforts at the State level, local communities,  families, and landowners are taking their own steps to cope with the  threat of climate change and adapt as necessary. Last week, I met with  National Park Service officials, members of the Ala Kahakai Trail  Association, local government representatives, nongovernment  organizations, and community partners, including Native Hawaiian lineal  descendants, to learn what they are doing to lead community-based  approaches to trail management and how the issue of climate change is  threatening national treasures on our coasts in Hawaii.   During my visit, members of the Kailapa Community Association created  a plan to cope with decreased rainfall, coastal erosion, and other  impacts on the ahupua'a--or division of land--that they have lived on  for more than 12 generations. Families and communities in Hawaii who  understand the threat of climate change are demanding that we take  divisive action to combat it.    Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress should muster the political  courage to do the same, but that is not happening anytime soon--quite  the contrary. Instead, as with so many ideas they oppose, Republicans  have resorted to mocking and distorting what the Green New Deal does.  They are doing it by their tried-and-true method--by scaring people.   Donald Trump and the majority leader have invested a lot of time in  attempting to justify their claim that the Green New Deal is going to  ban air travel. What?    Let me conclude by saying that the Green New Deal is  aspirational. To say that it is going to result in forcing everyone to  stop eating meat--it is like, what the heck? What these so-called facts  opponents and the climate change deniers are saying about the Green New  Deal is laughable, coming from the very people who deny the scientific  fact of climate change.   I could go on, but obviously my time is up. I will have more to say  as we continue this so-called sham debate. But let's not continue to  stick our heads in the sand.   I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record a letter written by  an 11-year-old girl in Hawaii who spoke at a climate change rally in  Hawaii. She was so articulate. She said: You know, this is like  experiencing world war III for the young people.    They demand that the adults in the Senate to do something  about it and address climate change in an appropriate way.   Thank you.   On Sunday, I received a letter from Mesina--an 11-year-old girl--who  spoke at a March 15th climate action protest in Hawaii, and she wrote:         ``I hope that all of our eyes are open now. Floods are       demolishing people's homes, forest fires are killing people       and singeing acres of land. Sea creatures are dying. Oceans       are rising. How can we deny climate change and the science       that supports its human cause?''        ``We are experiencing World War III, except in this war, we       are all on the same side. We can all agree on clean air,       clean water, and a clean earth. As a child that is going to       inherit our Earth, I beg you please do everything in your       power to protect my generation's future and the generations       to follow.''    Mesina is asking us to step up. It's past time to take urgent action  to combat climate change.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I come to the floor today to denounce the  majority leader's sham debate on the Green New Deal.
