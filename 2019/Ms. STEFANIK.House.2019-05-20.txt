 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  Stronger Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act.   In 2016, there were 4.1 million referrals to child protective  services. Far too many children experience some form of abuse or  neglect in their lifetime, a sad reality that deserves our utmost  attention.   The Stronger Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act strengthens the  original law in order to further protect our children. The bill  provides for evidence-based support for the victims of abuse,  establishes national reporting requirements to more accurately track  child abuse trends, expands research into child welfare, and improves  the grant funding process.   As Representatives in Congress, protecting our children and most  vulnerable members of society is an obligation we each take very  seriously. This issue rises above party lines and, as an original  cosponsor of the bill, I am grateful for my colleagues coming together  to support this important legislation.   I am also proud that this bill includes an amendment that I  introduced with my colleague across the aisle, Mrs. McBath, to  establish a National Abuse Hotline. This amendment offers grant funding  to nonprofit entities to establish and maintain a 24-hour, national,  toll-free, abuse hotline that gives at risk individuals the opportunity  to report instances of abuse and receive immediate assistance without  fear of retribution.   I thank my colleagues for the unanimous support of this amendment,  and I encourage all of my colleagues today to support this lifesaving  bill.
