 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   The information I had was, as the chairman has indicated, that the  gentleman who just spoke appeared before the Rules Committee in support  of this bill. And we can get the transcript. I don't have it right now,  but perhaps somebody can get that transcript for me.   For my entire career in public service, I have supported efforts to  make America both strong and safe and a force for peace and  reconciliation. In the course of those years, I have striven to draw an  acceptable balance between our national security and the protection of  our personal liberty and the right to privacy central to our unique  extraordinary democracy; a government of laws, not men.   Pursuant to that principle, as the majority leader, I scheduled the  Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act for floor consideration over 2  months ago.   Previously, in 2008, Roy Blunt, then the minority whip, and myself,  the majority leader; Senator Kit Bond, Senator from Missouri; and  Senator Jay Rockefeller, Senator from West Virginia, worked together,  at a time of great controversy with respect to the Foreign Intelligence  Surveillance Act, to forge a bill that would garner bipartisan support.  It was a difficult bill, with the same kind of principle differences  that Chairman Nadler spoke of earlier and I am going to speak about  again.   We passed that bill in a bipartisan fashion with, as we have today,  people on the right and people on the left concerned about its content.  So there was bipartisan support and bipartisan opposition. Speaker  Pelosi and to-be President Obama, then in the Senate representing  Illinois, voted for that bill. I have tried to continue to forge that  balance through the years.   The bill I brought to the floor a few months ago was a bipartisan  effort to achieve that critical balance, and when it came to a vote, it  received two-thirds of the votes from both Democrats and Republicans.  This bill essentially had two-thirds of the votes on the Republican  side and two-thirds of the votes on the Democratic side, so obviously,  two-thirds of the votes of this House.   As I observed yesterday, Americans must have been heartened by the  fact that we could reach a bipartisan agreement on such a difficult  bill. It was not a partisan bill. The leaders, all three top leaders,  on both sides of the aisle supported, essentially, this bill.   That bill, upon Senate consideration, was amended by an  overwhelmingly bipartisan vote to strengthen the protections of  privacy, which should have been heartening to those on the right and  the left, and it was certainly heartening to me.   And then, what did they do? They passed it, with 80 Senators, 48  Republicans supporting this bill; 48 out of 53 supporting this bill.  But this is not a partisan bill; and this bill is about that balance.   Mr. Nunes and Mr. Schiff supported this bill and supported this  balance. And two-thirds of us made a judgment that they had done a job  worthy of support.   So two-thirds of the Democrats in the Senate, two-thirds of the  Republicans in the Senate, two-thirds of the Republicans in this House,  and two-thirds of the Democrats in this House have supported this bill.  I believe that support was garnered because an assumption was made, a  premise was adopted by the overwhelming majority of us, that it was a  carefully crafted balance between security and individual liberties. It  may not be perfect, but we have a responsibility to protect this  country and our people.   In consultation, therefore, with other leaders, I scheduled this bill  for consideration yesterday. The night before, I got a call from my  friend, the minority leader, that the President was urging Republicans  in the House to change their votes to ``no.''    In the twinkling of a presidential tweet, without any substantive  logic to justify their actions, I was told that the 126 Republicans who  had voted for this bill when it was considered in the House would now  change their votes and vote ``no.''   Chairman Nadler has said this, and I want to share this because it is  worth repeating. I believe when FISA passed the House in March, every  Member, those who voted ``yes'' and those who voted ``no'' voted their  principles and their conviction on what they believed was in the  security interests of the United States. Every one of the 435 people--I  don't think there were quite 435--that voted on that bill, in my view,  voted on principle and out of conviction.   I, of course, believed that the two-thirds of the Members who voted  for the bill, on principle, and pursuant to conviction about making  this country safe, were voting, not for party, but for principle.   Therefore, I was surprised because I saw, not then nor now, any  reason that either principle or conviction should be changed,  particularly in light of the fact that 80 Senators--80 Senators--48  Republican colleagues of yours, Madam Speaker, voted for this bill.   Therefore, I assumed that we could bring Members back. We had a  controversy where some didn't come back. We had a new rule you don't  like. We could bring the Congress back and vote on a bipartisan bill  for America.   But, as a result of the President's antipathy toward Federal law  enforcement and his personal sense of grievance, authorities that have  expired will continue to be lapsed.   The complicity of those who believe that the reauthorizing of these  authorities was in the best interest of the United States, in  preventing its passage last night and today, is, I think, both sad and  irresponsible.   Madam Speaker, I regret that we did not bring this bill to the floor  for a vote.   This is a result, in my view, Madam Speaker, of patently political  and indefensible abandonment of principle and responsibility, both as a  coequal branch of government and its policymaking branch as well.   Madam Speaker, we need to send this bill to conference. I urge my  colleagues to vote to send it to conference. And if you think this  needs to be perfected in some way, as Mr. Nadler said, that is the  place to do it now that we are not going to have it on the floor.   Let me repeat. I would have had it on the floor. But we will not get  an opportunity to vote on it, so I will wait to see the result of a  conference with the Republican-led Senate on the bill that the  President has threatened to veto.   Two-thirds of us believed that this was a bill that was good for  America. This is a serious issue with serious consequences, and I urge  you to vote ``yes.'' Do not kill this bill.    Madam Speaker, this is testimony dated 5/27/2020. I am  going to read you some passages from that testimony:   ``Thank you for the opportunity to talk about this important  legislation.''   I will go down, skip a couple of paragraphs. Perhaps he will want to  point those out.   ``Fortunately,'' the gentleman said, ``this bill makes important  structural reforms to the program to combat abuses.''   He then said: ``Most importantly, this bill includes accountability  measures.''   He went on to say: ``It also includes reforms that strengthen  Congress' oversight powers.''   ``Finally,'' he said, ``I would like to thank Senators Lee and Leahy  for their amendment to the House-passed bill which strengthens the  amicus role in these proceedings by extending them to any sensitive  investigative matter involving any U.S. persons. And I also fully  support this inclusion as well of the Lofgren-Davidson amendment,''  which is not on the bill, ``to limit the FBI's ability to obtain  internet browsing history of Americans.''   I am trying to find a word of opposition to this bill, clearly, taken  by the Rules Committee as support of the passage of this bill.   My, my, my. As I have pointed out earlier, the consequences of a  twinkling of a tweet from the President of the United States: Like  that, changing the votes of 126 people, whom I believed voted on  principle and on conviction for this bill for America.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.    Madam Speaker, as we face the crisis that COVID-19 has  confronted us with, the House must do its duty in full and do so in a  way that contributes to the safety and welfare of our people, not in a  way that harms it.   Members are advised there will be no votes expected in the House next  week. Members are further advised that an updated 2020 legislative  calendar will be released in the coming days.   I expect conversations to continue on additional legislation  addressing COVID-19 and the legislation we passed honoring our heroes.  In the event that an agreement is reached on a bipartisan or partisan  bill--I don't know how an agreement can be reached on a partisan bill,  but a bipartisan bill--then we will make sure that the House has 72  hours before they need to come back to vote on that legislation.   I am disappointed that Leader McConnell said, when asked about the  next phase of coronavirus relief, he said, I think that's a decision to  be made a month from now.   As we know, we have a lot of people in crisis. We see food lines that  are very, very long. We see unemployment rising steeply. There are many  people in this country that think waiting is not appropriate.   I am pleased the House has adopted a resolution to allow the  committees to work remotely, Madam Speaker. I expect to use the coming  weeks to get our committees back up and running so that they can begin  having hearings and markups on critical legislation.   As my friend, Mr. Scalise, knows, we have a number of must-pass bills  that need to be addressed; the National Defense Authorization Act, the  12 appropriation bills, the surface transportation bill, and the WRDA  bill as well. As committees begin consideration of these bills, I will  be in touch with Members about when they will be scheduled this summer.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise),  the minority whip.    Madam Speaker, I want to echo the gentleman's comments.  Although the Congressman, the patriot, the hero, did not always vote  with me, nor I with him, we became good friends. And I shared with the  gentleman and others in this body a deep respect for who he was as a  person, a decent man, a patriotic man, a good man and, obviously, as  the gentleman pointed out, a very courageous man as well.   He served many missions, was shot down, imprisoned, but they did not  break Sam Johnson, nor did they break the love he had for his country,  and we honor the service he gave.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Pelosi).    Madam Speaker, as I said, what we are going to do over the  next couple of weeks, we have adopted a rule that allows the committees  to meet even if they can't be here for health reasons, depending upon  what the status is in D.C. and the Capitol, where it is around the  country, including transportation.   The rule that we adopted provides that committees must have, in order  to conduct virtual or hybrid hearings, a practice session, then two  hearings before they go to a markup.   So obviously, if we are going to work on this floor, we need product  and, obviously, product comes from the committees. And so I am very  hopeful that the committees will be getting up and running at top speed  in many respects.   And, of course, the committees have been working so very hard, and  the Members have been working so very hard, in my view, on both sides  of the aisle, as they have been home and talking to their hospitals,  talking to their governors and their county commissioners and their  local folks, nursing home administrators, so many people that we have  kept in touch with through these weeks to see what we could do to  assist them with whatever they needed.                                time  1530    The committees will be getting up to speed, and they will be  qualifying for having hearings. I expect work product to be coming  later this month, and we will be giving notice in the near term on a  longer term schedule. But the House will not be in session next week,  and we will be looking at how the committees are proceeding from that  point on.   We will give, as I said, as we have in the past, 72 hours' notice to  Members when and if we have to come back.   I want to again say also that we are very hopeful that our Republican  colleague will engage in the matters that were included in the HEROES  bill because our States are struggling. I know my State is a relatively  wealthy State, but its revenues are off 20, 25 percent. I don't know  what Louisiana's position is, but I am sure they are struggling as  well. Municipalities are struggling, cities are struggling, and  counties are struggling from the revenue reduction that is a direct  result of COVID-19. So, we are trying to help those States.   In addition, of course, we invested substantial sums in testing,  isolating, tracing, and treating individuals who have COVID, and we  need to follow up on whom they have contacted so that we can make sure  that they isolate themselves because the only way we are going to get a  handle on this is to make sure we reduce the transition from one to the  other.   We are also hopeful that we will develop, and there is money in there  to develop, a therapeutic to mitigate the adverse effects of COVID-19  but also a vaccine to protect us from getting COVID-19.   Until that happens, we also need to give additional help to our small  businesses and individuals who are really struggling as unemployment is  at historic levels. Over 38 million Americans--maybe it is now closer  to 40 million Americans--are without jobs. We have given them  assistance, and we need to give them some more.   That is where we stand now, and we will operate with an intent in  mind of getting the business of the House done, in addition to the  extraordinary work that we have done on five responses now from the  House on the effects that the coronavirus has caused in this country  both to human beings' health and to the health of our economy.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana.    The answer is yes. We are going to have out a fuller  schedule in the near term. But we have to find out how our committees  can operate.   I want to say, regarding the national defense authorization bill,  Members on both sides of the aisle have been working very, very hard at  a distance, on the phone, and in other ways. So, I expect them to be  ready to come to the floor this summer, and we are going to pass that  bill, we think, before the summer break. That is for certain.   Madam Speaker, I yield to my friend.    Madam Speaker, I think the country is distancing itself as  well. I don't know whether my friend drove to work today, but there are  hardly any cars on the street. There are hardly any cars on the street  in New York. The reason is because people are taking the advice of the  government and practicing social distancing.   We think that makes sense. We think that is consistent with medical  advice, and that is what we have been doing.   It is very nice to say, well, they could have been here, but there  are a lot of West Coast Members who have to get on airplanes. Some of  those airplanes now, because there are so few flights, are very  crowded, and people are concerned because they are not practicing  social distancing.   When I am speaking, I don't wear a mask. But if you see me in the  Capitol and getting into my car, I have a mask on. I think we are  setting an example. I think we are setting an example of how you  distance here on this floor, which we are all practicing right now.    So, I think the House is setting a good example of understanding that  it is not business as usual. When you walk down the street and people  are wearing masks, you know it is not business as usual. You know it is  not the America of 3 or 4 months ago, Madam Speaker.   In any event, I think we are going to proceed. We have provided to do  the business of the American people. We did that just in the last 2  days. We passed a number of very important bills, important bills to  small business in particular.   I was sorry that we didn't resolve the FISA question, but we did go  to conference. We will see what happens on  [[Page H2349]]  that. We have passed, as the gentleman mentioned earlier, extraordinary  legislation through this House over the last 2 months to ensure that  the American people got the help they needed and that the economics of  our country will undergird it to the extent we could. So, we have done  a lot of work.   I want to say this: I think we do a disservice to our Members and to  this institution if we go home and pretend that Members somehow aren't  working because they are not physically in this room. I don't know, I  presume my friend's Members--but I tell you, Madam Speaker, the Members  on my side of the aisle are working around the clock and communicating  around the clock.   That bill that we passed in a bipartisan way, we took a lot of time,  days and days and days and days of hours- and hours- and hours-long  conversations to get to a consensus on what ought to be in that bill,  and we passed it in a bipartisan way.   So, my presumption is my friend did the same. I don't know; I was not  on my friend's phone calls. But you do a disservice, I think--I don't  mean you personally. But we do a disservice to allow the President or  anybody else--nobody is on vacation. People are working harder now than  if we didn't have this coronavirus is my observation.   I am hopeful that we will move on. I am hopeful that we will be back  to business as usual and as soon as possible--``possible'' is the  operative word--with the advice of our Capitol physician, with the  advice of the administration, and my own Governor.   My friend talked about States. I have a Republican Governor, Governor  Hogan, whose father was one of my predecessors. I know he is still very  cautious and urging caution for our citizens.   Madam Speaker, unless the gentleman has something further, I am  prepared to yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1545     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and I yield back the  balance of my time.                            ____________________
