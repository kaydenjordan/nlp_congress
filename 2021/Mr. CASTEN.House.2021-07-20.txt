 Madam Speaker, I trust most of my colleagues have heard  of ``Hot Girl Summer'' and the broader Megan Thee Stallion oeuvre.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to declare the start of ``Hot FERC  Summer,'' with FERC, of course, being the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission. Why, you might ask? Well, to paraphrase Ms. Stallion,  because now that FERC has put in all that work, it is time for them to  be the MVP.   Now, some might say that FERC isn't, dare I say, hot enough to  warrant that attention. But for those of us who are serious about  fighting the climate crisis, they sure should be.   The Commission ensures our energy markets, generation, and  transmission  [[Page H3677]]  are operating and providing us with affordable, reliable energy. But  the best kept secret of all is that FERC is absolutely key to achieving  our clean energy goals and a zero carbon economy.   For the last few decades, FERC's biggest push has been to encourage  competition in the power sector. FERC Order 888, which just celebrated  its 25th birthday a few months ago, may not have cracked the Billboard  Top 100, but it has been almost singularly responsible for  decarbonizing our electric sector. The order, like most things FERC- related, was, frankly, pretty wonky. But by incentivizing lower-cost  gas, nuclear, and renewable energy, it drove the private sector to  drastically lower their greenhouse gas emissions and slash electricity  costs.   From the perspective of anyone who pays for electricity, that is  fantastic news. You pay less for cleaner power.   From the perspective of someone who cares about climate change, it is  also amazing because once a clean energy plant is built, you don't need  to pay the wind to blow or the Sun to shine. Clean energy is the  cheapest source of energy out there, and those old, dirty plants just  can't compete.   In my home State of Illinois, a recent study found that it would be  cheaper to sell a coal plant that was just built a decade ago for scrap  and procure cleaner replacement power through those FERC-organized  markets. Thank you, FERC.   To kick off ``Hot FERC Summer,'' I have introduced bills that will  help FERC build on this success. The first of these was the  Interregional Transmission Planning Improvement Act, which I introduced  with Senator Heinrich, that will ensure that our grid operators are  thinking properly about the benefits of building transmission wires  across the country.   The second, the Energy PRICE Act, which I introduced just today with  Representatives Levin, Huffman, and Bonamici, would help ensure that  FERC lives up to its legal responsibility to protect the public welfare  by not approving electricity rates that don't account for the cost of  greenhouse gas emissions.   I will be dropping a third ``Hot FERC Summer'' bill--I am sorry, a  third hot jam next week.   But right now, FERC is at a crossroads. For the first time in years,  President Biden has an opportunity to create a Democratic majority at  FERC; a majority that will ensure that these incentives are in place to  build an electric grid for our 21st century economy; a majority that  will ensure that State renewable energy rules are respected and  integrated into regional markets, a majority that will ensure that  uneconomic fossil fuel plants are subjected to the competitive  pressures of a free market that have given us an explosion in solar and  wind energy over the past decade; a majority that will ensure that we  make further progress in our clean energy goals rather than trying to  fight against it.   But in order to do any of that in time to prevent more climate  devastation, the President must nominate a Commissioner to FERC, and  the Senate must confirm that individual. I urge both to do so as soon  as possible to ensure that FERC stays at its full power and that it  will be able to continue to be the most important clean energy agency  that most of us have never heard of.   As you, of course know, Madam Speaker, ``Hot Girl Summer'' ain't  about degrees, but ``Hot FERC Summer'' most definitely is. The record  temperatures from Portland to Death Valley, the wildfires, and the  coming hurricane season are all the direct result of our failure to  decarbonize as quickly as we must.   While this summer is the hottest FERC summer yet, it is coming on the  heels of 2020, which was the hottest summer North America has ever seen  for as long as we have records. In point of fact, the 10 warmest  summers on record have occurred since 1998. If we fail to act, they  will be nothing compared to the summers we will experience over the  coming decades because while the best chance to take action on climate  was 30 years ago, the last chance is now.                            ____________________
