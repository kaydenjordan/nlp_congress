 Mr. Speaker, I rise today for the distinct honor and  pleasure of welcoming Pastor Steve William Schenewerk as the guest  chaplain in the United States House of Representatives this morning.   Pastor Schenewerk serves the congregation of Community Baptist Church  in Winston, Oregon. He was raised in the Midwest but followed the call  of God to the Pacific Northwest to become a pastor. His path led him to  Community Baptist Church, where he has humbly offered spiritual  guidance and encouragement to the community for over 25 years.   Pastor Schenewerk's devotion to his community does not stop there,  though. He serves on the board of the Winston Area Community  Partnership and is involved in several organizations that help the  needy in Douglas County.   Ever committed to serving those who have served others, Pastor  Schenewerk has most recently become the chaplain to the local police  force in Winston.  [[Page H6178]]    Of all the joys in his life, nothing compares to that for his wife,  Cindy; his daughter, Megan; and son, Josh.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Pastor Schenewerk for his words this morning.  They are most inspirational.                            ____________________
