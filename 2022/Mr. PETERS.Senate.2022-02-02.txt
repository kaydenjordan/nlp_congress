 Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to  confirm several highly qualified nominees to serve on the local  District of Columbia courts--the DC Superior Court, which functions as  the State-level trial court, and the DC Court of Appeals, which serves  as the State-level appellate court right here in our Nation's Capital.   Both courts are currently suffering from a vacancy crisis. There are  16 of the 62 DC Superior Court seats that are currently empty, and 3 of  the 9 seats on the DC Court of Appeals are also vacant, slowing justice  and impeding public safety for all District residents.   Last year, the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental  Affairs reported seven nominees to serve on the DC courts by a  bipartisan voice vote. These include five nominees to serve on the DC  Superior Court--Rupa Ranga Puttagunta, Kenia Seoane Lopez, Sean  Staples, Ebony Scott, and Donald Tunnage--and two nominees to serve on  the DC Court of Appeals--John Howard III and Loren AliKhan.   Judge Puttagunta currently serves as an administrative judge for the  DC Rental Housing Commission. She began her legal career as a law clerk  in the DC Superior Court and the DC Court of Appeals and practiced for  several years in the District of Columbia, focusing on family and  criminal law. I am certainly pleased that my colleagues confirmed her  earlier today.   Judge Seoane Lopez currently serves as a magistrate judge on the  Superior Court of the District of Columbia, a position that she has  held for 9 years. She previously served as a bilingual attorney  negotiator in the court's domestic violence division and as an  assistant attorney general for the Office of the Attorney General of  the District of Columbia.   Judge Staples also currently serves as a magistrate judge for the  District of Columbia Superior Court, a position he was appointed to in  2013. Early in his career, he served as a law clerk on the superior  court and then worked as a solo practitioner and an assistant public  defender. He went on to work as a clinical professor for several years,  supervising law students representing criminal defendants in DC  Superior Court.    Judge Scott has served as a magistrate judge on DC Superior Court  since 2020. She previously served as a deputy director in the DC  Mayor's Office of Legal Counsel as general counsel for the District of  Columbia Office of Human Rights and the assistant attorney general for  the DC Office of the Attorney General's housing and community justice  section.   Mr. Tunnage has served as a criminal trial attorney in the Civil  Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice since 2009 and  previously served as an assistant public defender in Miami, FL.   Loren AliKhan has served as the solicitor general for the District of  Columbia since 2018. She previously served as deputy solicitor general  and spent time in the U.S. Department of Justice and in the appellate  practice division of a DC law firm.   John Howard III currently serves as an administrative law judge with  the District of Columbia Office of Administrative Hearings. He  previously worked in private practice and served as an administrative  law judge with the District of Columbia Commission on Human Rights.   All of these nominees are experienced lawyers and adjudicators, and  all of them are dedicated to serving the people of the District of  Columbia.   These are not controversial nominations. Unlike Federal judicial  nominees, these individuals are extensively vetted by an independent,  seven-member local commission, which recommends candidates for the  President to nominate.   During the last administration, the Senate confirmed 10 local DC  judicial nominees, all by voice vote.   I urge my colleagues to join me in confirming these nominees, each of  whom has broad and strong bipartisan support.   Thank you.    Mr. President, I have 10 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of the  Majority and Minority Leaders.
