 Madam Speaker, for the past several months, my colleagues  across the aisle have struggled to advance their budget reconciliation  bill. The reason is simple: It is a disastrous piece of legislation  that the American people simply don't want now that they are starting  to find out what is actually in it.   When I served in Albany, we called these bloated budget bills, and  ones just like this the ``Big Ugly,'' and ugly this is.   I rise today to urge my colleagues to oppose our national ``Big  Ugly,'' which will raise corporation taxes, and that includes small  businesses and family farms, to 26.5 percent, one of the highest rates  in the world, and higher than the Communist Party of China charges  their corporations.   Despite assurances from the administration, low- and middle-income  taxpayers--and that includes, again, our small businesses and family  farms, which are the heart of our communities which drive our economy-- they will bear the brunt of this bill's $2 trillion-plus increase in  taxes.   Meanwhile, elite universities, left-leaning media outlets, and  families earning more than $800,000 per year will receive major tax  benefits or breaks. This bill also allocates billions of dollars to  Green New Deal policies while raising taxes on America's domestic  energy producers.   As we approach winter in upstate New York--and it is cold, trust me-- my constituents are facing some of the highest heating costs in recent  memory. This bill's tax hikes on American energy producers are an  insult to New York families who will be left struggling to pay their  energy bills, especially those who are seniors on fixed incomes.   The point is simple: The Build Back Better plan is an endless list of  progressive priorities that will add trillions of dollars to our  national debt and worsen skyrocketing inflation, which is nothing more  than a tax on the people who can least afford it: people on fixed  incomes, people struggling to make a living.   Dictators from Russia to China, Putin to Xi, are counting on us to  support our national ``Big Ugly,'' the Democrats' Build Back Better  plan, the budget reconciliation plan, that will secure Putin and Xi's  economic and energy dominance for decades to come. This will  irreparably hurt Americans across the board.   I urge my colleagues to vote against this. Come up with a better plan  that actually empowers American businesses, and especially the small  businesses who create most of the jobs and drive our economy, and  again, our family farms which are the tradition and heart of our  communities, especially in upstate New York.                            ____________________
