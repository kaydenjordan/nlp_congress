 Mr. Chairman, I rise, as well, in opposition to the  substitute amendment, and I do so because I am struck by the ways in  which you can, at times, agree on the diagnosis but disagree on the  cure.   I think we would all agree, Republicans and Democrats alike, that we  have a real problem in the way that wages have indeed stagnated over  the last 30 years. A lot of my Democratic colleagues are nailing it in  terms of that diagnosis.   The question though, is the cure. And the question there is: Can we  fix that problem by raising taxes by $2.7 trillion? Can we fix that  problem by increasing spending by $6.2 trillion? Can we fix that  problem by increasing the debt by $3.9 trillion and, in essence, having  a budget that never balances?   I would argue, no, and I would say, instead, what we have to look at  is the basics, which we have been dancing around, which is the  mathematic formula that says: Savings drives investment, which drives  productivity gain which, ultimately, impacts standard of living or  wages. And what we don't focus on enough is this notion of the  investment part of investment; if you want to increase productivity,  you have got to increase investment.   In fairness to my Democratic colleagues, part of that is public  investment, but another part is private.   What my colleague from Virginia was just getting at a moment ago was,  for 50 years, regardless of tax rate, 90 or 28 percent, the take to  government has been about 18 percent of GDP very consistently.   So what I would argue is we, indeed, need more public investment, but  we also need private investment to go with it. And if we don't watch  out, what is being contemplated with this Democratic substitute is a  process that will ultimately crowd out that much more in the way of  private investment so key to increasing productivity.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Kentucky has 3\1/2\ minutes  remaining. The gentlewoman from Tennessee has 1\1/4\ minutes remaining.
