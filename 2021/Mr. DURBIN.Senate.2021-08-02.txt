 Mr. President, ``socialism,'' it is a label we hear a  lot. It has been around a while--a long time--but in American politics,  it is kind of applied in an unusual way. The notion that every American  would pay into an insurance fund so that everyone who retired could  live in basic dignity--we called it Social Security as Democrats; the  Republicans called it socialism.   Do they want to remove Social Security as a socialist program? I  don't know. I listened carefully as the Republican leader started  talking about the weaknesses of the Democratic philosophy.   And then, in the 1960s, Lyndon Baines Johnson looked around America  and saw a new class of impoverished Americans growing by the day. They  were our parents and grandparents. And he decided one of their biggest  problems was paying for their medical expenses and their prescription  drugs eventually. So he proposed a Federal program called Medicare for  everyone who reached the age of 65 in America, regardless of whether  they were rich or poor. Boy, think about that.   The critics called that socialism--the notion that we would help  everybody, that we would collect money during their work experience and  then take care of our parents and grandparents so they could live  longer, more independently. Socialism.   Now, we are discussing--and we are at an early stage--changing that  Medicare Program to extend its benefits to include fundamental and  basic things that have been sitting there for decades waiting to be  addressed. Eyeglasses, hearing aids, dental work--we know what a  difference those things make in the lives of everyone but how  critically important they are to those who are elderly.   And, yes, the junior Senator from Vermont has proposed that we extend  Medicare benefits to include those protections, but he is not alone.  Moderates within the Democratic caucus across the board agree, it is  time to take a serious look at that, and the Republican leader tells us  we are flirting with socialism again.   I don't think that a poor, elderly person without dentures who can't  eat their food can be ignored--or that helping them is socialism.   I might add one thing that is important. He cites the CARES Act. I  remember it well. It was a little over a year ago, it was last year.  The pandemic was just kicking off, and it was proposed. This CARES Act,  it was over $1 trillion. It might have been the biggest bill when it  was passed. It was proposed with the Trump administration, with a  Democratic Congress, and it ended up with a strong bipartisan rollcall.  I voted for it. Virtually every  [[Page S5531]]  Democratic Senator joined every Republican Senator to make it a  reality: billions of dollars to deal with the pandemic. Socialist? I  don't think so. It was America coming together to address a crisis.  That is exactly what happened.   So what happened when we had a new President, when Donald Trump was  gone--and, yes, he is gone, despite the fact that he doesn't know it.  What happened when we had a new President who decided he wanted to put  together a rescue plan? This rescue plan addressed some fundamentals.  It addressed the promise that Donald Trump made, that $1,400 was coming  to families. Really? Sounds socialistic to me.   But it was the Trump idea and it was the Biden rescue plan that  pulled it off.   And the vaccines--and we can only thank the Lord and the great  researchers who put that together--but it was only just a theory and  inventory. But President Biden found a way to administer the COVID-19  vaccines across America, a dramatic effort. That was paid for by the  American Rescue Plan. And the money loans for businesses to get started  after the pandemic, money for schools to make sure they are safe when  the kids return to them this fall. When the American Rescue Plan was  put together by President Biden and offered in this Chamber, I am sorry  to report that not one Republican Senator supported it. I hope they  have had second thoughts since then. Administering the vaccines has  given us hope in America, and I hope more people will take advantage of  it. But that was bipartisanship that really hit the rocks. It took the  Democrats and Kamala Harris to make a difference.    When I hear about socialism and bipartisanship from the other side,  how far would they go in ending programs which have historically been  labeled as ``socialistic''?                                  H.R. 3684    Mr. President, on a completely different topic but somehow related,  Senators spend a lot of time in airports and in airplanes, even in  COVID-19 times. The Presiding Officer knows that well. I spend a lot of  time in airports. O'Hare, I can take you on a tour. Springfield is a  small airport. Reagan National Airport here, I am familiar with it as  well.   But I always thought to myself, as I traveled years ago, that one of  the worst airports in America, sadly, was LaGuardia. Oh, what a wreck.  LaGuardia was just way underutilized and lacked all the modern  developments we expect at an airport, but, lo and behold, that has  changed. LaGuardia is finished now, and it is beautiful. It has many  things that many airports would only aspire to have, as it should,  because it is not only serving a great city, but it is also named after  a great man, Fiorello La Guardia.   He stood 5-foot-2, but he was a giant. As mayor of New York City  during the Great Depression and World War II, he took on political  corruption and organized crime. He did some things that are still  talked about. When the newspaper workers went on strike, he read the  funnies to the kids so they could keep up with them.   He did something else, too. He oversaw investment in public works,  including investments in roads, highways, and tunnels, that changed the  landscape of America's largest city.   Fiorello La Guardia famously said: ``There is no Democrat or  Republican way to fix a pothole.''   He understood, when it comes to the most basic responsibilities of  government, political labels shouldn't matter. Building and maintaining  roads and bridges helps all of us.   I think Mayor Fiorello La Guardia would be happy to know that we have  created a blueprint for America's economic future. Against the odds, we  now have before us a bipartisan plan to build the physical backbone of  the 21st century American economy. In these times when there is so much  political disagreement, just getting this far is a remarkable  achievement. I look forward to a productive debate and hopefully a vote  this week. I am hopeful we can meet the deadline because the fact is,  America can't wait any longer for this Senate to take action. Our roads  and bridges are crumbling beneath our feet.   Last week, I brought to this floor a photo of a bridge that collapsed  2 weeks ago in a small rural town in Illinois known as Seneca. A man  was driving his pickup truck across the bridge when the bridge  collapsed. The picture showed his red pickup truck precariously  straddling the two halves of the broken bridge. Luckily, some Good  Samaritans came to his rescue.   Any of us, at any time, could be that man on the bridge. More than  47,000 American bridges are judged to be structurally deficient,  including 2,000 in my State of Illinois. The legislation we are voting  on this week will start to repair them. It includes the largest  investment in American bridges since the creation of the Interstate  Highway System. Imagine that.   It also includes the largest investment in clean water infrastructure  ever. Do we need it? Well, think of Flint, MI, and think of the story  today in the Chicago papers about the discovery of PFOS contamination  in water supplies across my State. That isn't all.   We can replace the old lead service lines that poison drinking water.  So many homes and businesses and schools and churches are served by  lead pipe service lines, and there is no tolerable amount of lead that  can be in water.   I want to thank my colleague Tammy Duckworth. She has been a real  leader on this issue, and I think all of us owe her a debt of gratitude  that it is included in this legislation.   Chicago has more miles of lead water pipes than any city in America.  I am not bragging. I am just stating facts. But Chicago isn't alone.  These lead pipes are in big cities and small towns all across the  Nation. Listen to this.   The bipartisan plan includes the largest investment in passenger rail  since the creation of Amtrak in the 1960s. You know President Joe Biden  wouldn't forget Amtrak, nor would Tom Carper or Chris Coons. It is the  largest investment in public transit in American history. I was just  out at the ribbon-cutting--well, several recently in Chicago.  Naturally, people were not riding the CTA and Metro and other rail  opportunities as they once did because of COVID-19, but it is coming  back, and we want to make sure those stations are safe and make sure  they are accessible for people with disabilities.   With this bill, in my State, the Chicago Transit Authority and  transit agencies downstate will be able to buy new, more efficient  buses and railcars and modernize tracks and rail stations. It will  expand the capacity of the blue line at O'Hare, completing the red line  south extension, which has been a dream for decades.   This plan includes $25 billion to modernize Illinois' airports,  including money for O'Hare's terminal expansion. Believe me, we can use  it. We have done a lot with the runways--magnificent investments there.  Now, we have got to make sure the terminals keep up with that  modernization.   Remember the cargo ship that ran aground at the Suez Canal, causing  major delays worldwide in shipping, costing companies and, ultimately,  customers millions of dollars? Well, this infrastructure plan will keep  America's economy moving and our shipping lanes open by modernizing our  ports, locks, and dams.   We are not just repairing old infrastructure; we are building new  infrastructure. This plan includes the largest investment in clean  energy in infrastructure in America's history. If there was ever a  moment in time--with the world literally burning up--for us to get  serious about climate change, this is that moment, and this investment  responds to it.   In America, the biggest source of greenhouse gases is transportation.  We can change it. This plan is a start.   In the town of Normal, IL--yes, there is a Normal, IL--a company  called Rivian bought an old, abandoned Mitsubishi automobile factory 5  years ago. They now have started production on electric cars and  delivery vans, the cars of the future.   Is this going to go anywhere? Does anybody believe in electric  vehicles? Well, 15 percent of Rivian is owned by Ford Motor Company. If  you have heard of a company called Amazon, they invested $1 billion in  Rivian. They ordered 120,000 delivery vans. There are 2,000 people  working there now, twice the number who were working when Mitsubishi  left. They aspire to double  [[Page S5532]]  that number again and to make production really accessible all across  the country.   That is not the only story I could tell about electric vehicles.  Illinois is in a position to be a global leader in electric cars.  Argonne National Laboratory in the Chicagoland area has really led  American research in battery technology and recycling batteries. That  is the future. If you don't believe me, just watch the ads on  television where they are advertising the new Ford F-150 Lightning, an  electric truck. They don't have any available now, but they invite you  to sign up to buy one next year.   With this plan, we can build a network of electric vehicle charging  stations, where drivers can charge their cars for a fraction of what it  costs to fill a gas tank today and without the harmful emissions. It  really is the future that we are trying to assist with this important  infrastructure bill.   Importantly, this plan will help connect every American to reliable  high-speed internet. Over 60 percent of the American people say that  access to high-speed internet is as important as electricity to them  and some say it is even more important than water. It has become that  integral to a successful life for business. No matter where you live,  the internet puts the world at your fingertips. Your children can learn  from home, you can connect to healthcare providers when you need them,  and businesses can reach the global marketplace.   One last point. This plan will help us protect America's  infrastructure, our economy, and American families from 21st-century  threats of climate change, extreme weather, and cyber attacks. It is  the largest investment in resilience of physical and natural systems in  American history.   With this plan, we can create thousands of good-paying, family- supporting jobs, and the majority of these jobs may not require a  college degree. Perhaps that 2 extra years of community college, which  we hope to include in the next bill, will be just what a person needs  to get a good-paying job, settle down, and raise a family--the American  dream. And we can lay the foundation for a long-term economic boom if  everyone pulls together.   These are smart, prudent, necessary investments that will pay  dividends for years to come. I want to thank the President. He was  really all in in the negotiation of this bill. Without his leadership,  we wouldn't be here. I also want to thank the bipartisan group of  Senators who worked with the White House to produce this agreement. I  have come to know them. I participated in some of the early meetings  and listened to them through the deliberation. There were times when I  wanted to wring their necks, and there were times when I wanted to pat  their backs. But they never quit trying, and today, we have a bill  before us that is a dramatic achievement, and it is a bipartisan  achievement.   I think the number was 17 of the Republicans who voted for us to move  forward on this debate. I hope those 17 can hold together with the  Democrats to see this bill to its successful conclusion.   Remember Fiorello La Guardia's statement that there is no Democratic  or Republican way to fill a pothole? But there is a smart way to build  the physical backbone of an economy. This is the right start. This  bipartisan plan hits the sweet spot. I thank our many Republican  colleagues who have joined with the Democrats to advance this debate.  Isn't that what America has been waiting for?   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker)  is necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker)  is necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker)  and the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Kaine) are necessarily absent.    Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
