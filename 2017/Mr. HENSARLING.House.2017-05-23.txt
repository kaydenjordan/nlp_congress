 Mr. Speaker, I certainly thank the gentleman for  yielding.   I have had many opportunities in my career to come to this House  floor and speak about topics of great importance, but few are as near  and dear to my heart as is Scouting.   So, one, I want to thank the gentleman from New York for his  leadership and the gentleman from Texas for his leadership and keeping  Scouting alive not only in their hearts, but in the heart of the House  and in the hearts of so many young men in America today.    Mr. Speaker, as I think about my own life, I think how terribly  blessed I have been. I think about the molders of my character, and,  certainly, I thank the Lord for the blessing of being able to worship  Him in the land of the free. And I think about the impact my church has  had upon my life.   I think how blessed I am to have parents like Charles and Ann  Hensarling, who raised me in College Station, Texas, and how proud I am  to be my mother's son and how proud I was to be my late father's son.  But I also think about what Scouting meant as a molder of my character.   Mr. Speaker, that is not what originally drew me to Scouting. I was  originally drawn to the fun of it, to the high adventure, to the  camping trips, to those Capture the Flag games that went on to the wee  hours of the morning. Little did I know how long one could actually  hunt for a snipe back in the early days of my Scouting career. And so I  was drawn to Indian lore and canoeing and camping, and that was so  exciting to me.   So when I think about my Scouting career, Mr. Speaker, I think about,  you know, the fun I had. I think about the friendships. There are  people I haven't seen for decades, but, you know, I think about a  friend by the name of Dennis Gary, whom I haven't seen in decades. But  if I saw him tomorrow, I would know him because I would know him  through his heart, because we experienced Scouting together, and so  many others.   I think about the many practical things I learned in my Scouting  career. I hope I never fall into a hole and break an arm, but if I did,  even today at my ripe old age, I could still tie a one-handed bowline.  I still know how to do that.   I hope I am never lost in the forest for days on end, but, you know,  Mr. Speaker, I know that, as distasteful as it would be, I could  survive off of cattail root and dandelion leaves because that is what  Scouting taught me.   So Scouting is about fun; it is about friendship; but it was about  practical things that I learned. Mr. Speaker, there is even a far more  important aspect to Scouting, and that is values, the values that we  learned.   So even today, as a Member of Congress, I know how important it is to  be prepared, to be prepared before I come to this House floor and try  to convince fellow Members of this august body on actions that we  should take in the life of a great nation.   As we deal with so many issues about the lives of a great nation, I  also remember, for example, somebody who wasn't in the Boy Scouts--my  wife. I know back in Dallas, Texas, almost every week of her life she  is driving some indigent cancer patient to their treatments.   I reflected that, although as Members of Congress we deal with  matters of great importance that impact millions and millions of  people, I have got to tell you, my wife, back in Dallas, Texas, does a  good turn daily. It reminds me that I learned in Scouting how important  it is to help one human life at a time and to do a good turn daily.   When I look upon my colleagues here in Congress today, I think about  a certain colleague, and I am not going to mention his name, but a  colleague who at one time wasn't quite keeping up with his diet. He  wasn't quite keeping up with his exercise. Although he had young  children, he had a heart attack, and we almost lost this colleague, but  he came back. It is a reminder how important it is to keep ourselves  physically strong for our children, for our parents, for our  colleagues, and for our friends. That is something I learned in  Scouting, Mr. Speaker.   I think about another friend whose wife almost was lost when she was  diagnosed with a very serious form of cancer, stage IV. But there was  an oncologist here in this area, in the Washington area, who was on the  cutting edge of cancer research that saved her life, and she was--the  percentages against her, there was a 99 percent chance she wouldn't  make it, but she did because somebody decided to be mentally awake.  That is something else I learned in Scouting, Mr. Speaker, how  important it is to be mentally awake.   And one day, when I leave this institution, some of the finest people  I have ever met in life I know will have served in the United States of  House of Representatives, but, unfortunately, a couple of them  represent the worst. A couple of them have turned in their pin stripes  for prison stripes because somehow they lost their way.   In Scouting, we are taught to orient a map with a physical compass,  but we are also taught to orient the map of life with a moral compass.  So I learned in Scouting how important it was to be morally straight,  to have that internal compass to guide us at all times.   So I will admit, I am not proud of the fact, Mr. Speaker, but you  know what? The words, over the years, occasionally they are a little  rusty to me. I don't quite recite them as I once did. I don't always  recite the words: ``On my honor, I will do my best to do my duty to my  God and my country, to obey the Scout Law, to help others at all times,  to keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and morally  straight.''   So, yes, Mr. Speaker, occasionally the words are a little rusty, but  the principles are as alive to me today as they were almost half a  century ago when I first entered Scouting and followed that career all  the way up to Eagle Scout, something I am so, so very proud of today.   So, Mr. Speaker, I hope anybody who is watching the proceedings at  this time will, again, understand how valuable Scouting is to all of  us. It is not just important to my own personal life. It is important  to the life of a great nation.   Our first President, the Father of our Country, said that you cannot  have a free society which is not a moral society. Scouting helps make  certain we have a moral society.                                time  1815    So I think of the fun, I think of the friendship, I think of the  lessons, but, most importantly, I think about that moral compass for  the map of life that has guided me and, with Scouting to come in the  future, will guide the life of this great Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Dallas for his leadership, I  thank him for his friendship, I thank him for all he means for  Scouting, and I thank him for yielding to me.
