 Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend,  Mr. Walberg, and appreciate his leadership on this issue and also, the  bipartisanship that is being shown to the American people today to  address an issue that is important--to Ranking Member Foxx, too--to our  communities.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6087 because of what has  been said. The positive impact that this bill can have within our  medical communities, and giving Americans access to the healthcare that  they deserve is something that deserves all of our support.   This bill would include physician assistants and nurse practitioners  in the Federal workers' compensation program and put them in line with  the State scope of practice. It is also going to improve access to care  for injured Federal workers and postal employers, especially in the  areas that I serve--in rural and underserved areas--like central and  southwestern Illinois.   Getting people back to work as soon as they can once they recover  from an injury is now more important than ever given the record  inflation we are seeing and the staggering 11.4 million open jobs in  this country.   This is a commonsense piece of legislation. I am glad to support the  work  [[Page H5248]]  of my friend, Congressman Tim Walberg, on this bill to ensure that  injured Federal employees return to the workforce quickly.   Madam Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on  this important bill.
