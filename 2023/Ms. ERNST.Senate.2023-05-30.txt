 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Iowa small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize  Swenson's Do it Best Hardware of Britt, IA, as the Senate Small  Business of the Week.   In 1977, 21-year-old Jon Swenson purchased the then-named Kreitinger  Hardware in downtown Britt. The store was renamed Swenson's Do it Best  Hardware and has been family-owned and operated ever since. They offer  both home and outdoor tools and supplies, including rental power tool  equipment. They can also provide pipe cutting, key cutting, and window  or screen repair services in the shop. Swenson's Do it Best Hardware  has an ``online warehouse'' of over 67,000 items and is a one-stop shop  for all home improvement needs. In 2022, Swenson's Do it Best Hardware  celebrated their 45th anniversary.   The team at Swenson's Do it Best Hardware is active in the Britt  community. Jon Swenson has been a volunteer firefighter in the Britt  Fire Department since 1978 and was named the fire chief in 2015.  Additionally, and since 1974, Jon has filmed the football games at the  West Hancock High School. Swenson's Do it Best Hardware has also been a  sponsor of the high school's events and activities. In 2022, when  RAGBRAI had a stop in Britt and Swenson's Do it Best Hardware's  downtown storefront was used for photo opportunities for riders and  tourists. They also provided a device charging station for the 2022  racers. They have also participated in Britt Chamber of Commerce events  to support the local small business community.   Swenson's Do it Best Hardware's commitment to providing quality  tools, equipment rentals, and repair services in northern Iowa is  clear. I want to congratulate Jon Swenson and the entire team at  Swenson's Do it Best Hardware for their continued dedication to  providing home improvement supplies to Iowans. I look forward to seeing  their continued growth and success in Iowa.                            ____________________
