 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the  service of Ellen Welch, a crime scene specialist in Morgan County and  founder of the Hero Tree.   Ellen has exhibited an unwavering commitment to Morgan County's law  enforcement as she works as a crime scene specialist and investigator.   Each year, during the holiday season, Ellen takes on the role of  lifting up the community's fallen law enforcement officers and K9s.  2021 has marked the third year that Ellen has spearheaded this service  to the community, and it continues to grow.   Every year, Ellen, her mom, and her niece paint each ornament and  write the name, death date, and agency of each fallen officer. Then  they place the ornaments on a tree that stands in the Morgan County  squad room until January.   Unfortunately, this year was especially hard on law enforcement.  Ellen had to get a much larger tree as violence against police officers  spiked.   Ellen has exhibited a selfless commitment to our police officers, and  for that, we are very grateful. I thank Ellen for what she does and  encourage her to keep it up.                           Recognizing Ava Dorminey     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize an  extraordinary student in my district, Ava Dorminey, for her work  building the Students Helping Students Succeed mentorship program.   Now a senior at Savannah Arts Academy, Ava founded the SHSS  mentorship program in her junior year to help struggling students.   The COVID-19 pandemic and related school closures, which proved  difficult for many students, are what prompted Ava to take action. Her  desire to help students' mental health and academic success culminated  in the creation of the Students Helping Students Succeed mentorship  program. Ava wanted to assist her fellow students while also working to  instill essential qualities like confidence, teamwork, and leadership  in our youth.   Her work has been instrumental in helping students through these  trying times. I am extremely proud to represent a district where young  people's work, like Ava's, is on display for the whole Nation to see.   She inspires me and gives me even more confidence in our future, and  I want to thank her for the work she is doing in our community.    I hope Ava's story and work inspire other young people to find an  avenue that can help their communities be successful as well.                        Congratulating Rincon, Georgia     Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  Rincon, Georgia, for being recognized as one of 24/7 Wall Street's best  cities to live in, in the South.   Rincon is a gem of a town in the First District that is well  deserving of this recognition. Its population growth, high median  household income, and low unemployment rate are just some of the  features that caught the attention of 24/7 Wall Street, an independent  news organization that ranks cities based on affordability, quality of  life, economy, and community.   Incorporated as a city in 1927, Rincon has a rich history as a rail  town in the 1800s. When World War II came to America, Rincon, like the  rest of the First District, answered the call to arms. Due to its  proximity to Savannah, Rincon citizens were instrumental in the  construction of U.S. Liberty ships.   Since then, the city has continued to grow and flourish into what it  is today. I know the citizens of Rincon, Georgia, and myself are proud  of this recognition.   As someone whose grandparents lived in Rincon, I was in Rincon most  Sundays every week as a young man. I can tell you how proud I am of the  city of Rincon and Effingham County and the tremendous growth they have  seen while still maintaining a great quality of life.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding and for hosting this Special Order.   Madam Speaker, Joe Biden's first year in office has exceeded all  expectations. In 365 short days, Joe Biden has managed to inflict an  entire term of pain and hardship on the American people. Grocery store  shelves are empty. Prices are up 7 percent nationwide. Gas costs $1  more per gallon today than it did when Biden took office. Americans  lost the equivalent of two paychecks last year, and Biden has failed to  add one single job from our 2019 high.   Madam Speaker, only one thing has gone down in price during this  administration, and that is the price of fentanyl. That is the price of  fentanyl because of the fentanyl that is coming across the southern  border.   Washington Democrats were counting on Joe Biden to socialize our  economy, and, boy, did he deliver. His administration caved to teachers  unions, putting the wants of liberal elites ahead of the needs of our  children who are desperate for high quality, in-person learning.   Domestic terrorists--that is how this administration labeled parents  who want better for their children than virtual learning. It is  despicable.   He caved to Russia, gutting the Keystone XL pipeline on his first day  in office but allowing the Nord Stream 2 pipeline to push ahead  virtually unchecked.   He caved to Fauci, who kept his job despite lying to Congress about  gain-of-function research.   Do you know who isn't caving, Madam Speaker?   Senator Manchin, the Supreme Court, and Republicans across the Nation  who are fed up with this administration's singular focus on stripping  rights and opportunities away from Americans. This administration has  more than earned its 33 percent approval rating, and I hope, for the  sake of our country, that the next 3 years are nothing like the one we  have just endured.                                time  1500
