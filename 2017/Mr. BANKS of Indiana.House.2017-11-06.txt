 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Roe for his hard work  on behalf of our veterans as chairman of the House Veterans' Affairs  Committee. I am very proud to serve on that committee under his  leadership.   Mr. Speaker, because our veterans answered the call and served our  country, we, in turn, must serve them and their families.   This commitment extends to assisting them in medical recovery, in  successfully transitioning to the civilian workforce, and, just as  importantly, in properly memorializing their lives when they are gone.   Current law provides memorial headstones for veterans and for their  spouses and children when the remains of the deceased cannot be found.  This can occur in unfortunate cases, such as a boating or a plane  accident.   Public Law 105-368 provides headstones for spouses, and it was  enacted in 1998. Public Law 109-461 provides headstones for dependent  children, and it was enacted in 2006. Both groups are eligible for this  benefit as of the date of enactment. However, as has already been said,  it is unfortunate that these two laws did not go into effect at the  same time, potentially opening the door for a parent to receive this  benefit, but not a child.   Mr. Speaker, my bill, H.R. 3656, would amend title 38 of the United  States Code to provide for a consistent eligibility date for spouses  and dependent children. The date for both would be set at the current  date for spouses: November 11, 1998.   This bill is especially necessary for the few tragic cases in which a  spouse and a dependent child both passed away in the same accident  during a period when these two laws were not in sync. We need to  correct this situation.   My legislation is a practical fix to take care of our veterans and  their families, and to keep our commitment to them. Therefore, I ask my  colleagues to support the passage of H.R. 3656.
