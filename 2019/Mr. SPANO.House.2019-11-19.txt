 Madam Speaker, I rise to highlight H.R. 5169, the TRICARE  Fairness for National Guard and Reserve Retirees Act that I introduced  with Representative Gabbard earlier today.   This bipartisan bill aligns the eligibility age for TRICARE Standard,  Extra, and Prime, which are the healthcare programs for uniformed  servicemembers, retirees, and their families, with the age at which  National Guard and Reserve personnel begin receiving their retired pay.   We have heavily relied upon our National Guard and Reserve personnel  for the past 20 years, and they have made major contributions to our  force structure for over 200 years.   Congress previously recognized their sacrifices by lowering the age  that they can receive their retired pay based on their Active Duty  service, but it is not fair that their eligibility for traditional  TRICARE was left at age 60. This has resulted in early retirees often  spending the vast majority, if not all, of their pension on TRICARE  premiums until they reach 60.   This bill will help these servicemembers transition into retirement  as intended when Congress reduced their retirement age. I urge my  colleagues to support this important legislation.                            ____________________
