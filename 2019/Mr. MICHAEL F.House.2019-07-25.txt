 DOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, we didn't want to  let the August recess go by without giving our annual report on the  Congressional Baseball Game for Charity. I know you have been waiting  for this moment, Mr. Speaker.   Once again, over 20,000 people came to Nationals Park to watch an  exciting game of baseball between the Democrats and the Republicans. It  was a rowdy crowd at Nationals Park. It was an exciting, action-packed  game.   I am happy to report to the House of Representatives that, once  again, the Democrats won the game 14-7.   I want to commend the Republican team. They played a very competitive  game. They have got some new players. They are playing with a lot more  resolve, and we look forward to competitive matches with them in the  future.   Our MVP this year was Cedric Richmond, who pitched a complete game,  and we had a record number of freshman Members playing on the team this  year. In addition, we had two outstanding women on the team, Linda  Sanchez and Nanette Barragan, who added much to the team.   So, in the end, Mr. Speaker, the real winners of this game are the  charities. The game this year raised a little shy of $1.3 million for  the charities. So it was a good cause and good camaraderie.   I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, that those of us on the Democratic team  genuinely like our colleagues on the Republican baseball team. We get  along great together. We have a lot of fun. We practice hard, and we  play our hearts out to give the crowd a good game and raise money for  the charity.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Williams), the  Republican manager.
