 Mr. President, for the past dozen years, the International  Commission against Impunity in Guatemala, with financial support from  the United States and other countries, has worked in collaboration with  Guatemala's Public Ministry. That partnership has enabled courageous  Guatemalan prosecutors to investigate and bring to trial cases they  never could have pursued without the international ``shield'' and  assistance provided by CICIG. It has also enabled courageous  constitutional court magistrates to defend Guatemala's weak judicial  institutions. In a country where throughout its history high-ranking  public officials, including senior military officers, and corporate  elites have enjoyed near total impunity for corrupt acts and violent  crimes, the Guatemalan people finally saw that justice is possible.   Not surprisingly, that collaboration encountered fierce opposition  from its inception. The same high-ranking officials and elites who  feared becoming the targets of corruption investigations sought to  curtail CICIG's role. Last year, that opposition culminated in  President Morales expelling the CICIG commissioner and subsequently  announcing that the agreement establishing CICIG would be terminated,  effective immediately. That announcement was made, without warning,  after months of negotiations between Guatemalan, UN, and U.S. officials  on reforms requested by the Morales government, which would have  established the position of Deputy Commissioner as well as certain  reporting and oversight requirements.   In response to that announcement, as well as other worrisome trends  in Guatemala, last week Senator Cardin and I, along with  Representatives Torres and McGovern, introduced legislation in the  Senate and House entitled the ``Guatemala Rule of Law Accountability  Act.'' Its purpose is to respond to the flagrant actions by the Morales  government to subvert the rule of law, including its campaign against  CICIG.   In fact, the Morales government lacks authority to unilaterally  curtail an agreement with the United Nations, a point that was made  clear by the UN Secretary General. CICIG's mandate continues in effect  until September 2019, at which point it may or may not be renewed.  However, I am concerned that there are some, including at the UN, who  believe CICIG should significantly reduce its activities and, for all  intents and purposes, fade into the sunset. This would mean that, for  the remaining 6 months of its current mandate, CICIG personnel would no  longer attend trials or engage in further investigations. Essentially,  CICIG would discontinue its public activities and its personnel would  be limited to preparing for the shutdown that would presumably occur in  September.   This is extremely worrisome for several reasons. First, donors would  be paying to simply keep the lights on. Second, CICIG would cease to  function half a year before the end of its mandate. This would be an  enormous waste of time and resources that could be used to continue  pursuing important cases and to ensure their proper hand-off to the  public ministry. Third, it would send a terrible message to the  Guatemalan people, especially to the families of the victims.   CICIG's work under Commissioner Ivan Velazquez has been important not  only for Guatemala, but for all of Central America. There are still  many cases under investigation. Abandoning these cases would be a grave  mistake. It would signal that the Morales government's tactics of  intimidation and obstruction of justice paid off. It would undermine  future anticorruption efforts in Guatemala, as well as send a terrible  message to anticorruption effort's in Honduras and fledgling efforts in  El Salvador. The United Nations and the international community have a  responsibility to do everything possible to prevent this result.   On a related topic, the Guatemalan Congress is about to debate, for  the third and final time, legislation to grant amnesty to former  military personnel who are charged with or convicted of war crimes and  crimes against humanity. If the amnesty legislation is approved, those  serving prison sentences will reportedly be released within 24 hours.  The Guatemalan Congress has long had a reputation for being corrupt,  and absolving military officers who engaged in heinous crimes is  clearly a payoff to obstruct justice and undermine the rule of law.   We remember that Guatemala was ravaged by three decades of an  internal armed conflict that included crimes of genocide. An estimated  200,000 people, mostly rural Mayan villagers, were killed, and,  according to the United Nations, more than 90 percent of those killings  were committed by the army. The peace accords that ended that disaster  were never implemented, and for decades, the victims of those crimes  were denied justice. Now the Guatemalan Congress, with the support of  President Morales, is on the verge of adding insult to injury by  freeing the few army officers who were sent to prison. If that happens,  the Guatemalan Government will join other pariah governments that fail  to uphold their most sacred obligation to provide security and justice  for their citizens.                            ____________________     Mr. President, it has been more than 5 months since  journalist and American resident Jamal Khashoggi was tortured and  murdered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. More than 5 months  since the Saudi Government initially denied it had anything to do with  Mr. Khashoggi's disappearance and told the world, in a calculated and  quickly disproven lie, that he left the consulate unharmed.   As the Saudi Government's complicity became clear, its explanations  became even more convoluted. We were told to accept that the operation  that resulted in Mr. Khashoggi's death was an interrogation gone wrong,  carried out by rogue agents who somehow flew to Istanbul, executed Mr.  Khashoggi, and worked with a local collaborator to cover up the crime,  all, despite their ties to the highest levels of government, without  the knowledge of the Crown Prince. Although Senators--Republicans and  Democrats--who have been briefed on the matter found that possibility  preposterous, President Trump and Secretary Pompeo seemed ready to  accept the Saudi Government's lies.   The truth is that, while there is a mountain of information  circulating in the press that suggests the Crown Prince was involved in  the planning and approval of the assassination of Mr. Khashoggi, there  are still many unanswered questions.  [[Page S1838]]    We know the Saudi Government identified certain Saudi officials who  allegedly carried out this murder, but we do not know how they were  identified, what these officials were asked, by whom, and what they  have said about the crime, or why some of them were brought to trial  and others were not.   We know that the Trump administration sanctioned 17 Saudi officials,  but we have not been told to what extent or why these individuals were  targeted for sanctions and others were not. We know that there was a  local collaborator, but we have not been told his nationality or  identity, nor the whereabouts of Mr. Khashoggi's body, which has not  been returned to his family.   What do we know? We know that the Saudi Government--the royal  family--is sticking to the latest version of its story, absolving  itself of any culpability. The Trump administration maintains, despite  many mixed signals, that it is doing everything in its power to ensure  Mr. Khashoggi's murderers are held accountable for their actions.   If that is true, we would expect the administration to be transparent  and to cooperate with the Congress.   But while I would like to be persuaded of their commitment to  pursuing justice in this case, their efforts to date have been anything  but convincing. On October 10, 2018, Senators Corker, Menendez, Graham,  and I, along with a majority of the members of the Foreign Relations  Committee, sent a letter to the President to trigger a 120-day review  and determination on the imposition of sanctions pursuant to the Global  Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act with respect to any foreign  person involved in the murder of Mr. Khashoggi. The response of the  administration has been to ignore the legal requirement to make that  determination. This is only the latest attempt by the administration to  obstruct the Congress's access to information about this crime.   Rather than ignoring its legal obligations and keeping Congress in  the dark, the administration should be working with Congress and the  international community, to expose the truth about who gave the orders  to kill Mr. Khashoggi. If the administration has nothing to hide, then  they have nothing to lose and everything to gain by being part of the  effort to see justice done.   One way for the administration to prove it is serious about  accountability is to fully cooperate with the UN Special Rapporteur on  extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, who is reviewing the  evidence in the Khashoggi case. The White House, the State Department,  and our intelligence agencies should promptly provide her with any  relevant information in their possession.   As I stated on February 3, 2019, if the President continues to take  actions such as ignoring the clear mandate of the Magnitsky Act or  otherwise refuses to cooperate with the investigations of this murder,  the White House will share the blame for attempting to cover up the  crime and for helping those responsible to evade justice.   The administration should also urge the Saudi Government to guarantee  a fair and public trial for the men accused of being involved in the  killing of Mr. Khashoggi, that meets international standards of due  process. A trial that fails to disclose all of the facts--a trial that  is rushed and secretive--will be seen as simply further obstruction of  justice. Real accountability must occur in this case.   We know all too well that Mr. Khashoggi's murder is only one example  of the brutal way in which the Saudi Government, led by the Crown  Prince, treats anyone it perceives as a threat, which means anyone who  dares criticize the government or who advocates for human rights.   Since May 2018, prominent women's rights advocates have been  imprisoned and tortured by the Saudi Government or banned from  traveling, without any criminal charges being brought--women like 25- year-old Loujain al-Hathloul, who had a driver's license from the  United Arab Emirates and advocated for the right of Saudi women to  drive, but was arrested in a sweeping crackdown on women's activists  just before the Saudi Government lifted the ban on female drivers. Dr.  Hatoon al-Fassi, another women's rights advocate and a history  professor, was arrested in June 2018 and remains confined to this day.  While these women have not been charged, their so-called crime is  obvious: engaging in independent activism. The royal family will do  whatever it takes to make clear that they alone can create change in  Saudi Arabia.   That is why, like these women, anyone of influence, including average  citizens who advocate for reforms, is at risk in Saudi Arabia. It is  not only opposition that the Crown Prince fears, it is the appearance  of capitulation to ordinary citizens that he seeks to avoid by cracking  down on those who are merely advocating for reforms he himself claims  to support. His repression has touched every segment of society, from  journalists to women's rights advocates to economists like Dr. Essam  al-Zamil, who was detained in September 2017, presumably due to his  opposition to the Crown Prince's economics plan, and Mohammad Fahad al- Qahtani, an economics professor and human rights activist who was  sentenced in 2013 to 10 years in prison for breaking allegiance with  the royal family and defaming the judiciary.   Sometimes the motivation behind the Crown Prince's actions is a  complete mystery. One egregious case is that of Dr. Walid Fitaihi, a  U.S. citizen who earned his medical degree from George Washington  University and a master's degree in public health from Harvard  University. Dr. Fitaihi was seized by Saudi authorities for unknown  reasons in November 2017. He has reportedly been severely tortured, and  he remains in prison. In fact, before Mr. Khashoggi was murdered, he  wrote about Dr. Fitaihi's detention on social media to decry the  arbitrary and repressive trends developing under the Crown Prince's  rule. Like Jamal Khashoggi, there is not a shred of evidence that Dr.  Fitaihi is guilty of anything. He should be released immediately. I ask  unanimous consent that a copy of the March 4, 2019, editorial in the  Washington Post, entitled, ``Saudi Arabia is torturing a U.S. citizen.  When will Trump Act?'' which highlights Mr. Fitaihi's case, be printed  in the Record following my remarks.   These cases are only a fraction of the known examples of the Crown  Prince's repression. There are countless others that don't escape the  royal family's tight control of information in the country. This is the  so-called reformer we are told to put our trust in to help lead Saudi  Arabia into the future. As others in this body have said, he is no  reformer; he is an impulsive, ruthless gangster. It would be naive not  to think that the Crown Prince's actions will lead to greater public  resentment and instability in Saudi Arabia and jeopardize our long-term  interests in the region. Contrary to the thinking of the White House,  no amount of arms sales and no amount of oil can change that reality.   I urge all Senators to join me in urging the White House and in  supporting legislative action as appropriate to protect our national  interests by ensuring that United States relations with Saudi Arabia  are guided, first and foremost, by our principles and, most  importantly, by our commitment to the rule of law.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the Washington Post, Mar. 4, 2019]       Saudi Arabia Is Torturing a U.S. Citizen. When Will Trump Act?                            (By Editorial Board)         Before he was murdered inside a Saudi Consulate in October,       our colleague Jamal Khashoggi questioned why Saudi Arabia had       detained a prominent doctor, Walid Fitaihi, a dual Saudi-U.S.       citizen seized in a November 2017 roundup of businessmen. The       detainees, in what was described as an anti-corruption drive,       were held at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh. ``What       happened to us?'' Khashoggi, himself a Saudi, asked on       Twitter. ``How can a person like @Walidfitaihi get arrested,       and for what reason?'' He added, ``With no interceding       channels to pursue & no Attorney General to answer questions       & verify charges, of course everyone is struck with awe and       helplessness.''        Today, Khashoggi is no longer able to ask such impertinent       questions. He was assassinated in Istanbul by a hit squad       that intelligence reports say was dispatched by the Saudi       crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. But Khashoggi's question       remains relevant. Mr. Fitaihi, founder of a medical center in       Jeddah, is still a captive. It is not known precisely why,       and he has never been charged, although the New York Times       quoted a friend saying he was being pressured to give       evidence against a relative.        He has been tortured during his captivity. He was       reportedly grabbed from his room at  [[Page S1839]]       the Ritz, slapped, blindfolded, stripped to his underwear,       bound to a chair, shocked with electricity and whipped so       severely that he could not sleep on his back for days. The       Times said his lawyer has written to the State Department       that the doctor ``is in fear for his life, that he cannot       take his situation any longer, and that he desires all       possible help.'' The Associated Press quoted the lawyer as       saying Mr. Fitaihi is now in a prison hospital after       suffering ``an emotional breakdown.'' Mr. Fitaihi earned his       medical degree from George Washington University and holds a       master's degree in public health from Harvard University.        On another front in Mohammed bin Salman's drive to crush       critical voices, Saudi Arabia's public prosecutor announced       charges Friday against a group of female activists who       campaigned to give women the right to drive--a right that       Mohammed bin Salman conferred after they sought it. The       activists have been jailed for nearly a year, during which       Amnesty International says they have been tortured and       sexually abused. They did nothing wrong and should be       released unconditionally and immediately.        In the New York Times Magazine on Sunday, Secretary of       State Mike Pompeo, asked about the crown prince's role in the       Khashoggi murder, declared that the United States would       ``hold everyone that we determine is responsible for this       accountable in an appropriate way, a way that reflects the       best of the United States of America.''        A doctor with U.S. citizenship was tortured and held       without charge. Women who stood for human dignity and       equality were jailed and tortured. A journalist was killed.       Yet President Trump and his administration--including his       son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who last week met with the crown       prince--are loath to act. That does not reflect the best of       the United States of America.                            ____________________
