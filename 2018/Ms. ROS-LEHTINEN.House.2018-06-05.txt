 Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate Pride Month, I would  like to congratulate SAVE, S-A-V-E, an organization in my congressional  district that works around the clock to promote, protect, and defend  LGBTQ equality.   For many years, I have been proud to partner with SAVE to create  much-needed public understanding of gender identity and, hence, foster  an even more inclusive south Florida community.   This Friday, June 8, this wonderful organization will host its 25th  anniversary gala, where it will honor the 2018 equality champions:  Miami Beach Police Chief Daniel Oates and the head of business  operations of our very own Miami Heat, Eric Woolworth.   It is because of groups like SAVE, champions like Daniel and Eric,  and committed individuals throughout our communities that we will  guarantee that our American values of freedom and opportunity are  shared by all.   So, thank you, Daniel and Eric; and thank you to my pal and SAVE's  Executive Director, Tony Lima, and to the entire SAVE team for all that  you do to promote LGBTQ inclusion and make our slice of paradise in  south Florida an even better place in which to live.                            ____________________
