 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Jessica  Klymchuk.   Jessica was the mother of three daughters and one son. She was an  educational assistant, bus driver, and librarian at St. Stephen's  School in Valleyview, Alberta, Canada, for 4 years.   She went to the Route 91 festival in Las Vegas on October 1 with her  fiance, Brent. The couple had recently been engaged and looked forward  to their wedding.   Jessica always put her family first and loved camping with them. She  is remembered for being a loving woman who always worked hard and  dedicated her life to her children.   I would like to extend my condolences to Jessica's family and  friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada,  and the whole country grieve with you.                            ____________________
