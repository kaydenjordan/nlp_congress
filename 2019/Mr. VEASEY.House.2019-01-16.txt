 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of my dear  friend, Dionne Phillips Bagsby.   Dionne was a very strong leader in the Fort Worth community. She  served as a role model to so many people, including myself, and she  really was driven by her work to desegregate the Fort Worth schools  when she first came to Fort Worth. That really spurred her to run for  the county commissioner's seat in precinct one in 1988.   When she ran, she became the first woman and the first African  American to become a Tarrant County commissioner. She did a tremendous  job for Tarrant County and the city of Fort Worth.   Throughout her 16-year tenure, Dionne fought to improve public  education and increase access to health resources for women and  children. Her former precinct administrator, who is now the county  commissioner, Roy Charles Brooks, said it best when he said that Dionne  was not a politician, she was a public servant.   In 2005, I was proud to be a part of the Texas Legislature and honor  her for a lifetime of service.   Again, she was a mentor and mentored so many young women throughout  Fort Worth who sought to replicate her success. She helped them aspire  to careers that would challenge the norm. She always encouraged those  young women to never give up. Dionne broke barriers for the African  American community, for women, for the disadvantaged, for the disabled,  and for so many others, including myself.   Mr. Speaker, I will tell you and will be honest with you, if you ever  met Dionne, you will know that she was very much into straight talk.  She did not mince words, and she always cut right to the chase. But I  will also tell you, as I mentioned before, that Dionne was a tremendous  mentor.   When I was elected to the State Legislature in 2004, Dionne was the  first person to call me up, and we went and had lunch. When I got  married later, she called my wife and me up, and we went and had lunch  with her. When I came to Congress and was elected in 2012, she was one  of the first people to call me up, and she; Lorraine Miller, who was a  former Clerk of the House here; my wife; and I all went and had dinner.  She was more than happy to dispense good advice that was very, very  helpful to me.   Mr. Speaker, Dionne was also very instrumental in bringing a lot of  firsts to Fort Worth. I mentioned her work with the schools, her being  the first Black and first woman on the county commissioners court. But  her legacy still lives today through The Links. She was one of the  legacy members of The Links in Fort Worth. The Greater Fort Worth Area  Negro Business and Professional Women's Club, she got a national  charter for that venerable organization and had the first meeting in  her living room in southeast Fort Worth.   Mr. Speaker, if you ever went to any of Dionne's receptions while she  was still in office between that 1988 and 2005 time period, you will  know that one of the things that she liked to do was give shout-outs.  She gave shout-outs to everybody from people in her family to the  person who was her trainer.   I am going to give a shout-out to some of her family members and  special friends today--and everybody back home, please forgive me if I  have left out anyone--her daughter, Dionne Anne Jones; her son, Jimmy  Bagsby; her husband who preceded her in death who was also on the Fort  Worth City Council, Jim Bagsby; her grandchildren, Kirbe, Josiah,  Kelli, and Elijah; and her brother, Paul Phillips.   She had so many friends whom she would like to give shout-outs to,  including one who preceded her in death, Dr. Erma Johnson Hadley, her  dear friend; Norma Roby; Bob Sanders; Jesse Gaines; again, Lorraine  Miller; Gwendolyn Morrison; Viney Chandler; and, again, County  Commissioner Roy Charles Brooks, who was also someone Dionne mentored  and who was her precinct administrator before he became county  commissioner. He also was a very, very dear friend.   We lost a giant in Fort Worth by losing Dionne. She will be missed  because she was a friend to so many and always had so many colorful,  wonderful, and humorous things to say. But I can tell you that our city  is better off and our county is better off because Dionne Bagsby moved  to Fort Worth with her husband and helped make it a better place for  everybody.                            ____________________
