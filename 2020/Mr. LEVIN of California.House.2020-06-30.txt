 Mr. Speaker, as a freshman Member of  Congress, it has been an honor and a privilege to get to serve on the  Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, and I am so grateful for that  opportunity. I commend Speaker Pelosi and Chair Castor for their  outstanding leadership.   Long before I pursued public office, I was a proud clean energy  advocate, and I knew then, as I know now, that solutions to the climate  crisis could also be solutions to many economic challenges we face.   We have seen that come true in my home State of California where we  have embraced ambitious measures to combat climate change and have seen  strong economic growth, particularly in the clean energy sector.   Last year, California supported more than half a million clean energy  jobs in areas such as energy efficiency, renewable energy, and clean  vehicles. Through 2019 job growth was nearly 10 percent annually.   Clean energy technology, clean domestic manufacturing, and  environmental restoration is already putting Americans to work.   Our report highlights a number of ways that we can combat the climate  crisis and create more jobs at the same time. For example, the report  includes bipartisan legislation I introduced to reduce our dependence  on fossil fuels by promoting environmentally responsible development of  renewable energy on public lands.   We can expand those technologies and grow our economy by extending  important tax credits like the solar investment tax credit which drives  job creation, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and helps level the  playing field for clean energy. We will also create jobs with strong  Federal funding for infrastructure, investments in new and retooled  domestic manufacturing facilities, new buy clean procurement rules,  expanded loan opportunities for decarbonization technologies, and the  creation of a civilian conservation corps and a climate resilience  service corps.   Alternatively, if we fail to act, we will allow other countries to  take the lead on developing clean technologies. China, India, and  nations in Europe will reap the economic rewards, and we will find  ourselves purchasing foreign products that should have been made right  here in America.   Some might take issue with the perceived cost of climate action, but  it is also important to note the cost of inaction. My friend, Marshall  Burke, a researcher at Stanford University, has studied this  extensively and found that if we don't take substantial action to  mitigate the climate crisis, it will cost the U.S. economy $25 to $35  trillion over the coming decades.   That is why we must act. I have a 6-year-old and an 8-year-old at  home, and, like any parent, there is a lot that I worry about for their  future; but I am most concerned about the planet that we are going to  leave behind for them and for their children. The path we are on right  now leads to a grim future for our planet. Our report charts a new  hopeful course for the future.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues and the outstanding staff who made  this report possible. Now let's get to work.                            ____________________
