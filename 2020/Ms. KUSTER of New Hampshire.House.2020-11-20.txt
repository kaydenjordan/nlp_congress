 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my  colleagues and leadership in Congress to reach a compromise and pass  much-needed relief as our country continues to respond to the COVID-19  pandemic.   The dramatic rise in cases and deaths are alarming and require a  strong and urgent response from the Federal Government to continue  supporting our local response across this country.   We must extend critical unemployment assistance to the thousands of  Granite Staters who have lost their jobs and will see their benefits  expire the day after Christmas.   We must provide relief for our State and local governments that have  spent millions of dollars responding to this pandemic and are facing  devastating budget shortfalls when the legislature reconvenes in  January.   Small businesses, especially restaurants, continue to face the  negative economic consequences of this pandemic, and Congress must  renew critical portions of the bipartisan CARES Act that served as a  lifeline for our business community.   The House has already passed two comprehensive pieces of legislation,  and I was proud to support these bills. We need to see real action and  leadership from the Senate and the outgoing Trump administration to get  the job done.                            ____________________
