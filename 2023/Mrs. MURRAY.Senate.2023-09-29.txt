 Mr. President, yesterday, the senior Senator from  California came onto the floor through those doors to do her job. She  voted. She voted to make sure that our country would continue to move  forward and not shut down. That was Dianne. She did her job every day.  She cared about her country. She cared about her State. She cared about  doing a job, no matter how tough it is, for the future of America, and  she did it with dignity and respect every single minute.   Today, you will hear accolades from across the country, lists of  legislative accomplishments from her early days, all the way through  her career. What I just want to say today: It is a true loss to  America. It is a loss to her family.   My heart is with you.   It is a loss to her colleagues from California who have served with  her and know her as I do--as a tower of strength--to our colleagues on  the floor who have worked with her on a laundry list of legislation  that you will hear about and is way too long to list today.   But, to her constituents, you need to know we depended on her just as  you did, and she was here every day to fight for you, no matter what.  She fought for women. She fought for those who were victims of gun  violence. She fought for foreign policy that was remote to most people,  but she knew every detail. And when Dianne spoke, the rest of us  stopped and we listened.   Mr. President, she was a friend. I was sworn into office just a few  weeks after she was, and she was always there for us, in matters big  and small, in matters of our country, in matters of policy, and always  as a friend.   To those of you who don't know, she was the most generous Senator I  have ever known. I remember one time when I noticed that her purse was  really nice, and I said: Dianne, that purse is beautiful.   Two days later, I got one delivered to my door. That was Dianne. She  saw people. She knew people. She saw that she could be someone whom we  all needed, and she saw that she could be there when she was needed-- and she was there.   I will have more to say about my friend of more than 30 years over  the next few days, and I am sure we will hear so much today. But I am  so sorry I didn't hug her when she went back out that door yesterday.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, as I have  said, I share my colleague's concern with making sure that our  servicemembers do not miss a paycheck because of a potential government  shutdown. In fact, I do not want any of our Federal workers to miss a  paycheck, whether they are cancer researchers whose work saves our  lives or brave firefighters who risk their lives for us, and I don't  want any programs families rely on to be undermined: counseling and  transition assistance for new veterans adjusting to civilian life,  nutrition assistance for 7 million moms and kids who need a hand up.  And that includes our servicemembers' families.   Several years ago, I worked to save a WIC clinic which was going to  be kicked off a Navy base in my home State of Washington that hundreds  of military families counted on. None of those paychecks for any of  these workers and none of those programs should shutter because of a  completely unnecessary shutdown, which is why I am working around the  clock with the majority of our colleagues to make sure that we do pass  a bipartisan CR, which we released this week, because that is the only  serious solution here. That is the only way that we will make sure  everyone is able to keep doing the work that the American people count  on and getting that paycheck that they do deserve.   If the Senator from Alaska or the Senator from Texas are serious  about making sure our servicemembers get paid, I hope they will get  serious in a way that matters the most, and that is their votes. I hope  they will work with us to keep the government open. And I hope they  will reconsider their recent votes against the CR to fund the  government in a bipartisan and timely way.   Let's be real. You cannot grandstand about wanting to make sure that  servicemembers get paid during a shutdown and then vote against the  very bipartisan bill that prevented a shutdown.   I also hope the Senators will understand that our servicemembers will  see the harm of a government shutdown in so many other ways. Permanent  change-in-station moves will be significantly curtailed, meaning that  some of our families could be left without a place to live if they have  already sold their house or broken their lease or they could be forced  to pay for two homes at once. For the Army alone, this means  approximately 2,100 moves every week. And if you do not work with us to  keep the entire government open, servicemembers' elective surgeries and  procedures at DOD medical and dental facilities would have to be  postponed. And, by the way, an elective surgery could be anything from  removing a kidney stone to a mastectomy for breast cancer.   Essentially, post and base services will be closed or severely  limited. That is everything from our commissary statewide to childcare  our military families count on.   So not only do I want to make sure that our servicemembers don't miss  a paycheck, I want to make sure that our servicemembers don't miss out  on any critical services they rely on every day.   The Senators should also understand that their focus and support of  the military cannot end with those who are currently in uniform. And  they should remember, 47 percent of Department of Defense civilians are  veterans. And for that matter, one in every four employees across the  entire Federal Government are veterans. We can't leave anyone behind.   So I will say it again for my colleagues who raise their voices here  on the Senate floor but have not cast their votes to prevent a  shutdown: There are a lot of programs I care about, a lot of programs  we all care about that would be hurt by a shutdown. But we are not  going to solve this problem one by one, carve-out by carve-out. The  best solution is to stop a shutdown in the first place. That is  something we can do. And I bet we could do it a lot more quickly if the  Senators from Alaska and Texas would earnestly work with us.   This isn't complicated. We have a straightforward, bipartisan CR  package that will avoid that shutdown, keep our military paid. So let's  get our jobs done and get that passed. I object.    Madam President, Americans across the country are  watching us now, as we near the brink of an entirely pointless and  absolutely devastating government shutdown and wondering: How in the  world did we get here? It is a great question and an infuriating one.   So I want to take a few minutes to walk through exactly how we did  get here, because the plain truth I want the American people to  recognize is, it did not have to be this way. But a number of House  Republicans, who have been working from day one of this Congress to  hold our government hostage, pushed the most extreme partisan agenda  imaginable and set us on a collision course for a government shutdown.   You don't have to take my word for it. Just listen to what some of  them have been saying:         If a shutdown occurs, then so be it.        We should not fear a government shutdown.    It is ``not the worst thing that could happen.''   And this quote:         [M]ay be what it takes.    Last week, of course, former President Trump--the same guy  responsible for the longest shutdown in history--called for Republicans  to shut down the government again.   Unfortunately, it sure seems like these are the sorts of people  Speaker McCarthy has been listening to--the most extreme, fringed  voices in his party--when he should be listening to the overwhelming  majority of people in our country who do not want a shutdown, because,  let's be clear, most Members of Congress--like most Americans--on both  sides of the aisle here, in both Chambers of Congress, do not want a  government shutdown. They do want to see us working together to get our  jobs done.   This is something I have heard from so many of our colleagues when I  became chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee at the beginning of  [[Page S4819]]  this year: We need to get back to regular order. No more omnibuses. No  more chaos. No more government shutdowns. I heard it from across both  parties here in the Senate.   So I have been working with the senior Senator from Maine to deliver  on just that: to make our appropriations process work better, to get  our bills done, and to ensure that all Members do have a say in the  process.   We have made some concrete progress; but over and over, extreme  Republicans in the House have put up roadblocks and done everything  they can to prevent Congress from getting even the most basic things  done.   The vice chair of the Appropriations Committee and I held nearly 50  hearings this past spring to evaluate what resources our communities  need in the year ahead. But, then, instead of being able to get right  to work and negotiate top-line spending numbers and writing those bills  as we finished those hearings this spring, we had to press pause to  contend with extreme Republicans who were then holding our Nation's  credit hostage and threatening a devastating default if they did not  get their way with unrealistic, draconian cuts to programs that this  entire country relies on.   It was a full-blown crisis. It was created by extreme House  Republicans who ground Congress and almost our economy to a halt.   Finally, after their dangerous brinksmanship caused so much  unnecessary drama and delay, President Biden and Speaker McCarthy  struck a deal on spending levels that rejected the deepest, most  damaging cuts. Now, it was not a deal I would have written myself-- absolutely not--but a deal is a deal.   The Speaker and the President shook hands. We all voted on it. It was  signed into law. We had an agreement so we here in the Senate could  finally get to work writing our bipartisan spending bills.   And in the Senate, that is exactly what we did. The senior Senator  from Maine and I said: Okay, let's get things back on track. Let's get  back to regular order. Let's write serious bills that can actually be  signed into law.    We agreed to work off that Biden-McCarthy deal in a bipartisan way to  avoid partisan poison pills and give all of our colleagues input on  those bills. We held televised, bipartisan markups with amendments,  with debate. And, for the first time in 5 years, we passed all 12 bills  out of the committee, and those bills passed overwhelmingly with  bipartisan support. We then got a resounding 91 votes to start work on  three appropriations bills that passed unanimously out of committee on  the Senate floor.   As we know, a few holdouts slowed things down. But I want you to know  we are going to keep working together to return to regular order so  Members can debate appropriations bills and offer amendments, and we  can get them passed.   Now, compare that to the House. Did they work to produce serious,  bipartisan appropriations bills that can be signed into law? Nope. They  wrote extreme partisan bills--extreme--that are not going anywhere.   Did they keep out provisions that they knew would be nonstarters?  Absolutely not. Their appropriations bills are a far-right wish list  chock full of extreme policies that would undermine our response to the  climate crisis, embolden bigotry against the LGBTQ community, weaken  commonsense gun safety regulations, and, of course--of course--impose  extreme abortion restrictions.   I mean, the list of extreme far-right policies that were slapped onto  the government spending bills in the House is astounding. If you want  to get something done for your constituents, you need to get serious,  and those bills are not serious.   Did House Republicans, at least, stick to the bipartisan top lines  that President Biden and Speaker McCarthy agreed to and we all voted  on? Not even in the slightest. Before the ink was dry on that deal that  he shook hands on, Speaker McCarthy caved to demands from the far right  to ignore those agreed-upon spending levels and take a hatchet to  programs that our families rely on.   In those spending bills, House Republicans want to cut 80 percent--8- 0--80 percent, that is $14.7 billion from title I funding our public  schools rely on. It supports nearly 90 percent of our Nation's school  districts. That includes rescinding funding that Congress provided last  year that schools have worked into their budgets and are using for this  school year.   They want to cut grants that keep our drinking water safe by more  than half.   They want to slash nearly $4 billion from lifesaving research at the  NIH.   In the middle of a childcare crisis, they want to cut Head Start by  $750 million and eliminate funding to help our States expand preschool  programs.   I am just getting started. I can go on all day with the devastating  cuts House Republicans have jammed into their partisan spending bills  with utter disregard for that agreement that we all passed a few months  ago and, more importantly, for how harmful those cuts would be for  those back home.   Those cuts would hollow out Federal programs and Agencies to a point  where basic government services that people expect to get done--whether  it is food safety inspectors or air traffic controllers--would almost  certainly break down.   I don't say all of this to score political points. I am laying the  facts out to make them plain to the American people, who I am sure are  just as frustrated as I am, about how pointless it would be to shut  down and how ridiculous it is that we are even at this point today.   So here we are, days from a government shutdown, and it is clear the  only way Congress can keep the lights on and avoid a terrible shutdown  is the bipartisan bill to continue funding and keep things open short- term while we work on those full-year bills.   The House isn't even trying to put forward a serious proposal to do  that.   Here in the Senate, the senior Senator from Maine and I have a  simple, bipartisan bill that keeps the government funded so we can  continue to work on our full-year appropriations bills. It includes  absolutely essential, time-sensitive reauthorizations for the FAA and  other Agencies, and it extends urgently needed funding for disaster  relief and our allies in Ukraine. It is a truly reasonable, bipartisan  bill carefully negotiated.   We are working at this very moment with our colleagues to get this  bill over to the House as soon as possible. But so far, Speaker  McCarthy seems to be more focused on indulging a few Members by writing  bills with massive, cartoon-villain level cuts instead of listening to  the American people and avoiding this shutdown.   After wasting all of our time on his partisan bills, which will never  become law, he tried to jam through a truly extreme CR that would have  cut agencies by 30 percent--30 percent--as if a 30-percent shutdown  isn't devastating to our families and the economy.   They need to get real. If it were to become law, that extreme  proposal would have been devastating for families and for our country.  Whether it is the Social Security Administration that is working to get  seniors signed up for new benefits; the Department of Education that is  working to process Pell Grants and financial aid for students--those  Agencies and so many others--would have had to figure out this Monday  how to implement a 30-percent, across-the-board cut if their bill had  passed. This Monday.   Their bill would grind basic government services to a halt. It would  create chaos and almost certainly make the odds of a recession likely.   As we just saw a while ago, that bill, fortunately, went down in the  House in flames because it was not bipartisan, and it was not a serious  effort to get our communities the funding they need.   So the lesson here should be obvious: Partisanship is not how we get  through crisis--any of them--especially in a divided government. It is  not how we prevent shutdowns. We prevent shutdowns by rolling up our  sleeves, doing the hard work of talking to each other, listening to  each other, and hammering out a bipartisan agreement to keep the lights  on.   Fortunately, that is what we have actually done here in the Senate.  We have a bipartisan agreement. We are on our way to sending it to the  House as soon as possible.   The good news: It is not too late for Speaker McCarthy to learn his  lesson and do the right thing. So I hope instead of listening to the  likes of former  [[Page S4820]]  President Trump or the extreme right and continuing to push a bill like  he just did that failed so badly, the Speaker needs to listen to all of  the people who will be hurt by this shutdown, who will miss their  paychecks, who will be cut off from healthcare and childcare and  support they rely on. And then I hope he will commit to bringing up our  commonsense CR bills to the floor as soon as possible.   Let us get our jobs done. Let's keep the government open. And then,  instead of retreating back to partisan extreme, I urge Speaker McCarthy  to do what so many of our Members on both sides of the aisle here in  the Senate have called for and work together with our colleagues to  find common ground and produce serious proposals that will make  people's lives better.   Politics isn't a game. Sometimes you just choose to do the right  thing because you know quite clearly what the right thing is to do.  Shutting down the government is not the right thing. Refusing to work  in a bipartisan way and forcing us into a showdown to show certain  Members of the House Republican majority that you will fight Democrats,  that is the wrong thing.   The American people don't want to see you fight the other party. They  want to see you work with your colleagues across the aisle. That is  what we have done in the Senate with our 12 bipartisan funding bills,  and the sooner we take the shutdown off the table, the sooner we can  get back to work to pass those 12 bills that fund everything from  cancer research to grants for our farmers, to top-notch medical care  for our veterans, and so much more.   So, as I have said so many times, let's help people and solve  problems. Let's work together, not against one another.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, reserving the right to object, we can't  be back here in the same situation in 2 weeks. We need a CR that gives  us the actual time to get through our bipartisan spending bills.  Believe me, I would love to say we could get this done in 2 weeks. But  we know that is not realistic, because even the three that passed  unanimously out of my committee have run into delays, as the Senator  from Wisconsin knows all too well.   And, just as importantly, this bill does nothing to reauthorize time- sensitive programs. It does not reauthorize the FAA, which means chaos  for air travelers. It doesn't reauthorize our community health centers  and other critical primary care programs, which means patients in our  underserved areas will lose access to programs they need.   And it doesn't protect our wildland firefighters from a drastic pay  cut. It doesn't extend disaster relief funding or Ukraine's aid.   We have before this body a carefully negotiated bipartisan CR that  does include all of those absolutely essential policies, that has  already garnered more than enough support to pass here in the Senate,  and that I am confident will pass the House as soon as Speaker McCarthy  actually puts it to a vote.   That is where our attention needs to be, not on a slapdash bill that  puts us back here in 2 weeks and completely leaves air travel, health  care providers, firefighters, and so much more in a lurch.   I object.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it recess until 12 noon on  Saturday, September 30; that following the prayer and pledge, the time  for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day and  morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of morning  business, the Senate resume consideration of H.R. 3935.    Madam President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand in recess under the previous  order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 5:21 p.m., recessed until  Saturday, September 30, 2023, at 12 noon.                            ____________________
