 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my colleague  Congressman Ted Poe holding this important Special Order Hour to honor  survivors of sexual violence on our college campuses, and in particular  the brave members of the 12th Woman, a group of survivors from Texas  A&M University who are speaking truth to power about their experiences.  Judge Poe has been unwavering in his pursuit of justice for victims of  sexual violence on the bench and in Congress. I applaud his strong  advocacy and tireless dedication to this incredibly important cause. He  is a true ally and his legacy on this issue will continue to help  countless victims and survivors move forward.   When parents drop off their children for their first year of college,  we expect our institutions of higher learning to keep them safe. But  that's not the reality for 20 percent of young women and six percent of  young men who are destined to become victims of sexual assault on  campus. To make matters worse, survivors are constantly told that they  are responsible for their assault--from being penalized for so-called  `code of ethics' violations, like drinking at parties or going into  other students' dorm rooms, to being blamed for not fighting back.   That includes a brave survivor at Texas A&M who had the wherewithal  to alert her school that her rapist was allowed back on the swim team  after being suspended for only one semester and not being subject to  criminal charges. The school's response speaks volumes--``I regret your  displeasure with the perceived impact, and I wish you all the best as  [[Page H6585]]  you continue to seek healing''. The school's failure to protect the  survivor and other potential victims is unacceptable.   They are not alone. Universities continue to inadequately deal with  perpetrators across the country--from expulsions after graduation, to  honor code violations that carry less of a penalty than plagiarism, to  allowing perpetrators to directly cross-examine their victims about  their past sexual history during the so-called investigative process.  This kind of antiquated victim-blaming and -shaming must end.   That is why I am introducing the bipartisan Hold Accountable and Lend  Transparency or HALT Campus Sexual Violence Act with my colleagues  Congressmen Ted Poe and Brian Fitzpatrick to ensure that our colleges  and universities do everything they can to hold perpetrators  accountable and to provide the support survivors need and deserve.                            ____________________
