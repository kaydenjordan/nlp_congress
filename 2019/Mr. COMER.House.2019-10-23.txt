 Madam Speaker, I rise today to strongly condemn the  unfair, closed-door, hyperpartisan, impeachment inquiry process being  conducted by House Democrats.   Nothing, not even the cold, hard facts, will stop the partisan  politics of my colleagues on the left from nullifying the 2016  election.   One of Speaker Pelosi's committee chairs who she chose to lead this  process promised years ago that she would find a way to impeach the  President. This has been the plan from the beginning.   Certain minority rights have been denied to Republicans during this  process, like equal subpoena power, a right that Republicans provided  Democrats during the Clinton impeachment.   Chairman Schiff started this trend of dishonesty by promoting false  allegations related to the President and Russia. Now, he has publicly  mischaracterized his committee's handling of the whistleblower inquiry  and deceived the American people about his relationship with the  whistleblower.   Democrats still refuse to hold a full House vote on their impeachment  inquiry, yet they continue this baseless impeachment inquiry of  President Trump instead of tackling the issues most important to our  citizens.   I urge the American people to take a hard look at the lack of  transparency and accountability surrounding this unfounded impeachment  inquiry.                            ____________________
