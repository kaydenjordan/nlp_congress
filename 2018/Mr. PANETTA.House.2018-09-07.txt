 Mr. Speaker, today I honor Weston Call. Weston was a  beloved member of our close-knit Big Sur community in my district on  the central coast of California who, unexpectedly and unfortunately,  passed away in August at the young age of 32.   Weston was a fourth-generation Carmel native and a 2004 graduate of  the same high school I went to, Carmel High.   Although he grew up in Carmel, Wes would give everything and do  anything for the people of Big Sur.   During the 2016 Soberanes fire, he helped Big Sur neighbors fight the  flames from their properties.   During the 2017 storms, when the Pfeiffer Bridge got knocked out, Wes  took it upon himself to transport people from the makeshift trail  around the bridge to their jobs.   And as tourist traffic has become a major problem in Big Sur, rather  than complaining about it, Wes did something about it. He created a  shuttle service to alleviate the congestion along Highway 1. During  those rides, he would always provide a local point of view about where  to go and what to do. He wouldn't share too much about our secrets, but  he always stressed how sensitive we should be about the environment.   I hope that Wes' life serves as an example for all of us of how to be  better neighbors, better citizens, and better stewards of our beloved  home.                            ____________________
