 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate The Children's  Trust on their 20th anniversary.   My wife, Lourdes, and I have been longtime supporters of The  Children's Trust and are so proud of their tireless work to protect our  community's children and safeguard taxpayer dollars.   I would especially thank our friends, David Lawrence and James Haaj.  Their visionary leadership has paved the way for the countless  innovative programs offered by The Children's Trust aimed at improving  the lives of our next generation of leaders: our children.   In Miami-Dade, we are blessed to have The Children's Trust  prioritizing our kids' welfare and investing in family programs to  nurture and advocate for all of our children regardless of  socioeconomic background.   As a county commissioner, mayor, and now a Member of Congress, I have  seen the impact of The Children's Trust firsthand, and I look forward  to continuing to work closely together.   Congratulations on these 20 years and many, many more.                            ____________________
