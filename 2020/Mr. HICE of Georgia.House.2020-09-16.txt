 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Biggs for  yielding.   Look, we have all seen the out-of-control left hijacking our cities  across  [[Page H4482]]  the Nation, and we know where the bottom line ends. It is organizations  like Antifa, where they are targeting police officers, burning down  buildings, destroying private property, besieging Federal buildings,  attacking innocent civilians. We have seen what happened with the  police in L.A. and the chants that took place there.   But all this type of behavior does not happen in a vacuum. It doesn't  happen in a vacuum.   In fact, we are seeing all of this fueled by reckless rhetoric, much  of it coming from our Democratic colleagues, where they say things  like: All cops are evil, all cops are bad, and cries to defund the  police.   The result we are watching? Record numbers of police murdered and  killed across the country, record numbers injured.   Yet, the left is still calling to defund the police. Rather than  condemn this lunacy that is happening in our country, the majority  continues to appease, continues to fuel this horrible behavior.   In fact, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee won't even admit  that Antifa violence exists. He calls it a myth. It is unthinkable.   Where is the leadership of the Democratic Party? Where is the Speaker  of the House, for that matter? She has consistently downplayed this  crisis that is happening in our streets.   It is time that we have leadership here. It is time that we address  the issues. The Speaker, frankly, should be ashamed of the absolute  failure to address this horrific behavior that is happening and the  unrest that is happening in our country.   In fact, when the Senate passed serious legislation, the Speaker went  out to say that the Senate is trying to commit murder. My question is,  how many murders have occurred on the streets of America since she made  that statement?   Rather than work with us, the Democrats and the Speaker call us and  the President domestic enemies and enemies of the state, and that is  just totally unacceptable.   It is time that we restore law and order in this country, and it  begins by restoring it right here in this Chamber.                                time  1715
