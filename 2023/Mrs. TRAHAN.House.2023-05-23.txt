 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remind Members of this  Chamber what happened just 2 weeks ago in Allen, Texas.   Eight people were senselessly murdered by an extremist armed with an  assault rifle--a 3-year-old boy and his mom and dad, who left behind a  6-year-old orphan who survived the mass shooting.   Two young sisters, one in the fourth grade and the other in the  second grade, who were described as rays of sunshine, and three young  adults each had their entire life ahead of them. All of them were  simply minding their own business at the outlets on a Saturday, not  knowing it would be their last day.   The news cycle may have changed--something many in this Chamber were  waiting for--but each of these victims leaves behind loved ones who are  still mourning an unimaginable loss.   Each of these victims, like every victim of a mass shooting before  them, deserved better. They deserved real action that could have  prevented a person deemed unfit to serve in the United States Army from  accessing an assault weapon that he used to kill them.   They deserve better than their Member of Congress going on national  television that same day and saying that thoughts and prayers are  enough to stop gun violence and that if you disagree, then you don't  believe in an Almighty God.   They certainly deserve better than platitudes from a Governor more  concerned about his grade on the NRA scorecard than the number of  victims of mass shootings in his State.   Mr. Speaker, I stood here at this podium 3 weeks ago after three 9- year-old children and two teachers were murdered in their classrooms in  Nashville. I pleaded with the Republican majority to bring legislation  to the floor to prevent another mass shooting.   I listed bills we could have considered: the assault weapons ban to  get weapons of war, the gun of choice for mass shooters, off our  streets; the Bipartisan Background Checks Act to make sure guns aren't  falling into the hands of individuals who shouldn't have them; and the  Enhanced Background Checks Act to ensure that a full background check  is actually completed before the firearm sale is processed.   Yet, here we are, 17 days since Allen, Texas, 57 days since The  Covenant School, and 1 day before the first anniversary of the massacre  in Uvalde, and what are we being forced to vote on this week? A piece  of legislation that will make it harder to stop air pollution. Are they  serious? This is a colossal disconnect.   There is a witness from a shooting just 2 weeks ago who talked about  how he went to help a little girl whom he thought was hiding, and when  he went to check on her, she didn't have a face after being shot with  an AR-15-style assault weapon.   We can't even get a vote on whether these guns should be available.  It is no wonder people think Congress is out of touch.   The United States is the only developed nation in the world where  this kind of thing keeps happening again and again. We are the only  country where mass shootings are so common that we have PSAs so people  know what to do and where my girls' school day is interrupted on a  regular basis to practice an active shooter drill.   It is shameful, infuriating, and embarrassing. This Chamber should be  embarrassed that another mass shooting has disappeared from the news  without a shred of action.                            ____________________
