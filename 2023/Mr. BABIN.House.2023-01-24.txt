 Mr. Speaker, I really appreciate Chris Smith, and I thank  the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Mrs. Fischbach) for having this Special  Order.   Mr. Speaker, today, as we mourn the millions of babies lost because  of the decision in Roe v. Wade 53 years ago, we also celebrate the  millions that will  [[Page H271]]  be saved now because that decision has been overturned.   Tragically, Mr. Speaker, my Democratic colleagues would rather spread  lies about the Supreme Court decision than to tell the truth. They want  to deceive you into believing that Republicans don't care about women's  health--that is crazy--even as they enable and encourage biological men  to use women's bathrooms and to compete in women's sports, and they are  content to simply watch pro-abortion thugs attack and burn pregnancy  centers and churches around the country.   They may refuse the truth because it doesn't further their anti-life  agenda, but they can't change it. The truth is that the reversal of Roe  v. Wade returned the power to where it belongs, and that is to States.   So today I celebrate that decision, I pray for those taken, and I  renew my promise to never surrender the fight for our unborn. I will  always defend the voiceless, and I will always stand for life.
