 Madam Speaker, I have one question: Where has Congress been?   Forty-three percent of American households have had a significant or  total pay cut; 26 million Americans have filed for unemployment;  schools are shut down, placing burdens on families; and hospitals are  laying off doctors and nurses. Where has Congress been?   Congress has met twice: first, to pass a $2 trillion bill that in  many cases is harming the very businesses it purports to help; now,  again, to spend more borrowed money without asking the important  questions--no hearings, no oversight.   Today, I am holding my nose voting for a bill I had no chance to  shape because there are 700,000 businesses closed by the power of  government on the outside looking in while Harvard qualifies for $9  million.   But this is it, Madam Speaker, enough. No more half-assed  legislating. No more picking winners and losers. No more asking a small  restaurant to gamble, to borrow money in hopes that money will be  forgiven by their government if they rehire people. They can't rehire  because those same overlords are paying workers more in unemployment  than to do their job.   Congress must convene not just today, but every day until America is  back on track. Our job is to make policies that will save lives by  moving us forward with deliberation, facts, and balanced reason, not  reaction, panic, and fear.   Congress should be here, Madam Speaker.
