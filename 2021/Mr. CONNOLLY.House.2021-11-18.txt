 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend, Mr. McGovern, for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, when I served in local government, I helped to write  and pass 14 consecutive budgets. If I learned one thing from that  process, it is that budgets are statements of values. When Republicans  last used the budget reconciliation process, it was to pass a $2  trillion tax giveaway to the wealthy. Before that, they used it to rip  healthcare away from more than 20 million Americans. They stated their  values loudly and clearly.   Well, here are our values in this bill. We value working Americans,  and are using reconciliation to cut their taxes; not the rich. We value  American children and parents, and are using reconciliation drastically  to lower childcare costs, provide paid family leave, and guarantee  access to preschool. We value the health and well-being of the American  people, and are using reconciliation to expand access to vital health  services, especially our seniors. And we value our environment, and are  using reconciliation to make the single largest investment in the fight  against climate change in history.   These are our values. This is how we build back a better America, not  only for the rich and well-connected, but for all Americans.   Madam Speaker, I urge the passage of this important investment in our  future.
