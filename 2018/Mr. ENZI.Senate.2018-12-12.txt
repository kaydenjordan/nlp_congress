 Mr. President, as this session of Congress draws to a  close, it provides us with an opportunity to acknowledge and express  our appreciation to those Members of the Senate who will be retiring in  just a few weeks. One of those Senators who is retiring and whose  leadership and institutional knowledge will be missed is my friend  Orrin Hatch of Utah.   I have known Orrin since my first days 22 years ago in the Senate,  and I much appreciated working with him over the years. His mentoring,  his guidance, his love, and his sharing of his faith have made a  tremendous difference to me.   He comes from a State that borders my own. We are neighbors. As a  western Senator, he has an understanding of what is truly important to  the people in our neck of the woods and has fought to make this country  better during his time in the Senate.   Before I talk about his many accomplishments in public service, I  want to acknowledge some of the other things about him that have also  been mentioned, his life and role beyond the Senate.   So often it is easy to gloss over things that are important to  Senators personally. Sometimes it is easy to forget the men and women  we know have their lives that stretch beyond these Halls. Orrin has  been married to his wife Elaine for more than 60 years. He is a father  of 6, grandfather of 23, and currently has 24 great-grandchildren. He  is an author and a man of many talents. It has been mentioned that he  is a talented composer and musician and has both a gold and platinum  record from the Recording Industry Association of America. He has been  instrumental in the musical world and has been awarded an honorary  Grammy. He has been the main protector of copyrights.   Orrin has dedicated his life to serving the people of Utah. He has  always worked for the best interests of Utah, and that includes  Americans nationwide.   He has served in the Senate since 1977 and since 2015 has been the  President  [[Page S7471]]  pro tempore, where he can be seen presiding during the opening of the  Senate for daily business probably more than any other President pro  tempore of the Senate.   The numbers are in, and they are impressive. He has served under  seven Presidents, been a part of both the minority and majority, and  has served the people of Utah and the U.S. Senate for over 40 years.  Orrin has served in a variety of leadership roles and has helped  America every step of the way. He has had the opportunity to serve as  the chairman of three major Senate committees--the Health, Education,  Labor, and Pensions Committee; the Judiciary Committee; and most  recently, the Finance Committee while doing the tax bill. He has run  for President. He has been considered as a potential nominee for the  Supreme Court. He has played a role in confirming every Supreme Court  Justice currently sitting on the bench. Orrin is eminently qualified  for so many positions, and America has been lucky to have his  leadership through the years. The people of Utah, our Nation, and  people of all faiths were fortunate to have him to rely on. Orrin is a  man of faith, one who defends others' right to worship in peace.   He has consistently fought to rein in the Federal Government. He has  been a champion of responsible government spending and a leader of  States' rights. He authored a constitutional amendment to balance the  Federal budget that received 66 votes, just one short of what was  needed to amend the Constitution. One of those votes was somebody who  had just run for election and said that was the most important thing  and no matter how many times it came up, he would be voting for it. He  voted against it, and that was the one vote that was needed. Just by  virtue of his legislative triumphs, he has helped to author some of the  most consequential pieces of legislation in our time. Many have been  mentioned.   He paved the way for the sale of generic drugs and helped advance  innovation for patients with rare diseases. He has contributed to the  protection of children's health and well-being as well as the rights of  Americans with disabilities. I know one of his proudest accomplishments  is passing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which protects  individual Americans' right to exercise their religion. Most recently,  he had the honor of having the Orrin G. Hatch-Bob Goodlatte Music  Modernization Act named after him, which overhauled musical copyright  law.    We both have a strong touch of the West in our hearts, which we  express every day in what we do. That is why I wasn't surprised last  year when Orrin announced he would not be running for another term in  the Senate. He said:         I've always been a fighter. I was an amateur boxer in my       youth . . . but every good fighter knows when to hang up the       gloves. . . . I look forward to spending more time with       family, especially my sweet wife Elaine, whose unwavering       love and support made all of this possible.    Orrin has been a great source of strength and a great support for our  party, and he will be missed. My wife Diana joins me in sending our  best wishes and appreciation to Orrin and Elaine. We wish them all the  best as they have time to spend with their children, grandchildren, and  great-grandchildren. Together, they have been great examples of the  importance of public service, and we wish them the best in whatever  adventure they choose to pursue next.   Orrin, it will be said that it was well done, good and faithful  servant. Happy trails.   I yield the floor.
