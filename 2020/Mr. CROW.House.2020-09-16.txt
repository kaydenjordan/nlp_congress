 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the staff and  residents of the Veterans Community Living Center in Aurora, Colorado.  This Colorado veterans home has cared for veterans, veteran spouses,  and Gold Star parents for over 18 years.   The staff at Fitzsimons has acted heroically during this pandemic,  risking exposure, facing fears, and continuing to show up for their  residents and coworkers. Since March, 26 employees have tested  positive, and most have returned to work.   This dedicated team has pioneered new ways of connecting veterans to  their communities, including drive-by vintage car shows and  coordinating phone calls and Skype visits with family and friends.   We do mourn the loss of 25 veterans who lost their lives to the virus  and celebrate the lifetime of selfless service all veterans who live at  Fitzsimons have made.   It is with pride that I recognize the staff and residents at the  Veterans Community Living Center at Fitzsimons.          Recognizing Salud Family Health Centers' 50th Anniversary     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Salud Family  Health Centers on its 50th anniversary.   Salud was founded in 1970 to serve the migrant and seasonal  farmworker population living and working in and around Fort Lupton,  Colorado. Today, Salud operates 13 clinics and a mobile unit in 10  predominantly rural communities throughout northern and southeastern  Colorado, serving over 82,000 patients annually.   Salud has grown to provide medical, dental, behavioral health,  women's care, pediatric care, and on-site pharmacy services. Prior to  COVID, Salud also operated 11 school-based sites to better serve the  needs of the community.   Salud's mobile unit travels mostly rural areas during the evenings to  provide quality healthcare to seasonal and migrant workers. In its 50  years, Salud has served 2 million patients.   I am proud to have Salud Family Health Centers serving the people of  the Sixth Congressional District.                     Applauding Aurora Mobile Food Pantry     Mr. Speaker, I rise today as we observe Hunger Action Month  throughout September to applaud the work of the Aurora Mobile Food  Pantry.    While the food pantry is a crucial support system to our community at  the best of times, it has been a lifeline to those experiencing hunger  during the COVID-19 pandemic.   This summer, Aurora Mobile Food Pantry and its community partners,  along with over 750 volunteers, provided more than 475,000 meals to our  community. In addition to providing healthy food, more than 30,000  community members who visited the mobile food pantry received 37,000  pounds of pet food, 2,800 books for children, 5,400 water bottles, and  $47,000 worth of diapers and baby wipes.   All told, the Aurora Mobile Food Pantry has provided more than $1  million in food to our community during COVID-19. It serves as a  reminder of what can happen when Coloradans come together to support  one another in times of need.                     Recognizing Heroism of Manjit Singh     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Manjit Singh.   Manjit Singh immigrated to my district from India in 2018 in search  of the American Dream. On Wednesday, August 5, Manjit died a hero.   After his first day of truck driving school, Manjit was with his  family and friends at Reedley Beach near his new home in California. He  saw three children caught in the current of the Kings River and  selflessly rushed in to help them.   Manjit did not know how to swim, but he knew bravery. Witnesses say  he helped pull one of the three children to safety and endeavored to  assist another.   While all of them have recovered, an 8-year-old girl named Samantha  would later lose her life. I grieve for her and her family.   I stand amazed by Manjit's sacrifice, and I am grateful to his  community for recognizing the heroism he demonstrated that day. I am  inspired by the humanity and compassion that link all of us together.                            ____________________
