 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. It is great to be  here tonight.   I just came from the Library of Congress, and there are a lot of  books there, but there is one book in particular that is there, and it  is in the homes of many American families right now that I would call  the most dangerous book in the world.   It is a book that people are being put in prison for just having  possession of. It is a crime in many nations for people to own this  book, to read this book. There are thousands and thousands of people in  prison right now in other parts of the world who are being tortured and  killed because they possess this book.   I was reading earlier today about a country where there are people in  prison who have friends who tear this book up into little pieces, and  they smuggle it into the prison. And that person takes them, and they  piece together those pages so that they can not only read this book,  but they can memorize it. Because as one of the prisoners said: ``Even  though they can take the paper away, they can't take away what's hidden  in your heart.''   And there is another story from another country where parents, if  they have the privilege of getting one of these books, it is so  precious they read it at night to their families and then they hide it.   But the schools and the government trick their children in playing a  hide-and-seek game, and they trick the children into telling their  teachers if their parents have that book and where it is. And they are  given candy if they win this ``game,'' and then, sadly, they realize  their parents are taken away to prison camps as a result of that.   So what is this book that I think is really one of the most dangerous  books in the world? It is the Bible. It is the Bible. It is what we are  commemorating this week.   But why is it so dangerous? Why are governments around the world so  threatened by it? It is because it is the Word of God. I will say that  again: The Bible is the Word of God.   Now, that seems radical. I mean, some people would view that as  radical, but people who have read this book, whose lives have been  transformed by it, who have experienced the power of it, who have been  set free from difficulties in their life and the chains of either sin  or the chains of bondage of a government that is trying to oppress them  will tell you it is the most precious book in the world. And that is  why governments fear it, and that is why people seek it, and that is  why everyone should take advantage--especially in America--of reading  it. That is why it is such a popular book.   By far, it is the world's most popular book. There is no other book,  fact or fiction, which comes close. Most estimates place the number of  Bibles printed each year at 100 million.   Mr. Speaker, 20 million Bibles are sold each year in the United  States alone. The American Bible Society estimates that 9 out of 10  American households--or almost 9--87 percent of American households own  a Bible. In fact, they say the average American family owns three  Bibles.   My question tonight to all of us is: Are we reading it?   Having a Bible and not reading it would be just like being frustrated  that you need to go somewhere and having a car in the garage but just  not taking it out, or complaining about the room is so dark when you  just don't go over and turn the light switch on, or having no idea how  to go somewhere when you can just turn on your Google Maps on your  phone.   The Bible is the source of help; it is the source of power; and it is  the source of direction in our lives--and it is right there in our  homes, too many times, sadly, gathering dust.   In my own life, I started off going to church with my parents as a  child, but I never read the Bible myself. It was something, we used it  on Sunday, and the pastor would share a verse or two, and that was it.   And then I went to camp when I was 13. It was a Youth for Christ  Camp. I learned that we could read the Bible ourselves and how powerful  it is to, every day, start your day off reading from God's Word,  talking to Him through prayer, listening to Him through prayer, and  getting inspiration and guidance for your life.   And it was a revolutionary idea, so I started doing that when I was  13, continued that through my teenage years  [[Page H9110]]  to the present. And I can't tell you what a difference that has made in  my life.   Day after day, I would pick up the Bible to read, maybe 15 minutes  before the schoolbus came, and what I read that day would be something  that later on, a couple hours later, I would face at school. Whether it  would be something dealing with one of my classmates or a hard test or  being sick, it doesn't matter.                                time  1845    They say the Bible is living and active, and it really is. That is  one thing that makes it so special, because it is very, very powerful.   There have been many instances in my life where the Bible has made a  difference for me. But I want to certainly say the most important verse  is not just because it is the word of God; it is because it points me  to how I can have a personal relationship with him. And that is John  3:16.   I don't know about you, but I love football. Many times when you  watch a football game, somebody is holding up a poster that says,  ``John 3:16.'' I hope you go and read what that says because it is so  powerful. It says, ``For God so loved the world.'' That is what makes  this different than other religions. God is a god of love, and because  He loved the world, He gave His one and only Son that whoever believes  in Him should not perish but have eternal life. It goes on and says,  ``For God did not send his Son to condemn the world but to save the  world through him.''   I believed that when I was 9 years old, and I am so thankful to have  the privilege of knowing God and that God has made a way for each one  of us to know that.   I would, this week, encourage all of us to get our Bible off that  shelf, dust it off, open it up, and experience knowing God, hearing  from Him, and receiving the hope, healing, and help that only God can  provide.
