 Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank the Department of  Health and Human Services under this new administration for doing  something that should have been done a long time ago.   The agency is now opening a Conscience and Religious Freedom Division  within its Office for Civil Rights. This new office will be devoted  solely to treating people fairly, regardless of race, religion, or  creed.   It is part of a broader theme in America where people, lately, from  all religions and walks of life have been persecuted for their views  and for not conforming to the views of others. How is that in the name  of tolerance?   For example, I recently led an amicus brief on behalf of 144  Representatives and Senators for a Supreme Court case involving  pregnancy clinics in California who, under California law, are being  forced to violate their own faith and effectively advertise for  abortions, against their own will.   This is wrong, and it is evidence of the religious persecution in  America today, religion being one of the founding cornerstones that  have formed this country by our Founders.   This new DHS office is a positive sign for people of all faiths who  are being bullied into adhering to a leftist agenda and are essentially  being told their beliefs don't matter because they disagree with a  conservative viewpoint.                            ____________________
