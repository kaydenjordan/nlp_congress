 Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the  nomination of Attorney General Scott Pruitt to be the Administrator of  the Environmental Protection Agency. Scott Pruitt is the right person  to run the Agency, and we need to confirm him.   Over the past 8 years, the political leaders of the EPA have taken  actions that have undermined the American people's faith in the Agency.  They have pushed broad and sweeping regulations that have hurt our  economy and have failed to protect our environment. These regulations  include the so-called Clean Power Plan. This is a rule that will kill  job growth in States like Indiana, Wisconsin, Ohio, and my home State  of Wyoming. These also include regulations defining the term ``waters  of the United States.'' This was a classic example of Washington  overreach. The Agency brought irrigation ditches, plowed farm fields,  and even parking lot puddles under Federal control. With both of these  rules, dozens of State governments have had to take Washington to  court. Why? Well, to try to stop the crippling effects of these  Washington-based regulations.   The Agency's outrageous actions have extended beyond these rules and  have had real consequences for many American families. According to the  chamber of commerce, since 2008 this regulatory rampage by the EPA has  destroyed 19,000 coal-mining jobs nationwide. In Kentucky, nearly 4 out  of every 10 coal-mining jobs have disappeared over the past 8 years.  Ohio and Pennsylvania have each lost more than 1,000 fossil fuel  electric power jobs during the same period. In West Virginia, 5,200  coal-mining jobs have vanished just since 2011.   The total cost of all of this new redtape from the Environmental  Protection Agency is more than $300 billion. The leadership at the EPA  has failed. It has failed because a lot of their regulations are bad  ideas.   That is not the only way the political leaders at the Agency have  failed; they have actually hurt people and damaged the environment  directly. In 2015, more than 3 million gallons of toxic wastewater  spilled into the river at the Gold King Mine in Colorado. The  government Agency charged with protecting our environment actually  caused this spill and poisoned a river. This was a direct result of  negligence on the part of the Environmental Protection Agency. This  plume of toxic liquid flowed downstream to New Mexico and polluted the  Navajo Nation's main source of drinking water and irrigation water.   In the final days of the Obama administration, the EPA then denied  $1.2 billion in damage claims from the farmers, the Native American  tribes, and small businesses impacted by the EPA's own negligence.   In Flint, MI, old pipes and improperly treated water caused lead  poisoning in children. When the leadership at the EPA learned of the  issue, they failed to respond in a timely manner. The regional EPA  administrator actually resigned following the incident.   For the last 8 years, the political leaders of this Agency have been  reckless, irresponsible, and arrogant. Change is badly needed at the  Environmental Protection Agency and Scott Pruitt will be that change.  Mr. Pruitt has served as attorney general in the State of Oklahoma  since 2011--6 years. He has worked to protect the environment in his  State, while also working for the benefit of all the people of  Oklahoma.    He has taken on polluters. He has worked across party lines to do it.  When poultry farmers in Arkansas, a neighboring State to Oklahoma, were  increasing phosphorous levels in the Illinois River that runs between  the States, he worked with Arkansas' Democratic attorney general on a  solution. They found a way to reduce pollution and establish permanent  standards.   Former Arkansas Attorney General McDaniel, a Democrat, called Pruitt  a ``staunch defender of sound science and good policy as appropriate  tools to protect the environment in his State.''   Scott Pruitt also helped negotiate a water rights settlement between  tribes in Oklahoma. The deal will help preserve scenic rivers and lakes  so they can be enjoyed for generations to come.   Scott Pruitt also stood up to industry when they caused pollution.  That is why the entire Oklahoma congressional delegation has endorsed  his nomination. He has been an advocate for the environment in  Oklahoma, and he will be an advocate for the environment in Washington.   When the EPA overstepped its mission, Attorney General Pruitt led the  charge to rein in Big Government Washington overreach. Time after time,  Scott Pruitt worked with other States to challenge the Agency when it  exceeded its authority. Under his leadership, this Agency will respect  the rule of law.   Attorneys general from 24 States have endorsed Scott Pruitt as  someone who can protect the environment while also protecting State  decisionmaking. He has also won the support of small businesses and  farmers around the country. Groups like the National Federation of  Independent Business, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National  Association of Home Builders, the American Farm Bureau Federation, and  many others have voiced their support for Mr. Pruitt.   As chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I take the  nomination process very seriously. Our committee thoroughly vetted Mr.  Pruitt. We held a confirmation hearing that lasted more than 6 hours.  That is by far the longest confirmation hearing for an EPA  Administrator on record.  [[Page S1231]]  During this hearing, Attorney General Pruitt was asked more than 200  questions by Members of the committee. We had four rounds of  questions--an unprecedented number. Our Democratic colleagues on the  committee noted during the hearing how fair the process was. They said  how much they appreciated the opportunity to ask so many questions.  After the hearing, committee members submitted another 1,078 written  questions to Mr. Pruitt to answer for the record. Again, this is the  most ever for a nominee to be Administrator of the Environmental  Protection Agency. His answers were thoughtful, and they were thorough.  That is why I was very disappointed to see the Democrats on the  committee decide to boycott the meeting to vote on the Pruitt  nomination.   The minority complained that he didn't answer enough questions.  Democrats have even complained that he has not been vetted thoroughly  enough. That is ridiculous. Scott Pruitt is the most thoroughly vetted  nominee we have ever had to lead this Agency. Democrats are using  delaying tactics to slow down the confirmation of many of this  administration's most important nominees. These boycotts and delay  tactics do nothing to protect our environment or the health of  Americans. Democrats are engaged in nothing more than political  theater. They are wasting time while the Environmental Protection  Agency needs a new Administrator.   Attorney General Pruitt has protected the environment in his home  State. He is endorsed by his peers, and he has been thoroughly vetted  for the job. He will make an excellent EPA Administrator. It is time  for the Senate to confirm him.   Mr. President, at this time I ask unanimous consent to have printed  in the Record the following items in support of Mr. Pruitt's  nomination: First are two op-eds I authored, one is from FOX News that  is entitled ``For Eight Years, the EPA Has Made Life Hard for Too Many  Americans. That's About to Change.''   The second is from USA TODAY, entitled: ``The Strong Leader the EPA  Needs.''   I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record some other  items: a letter from Dustin McDaniel, Democrat and Arkansas former  attorney general. In the letter, he writes that he ``saw firsthand how  Attorney General Pruitt was able to bridge political divides and manage  multiple agency agendas to reach an outcome that was heralded by most  credible observers as positive and historic.''   Another item for the Record is a letter from 24 State attorneys  general who wrote in support of Mr. Pruitt's qualifications.   Also for the Record is a letter I received from J.D. Strong. He is  the director of the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation. In  the letter, Mr. Strong directly refutes a New York Times article titled  ``Scott Pruitt, Trump's EPA Pick, Backed Industry Donors over  Regulators.''   Mr. Strong writes:         As a fifth generation Oklahoman and someone who has devoted       my career to natural resource protection, I take great pride       in the progress that has been made in improving Oklahoma's       land, air, water, and wildlife resources.    He goes on to say--         For the past six years, General Pruitt has been       instrumental in many of our successes and never asked me to       compromise regulatory efforts to benefit industry.    Also, I would like to include in the Record an op-ed by Ed Fite, the  former agency administrator of the Oklahoma Scenic Rivers Commission.  He writes:         Scott Pruitt is one who is committed to finding a balance       that protects and preserves our environment while at the same       time affords an opportunity for a robust economy to exist.       Achievement of one doesn't have to be exclusive of the other.    There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                        [FoxNews.com, Jan. 17, 2017]    Sen. Barrasso: For 8 Years the EPA Has Made Life Hard for Too Many                     Americans. That's About To Change                       (By Sen. John Barrasso, M.D.)         Seventy-five thousand dollars per day. That's how much the       Environmental Protection Agency threatened to fine a private       land owner in my home state of Wyoming. The crime: digging a       pond in his back yard.        This was an appalling overreach by the Obama       administration's EPA and its regulation of American's       property.        Sadly, this story is not unique.        For the past eight years, the EPA has abused and attacked       far too many hard-working American families.        A regulatory rampage by EPA has led to the loss of       thousands of coal mining jobs in Wyoming, West Virginia,       Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Kentucky.        Wisconsin is poised to lose more than 20,000 jobs in the       next decade because of the Obama administration's proposed       regulations on carbon emissions.        The misguided obsession of the EPA has created needless       economic burdens for Americans. It has, at the same time, put       people's health in danger.        Negligence on the part of the EPA resulted in more than 3       million gallons of toxic wastewater being dumped into a river       at the Gold King Mine in Colorado.        The plume of toxic liquid flowed downstream to New Mexico       and polluted the Navajo Nation's main source of drinking and       irrigation water.        In Flint, Michigan, aging pipes and improperly treated       water caused lead poisoning in children. When EPA officials       learned of the pending disaster, they failed to respond.        The agency's misplaced priorities are harming state       governments as well.        North Dakota stands to lose more than $100 million in tax       revenue over the next four years because of the Obama       administration's ``clean power plan'' regulations. The state       will have to look to already-strapped families to make up the       difference or else cut back on services.        Disregard for the consequences of its actions has become       the trademark of the EPA for the last eight years. Policy       goals and talking points have consistently taken priority       over American families. This cannot be the case any longer.        As chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and       Public Works, I look forward to ushering in wholesale change       at the EPA. I will be doing it alongside a committed and       capable administrator.        President-elect Trump has named Oklahoma Attorney General       Scott Pruitt to lead the EPA and to overhaul the agency.       Attorney General Pruitt has seen the effects of over       regulation in his own state and has worked to stop them.        Pruitt has distinguished himself by challenging the Obama       administration on several of its most burdensome rules. He       stood up for Oklahomans against the EPA's extreme regulations       on greenhouse gasses, methane emissions, and cross state air       pollution. He took action against unworkable water rules and       air standards. He sued the federal government to make sure       that it was interpreting the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts       as Congress actually wrote them, not how it benefited       President Obama's political agenda.        Attorney General Pruitt is respected by his peers for the       work he has done. His work in Oklahoma protected the       environment and strengthened the economy by standing up for       states' rights. Attorneys general from 24 states authored a       letter in support of his nomination. They know he can and       will rein in Washington.        President-elect Trump has vowed that his administration       will overturn two federal regulations for every new one it       proposes. The administrator of EPA will play a vital role in       keeping that promise. He must make sure that the agency meets       its mission of protecting our environment--ensuring clean       water, air, and land--while allowing our economy to grow.        Our committee is taking up the nomination of Attorney       General Pruitt this week. I look forward to hearing more       about his vision for the agency and how he will help get       Americans back to work.        The EPA has made the last eight years hard for families in       Wyoming and across rural America. Today, there is reason to       be hopeful.        The status quo at the EPA is changing.                                   ____                      `The Strong Leader the EPA Needs'                             (By John Barrasso)         The Environmental Protection Agency needs reform.        Anyone who doubts the deterioration at this once-respected       agency should recall the summer of 2015, when the EPA spilled       more than 3 million gallons of toxic wastewater into a       Colorado river.        Last month, the EPA denied $1.2 billion in damage claims       from farmers, Native American tribes and small businesses.       This disaster followed the EPA's mishandling of the water       crisis in Flint, Mich.        The government agency responsible for protecting the       environment and the health of Americans has been endangering       the public's health.        The EPA has become a bloated regulatory behemoth that has       lost sight of the needs of the American people and the       environment. The agency's bureaucrats have been more       preoccupied with pushing punishing new regulations.        This red tape killed thousands of jobs in energy-producing       and manufacturing states such as West Virginia, Pennsylvania,       Kentucky, Indiana, North Dakota and my state of Wyoming.        Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, President Trump's       nominee to lead the EPA, is committed to protecting the       environment--ensuring clean air, water and land--while       allowing the American economy to grow.  [[Page S1232]]         Pruitt will be the strong leader the EPA needs. He has seen       the consequences of the agency's overreach, and he has worked       to restore its original focus. He negotiated a water rights       settlement with tribes to preserve scenic lakes and rivers.        He worked with Dustin McDaniel, a Democrat and former       Arkansas attorney general, to reduce pollution in the       Illinois River, which flows between their two states. He       stood up to oil and gas companies that polluted his state's       air and water. Pruitt has won bipartisan recognition and       support. McDaniel called him a ``staunch defender of sound       science and good policy as appropriate tools to protect the       environment.''        Scott Pruitt will be an excellent EPA administrator,       committed to reform.                                   ____                                                   State of Alabama,                                  Office of the Attorney General,                                    Montgomery, AL, January 4, 2017.      Hon. John Barrasso,      Dirksen Senate Office Building,      Washington, District of Columbia.      Hon. Tom Carper,      Hart Senate Office Building,      Washington, District of Columbia.        Dear Chairman Barrasso and Ranking Member Carper: As the       attorneys general of our respective states, we write to       express our unqualified support for our colleague and the       Attorney General of Oklahoma, E. Scott Pruitt, as       Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,        As attorneys general, we understand the need to work       collaboratively to address threats to our environment that       cross state lines, as well as the importance of a federal       counterpart in the EPA Administrator who possesses the       knowledge, experience, and principles to work with our states       to address issues affecting our environment. We believe that       no one exemplifies these qualities more than Scott Pruitt.        As the Attorney General of Oklahoma, Mr. Pruitt developed       expertise in environmental law and policy. He negotiated a       historic water rights settlement with Indian tribes that       preserved the ecosystems of scenic lakes and rivers; he       worked with his Democrat counterpart in Arkansas to reduce       pollution in the Illinois River; and he represented the       interests of Oklahomans in rate cases against utility       companies and in numerous actions against those who       contaminated his state's air and water.        Attorney General Pruitt is committed to clean air and clean       water, and to faithfully executing the environmental laws       written by Congress. He believes that environmental       regulations should be driven by State and local governments--      a notion endorsed by Congress in the Clean Air Act and Clean       Water Act. When our nation is confronted with issues       affecting the environment that are not covered by a       particular statute, Scott will come to Congress for a       solution, rather than inventing power for his agency. He       wholeheartedly believes in a strong Environmental Protection       Agency that carries out its proper duties, providing a       backstop to state and local regulators as they develop       environmental regulations suited to the needs of their own       communities.        Scott Pruitt is more than just an exemplary state attorney       general, he is also our friend. A man of deep faith who is       committed to his family and to his friends, Scott seeks       always to do the right thing. His friendship and leadership       have been invaluable to us over the years.        The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency       plays a critical role in our Nation's government. Attorney       General Pruitt has proven over the course of his career that       he has the right character, experience, and knowledge to       serve as the Administrator of the EPA. We urge the Senate to       confirm his nomination.            Sincerely,        Jeff Landry, Attorney General, State of Louisiana; Alan       Wilson, Attorney General, State of South Carolina; Luther       Strange, Attorney General, State of Alabama; Marty Jackley,       Attorney General, State of South Dakota; Patrick Morrisey,       Attorney General, State of West Virginia; Adam Laxalt,       Attorney General, State of Nevada; Mark Brnovich, Attorney       General, State of Arizona; Herbert Slatery, Attorney General,       State of Tennessee.

Re Attorney General Scott Pruitt's Nomination To Serve as           Director of the Environmental Protection Agency.       Hon. John Barrasso,      Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on Environment & Public           Works, Washington, DC.      Hon. Tom Carper,      Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on Environment & Public           Works, Dirksen Senate Office Building.        Dear Chairman Barrasso, Ranking Member Carper, and Members       of the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee: My       name is Dustin McDaniel. I am an attorney in Little Rock,       Arkansas. I served as the Democratic Attorney General of the       Stale of Arkansas from 2007-2015. During that time, I served       for three years as the Co-Chair of the Democratic Attorneys       General Association, I am a member of the Democratic National       Committee and was a strong supporter of Secretary Clinton's       campaign for President. I am grateful for your work on this       committee. I believe in the core mission of the Environmental       Protection Agency. I believe that climate change is real and       overwhelmingly the result of human activity. I believe that       the United States has a moral obligation to lead the world in       shaping climate policy. These challenges in a hostile       political environment will be acutely felt by the next       director of the EPA.        As you consider the nomination of my friend Scott Pruitt, I       respectfully ask that you enter this letter into the record       so that I may attempt to clarify what I believe to be unfair       criticisms of the historic agreement negotiated between       myself on behalf of the State of Arkansas and Attorney       General Pruitt on behalf of the State of Oklahoma regarding       water quality in the Illinois River watershed.        Prior to the elections of General Pruitt or myself,       Oklahoma grappled with Arkansas municipal water systems and       Arkansas industry, primarily poultry companies, over       increased phosphorous levels in the Illinois River watershed.       Pollution was substantially impacting the water quality in       one of Oklahoma's most scenic waterways. In 2003, an       agreement was executed that would require that the phosphorus       levels be reduced over the next 10 years to a level .037       parts per million. As a result, all parties on both sides of       the state line worked diligently to substantially improve the       water quality.        At the same time, then-Oklahoma Attorney General Drew       Edmondson filed suit using an out of state plaintiffs' firm       against Arkansas's poultry industry. Many criticized the       litigation as taking the focus away from the environment and       placing it on money damages. The State of Oklahoma's outside       counsel presented their case to U.S. District Court Judge       Gregory Frizzell. Almost all the claims were dismissed by the       court. The evidence was fully submitted to the judge in March       of 2010 on the remaining question regarding injunctive       relief. To this day, no ruling in that litigation has been       handed down,        As 2013, the ten-year deadline for the reduced phosphorus       levels, was approaching, two things were evident: 1.) despite       huge improvements in water quality, the phosphorus levels in       the river would not be at .037 parts per million before the       deadline, and 2.) research into the standard itself called       into question its origin and basis in hard science.        The States of Arkansas and Oklahoma were facing a point of       litigating against one another (again) over this issue to the       detriment of all concerned, I approached General Pruitt to       ask if we could reach a solution that would protect the       environment and demonstrate to our citizens that we were       committed to working together on their behalf rather than       litigating against one another using taxpayer dollars for       lawyers instead of scientists.        The resulting agreement reflects that Oklahoma enhanced,       not relaxed, its enforcement of environmental protections.       Scientists were appointed to establish the proper water       quality metrics, establish a binding standard, and at no time       were phosphorous abatement measures relaxed. It was an       historic moment that demonstrated that cooperation in pursuit       of environmental protection yielded better results than       litigation. The resulting report was recently released from       the commission and is available for your review, (See,       www.ok.gov/conservation/documents/IR%20       2016.12.19%20Final%20Report.pdf)        Recent press accounts regarding these efforts unfairly       mischaracterize the work that was done by General Pruitt and       his team, He was a staunch defender of sound science and good       policy as appropriate tools to protect the environment of his       state. I saw firsthand how General Pruitt was able to bridge       political divides and manage multiple agency agendas to reach       an outcome that was heralded by most credible observers as       both positive and historic.        As I am sure that this committee will have questions about       this matter, I wanted to take this opportunity to add facts       and context to an accomplishment that should stand as a       credit to General Pruitt's career and qualifications for this       nomination.        I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to submit this       letter to you and to your committee and to be a part of the       record in these proceedings. I thank you for your service to       our nation,            Respectfully submitted,                                                   Dustin McDaniel.

Re Debunking New York Times article, ``Scott Pruitt, Trump's           E.P.A. Pick, Backed Industry Donors Over Regulators,''           January 14, 2017.       Hon.

Tom Carper,      Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on Environment & Public           Works, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Barrasso and Ranking Member Carper: Rarely do       I feel compelled to respond to a newspaper article,       particularly one that runs in a nationally renowned news       outlet like the New York Times. I've learned over 23-years as       a State environmental regulator to value the media's role in       uncovering and exposing the truth, not to mention the wisdom       found in the quote, ``Never pick a fight with anyone who buys       ink by the barrel.'' However, the mistruths propagated by the       above captioned article undoubtedly caught the attention of       you, your fellow committee members, and many of your       respective constituents just days before Attorney General       Scott Pruitt's confirmation hearing for EPA Administrator,       and thus deserve a response from at least one of the       regulators that allegedly lost out to industry donors.        First, it's worth noting that I spoke with the New York       Times for nearly fifteen minutes laying out the facts from my       perspective as Oklahoma's former Secretary of Environment and       a plaintiff in the state's litigation against the poultry       industry, then later as Director of the Oklahoma Water       Resources Board--the agency responsible for establishing the       phosphorus standard referenced in the article. One would       think such experience deserves significant play in an article       of this focus, yet more column space was devoted to a retired       employee of the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality       who was incorrectly listed as the leader of the agency's       Water Quality Division and wrongfully given credit for being       responsible for ``overseeing the poultry-related cleanup.''       The poultry industry and its related cleanup are governed by       our Oklahoma Department of Agriculture, Food & Forestry.       Rather than insinuating that Mr. Derichsweiler retired out of       frustration with General Pruitt, instead of the fact that he       retired after 40 years of service to the State, the New York       Times should have at least divulged that Derichsweiler       currently serves as Vice Chair of the Oklahoma Chapter of       Sierra Club, an organization that has launched a campaign to       oppose General Pruitt's confirmation.        The facts that I shared in my interview with the New York       Times paint a completely different picture than the article       portrays. If I were writing the headline, it would read,       ``Pruitt Helps Deliver Water Quality Improvement in       Oklahoma's Scenic Rivers.'' At the end of the day, that has       been Oklahoma's goal in the Illinois River watershed for       decades, and that is what is happening during General       Pruitt's term as Attorney General. As I stated to the New       York Times, no State Attorney General can force a Federal       Judge to rule, or I'm certain former Attorney General Drew       Edmondson would have taken such action during his last two       years in office. Rather than beating his head against that       wall, Pruitt helped Oklahoma negotiate a new agreement with       the State of Arkansas that prompted not just a study of the       appropriate phosphorus level necessary to protect our shared       scenic rivers, which the article dismissed as trivial, but       more importantly provided for continued phosphorus controls       on wastewater and poultry facilities. For the first time in       my career, Oklahoma measured decreasing phosphorus levels and       water quality improvement in the Illinois River watershed       beginning in 2012. While many people on both sides of the       border deserve credit for this result, General Pruitt       definitely was a key player. This mere ``study'' ultimately       led to a recent agreement between the states of Arkansas and       Oklahoma wherein Arkansas committed to meet a more stringent       phosphorus standard--another shocking development for two       states that have quarreled for decades and quite the opposite       result one would expect from an Attorney General that is       being unfairly maligned as a shill for industry.        Rather than spend several more pages contesting the       inaccuracies found in the New York Times article, I will       leave you with this overarching truth. As a fifth generation       Oklahoman and someone that has devoted my career to natural       resource protection, I take great pride in the progress that       has been made in improving Oklahoma's land, air, water and       wildlife resources. For the past six years, General Pruitt       has been instrumental in many of our successes and has never       asked me to compromise regulatory efforts to benefit       industry. On the contrary, all of our projects and cases that       involved his office were given staff support at the highest       level and, more often than not, resulted in more stringent       environmental protections, Please do not confuse Pruitt as       being anti-environment because of his well justified (and       strongly supported by me) efforts to counter the EPA's       various attempts to second-guess or usurp State authority.       Rather, he has been a strong ally in defending our ability to       continue the great progress that we've made in protecting       Oklahoma's environment at the state level--progress that is       too often impeded by Federal overreach and interference.        If I can be of further assistance as you embark on your       important task of reviewing Mr. Pruitt's qualifications and       disposition to serve as EPA Administrator, please do not       hesitate to contact me. I've always found Mr. Pruitt to be a       man of great honesty and integrity, so you should have the       perfect opportunity in your hearing to gather facts before       making your final decision. If truth prevails, you will find       what most of us in Oklahoma know to be true: Scott Pruitt       stands for responsible, common sense, State-led environmental       protection efforts that generate positive results.            Respectfully,                                                       J.D. Strong,      Director.                                   ____                               [Jan. 12, 2017]  A Firsthand Perspective From a Man in the Middle: Pruitt Nomination is                                  Welcome                                (By Ed Fite)         We have all heard much yammering, left and right, about       President-elect Donald Trump having selected Oklahoma       Attorney General Scott Pruitt as the next head of the U.S.       Environmental Protection Agency. As a conservationist and       riverologist, I have worked firsthand with Scott Pruitt and       know a good deal more about him than those nationally that       are attempting to malign him.        I have made it my life's work and my career to look after       our states designated Scenic Rivers. As a state employee and       a resource facilitator (I cannot take care of these valued-      treasured water resources by myself), I always find myself       arguing for the middle ground, for the workable solution upon       which both sides of an issue can agree. I have looked and       worked for real solutions, and have implemented them with       help from all sides.        I have found that General Pruitt has always done right by       our Scenic Rivers. He has done every constructive thing that       he told me he would do. Furthermore, for the first time ever,       he has gotten the State of Arkansas, which happens to have       portions of the streams we've designated as ``scenic rivers''       originating in and flowing through their state, to agree to       Oklahoma's Scenic Rivers Phosphorus Standard--an incredible       environmental accomplishment, the impact of which cannot be       understated. Instead of engaging in years of inter-state       litigation, he did this by negotiating an agreement with       Arkansas Attorney General Dustin McDaniel, a practical and       economical approach that will yield enormous environmental       benefits.        To understand the magnitude of this agreement, one must       consider that Oklahoma and Arkansas have litigated over       Illinois River water quality for more than three decades. The       latest action brought by Oklahoma, about abating water       quality degradation from the land-application of poultry       waste in the Illinois River watershed, has languished for       more than six years in the federal district court. Many       thought that when General Pruitt took office he would abandon       this suit because he is also known for his staunch support of       farming and ranching communities. However, not only did       General Pruitt allow the case to be fully litigated, he       proactively sought this joint state solution to let science       determine the phosphorus standard for the Illinois River. In       the end, a study conducted by Baylor University reinforced       that the phosphorus standard Oklahoma sought to protect would       remain.        Last, I have not seen him advocate dismantling the EPA.       Rather, he has rightfully supported necessary laws but has       challenged the agency when they have written new rules       without Congress having given them authority to do so. An       administrative agency should not decide what the law is in       the absence of legislation.        And so, my middle-of-the-river view is that Scott Pruitt is       one who is committed to finding a balance that protects and       preserves our environment while at the same time affords an       opportunity for a robust economy to exist. Achievement of one       doesn't have to be exclusive of the other.     I yield the floor.    Mr. President, over the past weeks, we have seen  Democrats continue to use one delaying tactic after another on the  floor of the Senate. They have tried to slow down the confirmation of  many of the administration's most important nominees. We have seen it  time and again. We have seen it in agencies all across the government,  including right now the Environmental Protection Agency, the EPA.  Democrats are just wasting time, and they are doing it intentionally.  They are not protecting our environment, not one bit. They are not  safeguarding the health of the American people, not at all.    Government agencies like the EPA and one after another need their  leadership in place and they need it in place now. What they don't  need, what the American people don't need, is more political theater  from the Senate Democrats.   We have heard a lot about Scott Pruitt's nomination to be  Administrator of the EPA. Much of what we heard from our colleagues on  the other side of the aisle has simply not been true.   I want to set the record straight. As head of the EPA, Scott Pruitt  will protect the environment. During his 6 years as attorney general  for the State of Oklahoma, Mr. Pruitt has stood up to polluters, he has  worked across State lines, and he has worked across party lines. He has  done it to lower phosphorous levels in the Illinois River. He actually  negotiated a water rights settlement with Oklahoma tribes. Why? Well,  to preserve scenic lakes and rivers. He used commonsense policies. He  used them to protect the environment in Oklahoma, and he will follow  commonsense policies at the Environmental Protection Agency.   The delays we have seen by Democrats have never actually been about  Mr. Pruitt or his record or the answers he has given to questions about  his qualifications. He has answered over 1,200 questions. He has  answered four rounds of questions in committee, went for 6\1/2\ hours.  Members on the other side said these were very fair hearings. These  delays are all about obstruction. They are all about denying President  Trump his Cabinet. That is what this is all about. It is about  pretending that their candidate Hillary Clinton did not lose the  election in November. That is what this is all about.   We have seen them use the same tactics on one Cabinet nominee after  another. As the Cabinet nominees were named, what we saw was a list of  eight nominees come out who Senator Schumer had as his hit list of  nominees he was going to oppose, slow down, obstruct, boycott.  Democrats delayed. They delayed again. They delayed again. That is what  we saw in one after another.   When Scott Pruitt is confirmed today, he will take office later than  any incoming EPA Administrator for any new administration going back to  the 1980s.   Our friends on the other side of the aisle need to recognize that the  terrible precedent they are setting today with all of these relentless  and needless delays will continue into the future. It is a precedent,  just like the precedent that Harry Reid set when he changed  [[Page S1390]]  the rules of the Senate by breaking the rules. The Democrats need to  see how their actions will continue to play forward, will affect the  confirmation process for all future administrations, including  Democratic administrations.   The American people want someone in place to run these important  Departments. What we see from the Democrats is political theater on the  floor of the Senate.   President Trump deserves to have his team in place. President Trump  deserves to have his Cabinet in place. The Cabinet nominees deserve an  up-or-down vote from the Senate on the floor of the Senate. That is  what we are going to do today with Attorney General Scott Pruitt, who  is qualified and who has been nominated to be the Administrator of the  EPA.   Scott Pruitt will protect our environment, and he will protect the  health of all Americans. He is the right person for the job.    At the end of my remarks, I will yield for a question.   So I say to you, as I come here to the floor, I chaired the  Environment and Public Works Committee on Scott Pruitt's nomination. I  listened to 6\1/2\ hours of testimony. I listened to and read through  responses that he gave to 1,200 questions that were asked of him. He  gave thorough answers--perhaps not the answers the Democrats wanted to  hear but answers that I felt were responsive.   So I come to the floor to urge all of my colleagues to support Mr.  Pruitt's nomination to be the Administrator of the Environmental  Protection Agency. He is a nominee who, as attorney general in  Oklahoma, protected the environment, worked to strengthen the economy,  and stood up for States' rights, which continues to be most crucial.   With that, Mr. President, I yield for a question.    Mr. President, responding to the Senator from  Minnesota, I think he may be referring to a part where I say: The  delays by Democrats have never actually been about Mr. Pruitt's answers  to questions or about his qualifications. These delays, I say, are all  about obstruction and denying President Trump his Cabinet. I go on to  say: It is about pretending that their candidate, Hillary Clinton,  didn't lose the Presidential election.    Well, Mr. President, it is my--    Mr. President, this is a very highly politicized  situation. It is not my intention in any way to impugn any of the  motives of any of the Members of this body.   I yield back my time.   Regular order.    Regular order.    Mr. President, for the past 8 years, the Environmental  Protection Agency, through its regulatory rampage, has hurt a lot of  people in my home State of Wyoming and all across the country. The  EPA's overreaching regulations have stunted job growth, hurt our  economy, and failed to help the Agency meet its mission. The mission is  to protect the environment and the health of all Americans. The EPA  needs to be reformed and modernized.   Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt is the right person for the  job. Mr. Pruitt is committed to protecting the environment, ensuring  clean air, water, and land while also supporting a strong and healthy  economy. He stood up to industry that polluted his State's air and  water.   He has received bipartisan support from Senators in this body, from  State leaders, from small business, from farmers, from ranchers, and  from many others across this country. Attorneys general from all around  the country have recognized his good work. Attorney General Luther  Strange of Alabama--now U.S. Senator Strange--and 23 of his peers wrote  a letter in support of Mr. Pruitt's nomination.   Here is what they wrote:         The Administrator of the EPA plays a critical role in our       Nation's government. Attorney General Pruitt has proven, over       the course of his career, that he has the right character,       experience, and knowledge to serve as Administrator of the       EPA.        We urge the Senate to confirm his nomination.    I agree. I urge my colleagues to support the nomination.   I yield back the remainder of my time.
