 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 233, I call up  the bill (H.R. 1868) to prevent across-the-board direct spending cuts,  and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material into the Record on H.R. 1868.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, because of the American Rescue Plan, relief checks are  already being deposited in Americans' bank accounts, furloughs have  already ended for tens of thousands of workers, and we have averted the  unemployment cliff. But we have a loose end to tie up before our work  is finished, and that is the bill before us.   Enacting COVID relief through budget reconciliation was always plan  B, but the American people could not afford any more delays, and  Congress needed a path forward for the American Rescue Plan and the  transformative support it provides. Because paygo requirements cannot  be changed in reconciliation bills, we knew from the outset that this  additional legislative fix was needed to avert painful and  indiscriminate cuts to Medicare, farm supports, and other programs.   The language of H.R. 1868 should look familiar. Over the past year,  Congress has enacted multiple COVID relief packages to address the  crises facing the American people and our economy. Each time, we  excluded these bills from statutory paygo calculations because of the  dire impact sequestration would have on our Nation's seniors, students,  farmers, and others.   Today's bill will ensure the American Rescue Plan is treated the same  as these previous relief measures and treated the same as the last  reconciliation bill passed by Congress. That was in 2017, when  Republicans used reconciliation to pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   Following the bill's passage without Democratic support in either the  House or Senate, Republicans proposed this same legislative fix, albeit  buried in a problematic continuing resolution. Enough House and Senate  Democrats joined Republicans to prevent harmful across-the-board cuts  to critical programs I mentioned, even though we opposed the short-term  CR and the massive tax giveaways to the wealthy.   This time the situation is flipped, but the same nonetheless. House  Republicans opposed the American Rescue Plan. I don't understand their  position. This bill is supported by more than 70 percent of Americans  and will directly benefit far more. But that is the choice they made.  Either way, a statutory legislative fix for paygo is now needed and,  historically, that has been enacted with little dispute.   Even in the wake of contentious legislation, Congress has come  together to prevent sequestration and to protect Medicare, farm support  programs, social services, resources for students and individuals with  disabilities, and other programs Americans rely on. This time should be  no different.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Scott), the distinguished chairman of the Committee on  Education and Labor, and also a member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind the gentleman from  Virginia that in 2017 when Republicans passed an almost identical  amount of tax cuts, 83 percent of which went to the top 1 percent and  major corporations, Mitch McConnell said on the Senate floor:  Sequestration has never happened, will not happen now, and will never  happen. His words were prophetic because it is not going to happen  today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Pallone), the distinguished chairman of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. Craig), a distinguished member of the Energy and  Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr.   David Scott), who is the distinguished chairman of the  Agriculture Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Georgia an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Panetta), who is a distinguished member of the Ways and  Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from California.    Mr. Speaker, I want to remind the gentleman from  Mississippi, along with all the other Members of this body, that his  citizens will receive, in total, $900 million from just the $1,400  checks. That is the average that every congressional district is going  to receive, and I hope that at some point they will realize the  benefits of that injection of capital into an economy that is  struggling.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr.  Courtney), who is a distinguished member of the Education and Labor  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), a distinguished member of  the Budget Committee.  [[Page H1595]]         Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time remains  on both sides?    Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a distinguished member of the  Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Doggett), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Mrs. Bustos), a distinguished member of the Committee on  Agriculture and Committee on Appropriations.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, the last couple of months have been an incredibly busy  time. The work that was done on the American Rescue Plan, from start to  finish, was extraordinary, and we owe our staffs an enormous debt of  gratitude, and not just the Budget Committee staff, but the staff of  the 12 committees that also contributed to the drafting of the American  Rescue Plan.   I would like to take this time to read the names of the Budget  Committee staff who pulled all-nighters, all-weekenders, and went way  beyond the call of duty in doing the work on the American Rescue Plan:   Erika Appel, Ellen Balis, Samantha Carter, Edward Etzkorn, Jose  Guillen, Jocelyn Harris, Emily King, Sarah Lee, Sheila McDowell, Diana  Meredith, Leyla Mocan, Kimberly Overbeek, Barbara Pike, Katie Raymond,  Scott Russell, Laura Santos, Raquel Spencer, Greg Waring, Alexandra  Weinroth, Christie Wentworth, Jennifer Wheelock, Sam Wice, Ted Zegers,  and Grady Stevens. I want to thank all of them personally for their  work on behalf of the House.   In closing, Mr. Speaker, I just want to say this: You know, we have  heard a lot of newly found concern about the deficit and the debt  today. We heard it during the debates. This is the same party that  drove up the deficit 3 years ago, 4 years ago now, with a $2 trillion  tax cut, most of which benefitted the wealthiest Americans, and,  according to virtually everyone who has looked at it, didn't even come  close to paying for itself.   What we have done in the American Rescue Plan is give an incredible  boost to the American people, the American people who need the boost  most. Not one dollar in the American Rescue Plan goes to the top 1  percent of Americans. The vast majority goes to middle- and lower- income people struggling to get by.   I am kind of amused when people talk about their States being  cheated. The gentleman from Georgia talked about how Georgia was  cheated. Under the American Rescue Plan, Georgia gets over $8 billion,  twice as much as Georgia got under the CARES Act. That doesn't even  count all of the money that is going to the Georgia citizens.   As I said, in every congressional district in this country, on  average, the people, the citizens we represent, will get $900 million,  every congressional district.   My friend from Missouri talked about his family of four. I know his  math is better than this, but a family of four doesn't get $1,400, as  he mentioned. A family of four gets $1,400 times four, which is $5,600,  and then two children, depending on their ages, get at least $3,000  each. So that family of four is going to get $11,000 out of this bill.    The talk about future generations, I love that. You know, I am sure  that when the national debt reached $1 billion under Abraham Lincoln,  there were people saying: ``Wow, we are laying an incredible burden on  our grandchildren.'' When it reached $1 trillion under Ronald Reagan, I  am sure there were people saying the same thing. And when it gets to  $50 trillion, as it probably will in the next couple of decades, people  will be saying the same thing.   We have been accumulating debt for our entire history, and yet no one  has ever been asked to pay for that debt, and no one ever will.   So all in all, we are very proud of the American Rescue Plan. The  American people love the American Rescue Plan. This fix, which we ask  for today, is something that, again, is just what the Republicans asked  to do in 2017. It is a routine measure. Nobody wants to cut Medicare to  providers and certainly benefits to our citizens. I am sure we will  have a bipartisan vote on this today, and I urge all of my colleagues  to support H.R. 1868.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
