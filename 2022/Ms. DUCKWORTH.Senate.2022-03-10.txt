 Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to  the remarkable life of Ms. Stephanie Denise Shannon, who passed away on  September 8, 2021.   Stephanie was born March 24, 1986, in Detroit, MI, to her late  father, William Everett Shannon, Sr., and her mother, Toni Laverne  Shannon. Upon completing high school, Stephanie attended Wayne State  University, where she pursued her passion for helping animals by  studying veterinary science. To her close friends, she will be  remembered as a kind and gentle spirit that loved video games and  enjoyed watching a variety of films. Stephanie was not only a dedicated  and loyal friend, daughter, and sister, but she was also a devoted  mother to her son, Cason, whom she referred to as her ``Prince'' and  her daughter, Madison, whom she referred to as her ``Mini Me.'' The  love and light that made so many love and appreciate Stephanie will be  passed down and live through her incredible children. May her radiant  and loving spirit be remembered by all those who knew her.                            ____________________
