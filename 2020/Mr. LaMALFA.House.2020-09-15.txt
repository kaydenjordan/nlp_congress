 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Sheriff Jon  Lopey, who has served as Siskiyou County sheriff for many years.  [[Page H4417]]    He served the people there well. He has been a friend in his 10 years  of service as sheriff-coroner of Siskiyou County. He will be, indeed,  retiring later this week.   He has been an excellent leader in the north State, leading the other  sheriffs; keeping the peace in the area; eradicating illegal marijuana  growth on public lands, something that is a widespread problem up that  way; and staying tough on crime.   Most recently, Sheriff Lopey has been tasked with evacuating Happy  Camp, California, with the tragic fire that has occurred there very  recently. It just partly destroyed the whole town by what is known as  the Slater fire currently burning in Siskiyou County.   Although never an easy task, I sincerely appreciate his dedication to  providing the very best safety and service to his citizens. As a  constitutional sheriff, he is always looking out for all of our rights.   Mr. Speaker, I wish Sheriff Lopey and his wife, Maxine, the best  during his retirement and happy trails.                            ____________________
