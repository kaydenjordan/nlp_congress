 Mr. President, I rise with my colleagues on the floor this  evening to discuss the very unfortunate actions of my Senate colleague  from Alabama, blocking the advancements and promotions for hundreds of  military officers.   I am a Senator from Virginia. Virginia is as connected to the U.S.  military mission as any State. One out of every nine Virginians is a  veteran. Our Active-Duty community is massive. Our military families,  reservists, Guard men and women, DOD civilians, and DOD contractors  create a Commonwealth deeply, deeply connected to the American military  mission.   The map of Virginia--Yorktown, where the Revolutionary War ended; the  battlefields of the Civil War; Appomattox, where the Civil War ended;  Bedford, where a core of young people from that tiny mountain community  served and died on D-day; the Pentagon, where we were attacked on 9/ 11--our map is a map of American military history. We train all Marine  officers at Quantico. We have the largest naval base in the world in  Norfolk and the largest military personnel facility in the world at the  Pentagon. Virginia is steeped in the Nation's military mission.   I also rise as a member of the Armed Services Committee and as the  father of a U.S. marine to urge my colleague from Alabama, as have my  other friends on the floor tonight, to stop punishing our troops and  their families, to stop punishing our troops and their families.   I want to talk about the policy, I want to talk about the stunt, and  I want to talk about the victims.   The policy: Senator Tuberville objects to the fact that the  Department of Defense will allow a servicemember to take time off and  travel to terminate a pregnancy lawfully. He objects to that policy.   Is that policy an unreasonable policy? No. It has been Federal policy  since the Reagan administration that Federal funds could pay for a  Peace Corps volunteer to travel to terminate a pregnancy lawfully if  the place where that Peace Corps volunteer was serving did not offer  reproductive healthcare access. The Reagan administration was a  Republican administration. The policy announced with respect to Peace  Corps volunteers in the 1980s was written by then-Department of Justice  lawyer Ted Olson, who became the Solicitor General under the Bush  administration.   So, for now 40 years, it has been Federal policy that if a Peace  Corps volunteer chooses to lawfully terminate a pregnancy, the Federal  Government will both allow her time off and pay for her travel--in  Democratic and Republican administrations.   It is, similarly, Federal policy that a female prisoner committed to  the Federal Bureau of Prisons will be allowed to travel to terminate a  pregnancy lawfully and that the Federal Government will pay for that  travel. So the policy has been now for 40 years that the Federal  Government will pay for travel of Peace Corps volunteers and Federal  prisoners to lawfully terminate a pregnancy.   Senator Tuberville wants women servicemembers to have fewer rights  than Federal prisoners. Senator Tuberville wants women servicemembers  to not be accorded the same choice and protection that we have accorded  Peace Corps volunteers since the early 1980s during the Reagan  administration.   Why--why--would we say to women who volunteer to wear the uniform of  this country and risk their lives that you are not entitled to what we  have allowed Peace Corps volunteers and Federal prisoners to have for  decades?   What is it about pledging to wear the uniform and offer your life and  service to the Nation that should disable you from rights that have  been afforded to others?   This is the policy that Senator Tuberville wants to reverse. He wants  to mandate that our servicewomen receive fewer rights and fewer  protections than Federal prisoners or Peace Corps volunteers.   I find that proposal outrageous. I find that proposal deeply  inequitable. But I do defend my colleague's right to have that opinion,  if that is his opinion. We have 100 people in this body. We have a lot  of different opinions about a lot of different things. But there is a  right way and a wrong way.   And so now let me move from the policy to the stunt. I am on the  Armed Services Committee. I have my chair here. I have been so pleased  to serve with him for the 10 years I have been in the Senate. And he  knows I have often offered amendments as part of our annual Defense  bill where I failed. I have tried to convince my colleagues, for  example, in the writing of the Defense bill to terminate outdated war  authorizations, and I have been told, no, this is not the right  committee for that; that should be in the Foreign Relations Committee.  I have asked for a vote anyway, and I lost. I couldn't convince my  colleagues that I was right.   We had a significant debate a few years ago about whether we should  do across-the-board cuts in the headquarters of the Pentagon, and I was  worried about what across-the-board cuts might do to things like  military housing. So I tried to convince my colleagues to see things my  way and, instead, adopt my position, and I failed. I had the  opportunity to persuade them, but I couldn't persuade a majority.   So what do you do when you can't persuade a majority? Do you punish  people who had nothing to do with the policy that you disagree with?  No. Not a single member of our committee has ever taken this step  during the 10 years that I have been on the committee until Senator  Tuberville has decided to undertake this stunt.   Senator Tuberville had an opportunity in connection with the Defense  bill in the committee to advocate his position--it was actually an  amendment drafted by Senator Ernst, and Senator Tuberville was the  cosponsor--to reverse the policy I described earlier and to take away  rights from servicewomen--rights that are enjoyed by Federal prisoners  and Peace Corps volunteers. And they had an opportunity to persuade.  And they offered that amendment, and they failed. They couldn't  convince a majority of the committee to go along with them. But they  had their chance.   And so once they have had their chance and failed to persuade their  colleagues, they now turn, and Senator Tuberville--I don't want to  assert this is Senator Ernst; Senator Ernst and Senator Tuberville have  the same position on the policy, but Senator Ernst disagrees with the  blockade--Senator Tuberville is now taking out his disappointment. I  couldn't convince my colleagues of the policy, so why don't I now  punish hundreds of military officers and their families? It is a stunt.   When you can't convince your colleagues, be more persuasive next time  or find a middle ground or have a dialogue and listen; and maybe the  next time you will try, you will do it better, and you will be more  persuasive. But, no, that is not what the Senator is doing. Instead, he  is deciding to punish these officers and their families.   And I will tell you, in some ways, the part of this stunt that makes  me the  [[Page S3600]]  angriest is the part that is happening right now. Right now on the  Senate floor, we are debating the Defense bill, because maybe you could  say I lost my vote in committee, but it is such an issue of conviction  and conscience for me that I want to have the whole Senate vote on it.  I could see Senator Tuberville--if it really mattered to him, if this  policy was really a matter of conviction and conscience for him, you  would think he would say: I know I lost in committee, but maybe I will  succeed on the floor of the Senate, and I want that opportunity. I want  the public to know we have offered Senator Tuberville the ability to  vote on this matter on the floor of the Senate. Let's do it in front of  the entire American public. You stand up and you say why the Department  of Defense policy is wrong and you put it to a vote and make every one  of the 100 Senators vote on it.   We have given him that opportunity. As of right now, 5 after 11, the  night before we hope to finish the NDAA, he has not accepted it.   Wait a minute. Does he even care about this issue? If it is a matter  of conscience and conviction, wouldn't you want to debate it on the  floor of the Senate to show how much you care about it? But as of right  now, he has not accepted our offer to allow him to have this vote.   Why hasn't he accepted the offer? He knows he is going to lose and  probably lose worse than he lost in the committee because there are  many people--both Democrats and Republicans--who are tired of the  punishment that he is meting out on these military officers. That is  why this is a stunt.   If he had the courage of his convictions, he would be on the floor  listening to this right now. If he had the courage of his convictions,  he would be asking for a vote. If he had the courage of his  convictions, he would be accepting the outcome of the vote. And if  unsuccessful, he would stop this foolish blockade.   Last, about the victims: My colleagues have done a very good job of  talking about who is being damaged and how. It is these officers,  certainly, but it is really their families--the inability to move, to  find a new school for your children. We have officers among the list of  those being blockaded who, on the assumption of a promotion, because it  has been done as a matter of course for decades--sold a home, can't buy  a new one because the new orders haven't yet come through and have had  to pay out of their personal funds to move their families because the  military won't pay to move them, hoping that they might be able to get  reimbursed.   We have a Virginia officer who has been blocked a promotion, whose  wife is a public-school teacher who had resigned from her job and not  accepted the contract for the public school for the next year on the  thought that she would be looking for a job in a new jurisdiction for a  public school. And now she is out of the past job without the ability  to go find a new job. What did they do to deserve this?   My colleagues have pointed out that Senator Tuberville does not  object to the qualifications of any of these people. He voted for them  in committee. In addition, Senator Tuberville has not asserted that a  single one of these people had anything to do with the policy he  doesn't like.   I mean, it would be one thing if we were nominating for a promotion  the individual who developed the policy that Senator Tuberville didn't  like. You might understand him subjecting that individual to some more  significant scrutiny and even opposition. But none of these people had  anything to do with the travel policy announced by the Department of  Defense after the Dobbs decision.   So punishing people who were serving this country, who had nothing to  do with the policy that you complain about; punishing them not because  of what they did but punishing them because you were not persuasive  enough to convince your colleagues to embrace a policy that you  advanced. It makes no sense.   We know we are facing a recruiting challenge in the military. We are  facing it generally. We also know that in certain specialties, that  recruiting challenge is particularly acute. Use pilots for an example.  Pilots have a lot of opportunities. A number of the officers who are on  this list are Air Force or Aviators in the other service branches, and  they have all kinds of options to go to the private sector and get paid  a whole lot more than they do, but they choose to work for less because  they are patriotic about this country and they believe this country  respects them.   What does this say to them? What would you do if you were a rational  person and you had an opportunity when your promotion was being blocked  for something you had nothing to do with, what would you do if there  was another opportunity you could take?   My oldest son, who is Active Duty and now a Marine Reservist, is of  an age where an awful lot of people are trying to make this decision  about: Do I stay in the military or not? I have had a career. I have  been in for 8 years or so. Do I stay and make a full career out of it  or not?   We know from recruiting polling that we have been doing that one of  the main reasons we have a recruiting and retention problem in the  military--this was identified in Army polling--is people's belief--it  is interesting. I was actually surprised by this polling. We are not  having a recruiting challenge because people are afraid to serve or  think they might get injured. We are having a recruiting challenge  because people believe that if they serve in the military, they will  fall behind their peers who don't serve in the military; that their  peers who don't serve might advance in their careers and have  opportunities decades from now that would be more than what I have if I  went in the military.   So if that is our significant problem right now, what is the message  that is sent to people who might want to serve if they know: Wow, one  Senator who is unhappy with something the Pentagon does can block my  professional advancement even though I had nothing to do with that,  even though I have served honorably and deployed and won a Silver Star  and Purple Heart and other citations for bravery, even though all that  happens--if one Senator--only one, only one--is unhappy with something  that the Pentagon has done, they can block my professional advancement,  just for that reason. How is that going to help us counter the  recruiting and retention problem we have in the U.S. military?   My colleagues have done a good job of listing some of the particular  positions that are vacant. They have no confirmed Commandant of the  Marine Corps to come up against possibly no confirmed chief of staff on  the joint chiefs of staff, to have no confirmed head of the U.S. Naval  Academy.   Virginia is a shipbuilding and sub-building State. To have no head of  Navy nuclear reactors--we are the premiere producer of nuclear subs in  the world. The reactors get built in Virginia--in Lynchburg,  generally--and then they get installed on subs and carriers in Newport  News. This is what our State does. This nuclear reactor thing is not  something to mess around with. It is not a minor thing that just anyone  can do. To be the head of Navy nuclear reactors is a really important  position.   We just announced through President Biden an initiative with  Australia and the United Kingdom to do nuclear sub capacity building  together over the course of decades. How good would we be at this  commitment we have made if we don't have a head of naval nuclear  reactors confirmed in serving this country?   So I join with my colleagues on this floor and ask Senator Tuberville  to stop punishing these people.   They served enough. They have done enough. They sweat enough. They  bled enough. They moved enough. They sacrificed enough, and they are  willing to do even more. Stop punishing them. Stop punishing them.   I yield the floor.

I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today, we commemorate the 75th anniversary  of a momentous event in our Nation's history: the signing of Executive  Order 9981 by President Harry S. Truman on July 26, 1948. This landmark  executive order marked a significant step forward in our ongoing  journey toward a more inclusive and equitable society.   A fundamental value of the United States is to support the equality  of all. E.O. 9981, titled ``Establishing the President's Committee on  Equality of Treatment and Opportunity in the Armed Services,''  proclaimed that ``there shall be equality of treatment and opportunity  for all persons in the armed services without regard to race, color,  religion or national origin.'' By desegregating the military, this  order shattered long-standing discriminatory practices and set a  precedent for the pursuit of justice and racial equality.   The issuance of E.O. 9981 was a response to the tireless efforts of  countless civil rights activists, military leaders, and concerned  citizens who recognized the moral imperative to confront racism and  discrimination. It represented a critical turning point in the fight  against racial injustice, serving as a catalyst for the broader civil  rights movement to follow.   Over the past seven and a half decades, the principles enshrined in  E.O. 9981 have had a profound impact on our society. By integrating the  military, this historic document not only helped to foster a spirit of  unity among servicemembers, irrespective of their race or background,  but it also provided a model for progress, inspiring subsequent  legislation and initiatives aimed at combating discrimination and  inequality in various sectors of American life.   Moreover, E.O. 9981 has served as a beacon of hope for marginalized  communities, demonstrating that institutionalized prejudice can be  dismantled  [[Page S3613]]  through bold leadership, determined activism, and collective will. Its  legacy has reverberated far beyond the military, contributing to the  broader struggle for civil rights and social justice, including the  landmark civil rights legislation of the 1960s and the ongoing quest  for racial equality today.   As we celebrate this significant milestone, it is essential that we  reflect on the progress made and acknowledge the work that remains  unfinished. While E.O. 9981 marked a pivotal moment, we recognize that  systemic racism continues to persist in various forms, demanding our  unwavering commitment to its eradication. In honoring the 75th  anniversary of E.O. 9981, let us recommit ourselves to the enduring  principles of equality and justice for all. Let us continue to strive  for a society that values diversity, inclusivity, and equal  opportunity, where the color of one's skin does not determine their  worth or limit their potential.   As members of Congress, entrusted with the duty of shaping  legislation and promoting the well-being of all Americans, I urge you  to draw inspiration from the spirit of E.O. 9981 and to uphold our  fundamental American values. Although our painful history cannot be  erased, let us work together to enact policies that dismantle systemic  barriers, rectify historical injustices, and build a more equitable and  harmonious future for our Nation.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I am introducing the Auto Reenroll  Act of 2023, alongside Senator Cassidy. Enacting this bill would  improve financial security for Americans by strengthening their private  retirement savings.   Nearly 7 in 10 Americans working in the private sector have access to  employer-sponsored retirement plans, but a quarter of those with access  do not participate in those plans. This means less money saved for  retirement. Often, it means leaving money on the table, in the form of  employer-matching contributions. Encouraging more employees to  participate in their workplace plans would increase their overall  compensation and improve their financial security and retirement  outlook.   The Auto Reenroll Act of 2023 would boost participation by  encouraging safe harbor retirement plans to adopt automatic  reenrollment features. Automatic enrollment plans have been  tremendously successful at encouraging workers to participate in  employer-sponsored plans, but employees who opt out of participating at  the beginning of their tenure will likely never reconsider that  decision. This bill would build on the success of auto enrollment by  permitting employers to reenroll nonparticipants once every 3 years,  providing them another opportunity to consider participation. This  would encourage those employees to reassess their nonparticipation as  their financial situation evolves.   I encourage my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation to  bolster private retirement savings.                                  ______                                         By Mr. KAINE (for himself and Mr. Warner):   S. 2547. A bill to amend the Natural Gas Act to bolster fairness and  transparency in the consideration of interstate natural gas pipeline  permits, to provide for greater public input opportunities in the  natural gas pipeline permitting process, and for other purposes; to the  Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.    Madam President, today, I am introducing a bill to make  the process of siting natural gas pipelines fairer, more transparent,  and more responsive to landowner concerns.   For some time now, I have been listening to Virginians with  passionate views on the process involved in permitting the Mountain  Valley Pipeline, as well as the previous proposal for the Atlantic  Coast Pipeline. For various reasons, many oppose one or both of these  projects, while others support these projects. The Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission, FERC, is tasked with analyzing all the issues-- purpose and need for a project, impacts on people living on the route,  potential risks to the environment or property--and deciding what  course best serves the public interest.   From listening to all sides, I have concluded that while reasonable  people may reach different conclusions, FERC's public input process is  flawed and could be better. Accordingly, this legislation proposes  several steps to address several shortcomings, all of which were  originally brought to my attention by Virginia constituents. For  instance, this bill requires programmatic analysis of pipelines  proposed around the same time and in the same geographic vicinity so  that the full impacts of multiple projects can be analyzed. It requires  a greater number of public comment meetings so that citizens are not  required to commute long distances to meetings at which they must speed  through just a few minutes of remarks on these complex topics. It  ensures that affected landowners are given proper notice and  compensation. It guarantees that landowner complaints will be heard  before construction commences. And it clarifies the circumstances under  which eminent domain should and should not be used.   I am pleased to be joined by my colleague Senator Mark Warner on this  bill. The public deserves reasonable opportunity to weigh in on energy  infrastructure projects, and we are heeding calls by our constituents  to make this process fairer and more transparent without mandating a  particular outcome.   I encourage the Senate to consider this legislation, not to pave the  way for pipelines nor to throw up insurmountable roadblocks to them but  to give the public greater certainty that the Federal Government's  infrastructure decisions are fair and transparent.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I am introducing the Auto Reenroll  Act of 2023, alongside Senator Cassidy.
