 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the fiscal year  2021 National Defense Authorization Act. This NDAA will provide the  tools and resources essential to maintaining our national security.   I am pleased that the conference report includes a 3 percent pay  raise for our troops and invests robustly in initiatives to compete  with China, Russia, and others who threaten our security around the  world.   The conference report includes vital investments in our fleet, our  readiness, and continued construction of the Virginia-class submarine  and the modernization of our nuclear deterrence through the Columbia- class submarine.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to supporting the final passage of this  bipartisan legislation and I urge my colleagues to do the same.
