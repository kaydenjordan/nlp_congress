 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this bill  which will set forth the repeal of ObamaCare. But I also am concerned  that the bill doesn't have a basic amendment which would allow for the  importation of drugs from Canada.   Senator Sanders courageously, on Wednesday night, went on the floor  and introduced an amendment to allow for the importation of drugs from  Canada that the overwhelming number of Republicans and Democrats  support. It was appalling that 13 Senate Democrats voted against the  Sanders amendment, and they did so because the pharmaceutical industry  is a cancer on this body; the pharmaceutical companies' contributions  are a cancer.   We need to allow for the importation of drugs, we need that to be an  amendment to this bill, and we need to take it up as a body.    Mr. Speaker, I want to say what an honor it is to be on  this Committee with Chairman Thornberry and Ranking Member Smith and  their leadership. When I joined, I was told this was one of the only  bipartisan committees in the House. While we had a disagreement--and I  associate myself with Ranking Member Smith's remarks--I will say that,  to me, the debate seemed civil. It seemed genuine on philosophical and  constitutional principles. I am hopeful that, after this debate, we  will be able to work in a bipartisan way.   I know General Mattis was out in Silicon Valley. He has tremendous  respect in the Valley for dealing with issues of cybersecurity and the  future of the military. I think some of those ideas can help our  troops. I look forward to working on the Committee to support those  initiatives.
