 Madam Speaker, I rise today because seniors in my district  are walking out of the pharmacy without their medications after they  look at the out-of-pocket price and say to themselves, ``I can't afford  this.'' They are not taking the medications they need, which  jeopardizes their lives, and this is unacceptable.   It is their health--their very lives--that are on the line. That is  why, when we are talking about prescription drugs, we must focus on  lowering the out-of-pocket costs for seniors.   That is why I support H.R. 3, the Lower Drug Costs Now Act, because  it requires Medicare to negotiate drug prices so that my constituents  can get a fair and affordable price for their medication. It also caps  the annual out-of-pocket costs for those seniors who require many  medications or expensive medication.   No one should have to choose between buying groceries to eat or  getting medications they need, and H.R. 3 will lower costs so seniors  don't have to make that decision.                            ____________________
