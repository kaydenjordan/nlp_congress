 Mr. President, I rise to solemnly remember the 49  individuals who died and the 53 who were wounded at Pulse Orlando, an  LGBT nightclub in Orlando, FL, 2 years ago.   I will never forget waking up in the early hours that Sunday, to hear  that a 29-year-old gunman, armed with a Sig Sauer MCX assault rifle,  walked into a nightclub and massacred 49 individuals in one of the  deadliest mass shootings ever witnessed in our country.   To this day, so many lives impacted from the attack are still on the  long road to recovery and healing. To all of the families and loved  ones of those who were lost and injured during the attack, please  continue to accept my deepest condolences.   Please also know I will not rest until our country is safe from gun  violence. We cannot simply sit back and do nothing while mass shootings  continue to devastate our communities, our places of worship, our music  venues, our schools, and our workplaces.   In the days that followed the Pulse nightclub attack, I, along with  Senator Nelson and a number of my colleagues, resurrected calls for  legislation to allow the FBI to deny gun transfers to known or  suspected terrorists who pose a public safety risk.   The legislation was a direct response to Pulse. In fact, the gunman  in Orlando was ISIL-inspired and fueled by hateful extremism and had  previously been placed on the FBI's Terrorist Watchlist after earlier  investigative warnings to the FBI were made about him.   And, yet, the man was allowed to walk into a gun store, pass a  background check without any notification to the FBI, and walk out with  a Sig Sauer MCX, a modern assault rifle with devastating killing  capability.   Alarming statistics over a 10-year period demonstrate that, from  February 2004 through December 2014, there were 2,233 cases in which a  known or suspected terrorist identified in Federal terrorist watchlist  records attempted to buy or receive a gun or explosives.   In 91 percent of these cases--a total of 2,043 different times--the  known or suspected terrorist was cleared to buy or receive the firearm  or explosives. In 2013 and 2014 alone, FBI data specifically showed  that individuals on terrorist watchlists were involved in firearm- related background checks 485 times, and 455 of those--about 94  percent--were allowed to proceed.   It appeared there was widespread agreement to finally take action and  ensure that no one who is a known or suspected terrorist, with ISIL  affiliations, would be allowed to walk into a gun store and pass a  Federal background check to obtain a gun. However, because of the gun  lobby's strident opposition, and Republican submission to that  opposition, the legislation withered and failed.   Unfortunately, the problem of mass shootings has continued to  devastate this Nation. In October 2017 in Las Vegas, a single gunman  with multiple assault rifles outfitted with bump stocks killed 58  people gathered to listen to a concert from his hotel room window.  Numerous eyewitness accounts described the scene as a ``warzone.''   In Sutherland Springs, TX, in November 2017, a gunman walked into a  church sanctuary on a Sunday, and killed 26 people, ranging from the  elderly to young children.   Earlier this year, a 19-year-old gunman who legally purchased an AR- 15 style rifle just after his 18th birthday used it to kill 14 of his  former high school classmates and three educators at Marjory Stoneman  Douglas High School in Parkland, FL.   These shootings are heartbreaking. Time and again, I have stood here  to ask my colleagues to show courage, to stand up to the gun lobby, and  do something. These calls are only growing louder. Young people are now  also taking to the streets like never before and demanding action.   They are calling for weapons of war to be taken off of our streets,  and they are calling for universal background checks. They are fighting  for changes to our laws because they don't want to live in a country  where although we are 4.4 percent of the world's population, we possess  over 44 percent of the world's firearms.  [[Page S3758]]    They don't want to live in a country where it is more politically  expedient to bar doorways at schools, rather than ban assault weapons.  They are calling for lawmakers to stand up and do what is right: to  close loopholes in our gun laws and decisively take steps so they feel  safe in their schools, their churches, and their communities.   Their sentiment is captured powerfully in an article I would like to  share, that was written by Glennon Doyle Melton, an author and mother  of three children.   ``Two weeks ago, my second and fourth grade daughters came home from  school and told me that they'd had a code red drill... In case someone  tries to kill us. We had to all hide in the bathroom together and be  really quiet. It was really scary but the teacher said if there was a  real man with a gun trying to find us, she'd cover us up and protect us  from him. Tommy started crying. I tried to be brave.''   She continued: ``My three-year-old nephew had the same drill at his  preschool in Virginia. Three-year-old American babies and teachers-- hiding in bathrooms, holding hands, preparing for death. We are saying  to teachers: arm yourselves and fight men with assault weapons because  we are too cowardly to fight the gun lobby.   ``We are saying to a terrified generation of American children--We  will not do what it takes to protect you. We will not even try. So just  be very quiet, hide and wait. Hold your breath. Shhh.''   By failing to act, year after year, these children all across our  country are being forced to live in fear and have these kinds of  ``trainings.''   We are asking our teachers to not focus on teaching math and English,  but to wield weapons and fight off those armed to the teeth with  military-style weapons. That can't be the solution.   We can no longer remain silent. We can no longer do nothing. We must  stand up and fight. Our children and the generations to come demand it.  I hope we will finally take action and pass these commonsense bills.                            ____________________
