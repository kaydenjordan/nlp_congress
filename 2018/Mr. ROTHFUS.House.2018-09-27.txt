 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize U.S. Army Private First  Class Warren Goss.   A western Pennsylvania native, Warren answered the call to defend his  country and joined the U.S. Army in July of 1943 at the age of 18. He  was deployed to the European theater where he underwent training for  the D-day invasions as a rifleman.   Under heavy enemy fire and without air support, Warren and his fellow  comrades were some of the first soldiers to bravely storm the beaches  of Normandy, succeeding in their mission to secure a German  communications tower.   Afterward, Warren was transferred to the 70th Division's 274th K  Company, where he continued to fight in France and across Europe until  the end of the war.   Upon returning home, Warren met his wife, Mary, and fathered two  daughters, Rhonda and Paula.   For his heroic actions to liberate France, Warren was recently made a  Chevalier of the National Order of the Legion of Honour, France's  highest order of merit for military and civil merits.   Congratulations, Warren, on receiving this distinct honor, and thank  you for your valiant and selfless service to our Nation.                            ____________________
