 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 60th  anniversary of Motown and remarkable life of Berry Gordy, Jr., a man  who achieved one of the most significant musical accomplishments of the  20th century. Motown is the sound that changed America; it broke  barriers between people and united fans of every race and creed.   Mr. Gordy was born in 1929 to a middle-class family on the east side  of Detroit. At first, Mr. Gordy pursued his dreams to become a  professional boxer and boxed until 1950 when he was drafted to serve  his country in the Korean war. After returning from Korea in 1953, Mr.  Gordy began to pursue his passion for music by opening a record store,  and then went on to work at the Ford Lincoln-Mercury Plant.   In 1959, Gordy founded Tamla Records that would go on to become  Motown after he received an $800 loan and moved to 2648 W. Grand Blvd,  also known as Hitsville U.S.A. Due to Detroit being known as the Motor  City, Mr. Gordy, in tribute to what he felt was a city of warm, soulful  people and Detroit being his hometown, decided the perfect name for his  company and new label would be ``Motown.''   Smokey Robinson and Berry Gordy formed an early partnership and co- wrote Motown Records' first smash-hit ``Shop Around,'' recorded by The  Miracles, who would go on to be Motown's first million-record selling  record. Soon, other acts would follow, including legendary artists such  as the Supremes, the Four Tops, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, and the  Temptations, all discovered by Mr. Gordy.   In the 1960s alone, Motown Records had over 75 records in the top 10  of the Billboard Hot 100. In the 1970s, Motown moved to California and  continued to create hits with a Detroit sound by groups such as the  Jackson 5 and the Commodores. With so many music legends, Motown has  often been considered one of the greatest labels of all time.   In 1998, Mr. Gordy was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  as founder and helmsman of the Motown music empire.   In addition to music, Mr. Gordy produced films such as the Oscar- nominated, ``Lady Day Sings the Blues'' and ``Mahogany.'' both starring  Motown icon Diana Ross. In 2013, Mr. Gordy went on to write and produce  ``Motown: the Musical,'' to tell his story and the story of Motown  Records. ``Motown: the Musical'' went on to play 738 Broadway  performances, and have massively successful national tours and  international productions.   Mr. Gordy founded an American music institution that exemplifies the  unity that must exist in our country and created a sound that still  moves the Motor City today. Motown's music has become a genre all its  own and has grown to be beloved all over the world. Motown music helped  break barriers, and it is my hope that the legacy of Barry Gordy, Jr.,  and Motown will inspire the next generation of leaders to follow their  passion and change the world.                            ____________________
