Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure.   The measure before us reauthorizes the Trafficking Victims Protection  Act to make protection for survivors more effective, improve the way we  prevent this crime, and ensure that we are prosecuting those  responsible.

As the gentleman from California pointed out, he is the  sponsor of the companion bill in the House.   This legislation passed the Senate unanimously, and is the companion  of H.R. 5480. I urge Members to join me in supporting it.   Before I yield back, Mr. Speaker, I just want to say something, since  this is probably the last time we will have a chance to debate, the  chairman and myself, in this Congress.   I have served as ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs  Committee for the past 6 years, and in the new Congress will become the  chairman of the committee. The gentleman from California (Mr. Royce)  has served as the chairman for 6 years. I can tell you that there is no  better role model than Ed Royce. The bipartisan work we have done  together has really made a difference in people's lives all around the  globe.   Mr. Royce has been a chairman extraordinaire. We have always operated  under the premise that, when it comes to foreign policy, partisanship  should stop at the water's edge. And that is what we have really tried  to do.   I want all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to know that I  could not be more effusive in praise of the chairman, the gentleman  from California. It has been an honor and a pleasure serving with the  gentleman and being his friend. I cannot think of anyone doing a better  job than he has done for the past 6 years. I hope he will come back and  visit.   Whenever I have a question to think about what I will do as chairman  in the next Congress, I would think about what my friend, Ed Royce,  would do. Then I know I can't go wrong.    I yield to the gentleman from California.    Mr. Speaker, I wish the gentleman Godspeed. I know we will  be in touch. We have been a good team. It has been great.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
