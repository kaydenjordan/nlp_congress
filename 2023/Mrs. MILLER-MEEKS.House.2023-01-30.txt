 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Iowa's  former Governor and Ambassador to China, Terry Branstad for being  appointed as the President of the World Food Prize Foundation.   Founded by Iowa's Dr. Norman E. Borlaug, the World Food Prize  Foundation aims to improve food security around the world. Each year,  leaders in the agriculture industry travel to Des Moines to discuss the  latest global agriculture issues and recognize individuals who have  made distinguished accomplishments in the industry.   Governor Branstad played an integral role in creating the Iowa Hunger  Summit during his time as Iowa's and the Nation's longest serving  Governor. The Iowa Hunger Summit has been instrumental in combating  food insecurity in Iowa and around the world in large part because of  Governor Branstad's efforts.   I am excited to see how Governor Branstad will help the World Food  Prize Foundation evolve, and I am confident that his experience and  background will help the foundation further its mission to eliminate  world hunger. I can think of no better fit for the job.   Congratulations, Governor Branstad.   I also wish a happy birthday to Caroline Bender. Happy birthday,  Caroline.                            ____________________
