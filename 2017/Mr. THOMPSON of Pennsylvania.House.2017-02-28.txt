 Mr. Speaker, this week marks Rare  Disease Week on the Hill. Many Members of this House will meet with  patients, caregivers, physicians, family members, and advocates from  across the country about how their lives are impacted by disease.   The National Institutes of Health considers a disease rare if it  affects fewer than 200,000 people across the United States. Many times  the disease is accompanied by uncommon or mismatched symptoms that make  diagnosing the illness difficult, and many times such illnesses are  without a cure.   Mr. Speaker, before I came to Congress, I was a healthcare  professional, and I have seen firsthand how devastating a disease or  injury can be to an individual and to families.   I welcome the rare disease community to Washington this week, and I  look forward to meeting with Representatives from the Fifth District of  Pennsylvania, including Tom Weiser, James and Jean Rickard from  Bellefonte, Pennsylvania.   Education can help shape healthcare policy, Mr. Speaker, to better  meet the needs of the rare disease community, and I am pleased to be a  part of that conversation.                            ____________________
