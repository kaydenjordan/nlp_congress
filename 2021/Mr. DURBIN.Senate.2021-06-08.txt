 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, one of the major responsibilities of the  Senate Judiciary Committee, which I chair, is the selection of judges  to serve our Nation. It is important not only because it is a question  of measuring their standards of integrity, honesty, and judgment but  also because these are lifetime appointments. Literally, the women and  men who are chosen for these slots will have an impact on the future of  America in their courts which could last for many years and decades.  That is why we are careful with the Biden administration to not only  bring good nominees before the Committee but to make certain they bring  the necessary qualities.   This week, the Senate will consider several of President Biden's  judicial nominees. I believe they understand the role of a judge in our  system. They will bring much needed experiential and demographic  diversity to our Nation's courts.   I have tried throughout my career, and many others like me have  tried, to choose men and women for the bench who will reflect the  diversity of America. The face of justice is often as important as the  fact of justice, and if people appearing before our courts feel that  there is at least a chance for success based on the background and  experience of a judge, I think it is a positive thing.   Given the background of these judges in trying cases, arguing  appeals, and issuing rulings from the bench, I believe, and the  committee agreed, that these judicial nominees are ready for service.   Today, I would like to speak in support of two of them: Julien Neals,  nominated to the District Court of New Jersey, and Regina Rodriguez,  nominated to the District Court of Colorado.   New Jersey is really in desperate need of Federal judges. They are  facing a judicial emergency. In each of the States' six judicial  vacancies, they have been designated as a judicial emergency status by  the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.   Today, we can begin to address this judicial emergency by finally  confirming Julien Neals to the U.S. District Court for the District of  New Jersey. He is an extraordinary public servant. He has served the  people of the State of New Jersey for decades. As an expert in  municipal law, he handled several legal disputes that were tried to  verdict, judgment, or final decision, including multiple--multiple-- jury trials. He was the chief judge of the Newark Municipal Court. He  presided over 6,000 cases in that capacity.   He received a unanimous rating of ``well qualified'' from the  American Bar Association. He has the strong support of his home State  Senators, Senators Cory Booker and Bob Menendez. He has received broad  bipartisan support in the Judiciary Committee, with five Republicans  joining all the Democrats in supporting his nomination.   I urge my colleagues to support him.   This week, the Senate will also consider the nomination of Regina  Rodriguez to be a judge in the District Court of Colorado. What a life  story she brings. Ms. Rodriguez is the daughter of a Japanese-American  mother, whose family was interned during World War II, and a Mexican- American father who was one of the first Hispanic coaches in the  National Football League. Her father's job as a coach took the family  across the country.   Although Ms. Rodriguez was born in Colorado, she spent several of her  formative years in my home State of Illinois. When she was 17 years  old, Ms. Rodriguez thought she might want to be a lawyer, so she put on  her best suit, as she says, and knocked on doors in Macomb, IL, until  she found a lawyer who said: ``Come on in. I'll show you the ropes.''   Lucky for us, Ms. Rodriguez held on to that passion that first  developed when she was a teenager. Over the past 30 years, she has  served as a talented litigator who has tried 35 cases to verdict.   She has a range of experience in government and the private sector.  In the public sector, she served as an assistant U.S. attorney and rose  to become the first Latina Chief of the Civil Division of the U.S.  Attorney's Office for the District of Colorado. In private practice,  she represented a broad array of clients, from individuals to Fortune  500 firms. During her tenure as a litigator, Ms. Rodriguez has  demonstrated that she understands the importance of applying the law to  the facts in a fair manner. She has represented plaintiffs, defendants,  government, and those who have sued the government. As a woman of  color, she has risen as a partner in several leading law firms--no mean  feat.   Ms. Rodriguez has taken out time from her demanding schedule to  mentor young attorneys, just as that lawyer in Macomb, IL, did for her.   She has received a unanimous ``well qualified'' rating from the  American Bar Association, as well as positive  [[Page S3970]]  blue slips from both Senators Bennet and Hickenlooper. Her nomination  is also supported by the National Asian Pacific American Bar  Association, the Latinas First Foundation, and the Colorado Lawyers  Committee.   She has earned support across the aisle. On May 20, Ms. Rodriguez was  voted out of the committee by a vote of 17 to 5, with the support of  six of my Republican colleagues.   When confirmed, she will be the first Asian-American judge to serve  not only in the District of Colorado but in the entire Tenth Circuit.  Her historic, well-deserved confirmation will bring our Federal  judiciary closer to reflecting the lives and experiences of all  Americans. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for Ms.  Rodriguez's nomination.   The judicial nominees we are voting on this week illustrate something  that is substantial and profound. They illustrate that President Joe  Biden is dedicated to appointing legal experts with outstanding  credentials and a wealth of experience.   During his first several months in office, President Biden has  nominated public servants who will bring to the bench a variety of  professional perspectives and personal experiences. Too often, those  things have been missing in previous nominees. By confirming judges who  reflect the experience of all Americans and who demonstrate fealty to  the rule of law, we can continue building a justice system that works  for everyone.   Over the last 4 years, we have seen a concerted effort on the  Republican side to fill vacancies. They broke records, in some  respects, in the number of nominees that they brought before the Senate  for approval. Some of the records are not ones to be proud of, from my  perspective, and 10 of the nominees who were submitted for  consideration during the last 4 years before the Senate Judiciary  Committee were found unqualified by the American Bar Association.  Nevertheless, most of them made it to the bench in lifetime  appointments.   Many nominees came before us, of the Trump administration, who were  seeking lifetime appointments to become a trial judge and had no  personal experience in a courtroom. It is hard to imagine that anyone  would be thrust into that situation and expected to perform as a  professional. Imagine, if you will, the parties to those lawsuits, many  of whom stake their lives and reputations on the outcome, to find a  judge who couldn't find their way through the Code of Civil Procedure  if they were forced to. That, unfortunately, was the standard that was  used. As long as these nominees in the past had the blessing of the so- called Federalist Society, that was good enough for many of my  Republican colleagues.   Joe Biden is really responding to that by suggesting nominees who  meet much higher standards. I want to work with the Biden  administration to continue in that tradition, so at the end of the day  we can fill the vacancies with women and men who are not only competent  and honest but have the integrity and experience, both legal and  otherwise, to serve our Nation for the rest of their lives, should they  choose, in these judicial capacities.   I commend these two nominees who passed out of our committee with a  strong bipartisan votes. To my colleagues on the floor today, I hope  they will join me in supporting them.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) is  necessarily absent.   The result was announced--yeas 66, nays 33, as follows:                        [Rollcall Vote No. 220 Ex.]                                  YEAS--66       Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Booker      Brown      Burr      Cantwell      Capito      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Collins      Coons      Cornyn      Cortez Masto      Duckworth      Durbin      Ernst      Feinstein      Fischer      Gillibrand      Graham      Grassley      Hassan      Heinrich      Hickenlooper      Hirono      Hyde-Smith      Kaine      Kelly      Kennedy      King      Klobuchar      Leahy      Lujan      Manchin      Markey      Menendez      Merkley      Murkowski      Murphy      Murray      Ossoff      Padilla      Peters      Portman      Reed      Rosen      Rounds      Schatz      Schumer      Shaheen      Sinema      Smith      Stabenow      Tester      Tillis      Toomey      Van Hollen      Warner      Warnock      Warren      Whitehouse      Wicker      Wyden      Young  [[Page S3972]]                                        NAYS--33       Barrasso      Blackburn      Blunt      Boozman      Braun      Cassidy      Cotton      Cramer      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Hagerty      Hawley      Hoeven      Inhofe      Johnson      Lankford      Lee      Lummis      Marshall      McConnell      Moran      Paul      Risch      Romney      Rubio      Sasse      Scott (FL)      Scott (SC)      Shelby      Sullivan      Thune      Tuberville                               NOT VOTING--1               Sanders           The nomination was confirmed.    Mr. President, last week, China announced that it would  now allow families to have three children--a profound shift from their  previous one- and two-child policies.   Why the change? China looked to the future and realized that its  population policies would hamper economic growth. Now, the U.S.  Government will never tell families how many children to have. That  choice is profoundly personal. Yet we must ask ourselves the same  questions China is asking: What kind of changes will lead or deter the  United States from a future of economic growth and prosperity? How can  we enhance America's competitiveness? And more than just compete, how  can we make sure America comes in first?  [[Page S3978]]    The answer is obvious: Invest in American creativity. China is  investing heavily in electric vehicles, critical minerals, energy  production, computer chips--the list goes on. In all of these areas,  China is beginning to pull ahead of the pack. They are aiming for  first.   And what underscores all of their efforts? Research. Every  breakthrough, every new technology, every scientific step forward opens  new markets and drives their economy into the future at high speed.   Unfortunately, it is a different story in America. For decades, in  both the public and private sectors, we have downsized our discovery  and innovation investments. Since the days of the space race, we have  stepped away from the great challenge of discovery. If we were to  commit the same percentage of our national budget to research today as  we did in the Apollo era, we would invest $900 billion over 5 years.  That kind of an investment puts people on the Moon. That kind of  investment puts us in first.   So how do we get there? The U.S. Innovation and Competition Act would  set us back on track and at a fraction of the cost of Apollo-era  spending. As we debate and hopefully pass this bill, we must keep  asking: What are we willing to do to be No. 1?   One important way we can compete with countries like China is by  increasing support for domestic manufacturing and strengthening our  domestic supply chains. The legislation before us does exactly that. It  provides $52 billion in emergency funding to boost our domestic  semiconductor manufacturing capabilities. In 1990, the United States  produced 37 percent of the world's semiconductors, but today, just 12  percent of semiconductors are manufactured in the United States. Now,  we are facing a global shortage of microchips, which is impacting jobs  in my State and many others.   I am proud that Illinois has long been a leader in auto  manufacturing, thanks to dedicated workers like those at a Stellantis  plant in Belvidere, IL, who assemble Jeep Cherokees. Unfortunately,  that plant was forced to shut down in March due to the global shortage  of semiconductors. And last month, Stellantis announced that as many as  1,640 employees at the plant could be laid off in July--again, because  it does not have enough microchips. After briefly resuming operations  last week, the plant already has had to shut down again for 2 weeks  because of this shortage. Last week, I spoke to representatives from  Stellantis who shared that the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act  could make a real difference in terms of boosting supply of these  chips.   This funding is not just important for the assembly plant in  Belvidere. Sadly, we are seeing similar impacts of the semiconductor  shortage at Ford's Chicago Assembly Plant, which supports 5,800 jobs.  That plant was idled through April, with shutdowns extended into May.   We urgently need to act to address this global microchip shortage to  provide certainty to the workers whose livelihoods depend on a stable  supply of semiconductors. The legislation before us will not only  address our immediate market needs but it will also help prevent these  shortages again the future. This investment supports jobs across the  entire supply chain, from construction of new facilities, to  manufacturing and development of chips, to workers in the auto industry  who depend on a reliable supply of semiconductors, to American  consumers.   The U.S. Innovation and Competition Act is the result of weeks of  negotiation and bipartisan work. I was puzzled by some of my Republican  colleagues' arguments for voting against cloture on this bill. If you  don't want China's products and values to dominate the global  marketplace, why would you cede that marketplace to China--or anyone  else, for that matter? If you believe in America's products, values,  and most of all, its people, then do the smart thing: Invest in them.  Although some of my colleagues seem to believe otherwise, invective  isn't going to win this global competition. We need investment to  remain No. 1.   No one bill will secure America's economic prosperity or national  security or resolve all of the outstanding issues in our relationship  with China, but strengthening America's role as a global leader in  science and technology is an essential piece of our effort to  preserving American leadership in this world. So I put it to my fellow  Senators: Let's take a step forward today. Let's invest in the  research, the jobs, and the future that all Americans deserve. I plan  to vote in favor of the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act, and I urge  my colleagues to do the same.   Let's not settle for second best. Let's put America in the lead.    Madam President, there are still millions of women across  this country today who are doing the same jobs as their male colleagues  and are being paid less. It is more clear than ever that we must take  steps to close loopholes that allow for pay discrimination and empower  women to hold their employers accountable when pay discrimination  occurs. Nearly 60 years after passage of the Equal Pay Act and 12 years  after passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, women still only  earn 82 cents for every dollar paid to men on average. For women of  color, the wage gap is even worse. Black women make only 63 cents for  every dollar paid to White men, and Latina women make only 55 cents.  Mothers make just 75 cents for every dollar paid to fathers.   Throughout the pandemic, too many families have wondered how they  will feed their families, keep their homes, and care for their children  amid an unprecedented public health and economic crisis. For working  mothers, it has been especially challenging. The labor force  participation rate among women has dropped to 57.4 percent, the lowest  it has been since 1988. A survey last fall found that almost 40 percent  of working mothers in Illinois lost their jobs or were working reduced  hours. Nearly half of working mothers of color reported the same.   Why has this economic crisis been so economically devastating for so  many women? The reasons are clear. Women tend to be overrepresented in  the industries that were hit hardest by the pandemic, such as  restaurants, retail, and leisure and hospitality. And many women are  the primary caretakers for their families. With schools and childcare  programs closed, what choice did mothers have other than to step back  from work?   The economic hardship women have faced during the pandemic has only  been made worse by the wage gap. From wage discrimination to the  unavailability of childcare, women are not getting a fair deal. That  means working families are not getting a fair deal, and it must change.   This week, we have the opportunity to pass legislation that would  close the loopholes that allow paycheck discrimination to continue. The  Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which prohibits gender-based pay  discrimination, was the first bill signed into law by President Obama  back in 2009. Unfortunately, it is hard to enforce because employers  still maintain policies that punish employees who voluntarily share  salary information with their coworkers. Women can't demand equal pay  if they don't know they are being underpaid.   The Paycheck Fairness Act would ensure workers cannot be retaliated  against if they disclose their wages. It also would prohibit employers  from asking prospective employees about their salary history. And it  would require employers to prove that pay disparities exist for  legitimate, job-related reasons--not just because they believe  ``women's work'' is worth less. I am happy to join Senator Murray and  my Democratic colleagues in supporting this important legislation.   Women have carried America's families through this pandemic, but it  may take years for women to recover from the economic and career  setbacks they have suffered. By passing the Paycheck Fairness Act, we  can take an important step toward helping women and their families  fully recover from this pandemic and economic crisis.   I am disappointed that Republican opposition has previously prevented  the Senate from passing this bill. I hope that my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle can agree it is time to pass this commonsense  measure that will help put more money in the pockets of women and their  families across the country.    I announce that the Senator from New York (Mrs.  Gillibrand) is necessarily absent.

This pandemic  has tested each and every one of us in ways that we didn't know  possible.   But perhaps no one has been more tested than our Nation's frontline,  essential healthcare workers. They, like so many other frontline  workers, did not have the option to telework, to socially distance, to  remain in their homes, with their families, while the coronavirus  ravaged our communities--no, just the opposite. They showed up more  than ever before.   Not only did our Nation's doctors, nurses, and other medical  professionals put their own health concerns aside to treat COVID  patients, they continued to see all their other patients who couldn't  afford to delay treatment, the heart attack and stroke victims, the  chemotherapy and dialysis patients, the pregnant moms and new babies,  people who had been involved in car accidents or were victims of gun  violence.   When the rest of the world was being encouraged to stay home and  avoid interactions with people, our medical providers continued to  report to hospitals, community health centers, doctor's offices. They  did so even when they weren't provided the proper personal protective  equipment. They did so even when it meant that they had to quarantine  from their own families. They did so even when it meant extra shifts on  little to no sleep. They did so even when it meant spending each day  watching dying patients say their final goodbyes to loved ones over  Zoom. And they did so even when, in the midst of all of this, they were  subjected to racism, sexism, and hate.   An essay that appeared in the New York Times last month detailed one  doctor's experience. Dr. Chaya Bhuvaneswar--a female, Asian-American,  Boston-area physician--recalled an incident last April, when a patient  spit on her and said she ``brought the sickness.''   Anti-Asian bigotry is, sadly, nothing new in this country, and the  rise of it during COVID was certainly fueled by our former President,  who seemed to delight in coining hateful, racist terminology to  describe the coronavirus. Like so many others, our healthcare  providers, whether they are Asian American or African American, or  members of other minority groups, are subjected to racism, simply in  the course of doing their jobs.   Racism is inexcusable always, but imagine how much worse it must have  felt this past year, risking your life every single day to help a  nation in the midst of a deadly pandemic, only to be subjected to  racial slurs, offensive stereotypes, and vile actions. If this past  year has taught us anything, it is that our Nation still has a long way  to go on issues of race and immigration.   Consider this: One in six healthcare and social service workers are  immigrants. Yet our broken immigration laws prevent many immigrants  from contributing more fully to the battle against the pandemic.  [[Page S3982]]    As long as I am a U.S. Senator, I will continue to come to fight for  all immigrants. We must ensure that the hundreds of thousands of  immigrant workers in our essential workforce are not forced to stop  contributing when the need for their service has never been greater,  and we must give them the chance they deserve to become American  citizens. They have waited long enough.   I hope that, even in these divided times, we can come together in  Congress to quickly aid our immigrant healthcare heroes and other  essential workers. Whether we are witnessing horrific, racially  motivated acts of police brutality on the nightly news or reading about  bigoted verbal and physical assaults in our hospitals, it is clear that  the epidemic of racism, which long predated this pandemic, has not gone  anywhere.   It is my hope that, someday soon, we can look at one another and see  how much more unites us than divides us, but for now, let me just offer  another word of thanks to our Nation's healthcare workforce: You have  all given so much and endured so much. We are eternally thankful for  all you have done and all you will continue to do.                            ____________________
