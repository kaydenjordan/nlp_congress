 Mr. Speaker, I rise today just hours  before our 45th President, Donald Trump, will deliver the State of the  Union Address.   Members of Congress and guests will fill the Chamber tonight to hear  the President speak about a host of issues impacting America: from  economic growth to trade deals, and infrastructure investments to  immigration reform.   I look forward to hearing about the administration's successes and  the plans for the future. I know that we all want to find commonsense,  bipartisan solutions to the challenges before us.   Mr. Speaker, many distinguished guests will be here tonight, each  with a story to tell and each representing the very best of America.   I will host Mr. Bill Jones, president of Penn United Technologies.  Headquartered in Cabot, Pennsylvania in Butler County, Penn United  Technologies provides high-quality, high-precision manufacturing  solutions in various markets and employs more than 500 individuals.   Since 1971, Penn United Technologies has provided quality products  and has established itself as an industry leader. It is an honor to  have Mr. Jones here this evening, and I look forward to the President's  address.                            ____________________
