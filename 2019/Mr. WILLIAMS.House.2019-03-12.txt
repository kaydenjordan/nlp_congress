 Madam Speaker, I would like to take this time to honor  a great man and even better friend, Mr. Dan Jenkins, who passed away  last Thursday at the age of 90.   Many of us know Mr. Jenkins as a sports and literary icon. He wrote  for ``The Washington Post'', ``Sports Illustrated'', ``Golf Digest'',  and the list goes on.   He won countless awards and authored more than 20 books, all the  while representing our shared alma mater, Texas Christian University.   He was a true sports phenomenon, and he greatly impacted my life. In  fact, he played a role in my decision to attend and play baseball at  TCU. He was a vital member of the Horned Frogs golf team and has always  been a regular at TCU sporting events.   Just recently, the school named the press box at Amon G. Carter  Stadium after him. At 90, you may wonder what kept Mr. Jenkins going  all these years.   The answer is that he never stopped writing. He was quoted as saying:  ``I want to keep my mind active. I don't believe in retirement.  Everybody who retires too early dies too early.''   Sadly, no matter what age Mr. Jenkins left this Earth, it would have  been too soon.   I join the Fort Worth community in mourning an absolute legend in  sports and in the media, but I take comfort in knowing his legacy will  carry on for generations to come.   I hope you join me in praying for Mr. Jenkins' wife, June; his sons,  Danny and Marty; and his daughter, Sally, during this difficult time.   May God bless their family, and most importantly: Go Frogs.   In God we trust.                            ____________________
