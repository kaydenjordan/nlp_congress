 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the topic of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, earlier this month, President Trump  decertified the Iran nuclear deal. Tonight, during this hour, several  Members of Congress will be speaking here on the House floor about the  President's correct and necessary decertification, and discussing the  urgent need to address Iran's problematic nuclear and nonnuclear  activities.   The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, JCPOA, otherwise known as the  Iran nuclear deal, is deeply flawed and very one-sided for what is in  it, and it is fatally flawed and deeply one-sided for what is not in  it.   The so-called deal props up the wrong regime in Iran, the world's  largest state sponsor of terror, with a jackpot of $150 billion of  sanctions relief.   The United States made a slew of permanent concessions in exchange  for temporary concessions on the part of the Iranians--a point that  comes into greater focus as the sunset provisions are analyzed.   This deal is not a pathway for how to prevent Iran from acquiring a  nuclear weapon, it is a blueprint for exactly how Iran can acquire a  nuclear weapon.   We can and must do better. President Obama said this agreement was  not built on trust, it was built on verification. I am still waiting  for an answer on how you can support a deal based on verification  without knowing what the verification regime is.   The verification agreement between the IAEA and Iran still hasn't  been submitted to Congress, and Secretary Kerry has admitted that he  never read it.   We have learned, though, that Iran collects some of their own soil  samples and inspects some of their own nuclear sites. No U.S.  inspectors are permitted to participate in any of these inspections at  all.   The verification regime must become adequate and transparent, and  Americans should know what the verification agreement is.   Since the JCPOA was entered into, Iranian aggression in the Middle  East, Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere has only increased. These bad  activities have only gotten worse since all of the leverage that  brought the Iranians to the table was negotiated away in the JCPOA.   Iran has continued to illegally test fire intercontinental ballistic  missiles and finance terror. They even seized one of our naval vessels,  subsequently holding hostage and publicly embarrassing 10 American  sailors.   Iran has committed to wiping Israel off the map, and they chant,  ``Death to America,'' in their streets on their holidays, all while  unjustly imprisoning American citizens. They call Israel ``the little  Satan'' and America ``the great Satan.'' These are, unfortunately, just  a few of Iran's bad activities.   It is so important to note that Iran has not only violated the spirit  of the nuclear deal with its nonnuclear bad activities, it has also  violated the letter of the deal. For example, Iran spins  [[Page H8213]]  more IR6 centrifuges than they are allowed to under the JCPOA. They  have assembled more IR8 rotor assemblies than they are allowed to. They  have attempted to acquire carbon fiber that they agreed that they  wouldn't. They stockpiled more heavy water than they were supposed to  under the JCPOA. Iran is also not allowing any inspections at all at  any of their military sites. Iran is not only violating the spirit of  the deal, but they are also violating the letter of the deal.   President Trump was absolutely correct to decertify the JCPOA. If  Iran is serious about helping turn the JCPOA into a truly reasonable  agreement, then they should make those intentions clear, both in  private conversations with the United States and the other countries of  the P5+1, but also in their public rhetoric. Many of Iran's other bad  activities will need to cease.   If Iran does not want to save the JCPOA, then the sanctions should  immediately ramp up.   Throughout this next hour, we will discuss the President's correct  decision to decertify, as well as the urgent need to eliminate Iran's  problematic nuclear and nonnuclear activities.                                time  1900    Joining me tonight are Members of Congress from all across our great  country who are deeply passionate about America's best interests and  supportive of the President's decision to decertify the Iran nuclear  deal.   At this time, it is my great pleasure to welcome the distinguished  gentleman from South Carolina, Mr. Joe Wilson, a leader on the House  Foreign Affairs Committee and throughout all of Congress, who  oftentimes has been to the Middle East, who is a grandson of a veteran,  a son of a veteran, and a proud father of four veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr.  Wilson).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Wilson for his continued  leadership.   Mr. Speaker, at this time, it is my privilege to bring up a freshman  from Tennessee's Eighth Congressional district, David Kustoff. Last  Congress, I had the privilege of being both the lowest-ranking Jewish  Republican in Congress and the highest-ranking Jewish Republican in  Congress. But now that we have David Kustoff from Tennessee here, we  voted for each other to chair the Jewish Republican Caucus of two, and  1 day we may have a minion. These are our dreams that someday may come  true.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Kustoff).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Kustoff for his  important, insightful words.   Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure at this time to introduce the  gentleman from Florida's Third Congressional District. He is an  important voice on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, very learned on  these issues related to Iran and the Middle Eastern region especially,  and a great Member here in Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho).    Mr. Speaker, Congressman Yoho brings up some very  important points. The Iran nuclear deal was an unsigned political  commitment. Those were the words that were given to us by the  administration, and to think that we wouldn't have even asked for a  signature on something so important was foolish.    The next speaker tonight in this important Special Order in support  of President Trump's decision to decertify the Iran nuclear deal and  the need to address Iran's other problematic nuclear and non-nuclear  activities is a freshman from my home State of New York, someone I  served with in the New York State Legislature, and we are really  excited to have her here serving with us in the Halls of Congress. She  has hit the ground running and is very passionate about our military,  our veterans, and also especially why we are here tonight, the path  forward with regards to Iran.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York's 22nd  Congressional District (Ms. Tenney).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Tenney for being here,  for her remarks this evening, and for her leadership on this important  deal.   It is my pleasure at this time to yield to Congressman Andy Barr, who  is a leader on the House Financial Services Committee. He has been very  active in the efforts as it relates to sanctions. It is also important  to note that it was sanctions that brought the Iranians to the table,  and applied an incredible amount of economic pressure.   The Iranian regime that is in charge desperately needed relief in  order to get through their next election, and now the Iranians have had  an opportunity to experience life with that sanctions regime and life  without it. Chairman Barr is a very important voice here in the Halls  of Congress for ensuring the right leverage is on the table to deal  with Iran's nuclear and non-nuclear activities.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Barr).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his remarks.  Certainly in the days, the weeks, the months that are ahead, many  throughout our country will be leaning on his leadership as we discuss  the path forward as far as sanctions and the right way to reestablish  the leverage that  [[Page H8216]]  brought the Iranians to the table in the first place.   Mr. Speaker, Congressman Rokita is a strong voice in ensuring that  America has a strong but effective foreign policy, one that makes sure  that our military is always set up for success, our veterans are taken  care of when they come home. As I mentioned earlier, as I was  introducing Congresswoman Tenney, part of that effort, certainly is  ensuring the right path forward as it relates to Iran.   Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr.  Rokita), from Indiana's Fourth Congressional District.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Rokita for being here  and for his important words as well and for all of the Members who have  spoken.   I recognize House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce,  Congressman Pete Roskam, and former Congressman, now CIA Director, Mike  Pompeo. These are some of the voices during the course of these last  few years on this very important issue on the need to hold Iran  accountable and to fight for the best possible agreement for the United  States.   Over the course of tonight, we discussed what was in the JCPOA, and  we discussed the JCPOA as far as what wasn't in it and some of the  challenges that we have faced since the JCPOA has first been entered  into.   We all want to deal with Iran's bad activities. We have to ask  ourselves: How are we going to do that? What is the leverage that  brought the Iranians to the table to negotiate the Iran nuclear deal?  How do we get that leverage back?   Now, some people out there are saying that Iran is abiding by their  word and that the United States would somehow be going back on our word  by the President decertifying the Iran nuclear deal. We can have a  discussion about what violates the spirit of the Iran nuclear deal.   We talked about Iran's other bad activities: their financing of  terror, their overthrowing of foreign governments, illegally test- firing intercontinental ballistic missiles, holding Americans hostage,  and publicly embarrassing American Navy sailors. We had to pay a ransom  to get hostages back in January of 2016. They call Israel the Little  Satan, America the Great Satan. They pledge to wipe Israel off the map.  They chant ``death to America.'' They are supporting Assad in Syria and  Hezbollah.   What do we do to deal with Iran's nonnuclear bad activities? Right  now we don't have the leverage to deal with that. We really needed to  bring that to the table when we were sitting down with Iran last time  because, when you negotiate away the leverage that brings them to the  table, what is left to deal with all of those activities that we would  say violate the spirit of the JCPOA?   But people say that if the President decertifies the Iran nuclear  deal, then that would mean that we are going back on our word and that  Iran has been abiding by the deal. We cannot forget about all of the  ways that Iran is violating the letter of the JCPOA.   Why is there no accountability in debate, as we know, that Iran spins  more IR-6 centrifuges than they are permitted to under the JCPOA? Why  aren't we talking about that?   Why aren't we saying that Iran is not following their word when they  assemble more IR-8 rotor assemblies than they are allowed to under the  JCPOA?   Why aren't we saying that Iran is not following through with their  word as they attempt to purchase carbon fiber that they are not allowed  to try to purchase under the JCPOA?   Why are we giving Iran a free pass?   Does the President's opposition despise him so much that they are  willing to literally take Iran's side when Iran says that we will never  be able to inspect any of their military sites?    Before, during, and after this deal, they said that we will never be  able to  [[Page H8217]]  inspect all their military sites. The Obama administration said we will  inspect their military sites. So you have a material disagreement on  this JCPOA, this Iran nuclear deal.   We said that sanctions were going to be phased in over time based on  compliance. The Iranian regime said sanctions relief was going to be  immediate, no suspension. But why are we not holding Iran to their word  on the ways that they are violating the letter of the JCPOA?   Why is it that before implementation day when inspectors, the last  time they got to Parchin and they found particles in the soil that are  consistent with nuclear capability, and then after we discover those  particles the Iranians say, ``That is it. No more access to Parchin,''  why are we not saying that Iran is not following their commitments  under the JCPOA? This is the letter of the JCPOA.   Now, it would be great if we can have a discussion here about what  the verification regime is. I would love to read the deal between the  IAEA and Iran. When I was at a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing  with then-Secretary of State John Kerry and I wanted to engage with  him, have a conversation about what the verification agreement was, I  was shocked that even he said that he hadn't read the verification  regime between the IAEA and Iran. It really makes you scratch your  head.   I asked the question here on the House floor last Congress while we  were debating the JCPOA. President Obama says that we are entering into  the JCPOA not based on trust, but based on verification. So the  question that I posed then, and I still haven't gotten an answer today,  is: How do you support a deal based on verification without knowing  what the verification is?   We are propping up the wrong regime. In 2009, during the Green  Revolution, an undemocratic election, millions of Iranians went to the  streets. These are people who go to the streets that right now there  are people--millions of Iranians today--who would love a free, stable,  democratic Iran. After an undemocratic election, they went to the  streets. We said that it was none of our business.   Fast-forward years later, we are paying ransom of $400 million that  was disputed for good reason for decades, claims going both ways. There  is a reason why that money wasn't paid out. There was a dispute,  multiple claims, U.S. to Iran and Iran to the United States, and $1.3  billion of interest. They said that it wasn't a ransom. $1.7 billion in  cold, hard cash in pallets that had to get delivered at the exact same  moment of the American hostages--by the way, not all of them--at the  exact same moment of the American hostages being released, and we are  saying that that is not ransom.   That was a coincidence that we are signing documents in the middle of  January on the same exact day within 24 hours of each other.   Now, after we provided a jackpot of sanctions relief in exchange for  this very one-sided deal, there was an election. After that election in  Iran, members of the American media and around the world said that this  was evidence of progress in Iran that the most moderate candidates were  elected.   But do you know what that completely ignores? The 12,000 most  moderate candidates not being allowed access to the ballot. We are  propping up the wrong regime.   After our American sailors were detained, held hostage, and  embarrassed in videos and photography all around the world, we said,  ``Thank you.'' That was our response, ``Thank you.''   After all the concessions that were made as part of the JCPOA, our  Secretary of State became president for the Tehran Chamber of Commerce,  and here we are. Fast-forward to today, and everyone who wants to see  this President fail will stand with Iran before they would stand with  the United States. They will ignore Iran's violating the spirit of the  JCPOA. They will turn a blind eye with their head in the sand over  Iran's violating the letter of the JCPOA.   Mr. Speaker, we gathered here this evening to talk about the  President's correct decision to decertify the JCPOA, the Iran nuclear  agreement, and to talk about the need to eliminate Iran's very  problematic nuclear and nonnuclear activities. We heard from a half  dozen other Members of Congress: Congressman Joe Wilson of South  Carolina's 2nd Congressional District, David Kustoff of Tennessee's 8th  Congressional District, Congressman Ted Yoho of Florida's 3rd  Congressional District, Congresswoman Claudia Tenney of New York's 22nd  Congressional District, Congressman Andy Barr of Kentucky's 6th  Congressional District, and Congressman Todd Rokita of Indiana's 4th  Congressional District. I thank them, and I thank all of my colleagues  for their leadership on this issue.   There is important work ahead. There really should be more Members on  both sides of the aisle working together on behalf of the American  people putting country first on this issue.   People since the election pledged to entirely oppose and obstruct  this President on everything and anything. While the President's hand  was on the Bible, the streets of the parade route were lined up with  people holding up signs that said ``impeach him now''--while his hand  was on the Bible.                                time  1945    Last November, Americans all around this country elected a President  whose hand was on the Bible, yet people are calling for his impeachment  just for the fact he got elected. Every day we are here, we have  Members who come to the floor doing whatever they can in any way that  day, that minute, to try to tear the President down.   I had disagreements with President Obama, but he was my President. We  disagreed on the Iran nuclear deal. That is okay. We can disagree. We  should disagree with President Trump, President Obama, President Bush  before that, when we have strong philosophical differences on policy.  That is what we are elected to do. We are not elected to all just come  here and agree with each other.   But for those who are so set politically on trying to bring this  President down, so much so that they will take Iran's side in this over  the United States' side, I encourage you to rethink that and put  country over party, because we need to work together as colleagues  representing the greatest country in the world on a better path  forward.   It is a privilege for all of us to be able to serve here in the  United States Capitol in the United States Congress, because there is  so much history on this floor. There is going to be much debate ahead  on what challenges lie ahead for us with regard to Iran.   With servicemembers in harm's way, we understand and we reflect that  that is what is most important. We should never send our troops into  harm's way unless they are sent to win. We send our troops to win, or  we do not send them at all. When they come home, they are treated with  the love, dignity, and respect that they deserve on behalf of a very  grateful nation; and with a strong, consistent foreign policy and  taking care of our vets and setting up our military for success. It is  having the right foreign policy with challenges that are in front of us  in the Middle East and elsewhere.   That is why we are here for this Special Order hour in support of the  President's decision to decertify the Iran nuclear deal. Mr. President,  you made the right decision. We stand with you. We stand with the  United States. We want to hold Iran accountable. We want the best path  forward for our great country.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
