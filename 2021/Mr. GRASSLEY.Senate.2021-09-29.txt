 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, more than 3 months ago, ProPublica began  publishing a series of stories. These stories were based on what they  have described as ``a vast trove of Internal  [[Page S6756]]  Revenue Service data on the tax returns of thousands of the nation's  wealthiest people, covering over 15 years.''   I have spoken about this apparent leak or hack on IRS data before.  During the August recess, POLITICO Pro's Morning Tax, writing about  ProPublica, noted that ``it's been almost two-and-a-half months since  it ran its first story on that leaked tax data and, though the leak is  perhaps the worst in the IRS's history, the government has yet . . . to  say anything publicly about how it happened.''   As absurd as that statement is, it is also accurate, and I will speak  about the accuracy of that. The Biden administration has not said what  happened regarding perhaps the worst leak or hack in the history of the  IRS.   Now, in doing my constitutional duty of congressional oversight, I  have sent letters to the IRS and to the Attorney General and to the  FBI, who have provided an embarrassingly small amount of information in  response to my letters.   The first ProPublica story was published on June 8 of this year. On  June 11, I joined Leader McConnell and Finance Committee Ranking Member  Crapo on a letter to Attorney General Garland and FBI Director Wray.  Days later, on June 16, I sent a letter with other Judiciary Committee  members asking more detailed questions.   It took almost 2 months for the Department of Justice to respond to  these letters by sending me two copies of the same form letter in  response to my letter. Dated August 10, one of the letters contains an  apparent typo in that it purports to be in response to a letter ``dated  June 6, 2021.''   Given that ProPublica began publishing stories about this on June 8,  if I was clairvoyant enough to write a letter on the leak 2 days  earlier, I would already know what really happened. The fact that the  Department responded to two different letters with the exact same form  letter and couldn't correctly refer to my letters shows a lack of  diligence that is not unique to this matter.   In response to a different letter I sent with Senator Crapo to the  Commissioner of the IRS, Rettig, I received a recent response that  states: ``We do not yet have any information concerning the source of  the alleged taxpayer information published by ProPublica.''   Now, the IRS Commissioner is advocating for Congress to pass an  expansive new reporting requirement for the IRS. Every bank account  over $600 is going to be sent to the IRS for their review and use if  they want to go after the taxpayers. If Commissioner Rettig doesn't  even know whether the ProPublica information came from the IRS, how can  he assure us the IRS can properly protect this new information that  they want the Congress to pass? I don't think he is going to be able to  convince anybody of that.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the response I have  received from the Department of Justice and the IRS be printed in the  Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                         U.S. Department of Justice,                                   Office of Legislative Affairs,                                                     Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles E. Grassley,      Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,           Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Grassley: This responds to your letter to the       Attorney General and the Director of the Federal Bureau of       Investigation (FBI) dated June 6, 2021, urging the       investigation and prosecution of the disclosure of       confidential taxpayer information as reported in the media.       We are sending identical responses to the other Senators who       joined in your letter. We appreciate knowing of your concerns       about this matter.        As you may be aware, the Secretary of the Treasury       testified recently that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is       looking into the matter as is the Treasury Inspector General       for Tax Administration (TIGTA). She further stated that the       matter had been referred to the Treasury Inspector General,       as well as the Department of Justice.        The Department is committed to taking investigative steps       as appropriately predicated and authorized, carefully       reviewing referrals we receive, and, as appropriate,       considering relevant and admissible evidence in light of the       Principles of Federal Prosecution. See Justice Manual 9-      27.000. While we understand how important this issue is to       you, longstanding Department policy will preclude us from       providing your office with any information related to this       matter outside the public record.        We hope this information is helpful. Please do not hesitate       to contact this office if we may provide additional       assistance regarding this or any other matter.            Sincerely,                                                         Joe Gaeta,      Deputy Assistant Attorney General.                                   ____                                         U.S. Department of Justice,                                   Office of Legislative Affairs,                                                     Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles E. Grassley,      Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,           Washington, DC.

Mr. President, I call on Attorney General Garland, FBI  Director Wray, and Commissioner Rettig to take the apparent leak or  hack of taxpayers' information very seriously and cooperate with our  constitutionally mandated responsibility to conduct oversight to see  that the laws are faithfully executed.   The protection of taxpayers' information provided to the IRS is of  critical importance to the basic functioning of government. Determining  the source of the information published by ProPublica should be a top  priority for our Nation's tax enforcement Agency and, allegedly,  premier law enforcement entity. I intend to continue working with  Ranking Member Crapo of the Finance Committee and anybody else to  continue looking into this matter. I hope that we are able to resolve  how any confidential taxpayer information was obtained from the IRS and  those responsible are held accountable.
