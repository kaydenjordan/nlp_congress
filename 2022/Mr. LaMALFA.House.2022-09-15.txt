 Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to acknowledge the loss of a  pillar of our community in northern California, Didar Singh Bains of  Yuba City.   He lived a full life to the age of 84 and passed away peacefully at  his home, surrounded by his family, on Tuesday, September 13.  [[Page H7869]]    He was born in 1938 in Nangal Khurd, Hoshiarpur District of Punjab,  India, to a farming family. As a young man, he immigrated in 1958 to  Sutter County, settling in Yuba City, because of the potential he saw  in the land, soil, weather, and its likeness to Punjab, India.   Indeed, it worked out very well. Through his hard work and  determination, he became the largest independent peach grower in the  world, earning him the title of ``the Peach King.''   He was a deeply religious man, a leader in the Yuba-Sutter area,  philanthropist, and active member of the Sikh Temple of Yuba City.   He played a critical role in founding Sikh institutions and festivals  in the Yuba City area, as well as around the world.    In 1980, he started the Yuba Nagar Kirtan, called the Yuba Sikh  Parade, which has now become an annual event and a staple to the area  where people travel from all over the State, even all over North  America, tens of thousands, to take part. I have had a chance to take  part myself. It is indeed incredible.   When Sikhs faced hate crimes after the September 11 terrorist attacks  due to misunderstanding, it was Didar who led a delegation of Sikhs to  meet the U.S. President, George W. Bush, at the time.   He was a pillar of our community. His loss will be felt by Yuba City  and indeed internationally.                            ____________________
