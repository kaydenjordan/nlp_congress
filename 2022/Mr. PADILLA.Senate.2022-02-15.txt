 Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the  Transportation Equity Act, which I introduced today.   As our Nation is making historic investments in our transportation  infrastructure through the bipartisan intrastructure law, equity should  be at the forefront of the Federal Government's plans to revitalize  communities and ensure access, mobility, and opportunity for all.   One of President Biden's first actions in office was signing an  Executive order on advancing racial equity and support for underserved  communities through the Federal Government, which states, ``Our Nation  deserves an ambitious whole-of-government equity agenda that matches  the scale of the opportunities and challenges that we face.''   To accomplish this bold agenda, we need the interaction and  involvement of diverse groups of stakeholders to ensure communities are  heard and create effective policies.   Fortunately, we have a model for how we can bring such groups  together to infuse equity into our transportation and infrastructure  investments. In 2016, the U.S. Department of Transportation established  the Advisory Committee on Transportation Equity to provide advice and  recommendations on comprehensive, interdisciplinary issues related to  transportation equity from a variety of stakeholders involved in  transportation planning, design, research, policy, and advocacy.   That is why I am proud to introduce this bill with Senator Warnock to  permanently reestablish the Advisory Committee on Transportation Equity  within the U.S. Department of Transportation.   This bill would help recognize the role that transportation plays on  related issues like public health, housing, accessibility,  environmental justice, economic opportunity, and more.   I want to thank Senator Warnock for coleading this bill with me, and  I hope our colleagues will join us in support of this bill to help  redress inequities in transportation infrastructure and empower  communities to build back better.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN:   S. 3654. A bill to amend Chapter 31 of title 31, United States Code,  to provide procedures for congressional disapproval of the issuance of  additional debt; to the Committee on Finance.
