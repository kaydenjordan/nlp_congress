 Mr. Speaker, the Democratic Party is telling us that  they care about taxpayers, but the son of the President of the United  States is a tax cheat. He ignored Federal tax law on purpose. He  laundered money through 20 LLCs. He concealed millions of dollars of  overseas money, and the only reason he was able to accomplish these  feats of getting so much money into his companies is because the  President is his father. That is it.   If you are asking why we are looking for an impeachment inquiry, it  is because there were 170 suspicious activity reports at the Department  of the Treasury, which we went and looked through, and every one of  those reports said very clearly that there was evidence of money  laundering and potentially tax evasion. There were hours of  depositions. There is a web of LLCs with company names that have no  business interests whatsoever.   We have finally uncovered one example, Mr. Speaker, $5 million from a  foreign company going to a joint venture partly controlled by Hunter  Biden.    Mr. Speaker, the next day, $400,000 goes from Hunter  Biden to an account controlled by Jim and Sarah Biden. Sarah Biden  writes a check to herself, and then $40,000 is in a check to Joseph  Robinette Biden, the President of the United States. That is your  evidence. If you want to talk crime: bribery, co-conspirator to firearm  violations, and we can go on and on.   Vote for the resolution. Congress must investigate these crimes.                                time  1330
