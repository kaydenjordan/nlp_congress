 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Fiscal  Year 2022 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act,  which will help fund essential government programs that invest in the  success of everyday Americans and help build a stronger, more resilient  economy with greater opportunity and more shared prosperity for all.   As chair of the Financial Services and General Government  Appropriations Subcommittee, I developed this bill with the help of  Ranking Member Cindy Hyde-Smith from Mississippi, and I want to begin  by thanking her and the Appropriations Committee staff on both sides  that have helped assemble this legislation. Putting together any one  piece of the Federal budget is beyond the power of any one individual;  it takes a dedicated team of public servants working shoulder-to- shoulder, day-in and day-out--and committed to delivering real results  for the American people. I appreciate Senator Hyde-Smith's partnership  on our subcommittee, and I also want to thank Senator Leahy and Ranking  Member Shelby for their leadership on the full committee.   And in addition to my colleagues and partners on Capitol Hill who  have contributed to this legislation, our work has also been guided by  the input of others, outside of the Senate, who have offered their  testimony and insight. In order to craft this spending package, the  Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee held public  hearings with the Treasury Department and the IRS, a public hearing to  help understand Postal Service delivery issues, and a public hearing to  learn about the important role of Community Development banks in  economically challenged communities. We were briefed by an array of  agencies under the bill's jurisdictions and met with stakeholders who  would be directly affected by key elements of this legislation,  including residents from my home State of Maryland.   The result of those combined efforts can be seen in the substance of  this year's Financial Services and General Government spending bill,  which provides $29.4 billion to bring critical services to the American  people by funding a number of important Federal agencies and government  bodies from the Treasury Department to the Small Business  Administration to the Federal Judiciary to the D.C. courts--and much  more. Today, I would like to share with the American people exactly  what is in this bill and how they stand to benefit from the provisions  within it.   First and foremost, this bill arms the IRS with the resources it  needs to ramp up customer service. This bill includes $13.6 billion for  the IRS, an increase of $1.6 billion over last year's spending levels,  and these funds will allow the IRS to bring taxpayer services into the  21st century by upgrading and replacing aging IRS infrastructure. For  working families, that means improved service and shorter hold times  when they call the IRS with questions.   That additional funding will also allow the IRS to go after those  ultra-wealthy tax cheats who have avoided paying what they owe to the  government. Now, let's be clear: Each year, millions of folks pay what  they owe, fill out their tax forms, and send them in to the IRS  honestly and on time, and they trust that others do the same. But we  know that while most people pay what they are required to under the  law, some do not. There is anywhere from $500 billion to $1 trillion in  taxes each year that are owed but not paid, primarily by the wealthy.  That is billions of dollars that are overdue under current law and  which should be available to help fund everything from education to our  national defense. Both my Republican and Democratic colleagues know  that doing nothing and allowing this tax gap to grow on our watch just  isn't right. It flies in the face of basic fairness. While everyday  Americans have their taxes withheld and follow the law, we cannot allow  the super wealthy to evade the system. Everyone needs to pay what they  owe. By enhancing the agility of the IRS to crack down on individuals  who sidestep their current tax responsibilities, we can raise more  revenue without raising taxes by a single dime.   The investment in a robust IRS will deliver additional monies to  invest in growing opportunity and wealth in all of our communities,  including underserved communities. And that mission has taken on an  added measure of urgency as our country continues to recover from the  economic fallout of COVID-19. Our bill helps meet the full promise of  that very mission by providing $360 million for the Community  Development Financial Institutions Fund, a $90 million increase from  last year's spending levels. CDFIs are key vehicles for funding  businesses and projects in economically underserved communities. My  State of Maryland is proud to have 13 certified community-based lenders  across our State that benefit directly from the CDFI fund L, and  earlier this year, I chaired a subcommittee hearing that included  testimony from a Maryland constituent and valued adviser, Mr. Joseph  Haskins, Jr., who is the chairman of Harbor Bank in Baltimore, a  certified CDFI that has helped create $3 billion in economic  development in the Baltimore community since its founding in 2001. And  just last month, I convened a roundtable with Shelly Gross-Wade, the  CEO of the only CDFI in Prince George's County, MD, to discuss how we  can better support minority small businesses across the region.  Community lenders support a wide range of local projects, including  everything from bringing grocery stores to communities with no healthy  food alternatives to investing in low-income housing, and I am glad  that we were able to include robust funding for CDFIs in this year's  bill.   On top of that, this bill provides additional resources for  communities and small businesses through $1 billion for the Small  Business Administration, so we can make sure businesses continue to  recover from the pandemic--and can grow stronger into the future. Small  businesses are the backbone of our economy, and this spending bill puts  that notion front-and-center in our Federal budget. I am proud that  this legislation also includes a $53 million increase for  Entrepreneurial Development Grants that will encourage entrepreneurs to  build businesses and create good-paying jobs--including entrepreneurs  from historically under-served communities.   Money that goes to the SBA will also help make sure our small  businesses have the support they need to get back on their feet in the  wake of devastating natural disasters, which we all know have been on  the rise due to the growing and very real consequences of climate  change, an issue that demands this government's full and undivided  attention. Extreme weather events get worse and worse each year, and my  State of Maryland is feeling the pain of that trend right now in the  aftermath of Tropical Depression Ida. I am glad that the Small Business  Administration approved Maryland's request for a Disaster Declaration  for those impacted by Ida, which has unlocked additional low-interest  loans for businesses and homeowners in affected communities and  emphasizes how just important the SBA is in helping our fellow citizens  endure the impacts of climate change.   But if we want to tackle the climate crisis head-on, it isn't enough  for us to support those who have already been harmed by the devastating  effects of global warming; we also need to cut emissions. That is why  this bill invests $200 million in transitioning the Federal fleet to  zero-emission vehicles. There are currently around 655,000 gas-powered  vehicles in the federal fleet that spew more than 7 billion pounds of  greenhouse gases into the atmosphere each year. With this bill, that  will change. We need to take an all-of-government approach to tackling  the climate crisis, and this provision within our legislation helps us  do just that.   And as we invest in the health of our planet, we also need to invest  in the health of our democracy and I am glad that this bill is a big  win for increased campaign finance transparency in two major ways.  First, this legislation drops a long-standing rider that blocked the  SEC from requiring public companies to share their political spending  with shareholders. Shareholders and the public have a right to know  what political causes their money is being used to support, decisions  that can go against their values  [[Page S7796]]  or put their investments at risk. Our legislation will enable the SEC  to shine a light on that secret spending. And second, the bill drops a  longstanding rider that blocked the Treasury from clarifying the  definition of ``political activity'' for 501(c)(4) social welfare  group, which are major sources of secret election spending.   More transparency in political fundraising is part of the essential  mission to restore faith in government. Toward that same end, this bill  also mandates greater transparency in how the Office of Management and  Budget manages apportionments, which is the process of spending the  money that Congress appropriates. And additionally, this bill works to  ensure that our government represents the full diversity of the United  States by expanding opportunities for DREAMers so that DACA recipients  can be employed by the Federal Government. DREAMers should be able to  bring their skills, talents, and unique perspectives to government  jobs, where decisions affecting their communities are made every day,  and our legislation allows them to participate fully in public service.  This legislation also includes an increase in funding to the White  House that would allow for paid internships, and I urge the President  to use these funds to offer the opportunity to enter Federal service to  more young people.   But while we work to recruit more of our fellow Americans to serve,  we also need to ensure that those who are currently serving can work in  offices that meet their full needs. That is why I am particularly  pleased to include language in this bill urging the General Service  Administration and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to move forward  on the proposed new, consolidated FBI headquarter, a process that was  abruptly halted by the last administration. The FBI currently works in  a crumbling building that fails to meet its operational and security  needs, and it is time to move forward on the process of securing a new  campus. I would be remiss if I did not note that Maryland, which is  already home to many FBI employees, has two fully vetted sites in this  process. I am committed to getting this new campus, which is over a  decade in the making, finally completed to meet the needs of the FBI' s  mission.   And in addition to strengthening the core planks of government by  expanding transparency, helping grow pathways to service, and upgrading  Federal buildings, the Financial Services and General Government bill  also strengthens the government's ability to take on pressing crises  facing our communities, including our Nation's ongoing challenges with  addiction. It provides a 9-percent increase in funding for the Office  of National Drug Control Policy, including resources for the High- Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas program and the Drug-Free Communities  program, which helps prevent drug addiction among our Nation's youth.  Substance use disorders continue to tear at the fabric of our  communities, including in my home State of Maryland, and this vital  funding is essential both to stopping illegal drug trafficking and to  healing my State and States across the country that have been plagued  by addiction.   Finally, I would also like to note that this bill ends harmful riders  that have interfered with the District of Columbia's ability to spend  its own taxpayer dollars, an example of Congressional meddling in local  affairs that no Senator would tolerate toward their own State. And this  bill includes $760 million in special Federal payments for over a dozen  distinct purposes relating to DC, including $40 million for the DC  Tuition Assistance Grant Program to expand higher education choices for  students of the District. And at a time when we see attacks on a  women's right to choose across this country, I am proud to say this  bill ends years of restrictions to abortion care by dropping a rider  that prohibited the District of Columbia--and Federal health insurance  systems--from providing coverage for abortion services. This is sound  policy that the majority of Americans support, and this provision is  essential to protecting reproductive freedoms in this country.   In short, this legislation enhances services that help everyday  people, builds more economic opportunity, uplifts working families,  delivers support directly to our communities, fights climate change,  strengthens our democracy, accelerates our work to modernize the IRS,  and does much, much more, and we must get it to the President's desk.   While I wish we could consider this bill under regular order, have a  conference with the House and sign it into law, we are quickly running  out of time. It is imperative that we enact this spending bill and the  other 11 appropriations bills by December 3 when the current continuing  resolution runs out to avoid a government shutdown, and in order to  meet that deadline, we will likely be negotiating an omnibus. I look  forward to working with Ranking Member Hyde-Smith and our House  colleagues to move this process forward immediately because we have no  time to waste. So let's now push ahead with our work, finish these  bills, and do the job the American people sent us here to do.                                  ______                                         By Mr. KAINE (for himself, Mr. Warner, Mr. Van Hollen, and Mr.          Cardin):   S. 3183. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to establish a  program of the Department of Defense to carry out stormwater management  projects on or related to military installations to improve the  resilience of military installations and defense access roads and  protect waterways and stormwater-stressed ecosystems; to the Committee  on Armed Services.
