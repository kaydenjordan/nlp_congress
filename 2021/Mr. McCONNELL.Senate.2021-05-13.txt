 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I will begin this morning where I began  on Monday, talking about National Police Week. Yesterday, I got to  welcome members of Kentucky's Fraternal Order of Police here to my  office. I was glad for the chance to share my gratitude for their  service and hear what was on their minds.   Tragically, the past year's fallen officers, whom we will be  memorializing this week, includes one of Kentucky's own. In early 2020,  Detective James Kirk of the Stanton Police Department suddenly passed  away from a heart attack in the wake of struggling with an armed  subject. He was only 40 years old.    By all accounts, during James's nearly 20 years of service, he became  a model officer. He even served as police chief of a nearby department.  His colleagues remembered his easygoing, friendly nature and his total  professionalism.   As our Nation honors this brave Kentuckian, we continue to hold his  wife Brandy, their family, and the entire Stanton Police Department in  our prayers. Later today, Detective Kirk will join the ranks of heroes  enshrined on the National Law Enforcement Memorial.   We are also honoring our colleagues here in the Capitol this week,  the U.S. Capitol Police. On Peace Officers Memorial Day this Saturday,  we will especially remember Officers Evans, Sicknick, and Liebengood,  all taken too soon.   Their sacrifices are a sharp reminder: Standing with law enforcement  isn't something we can do only 1 week every year; we need to back the  blue all year round.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, while  Senators were back in our home States last week, the Washington Post  ran this headline: ``Chinese greenhouse gas emissions now larger than  those of developed countries combined.'' Let me say that again.  ``Chinese greenhouse gas emissions now larger than those of developed  countries combined.''   China is out-emitting the United States, India, and the entire  European Union combined. They are now responsible for more than one- fourth of the entire world's emissions. Beijing admits they aren't even  planning for their emissions to start declining for another decade.   It is a clear reality check: No matter how much self-inflicted pain  the far left might want to impose on American workers and families, it  would barely make any dent in the global calculus. Remember, with the  United States outside the Paris Agreement, our emissions fell on our  own even as our economy grew. Meanwhile, countries inside the deal,  like China, have kept roaring right on by.   Strangely, this didn't stop the Biden administration from rushing to  rejoin the failed deal. This is just one of the ways in which American  competitiveness has recently seemed to take a back seat.   This White House canceled a pipeline project that would have  increased energy security and supported thousands of American jobs.  They froze exploration of domestic resources that helped our Nation  become a net energy exporter for the first time since the 1950s.   After we just spent 4 years beginning to rebuild and modernize our  national defense, this administration indicated they will propose to  cut defense spending after inflation--fewer resources for our troops,  fewer tools to keep pace with China. They want to play year-to-  [[Page S2501]]  year games while our adversaries and competitors plan years and decades  in advance.   As former Defense Secretary Bob Gates put it in an interview this  week, cutting spending on our military would be ``a terrible mistake.''  That is President Obama's Defense Secretary, Bob Gates.   There could not be a more dangerous approach for the United States-- shortchanging the Pentagon and making America less competitive.   The first draft of the so-called jobs bill that the White House put  forward would play into the same dangerous dynamic. I am talking about  the multitrillion-dollar proposal that spends less than 6 percent--less  than 6 percent--on roads and bridges, the plan that Ivy League  economists say would cost hundreds of billions of dollars more than the  White House says; push American workers' wages down; and somehow manage  to shrink our economy despite taxing, borrowing, and spending trillions  more dollars. That is not a plan to make America stronger and more  competitive; it is a plan to pile up debt to leave us even weaker. It  would be better news for Beijing than for our own citizens.   That is the bad news. The good news is that the Senate can do better.  This body has long tackled real infrastructure on a commonsense,  bipartisan basis and ended up with bills that passed by big, lopsided,  bipartisan votes. That is what we Republicans are prepared to do again.  That is the path I discussed with President Biden at the White House  just yesterday. It was a good meeting. That is the road that the  practical proposal from Senator Capito and a number of my fellow  Republican Senators would begin to take us down.   If our Democratic friends are finally ready to reach across the aisle  and work together to locate common ground, I am hopeful we can do a lot  of good for the country and compete with China for real                            ____________________     On one final matter, the attacks being directed at  innocent Israeli citizens are coming from Hamas and Palestinian Islamic  jihad. Both these terrorist groups receive support from Iran.   The regime in Tehran is the most active state sponsor of terrorism in  the entire world. The regime supports Shia terrorists, Sunni  terrorists, and secular terrorists.   Many of the rockets now raining down on Israel cities are gifts from  Iran, technologies of terror honed by Iran's proxies in Yemen, Iraq,  Syria, and Lebanon.   Days ago, the U.S. Navy seized weapons on a vessel that appears to  have been dispatched from Iran bound for Yemen to fuel the violent  Houthi terrorists, in violation of the U.N. embargo. Just last night,  the Houthis again fired missiles against Saudi Arabia.   Public reporting suggests Iran's proxies, on top of assassinating  Iraqi protesters, are stepping up attacks on the U.S. and coalition  presence in Iraq as well. Iran is emboldened by our retreat from  Afghanistan. They are eager to challenge an administration that appears  desperate to return to a failed deal.   What former Defense Secretary Bob Gates said this week about weakness  inviting challenge from China and Russia applies to Iran as well.   The answer is not accommodation; it is America's strength. But  reportedly, this administration is considering preemptive concessions-- a huge rollback of sanctions, squandering our leverage, just to leap  back into a failed nuclear deal. I sincerely hope these reports prove  to be wrong.   It is difficult to believe an American President would consider  removing terrorism- or missile-related sanctions at the very moment  Iranian rockets are raining down on Israel, Iranian-backed militia are  attacking American facilities in Iraq, and Iranian missiles are being  trained on Saudi Arabia.   I cannot understand why the administration is considering any  sanctions relief to induce Tehran back into the Obama deal in the first  place. It would be total malpractice to squander our leverage just to  jump back into a flawed deal. That kind of preemptive capitulation  would make negotiating a better deal much, much more difficult.   Iran's own Foreign Minister has lamented that the terror masterminds  of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps basically run the country. So  what on Earth does our administration think the successors of Soleimani  would do with another influx of cash?   If the administration will stay smart, stay tough, and work toward a  better deal that truly halts Iran's nuclear and missile programs, as  well as a strategy to confront Iranian terrorism, then the President  will find support and partnership from the Republican side. But if the  administration chooses policies that leave America weaker and the world  more dangerous, Republicans will stand up for the right course.                            ____________________
