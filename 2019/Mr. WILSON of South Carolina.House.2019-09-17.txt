 Madam Speaker, in the August jobs  report, job numbers were once again strong. Over 570,000 people joined  the labor force, and the unemployment rate remained at its 50-year low  of 3.7 percent. In addition, 130,000 jobs were added in the United  States and wages were increased.   I am grateful for this consistent change for the better and for  President Donald Trump's policies in continuing to create jobs. By  creating jobs, lowering unemployment, and increasing wages, President  Trump is continuing his effective record of keeping his promises. With  more jobs created, there has been also an impressive increase in wages.   One number that specifically stood out in this past August's report  was the number of women employed. Currently, the number of employed  women is at the highest level since 2002.   I am grateful that the Trump administration will continue to focus on  American families and the creation of jobs.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.   I am grateful to recognize today is Constitution Day.                            ____________________
