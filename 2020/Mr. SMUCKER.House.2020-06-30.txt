 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this partisan  infrastructure bill.   This House can work together and can accomplish things for the  American people. It wasn't long ago that Members from both parties came  together in the face of an unprecedented pandemic to pass the CARES  Act. That act of bipartisanship saved thousands and thousands of jobs-- millions of jobs--and preserved the livelihoods of small business  owners all across this country.   Now, in the face of a new challenge, repairing our infrastructure,  Democrats have chosen a different path. They have chosen to go it alone  with a messaging bill that is not a serious effort to improve our  roads, bridges, and railroads.   I offered a number of amendments to improve the underlying bill,  including some bipartisan proposals, which I offered with my colleagues  on the other side of the aisle. While I appreciate that one of those  was adopted, the fact is this legislation was drafted with no  consultation with Republicans.   This bill will cost taxpayers an astounding $1.5 trillion,  disproportionately favoring urban centers at the expense of rural  America. But the real cost of this bill is the missed opportunity. What  better time to address our infrastructure needs, when interest rates  are as low as they are now and when we want to see the economy begin to  boom again.   Mr. Speaker, I remain committed to supporting legislation which would  effectively invest in improving our transportation infrastructure in a  way that would provide States additional flexibility to meet their  unique needs without onerous mandates. Yet this bill doesn't do that.  This bill kicks the can down the road rather than advancing those badly  needed priorities.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.
