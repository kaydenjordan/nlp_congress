 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Well, hating all things Obama, Trump impulsively tore up the nuclear  deal with Iran, even though all of his intelligence agencies, all of  the other signatories, the inspectors, agreed they were in compliance.                                time  1000    He said he would get a better deal as a master negotiator, through a  unilateral campaign of maximum pressure, and bring stability to the  region.   Instead, he has triggered steadily escalating tensions, culminating  in the January 3 assassination of Soleimani, bringing the U.S. to the  brink of war with Iran.   The Bush invasion of Iraq under phony intelligence provided by Vice  President Cheney was the worst foreign policy mistake in the history of  the United States of America, and we are still seeing the  repercussions, but a war with Iran would be worse.   Trump says he doesn't need to consult with Congress for a war in  Iran. We hear from the other side that Congress asserting its  constitutional authority regarding declaration of war is dangerous.   I tell you what is dangerous: an impulsive Commander in Chief  embroiling the United States in yet another endless war in the Middle  East.
