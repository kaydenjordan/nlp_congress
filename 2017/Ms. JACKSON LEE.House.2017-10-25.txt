 Mr. Speaker, today we will begin a journey that has  been represented to be a lifeline for the American people in long  awaited tax reform.   Sad to say that this is not a bipartisan bill. In addition, it is a  bill that will cause a great deal of challenge to the American people.   For example, in moving firms across the ocean, overseas, the American  people should know that those companies, in the construct of this bill,  will cause them to be exempt from taxes forever.   In a discussion this morning, I heard that it will not boost the  economy. The American people should know that it will destroy,  undermine, crush the economy.   The representation of the level of growth is a misnomer. Take, for  example, in 1986, in the tax reform, there was no surge in job creation  after the Reagan tax cuts. There was no high numbers of blossoming  jobs. Many in my congressional district need jobs.   It will be borrowing from the future and it will be a burden on our  children, our children's children, and their children. But the most  devastating part is the bill that we will be paying, the actual dollars  to pay down the deficit.   Of course, it should be known that we have examples that no jobs will  be created. In 2004, for example, when there was a repatriation from  companies regarding their taxes, there was no creation of jobs that we  can even recognize. Most of the money went for stock buybacks.   Now, I know that sounds completely technical, but let me be very  clear. The question has to be: What will the middle class working  families get?   I can assure you, it will be close to zero.   There are 2 million households, for example, in the State of Texas  that will be impacted by not allowing the exemption of State and local  taxes. We don't know whether mortgage deductions will be allowed,  charitable tax credits. So if you have in some way been deducting, for  example, those State and local taxes, you will not be able to do them  anymore. That will be a great burden on the working families of  America.   So my caution to the business community as well as the small  businesses, families: Be very careful what you buy into. We will have  discussions to provide you with that detailed analysis. The key is a  distribution table. What and whom will get the most money.   As the bill is presently written, middle class working families,  don't look for relief in the Ryan-McConnell tax bill. It will all go to  the top 1 percent. They will relish while, you might not be jealous,  but you will certainly be poorer for it.                                Opioid Crisis     Mr. Speaker, I want to also entertain the questions  about the pending opioid announcement of this White House. I want to  bring to the attention the article in The New Yorker on the empire of  pain.  [[Page H8152]]  I am working on these issues, but I realize that this has to be a  comprehensive approach to opioid abuse.   The Purdue company launched OxyContin with a marketing campaign that  attempted to counter this attitude and change the prescribing habits of  doctors.                                time  1045    Many people know OxyContin. The company funded research and paid  doctors to make the case that concerns about opioid addiction were  overblown and that OxyContin would safely treat an ever-wider range of  maladies. Sales representatives marketed OxyContin as a product to  start with and to stay with. Remember that. A product to start with and  to stay with.   Millions of patients found the drug to be a vital salve for  excruciating pain, but many others grew so hooked on it, that between  doses they experienced debilitating withdrawal.   If we are going to do real opioid reform, this must be a standup of  the pharmaceutical companies, and they cannot be defended.   In addition, we have to understand that those languishing in jail  that have suffered from criminal penalties for crack cocaine--crack-- there now should be a compromise for their release. Opioid reform must  include all of the neighborhoods of America, not just some.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Budget Committee, I  rise in strong opposition to Rule governing debate on the Senate  Amendment to H. Con. Res. 71, the Congressional Budget Resolution for  Fiscal Year 2018, and the underlying resolution.   Let us be very clear and direct: the resolution before us is not  intended to reconcile tax and spending priorities to reflect the  priorities of the American people or to reduce the deficit and national  debt or to put our fiscal house on a sustainable path to economic  growth.   Rather the sole purpose of Republicans bringing this job-killing  budget to the floor today is to fast-track their ``Billionaires First''  tax plan, which will cause significant harm to working and middle class  families, especially to my constituents in the Eighteenth Congressional  District of Texas.   The McConnell-Ryan tax plan, which this budget resolution is designed  to grease the skids for, would raise taxes on about 1.5 million Texas  households, or 12.4 percent of households next year.   On average, families earning up to $86,000 annually would see a $794  increase in their tax liability, a significant burden on families  struggling to afford child care and balance their checkbook.   An estimated 2.8 million Texas households deduct state and local  taxes with an average deduction of $7,823 in 2015.   The McConnell-Ryan plan eliminates this deduction, which would lower  home values and put pressure on states and towns to collect revenues  they depend on to fund schools, roads, and vital public resources.   The proposed elimination of the personal exemption will harm millions  of Texans by taking away the $4,050 deduction for each taxpayer and  claimed dependent; in 2015, roughly 9.3 million dependent exemptions  were claimed in the Lone Star State.   Equally terrible is that the McConnell-Ryan tax plan drastically  reduces the Earned Income Tax Credit, which encourages work for 2.7  million low-income individuals in Texas, helping them make ends meet  with an average credit of $2,689.   The EITC and the Child Tax Credit lift about 1.2 million Texans,  including 663,000 children, out of poverty each year.   This reckless and irresponsible GOP tax plan is made all the more  obscene by the fact that 80 percent of the GOP's tax cuts go to the  wealthiest 1 percent.   To achieve this goal of giving more and more to the haves and the  ``have mores,'' the GOP budget betrays seniors, children, the most  vulnerable, and needy, and working and middle-class families.   For example, the Republican budget steals hundreds of billions of  dollars from critical job-creating investments in infrastructure, job  training, clean energy and research and development.   It devastates Medicare and Medicaid by cutting $500 billion from  Medicare and $1.3 trillion from Medicaid, hurting veterans, seniors  with long-term care needs, children and rural communities.   The GOP budget's steep cuts in program investments fall most heavily  on low-income families, students struggling to afford college, seniors,  and persons with disabilities.   This Republican budget adopts Trumpcare but does even more damage  because in addition to depriving more than 20 million Americans of  healthcare, denying protection to persons with preexisting conditions,  and raising costs for older and low-income adults, cuts more than $1.8  trillion from Medicaid and Medicare.   This Republican budget ends the Medicare guarantee and calls for  replacing Medicare's guaranteed benefits with fixed payments for the  purchase of health insurance, shifting costs and financial risks onto  seniors and disabled workers; this represents a $500 billion cut to  Medicare over ten years.   Mr. Speaker, the federal budget is more than a financial document; it  is an expression of our values and priorities as a nation.   The values expressed by this Republican budget are not the values of  my constituents, the people of Texas, or the American people as a  whole.   For these reasons, I oppose the Rule and the underlying budget  resolution.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 580 Offered by Mr. McGovern         Strike all after the resolved clause and insert:        That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in order       to take from the Speaker's table the concurrent resolution       (H. Con. Res. 71) establishing the congressional budget for       the United States Government for fiscal year 2018 and setting       forth the appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal years 2019       through 2027, with the Senate amendment thereto, and to       consider in the House, without intervention of any point of       order, a motion offered by the chair of the Committee on the       Budget or her designee that the House concur in the Senate       amendment with the amendment specified in section 2 of this       resolution. The Senate amendment and the motion shall be       considered as read. The motion shall be debatable for one       hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on the Budget. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the motion to       adoption without intervening motion or demand for division of       the question.        Sec. 2. The amendment referred to in section 1 is as       follows: At the end of the Senate amendment, add the       following new section:       ``SEC. ___. POINT OF ORDER AGAINST ANY TAX BILL THAT RAISES                     TAXES ON MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES BY ELIMINATING                     OR LIMITING THE STATE AND LOCAL TAX DEDUCTION.         (a) Point of Order.--It shall not be in order in the House       of Representatives or the Senate to consider any bill, joint       resolution, motion, amendment, amendment between the Houses,       or conference report that repeals or limits the State and       Local Tax Deduction (26 U.S.C. 164).        (b) Waiver and Appeal.--Subsection (a) may be waived or       suspended in the Senate only by an affirmative vote of three-      fifths of the Members, duly chosen and sworn. An affirmative       vote of three-fifths of the Members of the Senate, duly       chosen and sworn, shall be required to sustain an appeal of       the ruling of the Chair on a point of order raised under       subsection (a).  [[Page H8166]]         (c) Waiver in the House.--It shall not be in order in the       House of Representatives to consider a rule or order that       waives the application of subsection (a). As disposition of a       point of order under this subsection, the Chair shall put the       question of consideration with respect to the rule or order,       as applicable. The question of consideration shall be       debatable for 10 minutes by the Member initiating the point       of order and for 10 minutes by an opponent, but shall       otherwise be decided without intervening motion except one       that the House adjourn.''                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my strong opposition  to H.R. 469 the ``Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act''  of 2017.   H.R. 469 is yet another attempt to undermine the ability of Federal  regulators to protect the health and safety of Americans.   This ill-conceived bill imposes numerous new procedural burdens on  agencies and courts intended to dissuade them from using consent  decrees and settlement agreements to resolve enforcement actions filed  to address agency noncompliance with the law.   H.R. 469 targets consent decrees and settlement agreements involving  congressionally mandated federal agency actions.   These agency actions in many instances have the purpose of protecting  civil rights, health, safety, and the environment.   H.R. 469 prescribes a host of burdensome--and, in some cases,  ambiguous--steps for courts and parties relating to such consent  decrees and settlements that would favor continued litigation over  settlement.   H.R. 469 establishes a prolonged process of publication,  intervention, and court-supervised mediation for these types of  settlements.   This prolonged process would waste judicial, individuals, and local  governments' resources, while wealthy corporations are empowered to  perpetuate violations of federal rules.   Such hurdles to settlements conflict directly with the expressly  stated and longstanding policy of the federal judiciary system to favor  compromise and the settlement of disputes in order to make the best use  of limited resources.   Proponents of this legislation argue that agencies and interest  groups collude to ``sue and settle'' to avoid compliance with the  procedures set forth in the Administrative Procedure Act.   These allegations are unfounded in fact.   The consent decrees and settlement agreements at issue do not  determine the substance of agency rules.   Rather, such agreements simply seek to enforce mandatory statutory  and procedural duties (such as deadlines enacted by Congress).   In fact, a December 2014 Government Accountability Office report  surveyed settlements over deadlines for major U.S. Environmental  Protection Act rulemakings and found that the settlements did not  influence the substantive results.   Furthermore, all public notice and comment requirements of the  Administrative Procedure Act and the individual laws at issue still  apply when an agency undertakes the substantive action for which a  deadline was missed.   Parties and non-parties alike are provided with numerous  opportunities to provide input in advance of the rules being finalized.   H.R. 469 undermines protections for the American people, masqueraded  as a measure to prevent undocumented and unfounded allegations of ``sue  and settle'' collusion between public interest plaintiffs and  sympathetic federal agencies entering into consent decrees and  settlements.   In fact, H.R. 469 favors industry interests at taxpayer expense and  promotes regulatory uncertainty by making it virtually impossible to  actually enter into consent decrees and settlements that avoid the  costly and time consuming alternative of litigation.   But its most serious flaw is that H.R. 469 is really a back door way  to derail the rulemaking process and undermine federal law, shifting  limited agency resources away from the implementation of health and  safety protections for the very people that we are supposed to be  representing.   What this bill truly targets are the legal rights of citizens to hold  government accountable by enforcing laws designed to protect health,  safety, and the environment, obligations that the supporters of this  bill would prefer to remain unenforced.   A broad coalition of more than 150 civil rights, environmental,  consumer protection and other public interest groups opposed the bill  in the last Congress.   On Monday, October 23, 2017, I received a letter signed by 86  environmental protection and civil rights groups urging me to oppose  this bill.   A bill that attempts to give third parties the power to obstruct and  delay the enforcement of federal law; which will harm plaintiff  corporations, state and local governments, nonprofit groups, and  individuals alike, when their interests have been harmed by illegal  federal agency actions or inactions.   Consent decrees and settlement agreements are simple, streamlined  ways to hold federal agencies accountable when they ignore Congress by  failing to commit congressionally mandated actions by a date  established in statute.   H.R. 469 is a sad attempt to eliminate vital and broadly supported  protections that have improved and saved millions of American lives.   By providing opportunities for industry to subvert or delay the  process of redressing injured groups, H.R. 469 effectively makes it  more expensive for agencies to do what Congress has mandated, that is  to protect the American people and redress any harm to their  livelihood.   Some of the unwholesomeness of this bill could have been mitigated  had the Jackson Lee amendment to H.R. 469 been made in order.   The Jackson Lee amendment would have excepted consent decrees or  settlement agreements that pertain to a reduction in illness or death  from exposure to toxic substances in communities that are protected by  Executive Order 12898.   Executive Order 12898 directs federal agencies to identify and  address the disproportionately high and adverse human health and  environmental effects of agency action on minority and low-income  populations.   It is impossible to understand why even conservative Republicans  would back legislation that hinders enforcement of the law, requires  agencies to waste money in court on cases they believe they cannot win,  and would stymie industry and state settlements along with all others.   I urge all members to vote against H.R. 469 and reject this harmful  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I have often said that, even though the  sun is shining after hurricanes and storms, the people are still  hurting. Houston is resilient--and I might just say, ``Go Astros''--but  I think it is important to talk about those who are impacted by  Hurricane Harvey.   I rise to help FEMA, because there is a large percentage of denials  in my district. I believe that there should be a large promotion, if  you will, informational provision to indicate to people the process for  appealing FEMA denials.   FEMA, itself, admits that many times the denials are based upon  technical issues, that they should go to disaster recovery centers; but  no one knows that if there is not a massive effort of information,  number one.   Number two, there are still in the thousands of homes in and around  my district and in Texas that are waiting for FEMA inspectors.   I have offered suggestions. Those suggestions should be taken up:  college students, using resources of finding temporary employees,  people who are already working but may have the skills to spend some  hours as a FEMA inspector.   In my phone are so many pictures of homes with garbage outside,  people's belongings. It is now garbage. It is their belongings. It is  their life out on the front steps of their home. They are waiting for  an inspector. The New York Times article says they are waiting for an  inspector.   FEMA, let's work together. People are hurting. That should be part of  our recovery and our appropriation coming up                            ____________________
