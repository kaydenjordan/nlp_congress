 Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the 1-year  anniversary of the American Rescue Plan, or the ARP.   The ARP helped to provide critical assistance to individuals and  small businesses during our historic COVID-19 pandemic that has driven  job and wage growth in our country.   I will focus on just one little piece of this law: the provision  boosting the child tax credit.   Study after study has shown the benefits of this policy: helping  families meet basic needs such as food and utilities, a need that has  become even greater when we talk about the rising costs and inflation  we are all experiencing.   Unfortunately, this support ended as families are grappling with  higher prices for a range of basic needs.   If you really want to help families struggling with inflation, renew  the successful ARP child tax credit. It is the right prescription for  struggling families.                            ____________________
