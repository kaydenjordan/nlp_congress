 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to announce the introduction  of my bill opposing the latest attack on American energy producers.   Crisis after crisis after crisis, and yet Democrats are pushing a  natural gas tax that will reduce our GDP by $9 billion, kill at least  90,000 jobs, and raise energy bills for every American.   In fact, every American family will pay nearly 20 percent more on  their utility bills almost immediately. President Biden's out-of- control spending is already driving prices up on everything. We know  that this is going to be the most expensive Thanksgiving in history.  And now Democrats are desperately searching for new ways to squeeze  even more money out of the American people to pay for Big Government  projects.   A natural gas tax is a tax on every single American, and it will  disproportionately hurt working-class Americans, farmers, and ranchers.  President Biden's message in Europe is, American energy--never. Our  message should be American-made energy is better than ever.                            ____________________
