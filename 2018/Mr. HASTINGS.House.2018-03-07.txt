 Mr. Speaker, in a few moments I will manage today's  rules; but right now, I would like to thank the staff of the Rules  Committee on both sides for the hard work that they do, especially the  staff director for the Democrats, Don Sisson.   I would like to also take a moment to recognize Ms. Kira Sisson, a  senior from Albion High School in western New York. Kira is here with  us today, along with classmates from her school. Don is her uncle.   Today we will not address Dreamers. Today we will not address the gun  epidemic. I encourage all adult Americans to work with the students on  March 24 that are coming here to Washington in a march for what they  describe as our future. I hope adult Americans will encourage massive  attendance at this march, and that this Congress will take action to  abate the gun epidemic.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like first to thank the gentlewoman from Wyoming  (Ms. Cheney), my friend, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes for  debate.   Today's bills would modify Clean Air Act regulations, or the act  itself, to give a handout to specified industries to emit more  pollution into the air. These bills, in my view, would result in more  smog, more fine particle pollution, and more toxic air pollution. The  effects would be worse, resulting in more asthma attacks, more kids in  emergency rooms, more bronchitis, more cancer diagnoses, and more birth  defects.   Mr. Speaker, these bills represent a fundamentally unfair and deeply  troubling approach to regulation. In bringing up these bills, the  Republican-controlled Congress is granting favors to special interests  at the expense of public health. Shocking, but not surprising. By  bringing up these bills, the majority intends to overturn evidence- based, scientific decisions made by the Environmental Protection  Agency, States, and courts after a transparent and extensive process.   To date, the Trump administration, with the help of the Republican- controlled Congress, has targeted 67 environmental rules. One of those  rules was the requirement that mining companies prove they have the  financial wherewithal to clean up their pollution. Another is the rule  regulating airborne mercury emissions from fossil fuel power plants.  And most recently, the administration announced it was targeting oil  rig safety regulations, regulations that were implemented after the  2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill, a spill that burned for  36 hours, released 4.9 billion barrels of crude oil into the Gulf of  Mexico, spread 3,850 square miles, and resulted in billions of dollars  of losses to the U.S. fishing industry and the Gulf Coast tourist  industry.    Mr. Speaker, since passage of the Clean Air Act in 1970, America has  made substantial progress in cleaning up this Nation's air. We have  done this by following a fundamental principle: holding polluters  accountable for their pollution.   Instead of following this commonsense, bedrock principle, my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle insist on creating loopholes  for a few favored industries: waste coal plants, brick manufacturers,  and those who manufacture residential wood heaters.   Mr. Speaker, the first of these bills, the ironically titled SENSE  Act, weakens the critical Mercury and Air Toxics Standards rule, which  established the first national standards to address power plant  emissions of toxic air pollutants. This Mercury and Air Toxics  Standards rule requires coal-fired power plants to meet emissions  standards for mercury, other metals, and acid gases.   Has the majority engaged in any in-depth analysis of what will happen  when this rule is weakened? Has the majority filled its ranks with  experts, scientists, and doctors who will be able to put forth a case  for why undermining this rule is good policy? Of course not.   Mr. Speaker, here is what we know: The Environmental Protection  Agency estimates that for every dollar spent to reduce pollution under  this rule American families receive up to $9 in health benefits. In  fact, the EPA estimated that, in 2016, the MATS rule would avoid up to  11,000 premature deaths, 2,800 cases of chronic bronchitis, 4,700 heart  attacks, 130,000 cases of aggravated asthma, 5,700 hospital and  emergency room visits, 6,300 cases of acute bronchitis, 140,000 cases  of respiratory symptoms, and 540,000 days when people miss work. My  Republican colleagues want to do away with those health benefits and,  instead, permit favored industries to pollute more.   Mr. Speaker, the second measure combines two bills: H.R. 1917, the  BRICK Act; and H.R. 453, the Relief from New Source Performance  Standards Act. The BRICK Act unjustifiably delays reductions in toxic  air pollution from brick manufacturers by allowing them to continue to  pollute until all their lawsuits are exhausted. The bill throws out  existing judicial process by providing a blanket extension for any  compliance deadline, regardless of the merits of the case.   Under well established legal norms, the court of appeals for the  district circuit may stay a rule during litigation if it finds that the  party seeking the stay has demonstrated that there is a likelihood of  success on the merits, the prospect of irreparable harm to the party  requesting the stay, and, most importantly, whether granting the stay  is in the public interest. To date, not one of the industry litigants  have even asked the court to stay the Brick and Structural Clay  Products rule. Not one. Presumably it is because they recognize that  they cannot meet this legal standard.   Mr. Speaker, the existing judicial process is the appropriate method  to seek a stay of the rule and is the preferable method to unnecessary  congressional intervention proposed by the BRICK Act.   This brings me to H.R. 453, the Relief from New Source Performance  Standards Act, which delays cleaner burning wood stoves until 2023, on  top of the 5 years manufacturers already had to comply, exposing  communities to additional years of unhealthy fine particle pollution,  carbon monoxide, and volatile organic compounds.   In 2015, the EPA strengthened the pollution control requirements for  new residential wood heaters. The new standards would cut fine particle  pollution and volatile organic compounds from new wood heaters by  almost 70 percent and will cut carbon monoxide pollution by 62 percent.  The EPA even included provisions in the rule to help manufacturers  achieve the new standards, giving the manufacturers 5 years to comply.   Mr. Speaker, these pollutants combine with other pollutants in the  air from smog, black carbon, and benzene, harming the health of the  American people, particularly our kids and seniors, who will have to  pay for these special interest breaks with their health and, in some  cases, with their lives. These three bills sacrifice Americans' health  with additional years of unnecessary pollution.   Mr. Speaker, it is as disappointing as it is frustrating that we come  here today to debate bills that will increase pollution in our country  and also have very little hope--let me underscore that: very little  hope--of ever becoming law. We have real work to do in this place, and  these bills are not that work.   This body must turn its attention to finally addressing the gun  violence epidemic that has taken over our country. Most recently at  Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, in a  district adjacent to the district that I am privileged to serve, less  than a month ago, a 19-year-old legally purchased a semiautomatic AR-15  and used it to methodically murder 14 of his former classmates and  three teachers.   What was the response of this body? Well, we did prayers and  thoughts, which is good. But did my Republican colleagues bring to the  floor a bill that would ban assault weapons? Did they bring to the  floor legislation to close the gun show loophole? Did they bring to the  floor legislation that would raise the minimum purchase age for rifles?  Or mandatory comprehensive background checks for gun buyers and ban  bump stocks? Or allow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to  study gun violence?                                time  1245    No, Mr. Speaker. Instead this body offered, as I said, its thoughts  and prayers.   And I have said it before and I will say it again today: those who  stand in the way of legislation that will address our country's gun  violence epidemic are increasingly culpable for its needless  continuation.   So what we choose to talk about is pollution. What we should be  talking about is the gun epidemic, and I will get to DACA a little bit  later in my closing.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, 6 months ago, Donald John Trump decided to end the DACA  program, a program which gave hundreds of thousands of hardworking  young people hope for the future. He gave Congress until March 5--that  was 2 days ago--to pass a bill. Since then, House Democrats have tried  23 times to pass bipartisan legislation to fix this problem. Donald  John Trump even tweeted: ``Total inaction on DACA by Dems. Where are  you?''   Well, Mr. President, where we are is right here, waiting for this  deal that you say can be made. Yet, on 23 occasions, it was our friends  on the other side of the aisle who refused to make a deal and rejected  even considering the bipartisan Dream Act that was deadlined by you,  Donald John Trump, on March 5.   We need to address this vital issue now. Approximately 120 Dreamers  lose their status each day. Over 22,000 have lost their status since  the administration ended the program.   Mr. Speaker, I implore my colleagues: Let's do something now to lift  the cloud that hangs over these young people who are American in every  way except on paper.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I am going to offer  for the 24th time an amendment to the rule to bring up H.R. 3440, the  Dream Act. This bipartisan, bicameral legislation will help solve the  problem created by Donald John Trump's decision to end the DACA  program.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Costa), my good friend, a member of the Agriculture and  Natural Resources Committees of this Congress, who will discuss our  proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I have watched this last year as members of the  Republican majority worked diligently to eliminate Federal  environmental regulations that serve to keep the American people safe  from harmful toxins in their air and water.   I couldn't help but be amused by my colleague on the right's comments  at the end that we will be using sticks instead of bricks. Very clever.  But the real truth of the matter is, in certain parts of the world--and  I would urge him to visit some of them--there are examples of things  other than brick for construction. I have no quarrel with the brick  industry. I just urge--and in many instances they are already doing  it--that they do everything they can not to pollute the environment.   I have watched members in the Republican majority work relentlessly  for special interest groups instead of working for all of the American  people. I have watched members of the Republican majority put the wish  list of the powerful corporate gun lobby ahead of the safety of the  American people.  [[Page H1456]]    On Monday, we all watched a self-imposed Republican deadline slip by,  to the detriment of thousands upon thousands of young people in our  country who we have identified as Dreamers, young people who know no  other country as home than the United States of America. Every day of  inaction on the part of my friends across the aisle means another day  that families are needlessly and cruelly made to live under the threat  of being torn asunder.   My colleague, Lois Frankel, and I were at a men's club before a  couple of hundred of men in the Valencia Cove in Boynton Beach. The  question was put to both of us: Why do we support illegal immigrants in  this country?   We tried to make the distinction for him with reference to Dreamers  and the fact that all of these young people were brought here against  their volition by their parents. So it is the Dreamers that we are  supporting. I think he finally understood the importance of our doing  comprehensive immigration reform in this country.   Democrats have offered to bring the Dream Act to the floor now 24  times. We are going to give them one more chance. We have done it 23,  and every single time this effort has been blocked by the majority.   To address my friend who correctly cited that we were bringing this  up: It is not so much to change the topic of the day. We don't have  that prerogative. But we do have embedded in this rule the prerogative  to bring a previous question, and that can be on any subject that we  choose. What we choose to do is to prioritize things that we consider  to be important. It would not have blocked this particular measure.    But the fact is, enough is enough. The President says he wants to fix  this problem. The Speaker says he wants to fix this problem. We on this  side of the aisle clearly want to fix this problem. So let's do it now.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule, on the previous  question, and on the underlying bills.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
