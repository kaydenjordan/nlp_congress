 Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained and missed recorded  votes on rollcalls Nos. 291, 292, and 293 on June 26, 2018. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 291, ``yea'' on  rollcall No. 292, and ``yea'' on rollcall No. 293.                             personal explanation     Mr. Chairman, for more than a decade, we have overused and  underinvested in the United States military. This bill marks a welcomed  change of direction and a recapitalization of the American military.   I could go through a lot of the weapons systems and missions and  programs. I am fortunate enough to represent a district in which all  four services are active, both at Fort Sill, where we have Marine  artillery and Army artillery and air defense artillery, and Tinker Air  Force Base, where we have the Navy E-6 wing as well as the largest air  depot in the world. This bill will make a difference for all of those  installations.   Much more importantly, what the American people need to understand  is, at the end of this process, we will have a larger Army, a larger  Navy, a larger Air Force, and a larger Marine Corps. They will be  better trained, better equipped, and better able to serve us and, thank  goodness, better compensated as well.   Mr. Chair, I want to thank, particularly, Chairwoman Granger and  Ranking Member Visclosky. I wish people could have watched this  process. I have served under three very capable chairmen on this  subcommittee. To watch them work back and forth in such a bipartisan,  pragmatic, and thorough way and to interact with professionals in our  military and to give every member of that subcommittee an opportunity  to participate in a meaningful way was a legislative marvel and  probably a minor miracle in the way things go. I think you can see that  just by listening to the remarks on both sides of the aisle about our  chairman and our ranking member and the process in which they engaged.   Mr. Chair, I want to urge everybody on the floor to vote for this  bill. It was arrived at the right way. It is the right thing for the  country and the American military. More than that, I am proud of our  chairman, I am proud of our ranking member, and I am very proud to have  been able to participate in this process.
