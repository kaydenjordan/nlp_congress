 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question is addressed to counsel for the  President:         As a matter of law, does it matter if there was a quid pro       quo? Is it true that quid pro quos are often used in foreign       policy?    Mr. Counsel DERSHOWITZ. Mr. Chief Justice, thank you very much for  your question.   Yesterday, I had the privilege of attending the rolling-out of a  peace plan by the President of the United States regarding the Israel- Palestine conflict, and I offered you a hypothetical the other day:  What if a Democratic President were to be elected and Congress were to  authorize much money to either Israel or the Palestinians and the  Democratic President were to say to Israel ``No; I am going to withhold  this money unless you stop all settlement growth'' or to the  Palestinians ``I will withhold the money Congress authorized to you  unless you stop paying terrorists, and the President said ``Quid pro  quo. If you don't do it, you don't get the money. If you do it, you get  the money''? There is no one in this Chamber who would regard that as  in any way unlawful. The only thing that would make a quid pro quo  unlawful is if the quo were in some way illegal.   Now, we talked about motive. There are three possible motives that a  political figure can have: One, a motive in the public interest, and  the Israel argument would be in the public interest; the second is in  his own political interest; and the third, which hasn't been mentioned,  would be in his own financial interest, his own pure financial  interest, just putting money in the bank. I want to focus on the second  one for just one moment.   Every public official whom I know believes that his election is in  the public interest. Mostly, you are right. Your election is in the  public interest. If a President does something which he believes will  help him get elected--in the public interest--that cannot be the kind  of quid pro quo that results in impeachment.   I quoted President Lincoln, when President Lincoln told General  Sherman to let the troops go to Indiana so that they could vote for the  Republican Party. Let's assume the President was running at that point  and it was in his electoral interests to have these soldiers put at  risk the lives of many, many other soldiers who would be left without  their company. Would that be an unlawful quid pro quo? No, because the  President, A, believed it was in the national interest, but B, he  believed that his own election was essential to victory in the Civil  War. Every President believes that. That is why it is so dangerous to  try to psychoanalyze the President, to try to get into the intricacies  of the human mind.   Everybody has mixed motives, and for there to be a constitutional  impeachment based on mixed motives would permit almost any President to  be impeached.   How many Presidents have made foreign policy decisions after checking  with their political advisers and their pollsters? If you are just  acting in the national interest, why do you need pollsters? Why do you  need political advisers? Just do what is best for the country. But if  you want to balance what is in the public interest with what is in your  party's electoral interest and your own electoral interest, it  [[Page S651]]  is impossible to discern how much weight is given to one or the other.    Now, we may argue that it is not in the national interest for a  particular President to get reelected or for a particular Senator or  Member of Congress--and maybe we are right; it is not in the national  interest for everybody who is running to be elected--but for it to be  impeachable, you would have to discern that he or she made a decision  solely on the basis of, as the House managers put it, corrupt motives,  and it cannot be a corrupt motive if you have a mixed motive that  partially involves the national interest, partially involves electoral,  and does not involve personal pecuniary interest.   The House managers do not allege that this decision, this quid pro  quo, as they call it--and the question is based on the hypothesis there  was a quid pro quo. I am not attacking the facts. They never allege  that it was based on pure financial reasons. It would be a much harder  case.   If a hypothetical President of the United States said to a  hypothetical leader of a foreign country: Unless you build a hotel with  my name on it and unless you give me a million-dollar kickback, I will  withhold the funds. That is an easy case. That is purely corrupt and in  the purely private interest.   But a complex middle case is: I want to be elected. I think I am a  great President. I think I am the greatest President there ever was,  and if I am not elected, the national interest will suffer greatly.  That cannot be.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.    I send a question to the desk on behalf of myself and  Senators Moran and Hawley. It is a question for the House managers.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question from the Senators to the House  managers:         An August 26, 2019, letter from the Intelligence Community       Inspector General to the Director of National Intelligence       discussing the so-called whistleblower stated that the       Inspector General ``identified some indicia of an arguable       political bias on the part of the Complainant in favor of a       rival political candidate.'' Multiple media outlets reported       that this likely referred to the whistleblower's work with       Joe Biden.        Did the so-called whistleblower work at any point for or       with Joe Biden? If so, did he work for or with Joe Biden on       issues involving Ukraine, and did he assist in any material       way with the quid pro quo in which then-Vice President Biden       has admitted to conditioning loan guarantees to Ukraine on       the firing of the prosecutor investigating Burisma?    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Chief Justice, I thank the Senators for the  question, and I want to be very careful in how I answer it so as not to  disclose or give an indication that may allow others to identify the  identity of the whistleblower.   First, I want to talk about why we are making such an effort to  protect the identity of the whistleblower.   If you could put up slide 48, this slide shows--it may be difficult  for some of you to read, so let me try to--actually, if you could hand  me a copy of that as well. I haven't had a chance to distribute that to  everyone.   It is not just that we view the protection of whistleblowers as  important. Members of this body have also made strong statements about  just how important it is to protect whistleblowers. Senator Grassley  said: ``This person appears to have followed the whistleblower  protection laws and ought to be heard out and protected. We should  always work to respect whistleblowers' requests for confidentiality.''   Senator Romney: ``Whistleblowers should be entitled to  confidentiality and privacy because they play a vital function in our  democracy.''   Senator Burr: ``We protect whistleblowers. We protect witnesses in  our committee.''   Even my colleague, the ranking member, Mr. Nunes: ``We want people to  come forward, and we will protect the identity of those people at all  cost.''   This has been a bipartisan priority and one that we have done our  best to maintain, so I want to be very careful, but let me be clear  about several things about the whistleblower.   First of all, I don't know who the whistleblower is. I haven't met  them or communicated with them in any way. The committee staff did not  write the complaint or coach the whistleblower what to put in the  complaint. The committee staff did not see the complaint before it was  submitted to the inspector general. The committee, including its staff,  did not receive the complaint until the night before the Acting  Director of National Intelligence--we had an open hearing with the  Acting Director on September 26, more than 3 weeks after the legal  deadline by which the committee should have received the complaint.   In short, the conspiracy theory, which I think was outlined earlier,  that the whistleblower colluded with the Intel Committee staff to hatch  an impeachment inquiry is a complete and total fiction. This was, I  think, confirmed by the remarkable accuracy of the whistleblower  complaint, which has been corroborated by the evidence we subsequently  gathered in all material respects.   So I am not going to go into anything that could reveal or lead to  the revelation of the identity of the whistleblower, but I can tell  you, because my staff's names have been brought into this proceeding,  that my staff acted at all times with the most complete  professionalism.   I am very protective of my staff, as I know you are, and I am  grateful that we have such bright, hard-working people working around  the clock to protect this country and who have served our committee so  well. It really grieves me to see them smeared. Some of them mentioned  here today have concerns about their safety, and there are online  threats to members of my staff as a result of some of the smears that  have been launched against them.   I can tell you there is no one who could understand the plight of  Ambassador Yovanovitch more than some of my staff who have been treated  to the same kind of smears and now have concerns over their own safety.  They acted at all times with the utmost propriety and integrity.   Your Senate Intelligence Committee--and your chairman and vice  chairman can tell you--encourage whistleblowers to come to their  committee, and so do we. When they do, we try to figure out, is their  complaint within the scope of jurisdiction of the intelligence  community? And if it is, then we suggest they get a lawyer or we  suggest they talk to the inspector general, which is what happened  here. The whistleblower did exactly what they should--except, for the  President, that is unforgivable because the whistleblower exposed the  wrongdoing of the President. In the President's view, that makes him or  her a traitor or a spy, and, as the President tells us, there is a way  we used to treat traitors and spies.   You wonder why we don't want to call the whistleblower. First of all,  we know firsthand what the whistleblower wrote secondhand in that  complaint. There is no need for that whistleblower anymore, except to  further endanger that person's life. That, to me, does not seem a  worthwhile object for anyone in this Chamber or on the other side of  this building, in the Oval Office, or anywhere else.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   The Senator from Rhode Island.
