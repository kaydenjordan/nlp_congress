 Mr. Speaker, this is a historic day. It is the  beginning of the end of the great COVID depression. It also marks the  end of a decades-long successful battle by big corporations and the  super rich in this country for trickle-down economics, the idea that  the rich getting richer will somehow make us all do better. Wrong.   Today, we are putting money in the pockets of ordinary people, of  poor people, of the middle class, and they will be the engine that  creates a healthy, prosperous future for all of us.
