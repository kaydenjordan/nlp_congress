 Mr. Speaker, for far too long, the mainstream media and Big  Tech companies like Twitter, Google, and Facebook have used their power  to censor one type of speech while favoring and promoting other speech  that they prefer in an attempt to manipulate public discourse.   There is even evidence that the mainstream media and Big Tech use  their own judgment to suppress information related to the origins of  coronavirus as well as available medication and treatment options.   In December 2020, shortly after medical professionals and infectious  disease specialists testified before the United States Senate on the  effectiveness of COVID-19 treatments, Google's YouTube removed the  testimony from their online platform. The big takeaway is that these  conglomerates have been complicit in limiting discussion of facts and  evidence about the COVID-19 pandemic to the detriment of the American  people.   We must rein in Big Tech and the mainstream media's abusive and  monopolistic practices that have led to an abundance of censorship,  views, and opinions deemed, in their own judgment, to be objectionable.                            ____________________
