 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Ambassador Harold E. Doley, Jr. on his 75th birthday.   Ambassador Harold E. Doley, Jr., a native of New Orleans, Louisiana,  rang the closing bell of the New York Stock Exchange on February 18,  2022, marking his 50th anniversary of becoming a member.   Ambassador Doley began his career in investment banking in 1968. Five  years later, at the tender age of 26, he bought a seat on the stock  exchange, becoming the first and only African American in history to do  so.   Ambassador Doley chaired the investment committee of Southern Africa  Enterprise Development Fund, SAEDF, a private equity fund. Ambassador  Doley also placed the first Black market maker on the Johannesburg  Stock Exchange.   Industry peers honored Ambassador Doley as an Outstanding Broker of  the Year in 1971, and The Wall Street Journal selected him as Stock  Picker of the Year in 1990.   Ambassador Doley has been an appointee of five Presidential  administrations.   In 1982, Ambassador Doley was appointed the founding director of the  Minerals Management Service in the Department of the Interior, a  department of more than 5,000 employees. MMS represented the second- largest revenue source to United States Government at that time.   In 1983, Ambassador Doley was appointed the United States  Representative of the African Development Bank Fund, AfDB,  headquartered in Abidjan, Ivory Coast.   The AfDB was able to quadruple its authorized capital by using  Ambassador Doley's capital increase formula.   At the AfDB, Ambassador Doley secured a AAA rating from the global  financial rating agencies, the first AAA rating for an African-based  entity.   Ambassador Doley was inducted into the United States Small Business  Administration Hall of Fame in 2005 and is a life member of the Council  on Foreign Relations.   In 2003, the Doley family funded the Doley Foundation, whose mission  is to support education and cultural endeavors that impact the African  diaspora.   The foundation and its work is an outgrowth of a 1977 study the  ambassador commissioned and directed in determining the reliability of  using apartheid South Africa as a dependable source for the strategic  and ubiquitous metal, platinum. The study can be found at the U.S.  Library of Congress today.   In 2018, Ambassador Doley received the Imagine Award for Special  Recognition in Social Justice in Cape Town for this watershed document.   The Doley Foundation replaced the Southern University Law Library in  New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina and funded an NFL study that called  on the league to engage with its franchise owners' contracts with  minority businesses.   A graduate of my alma mater, Xavier University, and the President  Management program and Harvard Business School, Ambassador Doley was  recently selected as one of 50 Wall Street practitioners interviewed  for this piece, Remembering Wall Street: 1950-1980.   Ambassador Doley is married and has two sons and two grandsons.   A huge congratulations and birthday wishes to this outstanding New  Orleans native, Ambassador Harold Doley.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for  yielding, and a special thanks to Representative Alma Adams for her  tireless efforts on behalf of our Nation's historically Black colleges  and universities.   HBCUs were built to educate and celebrate the Black community when  very few would. At Xavier University in New Orleans, my mother was able  to bring six children to class while she finished her college degree.  Little did she know that her children and grandchildren would later  attend and graduate from the very same university.   We are barely 2 full months into the year, but dozens of HBCUs are on  high alert amid several instances of racially motivated threats of  violence. HBCUs are resilient institutions that can weather any storm  but should not have to weather this type of storm.   The threats to these higher education institutions are not just  disrupting postsecondary education. They are disrupting the very  underlying sense of safety and community of the HBCUs. The fact that  this has been undermined is perhaps the biggest travesty of all.   Let us be clear: These threats are acts of terror, and they must be  urgently investigated and prosecuted. We must help foster safety in the  HBCU communities.    We must help foster safety in HBCU  communities. Today's resolution is a way that Congress can commit to  fighting against hatred and racism and stand with HBCUs.
