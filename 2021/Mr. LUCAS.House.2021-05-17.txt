 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1447, the COAST Research Act  of 2021. This bipartisan legislation would reauthorize and modernize  the Federal Government's ocean acidification research and monitoring  programs.   Ocean acidification is the result of a gradual decrease in pH in the  ocean chemistry. Even a small shift in pH can have a serious effect on  marine ecosystems, including shellfish habitat, coral reefs, and  fisheries habitat.  [[Page H2384]]    Congress recognized the need for a better understanding of the causes  and effects of ocean acidification and passed the Federal Ocean  Acidification Research and Monitoring Act in 2009. That legislation  created a framework for science agencies such as NOAA and the National  Science Foundation to dedicate resources to studying the phenomenon. As  a result, we made significant advancements in understanding ocean  acidification over the last decade.   H.R. 1447 reauthorizes the funding for NOAA and NSF efforts through  the fiscal year 2026, which lapsed in fiscal year 2012. It also  modernizes their activities by updating the strategic plan governing  the Federal Government's research efforts and strengthening cooperation  among scientific agencies.   Additionally, the COAST Research Act designates NOAA as the lead  agency for coordinating the Federal response to ocean and coastal  acidification. This is an important step to streamline and organize  efforts across the government.   Finally, this bill ensures that the voices of stakeholders and  industry from multiple regions are heard through a newly established  advisory board. This input is critical to effectively integrate the  many research, monitoring, and adaptation strategies for coastal  acidification.   This bill is the result of years of work in building a consensus  among stakeholders, including ocean conservation groups, sportsmen, and  coastal communities about how best to address this problem moving  forward.   Coastal communities and businesses will greatly benefit from this  legislation and how better knowledge of ocean acidification improves  our ability to respond to its effects.   I thank Ms. Bonamici for introducing and leading this bill along with  her House Oceans Caucus vice chair, Congressman   Don Young, along with  the many bipartisan cosponsors.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young), one of the most outstanding  individuals in this body; the dean of the House Republican Conference;  the dean of the United States House; but, most importantly, and  fortunately for his constituents, the dean of the Alaska congressional  delegation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I again rise to support H.R. 1447, the COAST Research  Act of 2021. It is necessary, bipartisan legislation with support from  Members representing a diverse range of districts.   As I previously mentioned, significant progress toward our  understanding the socioeconomic effects of ocean and coastal  acidification has been made in the last decade. But to continue that  progress, we need to update our priorities and our strategies.   That is what this bill does. That is what will keep our communities,  our businesses, and our entire economy at the forefront of managing and  mitigating the environmental challenges we face.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2533, the National Estuaries  and Acidification Research Act of 2021, a bipartisan bill sponsored by  Congressman Bill Posey, my esteemed colleague on the Science Committee.   This legislation directs the Secretary of Commerce to coordinate a  study with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and  Medicine to examine the effects of ocean acidification on estuary  environments, and to submit that report to Congress within 2 years.                                time  1615    Specifically, this study will be led by the Ocean Studies Board of  the National Academies and provide Congress a better understanding of  the biological and economic impacts of ocean acidification on inland  marine environments.   Estuaries are economically important water ecosystems that occur when  inland rivers meet oceans. This mix of fresh and salt waters is a  delicate balance of nature that possesses unique biological  characteristics. To date, there have been few studies on the effects  ocean acidification has on these ecosystems.   We can't manage and mitigate the effects of something we don't fully  understand. That is why H.R. 2533 is still needed today to bridge our  knowledge gaps by utilizing the best expertise and resources to gain a  better understanding of this important issue.   While Oklahoma is a landlocked State without estuaries, I recognize  the economic and environmental effects acidification has on all of our  Nation's waterways and other natural treasures. The waters of  Oklahoma's rivers, streams, and tributaries feed into larger systems  and eventually make it to the ocean. At the end of the day, being a  conservationist doesn't stop at geographic barriers. It is a nationwide  effort.   Mr. Speaker, this important word-for-word bill passed the House last  Congress with the same bipartisan support it has here today.  Unfortunately, it didn't move further in the Senate. So, 1 year later,  we still need to improve our knowledge of coastal acidification and  estuaries.   I thank Mr. Posey for leading this important legislation. I know his  constituents and the Indian River Lagoon community appreciate his  efforts to protect their surrounding environment. I also thank my  Science Committee colleague across the aisle, Ms. Bonamici, for leading  the effort on the majority side.   Mr. Speaker, as the saying goes, knowledge is power. This simple  bipartisan bill advances our knowledge and gives us the power to  quantify the effects estuary communities face when faced with coastal  acidification.   The National Academies are a tremendous resource. Their studies are  thorough, informative, and world class. I look forward to seeing the  final product directed by this bill.   By preserving our Nation's estuaries, we are saving businesses from  closing, ecosystems from dying, and people from getting sick. I, again,  thank Representative Bill Posey and the entire Congressional Estuary  Caucus for leading on this important topic.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 210, the Rural STEM  Education Research Act, a bill that passed this House with resounding  bipartisan support in the 116th Congress, and I hope it will do so  again today.   I am pleased to be leading this important bill, and I thank  Chairwoman Johnson for her support.   Now more than ever, America's prosperity and security depend on an  effective and inclusive science, technology, engineering, math, and  computer science workforce, or STEM.   Nationally, 80 percent of the fastest-growing occupations depend upon  mastery of STEM skills, and the number of STEM jobs is growing three  times faster than non-STEM jobs. Over the next decade, the STEM  shortage is anticipated to reach 1 million positions, according to the  Bureau of Labor Statistics.   To succeed in this job market, our students need to be equipped with  solid skills in science and engineering. Meeting this demand starts in  the classroom.   Over 9 million students in the United States, nearly 20 percent of  the total K-12 population, attend rural schools. In Oklahoma, that  number is even higher; one-third of our students attend rural schools.   These students face a number of barriers to accessing high-quality  STEM learning, including a shortage of trained science and math  teachers, a lack of access to advanced STEM courses, and few local  university and industry partners.   Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, we have seen further  proof that rural students are at a disadvantage, given the  unreliability or nonexistent broadband access many struggle with while  distance learning.   The Rural STEM Education Research Act supports research and  development activities to improve our understanding of the challenges  rural communities are facing, and it takes steps to address those  challenges in providing and sustaining quality STEM education programs.  [[Page H2390]]    H.R. 210 helps develop better practices for accessing and using  computer-based and online STEM education courses. It will help schools  combine online STEM education with hands-on training and  apprenticeships to give students both theoretical and practical  understanding of math and science skills.   The bill will also take steps to address one of the key obstacles to  rural STEM education, a lack of broadband access. Of the 21 million  Americans who lack access to broadband, the majority live in rural  areas. With the increase in online learning, we need to prioritize  connectivity for all students.   This bill directs the National Institute of Standards and Technology  to establish a prize competition to stimulate innovations in  technologies to deploy broadband connectivity to underserved rural  communities.   It also establishes a working group to set key research priorities  for improving broadband access so rural communities can enjoy the same  connectedness as the rest of the country.   This bill includes a number of provisions to help provide rural  educators with the tools they need to be successful, both in the  classroom and online. It supports opportunities for rural educators to  enhance their own STEM education, such as training in computer science  or research opportunities at Federal labs and universities. These  experiences will provide rural educators with high-quality STEM skills  they can take back to the classrooms and pass on to their students.    Lastly, the major focus of this bill is broadening the participation  of rural students in STEM. One way we can do this is by emphasizing  place-based learning, which gives students direct access to the STEM  knowledge present in their communities and local environment.   Place-based learning connects students to the science that is right  outside their doors, whether it is studying animal science with FFA,  learning about local ecosystems out on the prairies and in forests, or  developing the technological skills required to operate increasingly  complex and computerized farm equipment. That direct experience engages  students and helps them understand that STEM skills matter to everyone,  not just scientists in a white lab coat.   Taken together, the measures in this bill will make great strides to  improve rural STEM education. I believe rural areas represent one of  the greatest, yet most underutilized, opportunities for talented  students to enhance the United States' future STEM workforce.   I am pleased that this bill has been endorsed by a number of  stakeholder groups: STEM Education Coalition, Afterschool Alliance,  Battelle and STEM-X, National Science Teaching Association, American  Association of Colleges for Teacher Education, American Chemical  Society, American Geophysical Union, Human Factors and Ergonomics  Society, Association of American Universities, Microsoft, Girl Scouts  of the USA, National FFA Organization, and Association of Public and  Land-grant Universities.   I again thank Chairwoman Johnson and her staff for working with me on  this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes'' to  better STEM education for America's rural students, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Meijer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Iowa (Mr. Feenstra).    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I, once again, thank Chairwoman Johnson for her support  of this legislation. Whether you live in Dallas, Texas, or Cheyenne,  Oklahoma, every student should have the opportunity to gain STEM skills  and to compete for the jobs of the future.   The Rural STEM Education Research Act gives teachers better tools to  teach science and math, leverages local resources to engage students in  key subjects, and addresses the lack of broadband access in rural  communities. This important legislation passed the House with strong  bipartisan support last Congress. I hope it will do so again today.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill today,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 144, the Supporting  Early-Career Researchers Act, the first bipartisan bill Chairwoman  Johnson and I introduced in the 117th Congress.   Over the past year, COVID-19 has caused substantial disruptions  across this country, including in the U.S. research enterprise. Most  research and development work stopped or was dramatically limited to  provide for safe social distancing, and it is estimated we lost between  20 and as much as 40 percent of our research output.   In addition to this loss of research, we are facing the loss of our  researchers. Graduate students and post-docs are particularly  vulnerable to research disruptions. With their research on pause, these  young scientists are finding it difficult to complete their degree  requirements. Those who have finished their degrees are having trouble  finding work.   Much of academia has implemented hiring freezes, and it is estimated  that faculty openings in the sciences have decreased by more than 70  percent compared to 2019. At the same time, the pace of innovation is  accelerating globally, and with it, the competition for scientific and  technical talent.   The Chinese Communist Party has repeatedly stated it is determined to  overtake the U.S. in critical technologies like AI, quantum computing,  and advanced manufacturing. These technologies will require new levels  of scientific skills and understanding, and this new generation of  scientists will play a critical role in how they are developed.   Now more than ever, the innovation capacity of the U.S. and our  prosperity and security depend on an effective and an innovative STEM  workforce to compete with our adversaries.   If we do not provide the resources to support these young  researchers, we will be limiting our ability to support new and  innovative discoveries for years to come. Unfortunately, of the nearly  $6 trillion in COVID research spending that Congress has passed, only  $600 million was allocated to helping the research industry recover.  [[Page H2392]]    That is only 1 percent for a sector of our economy that drives as  much as 85 percent of the long-term growth. We have relied on American  science and scientists to combat COVID and we are not giving them the  funding they need to resume the work that has been stopped by the  pandemic and keep our future innovators in the system. Our STEM  pipeline and future competitors could be irreparably damaged if we  don't act quickly.   Mr. Speaker, that is why I am so proud to cosponsor this legislation.  It will establish a pilot program at the National Science Foundation to  provide 2-year fellowships to young researchers whose career paths have  been disrupted by the pandemic. The bill will support 3,200 fellowships  over 4 years. These fellowships will allow talented young scientists  and engineers to carry out independent research at an institution of  higher education of their choosing.    This bill provides targeted and temporary relief to support early- career scientists, keeping them in the STEM pipeline while the research  enterprise recovers. By supporting these young researchers, we are  investing in America's research and technology leadership.   This legislation has been endorsed by over 30 organizations, and has  nearly as many cosponsors. It was favorably reported out of the  Committee on Science, Space, and Technology on a bipartisan basis, and  I strongly urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I, again, thank Chairwoman Johnson and her staff for  working with me on this important legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Meijer).    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, America's scientific progress depends on a large pool of  talented STEM professionals. Our early-career researchers are a  critical link in the chain of developing the next generation of  scientists.   Unfortunately, in the STEM community, these young scientists have  been disproportionately affected by COVID-related lab closures, reduced  funding, and hiring freezes. We risk losing these valuable scientists  if we do nothing.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to join Chairwoman Johnson in championing the  Supporting Early-Career Researchers Act to support this up-and-coming  generation of scientists and preserve America's research and  technological leadership.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I thank Chairwoman Johnson and her staff for  working in a bipartisan and collaborative way on this legislation. I  encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 204, the STEM  Opportunities Act of 2021. As a co-sponsor of this legislation with  Chairwoman Johnson, I am pleased the House is taking it up for  consideration today.   H.R. 204 continues the Science Committee's long history of bipartisan  support for STEM education. The United States is in a race to remain  the world's leader in science and technology. The only way we will win  is by utilizing America's most valuable resource: Our people.   That means developing a diverse STEM-capable workforce at every  education level and from every background.   The U.S. invests over $1 billion a year in Federal STEM education  programs. But we have not made enough progress in growing a STEM- capable workforce. We need to address that. That is why one of the key  provisions of H.R. 204 is a requirement for more comprehensive data  collection and analysis on the students, researchers, and faculty  receiving Federal science grants.   This data will help us identify and reduce the barriers that prevent  underrepresented groups from entering and advancing in STEM. It will  also help us measure the success of Federal STEM programs to better  direct our investments.   The bill also includes a provision directing the NSF to support  computer science education through the existing Tribal Colleges and  Universities Program. Access to computer science resources and  developing computer skills is critical in today's economy.   The STEM employment in the United States continues to grow faster  than any other job category. Employers in all sectors, including  agriculture, energy, healthcare, and defense are desperate for workers  with STEM skills.   In order to meet this demand, we must develop talent across all  possible groups. Our bill takes important steps to ensure that we are  fully engaging America's entire talent pool and maintaining our global  leadership in science and technology.   H.R. 204 overwhelmingly passed the House last Congress, and I look  forward to getting the bill across the finish line this year.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to thank Chairwoman Johnson and  her staff for working in a bipartisan fashion on this legislation and  for incorporating our feedback and ideas. I look  [[Page H2398]]  forward to continuing to work with her to advance STEM education  efforts--this Congress--that will support, encourage, and develop the  next generation of STEM workers.   Maintaining our global leadership in science and technology is  critical to our economic and national security. We will not be able to  lead without a STEM-capable workforce for the 21st century.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 204, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to co-sponsor this legislation led by  Chairwoman Johnson and Research and Technology Ranking Member   Michael  Waltz, which continues the Science Committee's bipartisan work to  support, encourage, and develop the next generation of America's  Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Computer Science  workforce.   Minority-serving institutions, such as historically Black colleges  and universities, Hispanic-serving institutions, and Tribal colleges  and universities have a long record of success in recruiting,  retaining, and graduating underrepresented students in the STEM fields.   In my own district, I have seen the unique value of minority-serving  institutions. For more than 100 years, Langston University, a  historically Black college and land-grant institution, has educated  students of all backgrounds. They have influenced people's lives beyond  the classroom in service to the community in both rural and urban  Oklahoma. This legislation will help schools like Langston prepare  their students to fill the STEM jobs of the 21st century.   Since 1990, employment in STEM occupations has grown by nearly 80  percent. Over the next decade, with demand continuing to grow and U.S.  universities expecting to produce less than one-third of the STEM  graduates needed, the STEM shortage is anticipated to reach 1 million  professionals. At the same time, minorities are severely  underrepresented in STEM fields, only accounting for 11 percent of the  STEM workforce.   To meet this growing demand, talent from all groups is essential.  This bill we are considering today takes up this call to action by  providing for increased transparency, accountability, and accessibility  of Federal STEM education and research funding.   Without a diverse talent pool of Americans with strong STEM knowledge  and skills prepared for the jobs of the future, the U.S. will not be  able to maintain the innovation that supports key sectors of the  economy, including agriculture, energy, healthcare, and defense.   Mr. Speaker, I, again, thank Chairwoman Johnson and Ranking Member  Waltz for their leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Waltz), the ranking member on the Research  and Technology Subcommittee, and one of our great activists on this  subject matter.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield  myself the balance of my time to close.   Mr. Speaker, the United States is in a race to remain the world  leader in science and technology. The only way we will win this is by  utilizing America's most valuable resource: Our people.   That means developing a diverse STEM-capable workforce at every  education level and from every background. Creating opportunities for  students to not only develop STEM knowledge, but to also have hands-on  experience is essential.   Research shows that students--especially those from underrepresented  minority backgrounds--are more likely to graduate from science and  engineering programs if they have opportunities to engage in STEM  course content with peers, participate in undergraduate research, and  join science clubs and organizations.   This bill will support such STEM education and training activities in  MSIs, providing these students with the skills necessary to compete and  [[Page H2401]]  flourish in the 21st century. These investments will help grow our  workforce, improve our economy, and protect our country.   I, again, would like to thank Chairwoman Johnson and Ranking Member  Waltz for their leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2695, the Combating Sexual  Harassment in Science Act.   I am proud to say that this bill has a foundation of years of  investigation, analysis, and recommendations to the Science, Space, and  Technology Committee. Curbing sexual misconduct in science is a  priority that Chairwoman Johnson and I share.   Engaging more women in STEM studies and careers is essential to  American competitiveness. Women make up over half the workforce, but  account for less than 25 percent of America's STEM workforce.  Unfortunately, too many women have been driven out of STEM careers due  to a culture of harassment and abuse.   H.R. 2695 takes the first steps to address this problem. The bill  directs NSF to expand research efforts to better understand the causes  and consequences of sexual harassment affecting individuals in the  scientific, technical, engineering, and mathematical workforces.   Additionally, it directs NSF to examine policies to reduce the  prevalence and negative impact of such harassment.   The bill also supports the adoption of uniform guidance across the  Federal science agencies to combat sexual harassment involving grant  personnel.   There is an established legal process in place within higher  education and in the workforce for handling claims of sexual  harassment. I cannot stress this enough: this bill does not alter that  process.    What this bill does do is create a uniform policy requiring  universities and research institutions to report to Federal science  agencies when an administrative action is taken that impacts the  ability of a researcher to carry out a grant.   Pervasive sexual harassment in the scientific community discourages  women from critical work and good-paying jobs and hurts American  competitiveness. It is unacceptable for taxpayer dollars to fund  researchers who are guilty of harassing students or colleagues.   I want to thank the stakeholders, especially the university  community, for working with committee staff to improve this  legislation. I believe the revised bill strikes the right balance  between protecting due process and privacy, while also making sure that  Federal science agencies can act if a Federal research grant or the  personnel supporting that grant is impacted.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, H.R. 2695 takes the first steps towards  addressing sexual harassment in STEM fields, which is driving women out  of STEM careers and damaging U.S. competitiveness.   While some progress has been made since the Science, Space, and  Technology Committee first started investigating the issue almost 4  years ago, there is still much more work to be done. This legislation  sends a strong message to the scientific community that misconduct will  not be tolerated, and it sends a message to women who are in STEM  studies and careers that we support them.   This bill passed the House last Congress, and I look forward to  working with our colleagues in the Senate and stakeholders to advance  this legislation into law this year.   I again want to thank Chairwoman Johnson and her staff for working in  a bipartisan and collaborative way on this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
