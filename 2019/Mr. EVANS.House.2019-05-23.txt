 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman of this strong,  powerful committee and the ranking member for leading this effort.   Madam Speaker, I rise to offer my support for the SECURE Act.   Making it easier for small businesses to offer retirement savings  plans is vital. It is vital not only for the benefit of these small  firms but also the people they employ, their families, and the  communities they support.   In my home State of Pennsylvania, we have nearly 1 million small  businesses, employing 2.5 million workers, accounting for 46.7 percent  of the workforce for the entire State. Small firms account for 99.6  percent of my State's employers.   Small businesses are a vital part of saving our middle neighborhoods  in Philadelphia and across the country. These are neighborhoods that  are poised to tip either toward blight or growth. By helping small  businesses and their employees, the SECURE Act would help to revitalize  these middle neighborhoods and help our economy grow from the ground  up.   Again, I thank the chairman and his leadership and the ranking member  for this action.
