 Madam Speaker, 40 Virginia localities have declared  themselves ``Second Amendment sanctuaries,'' resolving to support the  Constitution and stand against infringements on the Second Amendment.   Across my district, thousands of citizens are rallying outside the  meetings of their local government to show their strong support for the  rights of gun owners.   Virginia has always been a cradle of constitutional rights. There is  no divide between our rural and urban populations. All of us want to  defend our rights as citizens of the United States of America.   I represent the same district that James Madison represented in the  first Congress. He understood America's rights to bear arms when he  wrote it into our Constitution.   I am a strong supporter of the Second Amendment, and I am proud to  stand with the people who are speaking up for their constitutional  rights and for the Commonwealth of Virginia.   James Madison would be proud. I know I am.                            ____________________
