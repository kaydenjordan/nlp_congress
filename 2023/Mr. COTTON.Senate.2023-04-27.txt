 Madam President, 201 years ago today, a great American  hero was born. Ulysses S. Grant rose from humble beginnings to stand  next to Washington and Eisenhower, as one of America's truly  indispensable generals. William Tecumseh Sherman once remarked that  ``Grant is the greatest soldier of our time if not of all time.'' This  great defender of the Republic won our bloodiest war and crushed the  darkest forces of disunion. He was an unshakable pillar of strength,  upon which this Nation's future rested time and again.   Virtually no one foresaw Grant's rise to greatness before the Civil  War. Although he had graduated from West Point and distinguished  himself as a soldier in the Mexican-American War, he had stumbled from  one failure to another in private life. When the Confederates attacked  Fort Sumner, that all changed. He redonned his army uniform and marched  into the history books.   For the first 3 years of the Civil War, Grant fought on the western  front, winning several of the Union's early victories while commanders  in the East dithered. After Grant's first great victory, his  Confederate counterpart sued for peace and asked what terms he would  give them. Grant firmly responded that he would accept, ``no terms  except an unconditional and immediate surrender.'' This earned him the  nickname ``Unconditional Surrender Grant'' and resulted in the largest  capture of enemy troops in the history of Western Hemisphere up to that  time.   Grant waged a relentless form of warfare. He knew that ``the art of  war is simple enough. Find out where your enemy is. Get at him as soon  as you can. Strike him as hard as you can and as often as you can, and  keep moving on.'' Grant's warrior spirit famously moved President  Lincoln to declare that ``I can't spare this man--he fights.'' When  Grant's enemies spread the rumor that he was an alcoholic and should be  dismissed, Lincoln wryly responded that ``if he could find out what  brand of whiskey Grant drank, he would send a barrel of it to all the  other commanders.''   Grant displayed his famous determination and grit during the brutal  battle of Shiloh, one of the bloodiest episodes of the Civil War. In  the first day of fighting, Grant's army was mauled by Confederate  forces under the command of Alfred Sidney Johnston, the Confederacy's  most capable general at the time. General Sherman approached Grant that  rainy night beneath a great oak tree and said, ``well, Grant, we've had  the devil's own day, haven't we?'' Grant replied between puffs of his  ubiquitous cigar, ``Yes. Lick em tomorrow though.'' He made good on  this promise, threw back the Confederate forces, and won the carnage- filled battle. Sidney Johnston was killed in the fighting and  Confederate President Jefferson Davis later wrote that ``it was the  turning point of our fate.'' This story remains so legendary in the  Army that it was commonplace for young officers in the Iraq war to  conclude a hard day by borrowing from Grant: ``lick `em tomorrow.''   After the bloodshed at Shiloh, scheming Washington insiders and  armchair generals removed Grant from the field, only to be forced to  return him to the fight.   Grant continued his brilliant streak of victories and on July 4,  1863, the 87th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of  Independence, he seized the fortress city of Vicksburg, splitting the  Confederacy in two and securing the Union's control of the mighty  Mississippi. This was perhaps the greatest strategic victory of the  war. Combined with the victory at Gettysburg the previous day, Grant's  seizure of Vicksburg put the Union on the path to victory.   Soon after Grant's decisive victory in the Battle of Chattanooga a  few months later and capture of the supposedly impregnable heights of  Missionary Ridge, Lincoln promoted him to the rank of lieutenant  general, a position that no one had held since George Washington. A few  days later, Lincoln also named him the commander of Union forces.   In his new command, Grant quickly turned eastward and confronted  Robert E. Lee, a skilled tactician who had run circles around the Army  of the Potomac for 2 years. Lee had spooked Union commanders for years  with his audacious battle plans. But not Grant. ``I am heartily tired  of hearing about what Lee is going to do,'' an exasperated Grant  admonished them. ``Some of you always seem to think he is suddenly  going to turn a double somersault, and land in our rear and on both our  flanks at the same time. Go back to your command, and try to think what  we are going to do ourselves, instead of what Lee is going to do.''   As he marched into the Confederacy, he told a reporter, ``if you see  the President, tell him from me that whatever happens, there will be no  turning back.'' In the weeks and months that followed, Grant attacked  Lee's army again and again. Whether he won or not, Grant continued to  advance deeper into the Confederacy. Grant's army fought in the burning  forests of the Wilderness and in the muddy trenches of Petersburg,  experiencing extraordinary hardship but never allowing Lee to regroup  or reinvigorate his shrinking army. Less than a year after Grant  [[Page S1414]]  began his Overland Campaign, Union forces took the rebel capital of  Richmond and broke the back of Confederate resistance.   U.S. Grant wasn't a great general simply because he won the war. He  was also great because he never lost sight of the first goal of the  war: to reunite our shattered Republic and restore the ``bonds of  affection'' and ``mystic chords of memory'' between Americans, North  and South. Instead of humiliating Lee at Appomattox Courthouse, Grant  offered him generous and honorable terms. Uncompromising in war, Grant  was magnanimous in peace. He allowed Confederate officers to keep their  sidearms and horses, did not demand Lee's sword, and promised not to  prosecute rebels who laid down their arms. And as Lee departed the  courthouse, Grant and his staff took off their hats in respect, a small  act for the victors, but an extraordinary gesture to the defeated  Confederates.   Today, if you travel to his memorial and final resting place in New  York City, you will see his four-word 1868 Presidential campaign slogan  etched into stone, which summarizes the prayer of every soldier. Those  words read ``Let Us Have Peace.''   Our country may not exist today if it weren't for Ulysses S. Grant.  It may have been shattered and divided forever by civil strife, but for  one man. That is why I was pleased last year to sponsor his  posthumously promotion to the rank of General of the Armies of the  United States, the highest rank in the U.S. military only held by  George Washington and John Pershing.   This was an important step towards recognizing the greatness of a too  often neglected hero in our Nation's past. His close friend, General  Sherman, reputedly said that he didn't understand Grant and didn't  believe Grant understood himself. And for decades, our Nation too has  misunderstood this American giant. But as we reflect upon his  accomplishments two centuries after his birth, we realize how great  they were and how extraordinary he was. I hope that we continue to  reclaim this exceptional and noble American's legacy.                            ____________________
