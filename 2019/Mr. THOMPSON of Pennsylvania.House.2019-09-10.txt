 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize the community development and revitalization efforts of  Clarion, Pennsylvania.   Recently, I was back in my district, touring Clarion's growing  downtown region, meeting with small business owners and community  leaders, and the progress and growth that I saw were truly exciting.   In 2015, Clarion was selected as a Blueprint Community, an initiative  through the FHLBank Pittsburgh that seeks to revitalize older  communities and neighborhoods. One of the shining stars of the  Blueprint program is the Clarion River Brewing Company, and I am proud  of their continued success as one of the many exciting small businesses  in town.   But Clarion's blueprint included more than new businesses. It also  outlines a plan to increase affordable housing options for current and  future residents.   These blueprints don't offer one-size-fits-all plans for community  development. Instead, they work with local leaders to better understand  the needs of their residents to create custom, homegrown solutions that  breathe new life into older communities.   Madam Speaker, I am excited to see what Clarion has in store, and I  am rooting for its continued success.                            ____________________
