 Madam Speaker, I thank Leader McCarthy, and the  Minnesota delegation.   Madam Speaker, it is an extraordinary honor to be here and to be  chosen by my southern Minnesota friends, families, and neighbors to  serve in this Congress.   First, let's take time to remember my predecessor, the late  Congressman Hagedorn. He was a true fighter for southern Minnesota, and  he was a great example of hard work and what we strive to be in  Minnesota.   I thank my wife, Jackie, and these hooligans up front, my seven kids.   Thank you, guys.   I thank my parents, my brother, sister-in-law--everyone, just thank  you so much. We really couldn't do this without you, so I just  appreciate you being here and the support and love that you have given  us our entire lives.   Madam Speaker, people in my district sent a farmer to Congress. I  tell people that when I wake up, I have dirt under my fingernails-- sorry, Jackie. I don't clean up that well. But I drive a John Deere  tractor, and on the farm, when we wake up in the morning, we know  something will be broke. So we wake up trying to figure out, How am I  going to fix things?   So really, to me, serving in Congress is all about that. Rolling up  my sleeves, taking that farmer mentality, figuring what is broke, and  how we are going to fix it, and move on. That is the farmer in me, and  that is the southern Minnesotan in me, born and raised. That is the DNA  that Jackie and I have had in our generations of families that have  built a farm and agribusiness in south central Minnesota.   We inherited the best country on Earth from the last generation. I  think quite often of those that have given blood, sweat, and tears to  give us the greatest country in the world. As I look at my seven  children and the children across southern Minnesota and across this  country, I know that we can do better, and it is up to us to make sure  that we are leaving them a better country than we have been left.   Madam Speaker, with that attitude, with that work ethic, and with my  compassion and hope to meet all of you and work with you, I just very  humbly say thank you. I am ready to get to work.                            ____________________
