 Mr. President, let me thank Senator Schatz for his  comments. I hope every Senator will follow the points he is making  because I think they are critically important.   First and foremost, we are talking about the appropriate power of the  legislative branch of government. We have the power to appropriate. We  are the article I branch of government. We have appropriated money for  border security. We have appropriated money for military construction.  Congress clearly intended the monies that we appropriated for military  construction to go to our military installations and our military  families. We made that conscientious decision.   Now the President is transferring funds from military construction  that help our service personnel to the border wall. I say that because  it is an unconstitutional grasp of power. It compromises the checks and  balances that are in our Constitution. It is an abuse of power, but it  is also affecting the quality of life of the men and women who have  voluntarily agreed to join our military to protect our country. We can  give you many examples.   We are talking about $3.6 billion of funds that were taken from  military construction that are now being used by the President to fund  the border wall. It is not Mexico that is paying for this wall; it is  the men and women who are serving our Nation who are going to pay for  this wall and our military service. That is outrageous, and every  Member of the Senate should be concerned about that.   Let me talk about my own State of Maryland and the military  construction projects in Maryland that would be directly affected.  There is a road project at Fort Meade for $16.5 million. Fort Meade is  just a few miles away from the Nation's Capital. For any of you who  have had the opportunity to travel between Baltimore and Washington, it  is about halfway when you come to Fort Meade. You will notice the  challenges of trying to get onto Fort Meade's base. The mission being  done at Fort Meade is a national security priority for this country,  and these roads are critically important for our national security. It  has been backed up a long time. Now, thanks to the President--if this  goes forward--it will be backed up a lot longer.   The second cut is $37 million to Joint Base Andrews for a HAZMAT  cargo path. This is a matter of safety for the men and women who work  at Joint Base Andrews.   I hope all of you are familiar with Joint Base Andrews, which is  located just a few miles from here. The Air Force is there. Many of us  go through that facility. It is critical that they have the facilities  to protect our Nation's Capital and protect the Members and personnel  who use that facility. The President, again, is taking away from the  safety of the mission at Joint Base Andrews.   The one issue I want to talk about that really highlights the  hypocrisy of this transfer is the cut of $13 million to a child  development center at Joint Base Andrews. I want to read for my  colleagues the justification given by the Air Force for this request. I  am quoting:         The existing child development center was originally       constructed as a medical clinic in 1943, renovated to serve       many purposes over the last 74 years and is inadequate for       current needs. Presently, base child development center has       over 37 children on a waiting list for enrollment. The       existing facility has suffered from sewage backups, a leaking       roof, HVAC failures, along with mold and pest management       issues. Work orders continue to pile up despite heavy focus       from [engineers], making it more difficult to ensure       accreditation each year. The bathrooms are constantly       flooding and drainage issues in [the] kitchen result in       monthly backups.    The justification continues by saying that the child development  center ``either needs to be recapitalized due to condition, or taken  out of service.''   Then they wrote:         IMPACT IF NOT PROVIDED: Not providing this facility forces       members to use more expensive, less convenient and       potentially lower quality off-base programs. These off-base       child development centers typically cost $9400 more than on-      base, creating a severe financial strain on military       personnel. Quality of life will be severely degraded       resulting in impacts to retention and readiness because       Airmen and their families will not have a safe and nurturing       environment for child care.    This is the Air Force's justification for this project. As they point  out, it will cost military families an additional $10,000 a year. Who  is paying for the wall? Our military families are paying for the wall,  not the Government of Mexico. That is what is involved here.   We cannot let this go forward. Every Member of this body should be  aware of what is happening. I just mentioned three of the projects that  are on that list of $3.7 billion that are being transferred to fund the  wall that Congress intentionally provided the money for military  families. That is wrong. We should stand up for our military families.   I enjoy the fact that we all say we support our military. We are very  proud of their stepping forward to defend us, and now we are telling  them they have to pay an extra $10,000 for childcare. That is what is  involved here. I hope every Member of this body will voice their  opposition to what the President is attempting to do.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues Senators  Collins, King, Brown, Markey, Murphy, Menendez, Klobuchar, Blumenthal,  Hassan, Jones, Van Hollen, Casey, Baldwin, Harris, Murray, Rosen, and  Kaine to recognize the week beginning September 8, 2019, as National  Direct Support Professionals Recognition Week. Direct support  professionals are an invaluable part of our Nation's healthcare system,  caring for the most vulnerable Americans, including the chronically  ill, seniors, and those living with a disability. Direct support  professionals include, among others, those whose titles include home  caregiver, personal care assistant, home care worker, or home health  aide. These varying titles speaks to the broad areas of support that  are integral to the work of direct support professionals. With the  assistance of direct support professionals, these individuals can  perform daily activities that many people take for granted, such as  eating, bathing, dressing, and leaving the house. The work of direct  support professionals ensures that these individuals can be active  participants in their communities.   Let me share with you the experience of Marian Mulbah-Poquee, a  direct support professional who was recognized this year for her  incredible work and dedication when she was given Maryland's Direct  Support Professional of the Year Award by the American Network of  Community Options and Resources, ANCOR. Marian has been described as  ``a tireless advocate for her ladies,'' providing the women she serves  with the space and choice to lead full and independent lives.   Marian supports her clients by teaching them skills that enable them  to participate in their communities to the fullest extent possible. For  example, Marian teaches her clients safety skills, gardening, and basic  home care so they can spend more time living independently. Marian also  encourages her clients to actively participate in civic life. This was  best exemplified by a trip her clients took to Annapolis last year for  Developmental Disability Day. Marian supported her clients as they met  with and engaged their local representatives to discuss issues that  affect the disability community in Maryland. Marian's commitment to  simultaneously supporting and empowering her clients to actively  participate in the public sphere speaks to the very core of what  defines direct support professionals.   Marian's story describes a career that is fulfilling, but one that  oftentimes is not easy for Direct support professionals like her. The  hours are often long, and the wages are low. The job can be physically  laborious, as well as emotionally draining. The reward for direct  support professionals, however, is that they are able to improve the  lives of individuals with disabilities and help fulfill the promise of  the Americans with Disabilities Act by making it possible for these  Americans to participate in their communities to the fullest extent  possible.  [[Page S5483]]    In our country, we are incredibly fortunate to have millions of  service-oriented individuals who are willing to rise to the task of  becoming a direct support professional. According to the Bureau of  Labor Statistics, the employment of DSPs is projected to grow by an  average of 41 percent from 2016 to 2026, compared to a 7 percent  average growth rate for all occupations during that period. The demand  will only continue to increase over time; the Baby Boomer generation  will result in the doubling of the population of adults ages 65 and  older by 2050. The increased demand for direct support professionals  has created shortages in some areas, which can place strains on  patients and their families or result in medical issues that could have  been avoided.   Unfortunately, direct support professionals are often forced to leave  the jobs they love due to low wages and excessive, difficult work  hours. Many direct support professionals rely on public benefits, and  some must work multiple jobs in order to provide for themselves and  their families. Now, more than ever, it is imperative that we work to  ensure that these hardworking individuals have the income and emotional  support they need and deserve.   I urge my colleagues to join me and Senators Collins, King, Brown,  Markey, Murphy, Menendez, Klobuchar, Blumenthal, Hassan, Jones, Van  Hollen, Casey, Baldwin, Harris, Murray, Rosen, and Kaine in expressing  our appreciation for the critically important work of our country's  direct support professionals, in thanking them for their commitment and  dedication, and in supporting the resolution designating the week  beginning September 8, 2019, as National Direct Support Professionals  Recognition Week.
