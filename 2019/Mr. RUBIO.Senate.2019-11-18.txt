 Mr. President, as chairman of the Committee on  Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize a small  business that exemplifies the American entrepreneurial spirit at the  heart of our economy. It is my privilege to honor a Florida small  business that not only creates a great product but also invests time  and effort into charitable work for the Greater Miami area. This week,  it is my pleasure to honor Misha's Cupcakes of Coral Gables, FL, as the  Senate Small Business of the Week.   Established in 2005, Misha's Cupcakes offers a variety of delicious  baked goods at its multiple storefronts throughout South Florida. After  hearing about a small cupcake company in Los Angeles which produced  1,000 cupcakes a day, founder Misha Kuryla became inspired and believed  she could replicate the same process. She began baking cupcakes out of  her kitchen, and after strategically giving away several free samples,  landed her first wholesale account from a local bakery. What started as  small, home-based operation has developed into a thriving company,  employing nearly 70 Floridians. Misha's Cupcakes now produces more than  10,000 baked goods every day at its stores and warehouse. In addition  to selling baked goods locally, Misha's Cupcakes sells its products  nationally through its website. This website offers customers not only  the ability to order products such as cookies and brownies but also to  request donated cupcakes for a charity event or fundraiser.   Misha's Cupcakes' dedication to community service has been central  since its founding when Misha donated several hundred cupcakes to a  local breast cancer awareness event. Since then, this business has  remained committed to serving its community. It has partaken in a wide  range of community service events, including donating baked goods to  local food banks and organizing a Hurricane Dorian relief drive for the  people of the Bahamas. Such dedication to service has made Misha's  Cupcakes a valuable member of South Florida's community.   Residents of South Florida have responded to Misha's Cupcakes'  involvement in their community by becoming loyal customers. In addition  to receiving rave reviews, the business was named ``Best Cupcakes in  Miami'' by the Miami New Times in 2014 and ``Best Cupcakes in Florida''  by the Daily Meal in 2017. Misha herself has also been honored by the  community for her dedicated work. In 2012, she was named an ``uncommon  thinker'' by her alma  [[Page S6622]]  mater, Florida International University--FIU--and participated as a  speaker at FIU's 2017 Women's Leadership Summit.   Misha's Cupcakes is a great example of the integral role community  oriented small businesses play in our unique American economy. I  commend their efforts to provide a quality product while simultaneously  making local involvement a priority. Congratulations again to the  entire team at Misha's Cupcakes. I look forward to watching your  continued growth and success.                            ____________________
