 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Patient  Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement Act.   And, yes, I agree with my colleagues, this is not the time for  partisan politics. It has been over 10 years since the passage of the  historic Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which expanded  healthcare to 20 million Americans. And now this administration is at  the Supreme Court trying to repeal it, and it has been 4 years since  our colleagues, who say they will protect people, have done anything.  They have not given us anything else. All they do is take knocks.   Many forget that when that bill passed the reforms ended lifetime  limits. People could not get health insurance if they couldn't afford  it, if they had pre-existing conditions. It allowed States to expand  Medicaid and provide access to both quality, affordable healthcare and  protection from crippling medical bills.   In my home State, the bipartisan expansion under Governor Rick  Snyder, a Republican Governor, Healthy Michigan, currently covers  650,000 Michiganders, and supports rural hospitals in Michigan that  would otherwise face a significant financial hardship. The reforms in  today's bill, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement  Act, build on these successes.   The legislation would reduce healthcare premiums for Americans by  expanding existing subsidies under the Affordable Care Act to those  that need the help. It would also support outreach and enrollment  efforts and roll back the current administration's plans to promote  junk insurance plans that lack the coverage of basic benefits.   Finally, it would save Americans billions of dollars annually by  allowing the Secretary of Health and Human Services, a Republican right  now, to negotiate drug prices. The Congressional Budget Office also  estimates that the drugs subject to negotiation would reduce prices by  55 percent.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
