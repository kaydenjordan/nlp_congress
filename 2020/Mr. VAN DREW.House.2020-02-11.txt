 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1980, the  Smithsonian Women's History Museum Act.   On March 31, 1776, future First Lady Abigail Adams wrote to her  husband, John Adams, urging him and the other members of the  Continental Congress to ``remember the ladies'' when fighting for  America's independence from Great Britain and drafting a new form of  government.   Unfortunately, despite this nation's great history, we were slow to  take Abigail Adams' advice to heart. It took 144 years to grant women  the right to vote, an historic event I talked about a week ago in a  floor speech commemorating the 100th anniversary of New Jersey's  ratification of the 19th Amendment.   Even this Congress has downplayed the contributions of women in  history as evidenced by the treatment of Portrait Monument, the statue  in the Capitol of the three greatest leaders of the suffrage movement,  Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott.   The Portrait Monument was unveiled with great fanfare in 1921 shortly  after the ratification of the 19th Amendment, but for decades it was  relegated to an isolated area of the Crypt without a plaque explaining  the contributions of the three women or a description of the female  artist who sculpted it.   For decades, Congress cited the cost of moving the statue as reason  enough for keeping it in the Crypt. In the 1990s, the sponsor of  today's bill, Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney of New York, led an effort  to raise the funds to move the statue upstairs to the Rotunda. It was  not until 1997 that the statue was moved to its current place of honor.   That date is significant for our purposes today. Susan Whiting, the  chairman of the board for the National Women's History Museum  organization has stated that ``[The statue] was the beginning of the  entire process of eventually building a museum,''   It's been a long road since 1997 to build a Women's History Museum  but passing this bill today will be one giant step closer to our goal.    Madam Speaker, I recognize Cannon Lodge 104, which, on  February 26, will be celebrating 150 years as a chartered Masonic  lodge.   Cannon Lodge had its first outreach on October 27, 1869, from Henry  Cannon, whom the lodge is named after. On February 26, 1870, a Masonic  charter was granted, and Cannon Lodge 104 came into existence.   In January 1960, through the generosity of Brother Elmer Smith, the  present location of the lodge was donated and dedicated to his father,  Captain Charles S. Smith.   In 1995, Sea Isle City Lodge No. 280 was merged with Cannon; and, in  1999, Arbutus Lodge No. 170 of Cape May Court House did the very same  thing.   I am a proud member of Cannon Lodge 104, and we live by the motto:  ``Making Good Men Better.'' These men around me there have made me a  better man. We are dedicated to the betterment of ourselves, our  community, and giving to charity.   Madam Speaker, I look forward to the continued work we will do in the  community, and I thank them all for the work my fellow brothers do.  They are truly heroes in south Jersey.                            ____________________
