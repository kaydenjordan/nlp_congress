 Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I  ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate  consideration of S. 2895, introduced earlier today. I ask unanimous  consent that the bill be considered read a third time and passed, and  that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table.    First off, I am disappointed my colleague  objected. I think No. 1 is this is unconstitutional. First off,  President Biden promised he wouldn't be doing this. This is  unconstitutional.   Here is what it is going to do. If you talk to businesses around this  country, they are already struggling to get people back to work because  of excess funding that has been provided. And now we are going to tell  a bunch of people that you can't come back to work because you haven't  been vaccinated. We are going to tell people, you can't get on an  airplane because you haven't been vaccinated.   This is wrong. This is not what the Federal Government ought to be  doing. They ought to do what I did when I was Governor. You give people  the information and feel comfortable that the American public will make  a good decision.   I think this is a mistake. I hope my colleague will change her mind.  And I hope this President will not continue down the path of requiring  Americans to get vaccinations, because I don't think it is fair to  Americans and I think it is unconstitutional.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, the past 18 months have been  trying for our Nation.   Thankfully, the vaccine has brought normalcy back to the lives of  many Americans. In record time, thanks to the hard work of the Trump  administration and scientists across our country, we developed a safe  and effective vaccine to protect Americans against COVID-19.   These vaccines show us what can happen through cooperation,  ingenuity, and hard work. And I am grateful for all those who helped us  get here. I got the vaccine and encourage everyone to talk to their  doctor and consider doing the same. That is what we all should do: give  Americans all the information and data so that they have everything  they need to make a good decision for their family.   That is exactly what I did when I was Governor of Florida in the face  of life-threatening hurricanes. I made sure Florida families were well  informed. I went out and made sure everyone knew exactly what to expect  and how dangerous the storm could be, but I didn't issue mandates  because that is not what governments should do.   When I was Governor of Florida, we had the Zika healthcare crisis,  which impacted newborns. Rather than placing mandates on pregnant women  or restricting their travel to areas with local transmission of Zika,  we simply informed Floridians, worked to be as transparent as possible,  and offered free Zika testing to all pregnant women in Florida.   Unfortunately, the Biden administration has gone in the complete  opposite direction. The White House has tried to use the new OSHA  guidance to create fear; push another round of trillions of dollars in  reckless, wasteful spending; lock down our Nation; close our schools;  and kill the economy that so many Americans have worked so hard to  preserve and protect.   Americans are sick and tired of the government telling them what to  do, and the American people are more than capable of making the right  choices to protect themselves, their families, and their neighbors.   As families and businesses in Florida and across the U.S. continue to  work hard to recover from COVID-19's devastation, travel is critical to  getting our economy fully reopened. America's truckers, shippers,  pilots, and deliverymen and -women play an important role in delivering  the goods needed to keep our economy going. Everything from gas and  groceries to packages from small businesses and department stores, they  help keep this country running. They also haven't had the luxury of  working from home. For 18 months, they have shown up to work. They have  figured out how to be safe without the feds telling them what to do.   But the job-killing Biden White House is now considering requiring  those engaged in interstate commerce or interstate travel be vaccinated  and provide proof of vaccination and a vaccine passport.   The Federal Government has no business imposing vaccine mandates on  the American people and our hard-working businesses. This proposal  reeks of a power grab and is another attempt by the Biden White House  to control  [[Page S6784]]  Americans. The Biden administration wants to control Americans through  fear and mandates so the Federal Government is touching every single  part of your life.   I won't stand for it. Americans won't stand for it. They know that  such an order is an overreach of power. Americans should be free to  make choices they feel are in the best interests of their own health  and the health of their loved ones, and the Federal Government has no  business requiring travelers to turn over their personal medical  information in order to make a delivery or to catch a flight.   I believe Floridians and Americans across this country know what  decisions are best for them. They don't need the Biden administration  controlling their lives.   The Supreme Court has already ruled that the Federal Government can't  force people to purchase health insurance under the Commerce Clause.  Why would President Biden think he could do so with a vaccine mandate?   In December, President Biden promised--promised--he would not require  Americans to be vaccinated or require that they carry vaccine  passports--promise by President Biden. The new OSHA order breaks that  promise. It has been one lie after another with this President.   Today, I am introducing legislation which will prevent  unconstitutional vaccine mandates for interstate commerce. I am  thankful for Senators Johnson, Lummis, Marshall, and Lee cosponsoring  this legislation and for Congressman   Dan Crenshaw, who is introducing  the companion bill in the House of Representatives.   We are working to make sure that families across our country can  travel freely and businesses can conduct interstate commerce without  the ridiculous government bureaucracy created by vaccine passports.   This bill would prohibit the Department of Transportation, the  Department of Commerce, and other Federal Agencies from requiring proof  of vaccination or the use of a vaccine passport to engage in interstate  commerce or travel.   It protects people like my dad, who used to drive a truck and would  carry goods across State lines. It protects the rights of American  citizens, as laid out in our Constitution.   President Biden is trying to upend our way of life and impose his  view of health on every American--and I am here to say that I won't  stand for it.   Now, I would like to yield to my friends Senator Johnson and Senator  Lee, as they will talk about this same bill.    Mr. President, under no circumstances should  the Federal Government attempt to mandate these vaccines and require  proof of vaccination in order to conduct business.   Small business owners who are trying to restart their businesses,  families trying to take vacations, and truckers who are getting back to  work shouldn't have to choose between living their  [[Page S6786]]  lives and meeting President Biden's demands.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the past 18 months have been  trying for our Nation.
