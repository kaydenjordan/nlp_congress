 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Alabama for his  strong leadership as our new ranking member, and I look forward to  working with him and the chairman on what is truly still, I think, the  most bipartisan committee in Congress.   I want to make clear that I have enormous respect for General  Austin's service. I don't think anyone can look at his record and not  come away very impressed.   But I also strongly oppose this bill. There is no waiver; we are  actually changing the underlying law. This was one of the biggest  talking points 4 years ago. And we should not do so lightly.   Much has been made about the historic nature of Mr. Austin's  nomination, which is true but in more ways than one. If we change the  law today, we will now have done so twice within 4 years, effectively  destroying the historical precedent against such exemptions.   We will also invert the congressional intent in the underlying  National Security Act by setting the precedent that the presumption is  for approval, not the disapproval, of recently retired officers.   So the law and the norm of civil-military relations that it is meant  to buttress is on life support right now.  [[Page H212]]    And, as in 2017, we will be granting this exemption without a public  hearing of the Armed Services Committee, which is the bare minimum of  our constitutional obligations. We will be getting rolled over, to  borrow a phrase that was used 4 years ago.   And I don't know, I am not in the room where these ratios are  discussed, and this and that, but it seems to me that it is worth  waiting a few days in order to have such a public hearing, but it is my  understanding that our entire workweek next week has been canceled.   So I don't think it withstands basic scrutiny to suggest that we  couldn't have had a public hearing to discuss this very, very important  issue.   Now, 4 years ago, I voted in favor of the exemption for Secretary  Mattis. I think it was my first vote. It was certainly my first speech  on the House floor. So it is fair to ask what has changed. Well, a lot  has changed.   First and perhaps most importantly, the threat from China is far  greater, and we need a Secretary with INDOPACOM experience. The nominee  has admitted that he is not uniquely qualified in that regard, and I  don't think there is a more important aspect of his experience that we  could analyze in considering whether to change the underlying law.   Second, budgetary pressures on the Department are much bigger.  Particularly in the post-pandemic world, it is going to be far more  difficult to build off of the success that we have had in giving the  Department the resources it needs, and we will need a Secretary with  political experience who can fight and win interagency battles for a  higher top line.   And, third, we also have more data. Four years ago, we ran this  experiment for the first time in 67 years, and we learned that recently  retired general officers face unique challenges when leading the  Department--specifically, the need to publicly advocate for a higher  top line, which requires some political experience. And the nominee has  made much of the apolitical nature of his prior experience.   Now, I know in politics we are not supposed to change our minds, but  if we are unwilling to learn from recent experience or change our minds  in response to new information, then we are doomed to repeat the exact  same mistakes.                                time  1430    This is why I am voting ``no,'' among other reasons.   But I want to be clear. I want Mr. Austin, soon-to-be Secretary  Austin, to be successful in this job. Nothing would make me happier  than to look back on his time at DOD and be able to say he was the most  successful Secretary of Defense in our Nation's history because that  will mean that we as a committee were successful in working with him to  do what is right for our men and women in uniform and do what is right  for the rest of the country.   Though I will oppose changing the law again for the second time in 4  years, I very much look forward to working with my colleagues, both  Republican and Democratic. I genuinely appreciate the honest exchange  of views we had 4 years ago and 4 years later. I can only say that 4  years from now, I hope we are not having the same debate because it  will prove we have learned nothing from this.
