 Mr. Speaker, to ensure environmental progress, we  must let technology lead the way. However, the liberal media often  ignores news about innovations that would mitigate climate change.   A recent report by the Environmental Protection Agency shows that  U.S. greenhouse gas emissions have declined by 11 percent since 2005.  No other industrialized country has made so much progress. Investor's  Business Daily points out in an editorial, ``How U.S. Slashed  CO2,'' that breakthroughs in technology, and not one-size- fits-all regulations, are the reason for U.S. success in reducing  emissions.   The IBD article also notes that many countries that signed the Paris  accord continue to increase their emissions. Instead of innovating,  these countries are regulating. Regulations set impossible targets for  carbon emissions and have little impact on the environment. The media  should report on technological innovations that address climate change.  Instead, they use scare tactics to promote more government regulations  and government control of the economy.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman from  Pennsylvania, the chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure  Committee, Mr. Shuster, for yielding me time.   Mr. Chairman, I support the FAA Leadership in Groundbreaking High- Tech Research and Development Act, or FLIGHT R&D Act, incorporated in  H.R. 4 as Title VII of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018.   Title VII's FLIGHT R&D Act will ensure America remains a world leader  in aviation innovation. By making prioritized and strategic investments  today, our Nation will continue to push the boundaries of aerospace  technology, maintain a safe and secure aviation transportation system,  and foster a healthy and growing aviation economy.   Mr. Chair, I thank Science Committee member Steve Knight for  introducing this important legislation and Chairman Shuster for  including it in his bill.   The safety of the flying public is of paramount importance. That is  why Title VII's FLIGHT R&D Act prioritizes research and development to  improve aviation safety.   Title VII authorizes increased funding for aviation safety research  and development. Improving aviation safety is the fundamental mission  of the FAA's research and development agenda.   Title VII establishes an FAA associate administrator for research and  development to manage and oversee all FAA research and development  programs and activities. These will include the R&D provisions in this  bill regarding unmanned aircraft systems, cybersecurity, the national  aerospace system, aviation fuel, air traffic surveillance, remote and  computer piloting, and spectrum use.   In closing, Mr. Chairman, I strongly support Title VII, the FLIGHT  R&D Act, and urge my colleagues to support this fiscally responsible,  commonsense initiative to ensure that America remains at the forefront  of civil aviation, innovation, and safety.
