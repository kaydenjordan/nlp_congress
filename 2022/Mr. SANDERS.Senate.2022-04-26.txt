 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the American people are increasingly  outraged by the level of corporate greed that we are seeing in this  country. As you know, while prices are rapidly increasing, corporate  profits are soaring: in the oil industry in what we pay at the gas  pumps; in the food industry in what we pay in grocery stores; in  housing and in so many other areas. Meanwhile, while the very, very  rich get richer, because of inflation, many workers are now seeing a  decline in their real wages.   During this pandemic, unbelievably--and I hope that everybody knows  this--while workers have been struggling, the billionaire class, people  who are worth at least $1 billion, have seen a $2 trillion increase in  their wealth; and the level of income and wealth inequality today is  the highest that it has been in over 100 years.   Two people--Mr. Musk and Mr. Bezos--now own more wealth than the  bottom 42 percent of American society--over 130 million people. Two  people own more wealth than the bottom 130 million Americans.   In the midst of all of this--inflation, inequality, corporate greed-- working people have declared loudly and clearly that enough is enough.  We must end the corporate greed that is hurting so many of our  families. Workers are now fighting back in a way that I have not seen  for a very long time to improve their standard of living, to get the  wages and benefits they desperately need, and to get a seat at the  negotiating table in a way that has not taken place in a very, very  long time.   Workers throughout this country are now in the process of organizing  unions at a grassroots level and are prepared to go out on strike when  the greed of large corporations prevents them from receiving decent  wages and decent benefits. During the last couple of years, I have  personally been involved in a number of union-organizing campaigns and  strikes throughout the country--from John Deere, Nabisco, and Kellogg's  in the Midwest to the Warrior Met strike in Alabama--which continues  today--to the Kroger grocery store strike in Colorado, and many  others--and I have to say that I have been incredibly impressed by the  solidarity and the courage of those workers who are prepared to stand  up for justice against very powerful corporate interests.   As I am sure the Presiding Officer knows, a historic union victory  was achieved nearly 1 month ago by Amazon workers in Staten Island.  Amazon is one of the most profitable and one of the most powerful  corporations in America. It is also one of the largest employers in our  country, with close to a million workers.   We are talking, when we talk about Amazon, about a company that made  a record-breaking $36 billion in profit last year--$36 billion. And  that was a 453-percent increase from where it was before the pandemic.  In other words, Amazon today is doing unbelievably well, and, in fact,  it is doing better as a company than it has ever done before.    We are talking about a company that is owned by Mr. Jeff Bezos, the  second wealthiest person in America, worth $170 billion. Let me repeat  that. He is not the wealthiest; he is only the second wealthiest, worth  $170 billion.   And here is something that is interesting and tells you about our  corrupt political system and our regressive and unfair tax system. We  are talking about a company--Amazon--that makes huge profits, that paid  nothing--zero--in Federal income taxes in 2017 and 2018 and paid a  lower tax rate, Federal tax rate, than a nurse or a firefighter last  year, after making billions in profits. The average nurse, firefighter,  or grocery store worker has an effective tax rate that is higher than  what Amazon's was last year.   We are also talking about Mr. Bezos as an individual, who, in a given  year, despite his extraordinary wealth, has also paid zero--nothing--in  Federal taxes.   It is funny. On Sunday, I was in New York City, and I stopped in a  McDonald's and was talking to one of the guys who works there. I asked  him how much money he made. He makes $15 an hour. And then he came back  and said: Well, they take out over a dollar in Federal taxes. So a guy  working in McDonald's for $15 an hour probably has a higher tax rate  than the second wealthiest person in this country.   That is what happens here in Washington when you are somebody like  Mr. Bezos or some other billionaire and you make a lot of campaign  contributions and you have an army of accountants and lawyers who help  you avoid your tax responsibilities.   Mr. President, during the pandemic the last several years, Mr. Bezos,  like  [[Page S2147]]  many other billionaires, did very, very well. In fact, since March of  2020, Mr. Bezos became $65 billion richer, in just a couple of years-- huge increase in his wealth. So, Mr. President, if you ask me why  people in this country are really, really angry, I will tell you, and  that has a lot to do with the reality that, in the midst of the  pandemic, in the midst of the massive economic dislocation that we have  seen, we have lost tens of thousands of essential workers, people who  live paycheck to paycheck, who had no choice. They had to go into a  warehouse. They had to go into a grocery store. They had to drive a  bus. They had to do all of the things that keep America going; and as a  result of that, having to go to work, thousands of them contracted  COVID and many thousands actually died. That is what happens when you  are an ordinary worker in America living paycheck to paycheck. You  don't have a choice. You have got to go to work to feed your family.   And during that same period, the billionaires and Mr. Bezos made out  like bandits. Bezos himself became $65 billion richer. Jeff Bezos has  enough money to own a $500 million yacht--$500 million yacht. He has  enough money to afford a $175 million estate in Beverly Hills. He has  enough money to afford a $78 million, 14-acre estate in Maui. He has  enough money to own a $23 million mansion right here in Washington, DC,  which has 25 bathrooms. So if you are in Washington, DC, and you have  to go to the bathroom, you know someplace that you can possibly go. Mr.  Bezos has enough money to buy a rocket ship to blast William Shatner to  the edge of outer space.   Yet even though Mr. Bezos can afford all of these mansions and his  $500 million yacht and his rocket ship, Mr. Bezos refuses to pay his  workers at Amazon decent wages, decent benefits, or provide decent  working conditions.   That, Mr. President, is what excessive greed is all about, and that  is why the American people are saying enough is enough. The American  people want action from the President; they want action from Congress;  and we have got to deliver.   From the very beginning of the union-organizing effort until today,  Mr. Bezos and his company have done everything possible--legal and  illegal--to defeat the union effort. In fact, Amazon cannot even come  to grips with the reality that workers in Staten Island won their union  election fair and square. In order to stall the process out, Amazon's  lawyers have appealed that election result to the NLRB. Their strategy,  as is often the strategy of corporate interests confronting unions, is  to use their incredible resources, their unending amount of money, to  stall, stall, and stall.   In every way possible, Amazon is refusing to negotiate a fair first  contract with the Amazon Labor Union. In fact, Amazon has been engaged  in a massive attempt to undermine the union organizing drive in direct  violation of labor laws and regulations.   Let's be clear. Amazon has already been penalized more than $75  million for breaking Federal discrimination and labor laws. Amazon is  currently being sued by the National Labor Relations Board to reinstate  a worker who was illegally fired for organizing a union. To date, there  are currently 59--59--unfair labor cases against Amazon pending at the  National Labor Relations Board. Several current and former employees at  Amazon have alleged that the company has engaged in illegal harassment  and discrimination based on race, gender, and sexual orientation.   Amazon misclassifies delivery drivers as independent contractors  rather than employees in order to evade tax, wage, and benefit  responsibilities.   Amazon's inadequate workplace safety policies also pose grave risks  to workers. If you can believe it--and this really is quite  unbelievable--according to a New York Times investigation, Amazon  warehouses have a 150-percent turnover rate--150 percent a year.  Workers come into the warehouses; they are worked as hard as humanly  possible. And then after they are exhausted and physically broken down,  they leave and then a whole new set of workers comes in and the process  continues. Further, in some locations, their workplace injury rates are  more than 2\1/2\ times the industry average.   I was in Staten Island on Sunday talking to some Amazon workers, and  they tell me that injuries take place every single day, and many of  them go unreported. Last December, six Amazon workers died after they  were required to continue working during unsafe weather conditions in a  warehouse that did not have appropriate safety facilities or policies.   It is abundantly clear that time and time again, Amazon has engaged  in illegal anti-union activity. Amazon may be a large and profitable  corporation, it may be owned by one of the wealthiest people in  America, but it cannot be allowed to continue to violate the law and  the rights of its employees. If working people are asked to obey the  law, they do it, or they get punished. That same principle must be  upheld for a large and powerful corporation like Amazon.   That is why this morning, I sent a letter to President Biden urging  him to sign an Executive order to prohibit companies like Amazon that  have violated labor laws from receiving Federal contracts paid for by  the taxpayers of America.   Let me quote directly from the letter:         Dear President Biden, last September, I was delighted to       hear you State that you ``intend to be the most pro-union       President leading the most pro-union administration in       American history.''    That is from President Biden.         At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, where       too many workers are falling behind, your sentiment [Mr.       President] is exactly right. We need to build the trade union       movement in America and allow [more] workers to engage in       collective bargaining.        One of the most effective ways for you [President Biden] to       begin accomplishing this important goal would be to ensure       that no corporation that is engaged in illegal anti-union       activities receives a contract paid for by the taxpayers of       the United States.    That would be enormously effective in curtailing the illegal  activities of companies like Amazon. I then continued in saying in my  letter to the President:         As you will recall [Mr. President], during the presidential       campaign you promised to ``institute a multi-year federal       debarment for all employers who illegally oppose unions'' and       to ``ensure federal contracts only go to employers who sign       neutrality agreements committing not to run anti-union       campaigns.    That is what President Biden said as a candidate for President.   Then I say in my letter:         That campaign promise was exactly right. Today, I am asking       you to fulfill that promise . . . As you may know, Amazon,       one of the largest and most profitable corporations in       America, is the poster child as to why this anti-union       busting Executive Order is needed now more than ever.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the  letter be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                     April 26, 2022.      President Joseph R. Biden,      The White House,      Washington, DC.        Dear President Biden: Last September, I was delighted to       hear you state that you ``intend to be the most pro-union       President leading the most pro-union administration in       American history.''        At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, where       too many workers are falling behind, your sentiment is       exactly right. We need to build the trade union movement in       America and allow more workers to engage in collective       bargaining.        One of the most effective ways for you to begin       accomplishing this important goal would be to ensure that no       corporation that is engaged in illegal anti-union activities       receives a contract paid for by the taxpayers of the United       States.        As you will recall, during the presidential campaign you       promised to ``institute a multi-year federal debarment for       all employers who illegally oppose unions'' and to ``ensure       federal contracts only go to employers who sign neutrality       agreements committing not to run anti-union campaigns.'' That       campaign promise was exactly right. Today, I am asking you to       fulfill that promise.        The essence of your plan for strengthening union organizing       was to make sure that federal dollars do not flow into the       hands of unscrupulous employers who engage in union-busting,       participate in wage theft, or violate labor law.        In order to implement that plan, I urge you to sign an       Executive Order preventing companies that violate federal       labor laws from contracting with the federal government.        As you may know, Amazon, one of the largest and most       profitable corporations in America, is the poster child as to       why this anti-union busting Executive Order is needed now       more than ever.  [[Page S2148]]         According to filings with the U.S. Department of Labor       (DOL), Amazon spent over $4 million on consultants last year       alone in an effort to prevent its warehouses from unionizing.       As part of their illegal anti-union activity, they forced       workers to attend closed-door anti-union meetings and       discriminated against pro-union workers. After workers in       Staten Island, New York voted overwhelmingly to join the       independent Amazon Labor Union, Amazon has not only refused       to negotiate a first contract with them but refuses to       recognize that the union exists even though the National       Labor Relations Board (NLRB) certified their union victory.        Amazon has been penalized more than $75 million for       breaking federal discrimination and wage laws and is       currently being sued by the NLRB to reinstate a worker who       was illegally fired for organizing a union. The NLRB has       found multiple instances of illegal opposition to unions by       Amazon, and there are currently 59 open Unfair Labor Practice       cases pending before the NLRB. Numerous current and former       employees have alleged that Amazon engaged in illegal       harassment and discrimination based on race, gender, and       sexual orientation. Amazon misclassifies delivery drivers as       independent contractors rather than employees to evade tax,       wage, and benefit responsibilities. Amazon's inadequate       workplace safety policies also pose grave risks to workers.       In some cases, their workplace injury rates are more than 2.5       times the industry average. Last December, six Amazon workers       died after they were required to continue working during       unsafe weather conditions in a warehouse that did not have       appropriate safety facilities or policies.        Mr. President: It is abundantly clear that time and time       again Amazon has engaged in illegal anti-union activity.       Amazon may be a large and profitable corporation, it may be       owned by one of the wealthiest people in America, but it       cannot be allowed to continue to violate the law and the       rights of its employees. The time has come to tell Amazon       that if it wants another federal contract, it must obey the       law.        Since 2004, Amazon has received thousands of federal       contracts worth billions of dollars. The Washington Post,       also owned by Mr. Bezos, reported that Amazon is in line to       receive a cloud contract from the National Security Agency       worth up to $10 billion--a contract that it should not       receive as long as it continues to violate labor laws.       Another Bezos-owned company, Blue Origin, may also receive a       contract from NASA worth up to $10 billion to fly a spaceship       to the moon after more than 20 current and former employees       alleged that this company repeatedly discriminated against       workers and did not adhere to safety protocols.        Mr. President: Taxpayer dollars should not go to companies       like Amazon and multi-billionaires like Jeff Bezos who       repeatedly break the law.        And let's be clear, it is not just Amazon and Blue Origin.       According to the U.S. Government Accountability Office,       federal contractors were required to pay nearly $225 million       in back wages to workers for Service Contract Act violations       between 2014 and 2019. An investigation completed by the       Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions       found that nearly 30 percent of the top 200 violators of       workplace safety and wage theft were government contractors.        The federal government spends more than $600 billion each       year on contracts to thousands of companies who employ more       than 4 million contract workers. These workers, just like       every worker in America, deserve fair pay and benefits, safe       workplaces, and the right to a union.        I urge you to ban companies who break federal labor laws       from receiving federal contracts.        Sincerely,                                                   Bernard Sanders,                                                      U.S. Senator.     Mr. President, President Biden, more than any other  President I can recall, has talked over and over again about being pro- union. I appreciate very much what the President has said, and I know  him to be absolutely sincere when he says it. But just this afternoon,  in an article published in POLITICO, an article that dealt with my  letter to the President, this is what the article said:         A White House official said that the President ``has stated       consistently and firmly that every worker in every state must       have a free and fair choice to join a union and the right to       bargain collectively with their employer.'' The official, who       declined to be named, added that Biden believes ``there       should be no intimidation, no coercion, no threats, and no       anti-union propaganda from employers while workers are making       that vitally important choice about a union.''    That is a statement from a White House spokesman this afternoon.   What I would say is that what this official said that President Biden  doesn't want is precisely what is happening in Amazon right now. There  is intimidation. There is coercion. There are threats and anti-union  propaganda. In fact, what President Biden says should not be happening  is precisely what is happening at Amazon.   Therefore, it is my view that the time for talk is over. The time for  action is now. Taxpayer dollars should not go to companies like Amazon  and multibillionaires like Jeff Bezos who repeatedly break the law. No  government--not the Federal Government, not the State government, and  not the city government--should be handing out corporate welfare to  union busters and labor law violators.   Today, I say to President Biden: You promised to prevent union  busters like Amazon from receiving lucrative contracts from the Federal  Government. Keep that promise.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
