 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, yesterday I introduced an amendment  that would take away the President's emergency power to sell our oil  from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and give that authority back to  Congress.   Since Joe Biden has become President, he has abused his emergency  power and sold American oil to our enemies. China was the number one  buyer.   President Biden abused his power to sell our oil and reduce gas  prices so that the midterm elections would swing Democrats' way. It is  a shame to trick the American people just to win an election.   No President should be able to use their emergency powers for  politics. While my amendment failed yesterday, it opened up discussions  on how to solve this problem.   While our leadership was working with me to protect America's  Strategic Petroleum Reserve, Democrats and the mocking Hill media were  making fun of me for having a failed amendment. I want to say this:  True success comes through failure.   There is one thing that needs to be pointed out about our new  Republican majority: We are much different than Republican majorities  of the past. We aren't afraid of conflict, of disagreements in the  public's eye. We have already proven that.   What all of us are afraid of is not being a successful Republican  majority for the American people and stopping the Democrats' America  last policies.   What our Republican majority will continue to show the country and  the mocking media, in the words of our new, great Republican Speaker:  ``It's not how you start, it's how you finish.''   Today, I am introducing a new amendment that would prevent President  Biden, or any President, from selling our strategic oil reserves for  political reasons.   The American people don't believe President Biden should have the  sole authority to sell our oil for whatever reason he comes up with.  President Biden's war on American energy has crippled our country and  left us vulnerable to an economic crisis and a national security  crisis.   There is no reason the President should be able to sell one of our  most strategic resources for political gain. Instead, the President  should unleash American energy at home.   I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Duncan).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, my Democrat colleague across the  aisle pointed out exactly what I was saying, that the entire reason why  President Biden released our very precious oil--that the American  people paid for with their hard-earned tax dollars for our emergency  reserves--the reason why it was released was to reduce gas prices  before an election. Our Democrat colleague completely admits that.   He then goes on to blame the war in Ukraine for the reason that we  have a low supply. Talk about serious.   Let's talk about the most unserious decisions: that the Senate would  not take up this bill to protect the American Strategic Petroleum  Reserves; that the Senate would not take up this bill and pass my  amendment to stop any President, Democrat or Republican, from selling  oil out of our SPR for political reasons; and to imagine that President  Biden would say that he would not consider this bill.   President Biden is telling America that he doesn't care about our  emergency supply or our national security. President Biden gives a  serious, clear message to the American people that he will destroy the  fossil fuel energy industry and that that will hurt every single  American. There are no politics that can play with that.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to pass my amendment and H.R. 21.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, plans are extremely important,  but, unfortunately, our President has given us no plan on how he will  replace all of the oil--very important oil--that has been sold out of  our Strategic Petroleum Reserve.   The American people are trapped on a journey in this country. The  American people work hard every single day and pay their taxes, and  their taxes have been abused. Their tax dollars were used to fill up  the supply in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and in 2 years' time,  this President has sold out America by selling our Strategic Petroleum  Reserves and creating a national security crisis for all of America.  [[Page H440]]    I am introducing an amendment today that will require a leasing plan  from day one of President Biden's Presidency, Inauguration Day, when  this bill is enacted into law. President Biden will have to come up  with a plan to tell the American people how he will clean up his mess  and refill America's SPR.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.                                Point of Order
