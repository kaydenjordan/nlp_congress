 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for working  diligently to create the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that will give a tax  break to the middle class.   After speaking to both Speaker Paul Ryan and Ways and Means Committee  member Tom Reed, I believe that an unintended consequence of this bill  would hinder middle class Americans pursuing a higher education degree  in an attempt to better their lives. These consequences will affect the  education of employees of universities, graduate students, and  employees receiving employer-provided education benefits.   Madam Speaker, under current law, higher education institutions can  provide tax-free tuition waivers or reimbursement to employees,  spouses, and dependents.   Secondly, many universities provide graduate students, including  Ph.D. candidates, with tuition relief and stipends, which they can  utilize while pursuing their degree. Several of my constituents,  including my niece, Sarah Schiavone, who is a Ph.D. student, would be  impacted by this.   Thirdly, employer-provided education incentives are currently not  taxed. I offered two amendments, amendments 20 and 21, to H.R. 1 that  would have kept these qualified tuition reduction benefits and  currently would have provided for them to continue.    I know the Senate is working on their version of the tax  reform package, and, as of today, the Senate bill does not include the  repeal of these vital education permits.   Mr. Chairman, I would like your assurances that the current status of  these education benefits will be protected during conference debate. I  am requesting you continue to work with my office as we, together,  address this issue.    I yield to the gentleman from Illinois.    I yield to the gentleman.
