 Madam President, in a few hours, the Senate will  confirm Judge Cory T. Wilson to join the U.S. Court of Appeals for the  Fifth Circuit. Yet again, President Trump has sent up an outstanding  nominee for this important vacancy. Judge Wilson holds degrees from the  University of Mississippi and Yale Law School. He has held a  prestigious clerkship, found success in private practice, and spent  years in public service as a lawyer and a judge. The American Bar  Association rates Mr. Wilson ``well qualified.''   Once we confirm Judge Wilson today, the Senate will have confirmed  200--200--of President Trump's nominees to lifetime appointments on the  Federal bench. Following No. 200, when we depart this Chamber today,  there will not be a single circuit court vacancy anywhere in the Nation  for the first time in at least 40 years. There will not be a single  circuit court vacancy anywhere in the Nation for the first time in at  least 40 years.   As I have said many times, our work with the administration to renew  our Federal courts is not a partisan or political victory; it is a  victory for the rule of law and for the Constitution itself.   If judges applying the law and the Constitution as they are written  strikes any of our colleagues as a threat to their political agenda,  then the problem, I would argue, is with their agenda                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, today was supposed  to bring progress for an issue that is weighing heavily on the minds of  Americans. In the wake of the killings of Breonna Taylor and George  Floyd, following weeks of passionate protests from coast to coast, the  Senate was supposed to officially take up police reform on the floor  today. Instead, our Democratic colleagues are poised to turn this  routine step into a partisan impasse.   Frankly, to most Americans, the situation would sound like a satire  of what goes on in the Senate: a heated argument over whether to invoke  cloture on a motion to proceed to a proposal--a heated argument over  whether to invoke cloture on a motion to proceed to a proposal. We are  literally arguing about whether to stop arguing about whether to start  arguing about something else.   I can stand here for an hour and extol the virtues of Senator Tim  Scott's JUSTICE Act. His legislation has already earned 48 cosponsors  because it is a straightforward plan based on facts, based on data, and  based on lived experience. It focuses on improving accountability and  restoring trust. It addresses key issues like choke holds and no-knock  warrants. It expands reporting, transparency in hiring, and training  for deescalation.   I am proud to stand with this legislation, but the reality is that  nobody thought the first offer from the Republican side was going to be  the final product that traveled out of the Senate. What is supposed to  happen in this  [[Page S3162]]  body is that we vote or agree to get onto a bill, and then we discuss,  debate, and amend it until at least 60 Senators are satisfied, or it  goes nowhere. It goes nowhere at the end until 60 Senators are  satisfied.   So what are they giving up? Nothing. They don't want an outcome. The  vote we will take in a few hours is just the first step. We aren't  passing a bill. We aren't making policy decisions. It is just a  procedural vote to say that police reform is the subject the Senate  will tackle next. That is all it says--that police reform is the  subject the Senate will tackle next.   Alas, our Democratic colleagues have suddenly begun to signal they  are not willing to even begin the discussion on police reform. They are  threatening to block the subject from even reaching the Senate floor.   Yesterday, in a letter to me and on the floor, the Democratic leader  and the junior Senators from New Jersey and California put forward an  argument that was almost nonsensical. First, they explained a number of  policy differences they have with Senator Scott's proposal. No problem  there. The Senate has a handy tool for settling such differences; it is  called legislating. We take up bills. We debate them. We consider  amendments from both sides. And only if and when 60 Senators are  satisfied can we even vote on passage.   But this time, Senate Democrats say the legislative process should  not happen. This time, the Democratic leader is saying he will not let  the Senate take up the subject of police reform at all--at all--unless  I pre-negotiate with him in private and rewrite our starting point  until he is satisfied.   This last-minute ultimatum is particularly ironic given the weeks of  rhetoric from leading Democrats about how very urgent--how very  urgent--it was that Congress address police reform and racial justice.  For weeks, the Democratic leader has blustered that the Senate simply  had to address this issue before July 4. Well, that is what the vote  this morning is about.   Last week, Speaker Pelosi said: ``I hope there's a compromise to be  reached in the Congress. . . .'' because ``How many more people have to  die from police brutality?'' So, as recently as last week, leading  Democrats called it a life-or-death issue for the Senate to take up the  subject this month. Well, here we are. Here we are. We are ready to  address it. But now, in the last 48 hours, this bizarre, new ultimatum.  Now they don't want to take up the issue. They don't want to debate.  They don't want amendments. They will filibuster police reform from  even reaching the floor of the Senate unless the majority lets the  minority rewrite the bill behind closed doors in advance. Let me say  that again. They will filibuster police reform from even reaching the  floor unless the majority lets the minority rewrite the bill behind  closed doors in advance.   Yesterday, the Speaker of the House told CBS News that because Senate  Republicans do support Senator Tim Scott's reform bill, we are all-- listen to this jaw-dropping comment--``trying to get away with murder .  . . the murder of George Floyd.'' That is the Speaker of the House  accusing Senate Republicans of trying to get away with murder.   Are you beginning to see how this game works? Two weeks ago, it was  implied the Senate would have blood on our hands if we didn't take up  police reform. Now Democrats say Senator Scott and 48 other Senators  have blood on our hands because we are trying to take up police reform.   What fascinating times we live in. Armies of elites and Twitter mobs  stand ready to pounce on any speech they deem problematic. Yet unhinged  comments like these get a complete free pass--a complete free pass.   When our country needs unity, they are trying to keep us apart. When  our Nation needs bipartisan solutions, they are staging partisan  theater. This is political nonsense elevated to an art form.   In a body that has amendments and substitute amendments, it is  nonsense to say a police reform bill cannot be the starting point for a  police reform bill. It is nonsense for Democrats to say that, because  they want to change Senator Scott's bill, they are going to block the  Senate from taking it up and amending it. If they are confident in  their positions, they should embrace the amendment process. If they  aren't confident their views will persuade others, that just  underscores why they don't get to insert these views in advance--in  advance--behind closed doors.   No final legislation can pass without 60 votes. If Democrats do not  like the final product, it will not pass. The only way there is any  downside for Democrats to come to the table is that they would rather  preserve this urgent subject as a live campaign issue than pass a  bipartisan answer.   The majority has done everything we can to proceed to this issue in  good faith. I have fast-tracked this issue to the floor this month, as  our Democratic colleagues said they wanted until 48 hours ago. I have  expressed my support for a robust amendment process, as our Democratic  colleagues said they wanted until 48 hours ago.   So make no mistake about it: Senate Republicans are ready to make a  law. We are ready to discuss and amend our way to a bipartisan product,  pass it, and take it to conference with the House. The American people  deserve an outcome, and we cannot get an outcome if Democrats will not  even let us begin--not even let us begin.   I hope our colleagues reconsider and let the Senate consider police  reform later today. If they do not, the next time another appalling  incident makes our Nation sick to its stomach with grief and anger yet  again, Senate Democrats can explain to the Nation why they made sure  the Senate did nothing                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I enter a motion to reconsider the  vote.    Mr. President, I want to explain the reason I changed  to no.   I am in strong support of the bill that has been crafted by the  Senator from South Carolina. In order to have an opportunity to  reconsider the vote without waiting for 2 days, I changed my vote and  moved to reconsider, which means that it could come back at any time  should progress be made.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 483,  S. 4049.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk for  the motion to proceed.  [[Page S3171]]     I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call  be waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, over the school's two centuries, some  of Kentucky's brightest students have walked Centre College's campus.  Our Commonwealth's first Governor, Isaac Shelby, chaired the inaugural  board. Prominent Kentucky surgeon Dr. Ephraim McDowell, whose accolades  include a statue here in the U.S. Capitol, also served as a trustee. To  date, Centre's alumni include two U.S. Vice Presidents, one Chief  Justice and an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, as well as more  than a dozen Senators, 43 Members of Congress, and 11 Governors.   Today, I would like to pay tribute to another leading member of  Centre's community: its 20th president and my good friend Dr. John  Roush. At the end of this month, John will complete his service to the  school, closing out 22 years of achievement that have brought well- deserved praise and growth to Centre.   Since coming to Danville, John has led a transformation of the  school. He championed major investments into campus infrastructure, the  addition of new endowed professorships, and the completion of a $120  million capital campaign. Along the way, a national publication twice  named Centre the top school in the South.   Of course, Centre College is no stranger to making national  headlines. In 2000, Centre hosted a Vice Presidential debate between  Dick Cheney and our former colleague Joe Lieberman. When Centre was  selected for this prestigious honor, it was the smallest higher  educational institution in history to host a Presidential or Vice  Presidential debate. By any objective standard, the event was a total  success, and it came as a clear result of John's creativity and  ingenuity. Afterward, a Washington Post writer praised the debate as  ``one of the best ever. The whole day was a happy pageant of Norman  Rockwell meets Alexis de Tocqueville.''   That writer wasn't the only one impressed by Centre's performance.  The Commission on Presidential Debates went back to John, asking Centre  to host another Vice Presidential debate. Once again, the Centre  community planned and executed an extraordinary event with the eyes of  the country on them.   Last year, John led Centre in the celebration of its bicentennial  anniversary with a full year of events. While the school honored its  distinguished history, John seemed to consider his own place in it. He  announced his retirement from Centre, making him one of the three  longest serving presidents in the school's history.   Perhaps John's greatest legacy at Centre will be his fierce devotion  to students. Every single graduate was invited into his home at least  twice during their undergraduate years. With his beloved wife Susie,  who is an institution herself, John brought compassionate leadership to  all aspects of his work. His colleagues called John the institution's  ``beating heart.'' As he leaves campus at the end of this month, 1 day  before his 70th birthday, he should take pride in a job very well done.   I am sure Centre College planned several opportunities for its  students, faculty, staff, alumni, and friends to express their sincere  appreciation to John. Unfortunately, the coronavirus pandemic changed  many of those plans. But there is nothing that can change our heartfelt  gratitude to John and Susie for all they have done for Centre College  and the Commonwealth of Kentucky. As they embark on their next  adventure together, we wish them the very best.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have 7 requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate.
