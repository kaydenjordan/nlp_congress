 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of two fallen  heroes back home in Florida: Gilchrist County Sergeant Noel Ramirez and  Deputy Taylor Lindsey. These two officers were tragically murdered in  the line of duty during an ambush shooting on April 19.   Mr. Speaker, these two young men were selfless heroes, patriots, and  everything we aspire to be as people, as a Nation, and as Americans.   Sergeant Ramirez had been in law enforcement for 7 years and leaves  behind two young children and a wife. He had, as Sheriff Bobby Schultz  described it, an infectious smile. Deputy Lindsey joined the Gilchrist  County Sheriff's Office in 2013, and dedicated his time and efforts  towards getting illegal drugs off our streets.   Please join me and the Florida delegation in honoring Gilchrist  County Sergeant Noel Ramirez and Deputy Taylor Lindsey and all of our  fallen heroes who have made the ultimate sacrifice to ensure our  safety.   At this time, Mr. Speaker, I ask that the House hold a moment of  silence.                            ____________________
