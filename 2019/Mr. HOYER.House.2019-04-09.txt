 Mr. Speaker, yesterday was the last day of the session of  the General Assembly in Maryland.   Sadly, the day before, on Sunday, the longest serving speaker of the  house of delegates--as we call our house of representatives--died on  Sunday, and I rise to pay tribute to him.   He was a great American, a great public servant, and a very dear  friend.   Maryland lost a champion. Michael Busch, Speaker of the Maryland  House of Delegates, passed away after a long and distinguished career  serving the people of our State.   He was young; he was 72 years of age, and the longest serving  speaker, as I said, in the history of the house of delegates.   He had served as speaker of the house since 2003, having first been  elected to represent Anne Arundel County in the house of delegates in  1986.   His title was Mr. Speaker; many, however, knew him as ``Coach,'' a  reminder of his days as a teacher and athletics coach at St. Mary's  High School in Annapolis.   It was at St. Mary's High School that Michael Busch first made a name  for himself as a very excellent football player. He later played at  Temple University, and for 40 years, he worked with the Anne Arundel  County, Department of Parks and Recreation with young people, teaching  them, mentoring them, giving them values.   Many who served with him in the legislature called him ``Coach,'' not  just because of his history, but because Speaker Busch was like a coach  and a mentor to so many of those who served in the house of delegates.   He was a man of deep intellect, poise, steadiness under pressure, and  a wellspring of compassion.   He led efforts to expand access to quality, affordable healthcare for  Marylanders. He helped lead efforts to make Maryland one of the first  States to adopt marriage equality by legislative action, an action that  was later confirmed by the voters of our State.   He led the State in its effort to abolish the death penalty, and he  oversaw the enactment of Maryland's $15 minimum wage. And he worked  hard to ensure a cleaner Chesapeake Bay and its watershed for future  generations while increasing investments in renewable energy.   Earlier this week, the General Assembly overrode the Governor's veto  to enact Speaker Busch's bill to protect five oyster sanctuaries in the  Bay.   Michael Busch's positive impact on Maryland will be felt for,  literally, decades to come.   He was a good and decent person who sought to elevate our politics  during an age when too many, unlike him, had brought our politics low.   I hope my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, would join me in expressing our  condolences to his wife, Cindy, their daughters, Erin and Megan, and to  the entire Busch family and to the people of Maryland he served so  faithfully for so many years.   I hope all of us in this House will find inspiration in Speaker  Busch's life and legacy as we strive to do right by those we serve, as  he did for so many years, and to do so together in a way that is  bipartisan, as was his inclination and performance; and be reflective  of the way he lived his life and approached the work of governing.   In an age where, as I said, politics has been brought low by  divisiveness, and in some respects, hatefulness and attacks on one  another, Michael Busch was somebody who treated others with respect,  with consideration, and with fairness.   Michael Busch served Maryland well. He served our people well. He  will be missed.                            ____________________
