 Madam President, I want to start with what I know is  on everybody's mind, and that is Kentucky basketball.   The University of Kentucky Wildcats men's team won their 31st SEC  title--their fourth straight, by the way. Hall of Fame coach John  Calipari is leading Big Blue Nation back to the NCAA tournament and, we  hope, to the school's ninth national championship.   At Western Kentucky University, the Lady Toppers just brought home a  second straight Conference USA title. They are hoping the hardware  keeps on coming as they head to their school's 20th showing in the NCAA  tournament.   I proudly join many Kentuckians in congratulating both UK and WKU. We  will be rooting for them in the Big Dance.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, later this  afternoon the Senate will vote to advance the financial reform bill  that is before us.   Senator Crapo's legislation starts from a simple premise: Small  community lenders on Main Street are not the same as the multi- trillion-dollar banks on Wall Street. But since the Dodd-Frank Act  passed in 2010, too many regulations have treated all of them the same  and imposed a crushing burden on community banks that are not able to  bear it.   A small number of our colleagues in the Senate seem dead set against  any commonsense reforms to help these smaller institutions. They are  dusting off old arguments and predicting apocalyptic consequences from  even this modest set of reforms. That is a shame because when small  lenders shut their doors, communities throughout America pay the price.  Even in this online era, research tells us that the closure of physical  banks makes it harder for farmers, ranchers, small business owners, and  low-income families to access capital. This story has played out  thousands of times across the country.   The legislation before us would restore a community lenders' ability  to  [[Page S1618]]  provide credit without having to navigate a maze of regulation that was  designed for far bigger organizations.   This commonsense bill has earned the support of a wide bipartisan  coalition. I would urge all Members to join us in moving it forward  this afternoon.                            ____________________     Madam President, now on one final matter, for more  than 20 years, Hope House in Spokane, WA, has offered vulnerable women  refuge from the streets and a safe place to sleep. Unfortunately, the  need is great. Even after stacking bunk beds in every available inch,  the shelter reaches capacity every single night. Last year, more than  2,000 women had to be turned away.   But there is good news this morning. Premera Blue Cross, a major  health insurer in the Pacific Northwest, announced that it will make a  $1 million contribution to the organization that operates Hope House.  The gift will jump-start the nonprofit's plan to build a brand-new  shelter with 120 beds--triple the current capacity.   Across the State, in Everett, WA, another organization called Cocoon  House serves at-risk and homeless youth. They are also receiving a  donation of $1.6 million to finish funding a brand-new youth center.   What has made all of this possible? Well, that would be tax reform.  Premera's president and CEO explained that America's new 21st century  Tax Code is allowing his company to devote major new resources to help  investment and philanthropy.   The women of Hope House and the children of Cocoon House are not  alone. There are stories like this all over our country. Just how many  Americans' lives will be changed for the better by tax reform when all  is said and done?   There are the big donations to countless nonprofits such as these  serving homeless women and children, higher take-home pay for American  families to help them make ends meet, more investment and more job  opportunities over the long term now that our Tax Code gives our job  creators a fairer fight with overseas competitors, and, of course,  special bonuses, raises, and new benefits for 4 million American  workers and counting.   We can add Premera workers to that list, by the way. They are getting  $15,000 bonuses as well. Every single Democrat voted to block these  good things--every single one of these guys over here. They did all  they could to stop tax reform from happening. Now that the law they  opposed is unleashing so much good news, they are in a tricky spot.   My colleagues across the aisle are falling back on the same old  rhetoric. They are trying to divide Americans, pitting different groups  against one another. Now they are even proposing to claw back tax  reform. Well, with a Republican Congress, that is not going to happen.  Democrats may want to repeal tax reform; that is, repeal the bonuses,  the raises, the family tax cuts, and the huge donations to life- changing organizations. They may want to repeal all of that, but  Republicans set out to take money out of Washington's pocket and put it  back in the pockets of the American people, who know best how to use  it. We will make sure that is exactly where it stays.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Secretary of the Senate request the return of the papers with respect  to H.R. 1207.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  March 13; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed. I further ask that following  leader remarks, the Senate resume consideration of S. 2155. Finally, I  ask that the Senate recess from 12:30 p.m. until 2:15 p.m. and that all  time during recess, adjournment, morning business, and leader remarks  count postcloture on amendment No. 2151, as modified.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:49 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, March 13, 2018, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
