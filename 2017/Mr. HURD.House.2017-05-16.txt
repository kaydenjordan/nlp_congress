 Mr. Speaker, the veteran unemployment rate is currently 5  percent in Texas, higher than the national average of 3.7. While the  national average has steadily declined in recent years, the  unemployment rate for young veterans ages 18 to 24 has skyrocketed to  13 percent, more than double the rate it was at this time last year.   We need to do more for the men and women who have sacrificed so much  for our freedom and our safety. That is why I introduced the American  Law  [[Page H4211]]  Enforcement Heroes Act: to provide an outlet for these heroes to  continue their service right here at home.   My district is home to more than 4,600 Active Duty and 45,000  military veterans who have served or supported Joint Base San Antonio,  Laughlin Air Force Base, and Fort Bliss, among others. They often tell  me about their struggles to find good jobs once they leave the  military.   This bill incentivizes State and local governments to hire veterans  as new law enforcement officers by giving preference when applying for  grants through DOJ's COPS Office which fund academy and field training  along with promoting community collaboration. It is modeled after an  expired program called Troops to COPS, which helped about 1,000  veterans in the late 1990s.   We owe our freedom to these men and women and must do a better job  facilitating their transition into meaningful civilian careers.  Ultimately, we should be doing everything we can to help those who have  served our Nation in one uniform continue to do so in another one right  here at home.   In commemoration of both National Police Week and Military  Appreciation Month, this bill will better serve our veterans and be a  win for communities nationwide.   I want to thank Senator John Cornyn, my colleague from Texas, for his  leadership on this issue, and I ask my colleagues to join me in support  of H.R. 1428.
