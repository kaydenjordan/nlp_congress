 Madam Speaker, for generations, Americans  and Canadians have owned homes on either side of the border, making  many of our citizens neighbors in every sense of the word.   The pandemic has hurt the connections between our two countries,  often making it difficult for citizens to visit their properties.   Recently, the Canadian Government proposed a 1 percent tax on  residential real estate owned by non-Canadians. We believe this tax is  not just an unfair fine on good neighbors but a violation of the United  States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and international tax law.   We are working with the Biden administration to advocate on behalf of  Americans and urge Canada to reject this proposal. Its adoption could  lead to a race to the bottom for both of our countries.                            ____________________
