 Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise in favor of S. 1532, the No Human  Trafficking on Our Roads Act. This bipartisan, bicameral bill  strengthens our Nation's efforts to combat human trafficking.   As a former organized crime prosecutor for two decades both on the  Northern border and on the Southern border, I have seen firsthand the  horrors of human trafficking. Too often, human traffickers take  advantage of our Nation's transportation network to transport their  victims from one location to the next.   The U.S. Department of Transportation and the transportation industry  play a critical role in preventing and stopping these heinous  exploitations. I want to commend the trucking industry for their  commitment in training drivers to identify instances of human  trafficking through organizations like Truckers Against Trafficking.   Truck drivers are often a critical asset in helping law enforcement  identify victims who otherwise might go unseen. However, an isolated  few individuals have taken advantage of their position to illegally  traffic innocent people. We must stop this from occurring.   Earlier this year, alongside my good friend, Congresswoman Esty, I  introduced H.R. 3814, the identical House companion to this bill. While  the vast majority of our Nation's truck drivers are hardworking, honest  men and women, our bill is necessary to ensure that the select few who  commit these crimes are brought to justice.   I am grateful for the chairman's support in moving our bill through  the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and bringing this  important issue before the floor of the House. I would also like to  thank outside organizations, like the National District Attorneys  Association, for supporting this legislation.   Again, I would like to thank Representative Esty and Senators Thune  and Klobuchar for their bipartisan, bicameral leadership in this  matter.
