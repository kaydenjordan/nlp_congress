 Madam President, I thank my colleague and friend, the  Senator from New Jersey, for his powerful remarks, and I rise today and  celebrate a bipartisan achievement--an achievement of the Senate; an  achievement for truth; an achievement for speaking the truth to  darkness, for speaking the truth to evil, for speaking the truth to  murder, for speaking the truth to genocide.   This journey has been a long journey. Senator Menendez has been  fighting this fight a long time. I have been proud to stand by his  side. This is the third week in a row we have come to the Senate floor  seeking to pass this resolution. I am grateful that today we have  succeeded.   The Menendez-Cruz resolution affirms U.S. recognition of the Armenian  genocide. It has been far too long in coming. From 1915 to 1923, the  Ottoman Empire carried out a forced deportation of nearly 2 million  Armenians, of whom 1.5 million were killed. It was an atrocious  genocide. That it happened is a fact and undeniable reality.   In fact, the very word ``genocide'' literally means the killing of an  entire people, and it was coined by Raphael Lemkin to describe the  horrific nature of the Ottoman Empire's calculated extermination of the  Armenians. It is why we have the horrid word ``genocide'' in our  English language.   Over 100 years ago, the world remained silent as the Armenian people  [[Page S7011]]  suffered and were murdered. Even today, many people are unaware of what  happened. But we must never be silent in response to atrocity. We have  a responsibility to stand up and speak the truth. With this resolution,  the United States is now saying it is the policy of the United States  of America to commemorate the Armenian genocide through official  recognition and remembrance.   We have a moral duty to acknowledge what happened to the 1.5 million  innocent souls who were murdered. It is the right thing to do. I am  grateful that, today, we have seen every Republican and every Democrat  come together in support of the bipartisan Menendez-Cruz resolution.  This is a moment of truth that was far too long coming.                      National Defense Authorization Act     Madam President, I rise today to celebrate yet another  major bipartisan victory that is included as part of the National  Defense Authorization Act that the House has passed and the Senate is  preparing to pass.   As it so happens, today is the 1-year anniversary--1 year to the very  day that the European Parliament voted overwhelmingly to condemn the  construction of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline between Russia and Germany.  By a vote of 433 to 105, the Members of the European Parliament called  for the project to be cancelled because ``It is a political project  that poses a threat to European energy security and the efforts to  diversify energy supply.''   In the coming days, the U.S. Congress will answer the call to stop  this profoundly dangerous project. The House has acted, and the Senate  will act very soon.   As part of the National Defense Authorization Act, sanctions on the  Nord Stream 2 pipeline are included. The Cruz-Shaheen legislation-- legislation I introduced, bipartisan legislation--Senator Shaheen and I  and the Foreign Relations Committee brought our legislation to a vote.  We won an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote--a vote of 20 to 2--out of the  Foreign Relations Committee.   In the past weeks and months, there have been extended negotiations  to include this legislation, these sanctions, in the National Defense  Authorization Act. We have negotiated with Republicans and Democrats-- Republicans and Democrats on the Senate Armed Forces, on the Foreign  Relations Committee, on the Banking Committee, in leadership, and also  Republicans and Democrats on the House Armed Services Committee,  Foreign Relations Committee, Banking Committee, and leadership--and we  have achieved a remarkable consensus.   Part of the reason we were able to achieve this bipartisan victory is  that the sanctions are narrowly targeted, precisely targeted. The Nord  Stream 2 pipeline is a pipeline from Russia to Germany to carry natural  gas that, if completed, would generate billions of dollars for Putin  and billions of dollars that would fund Russian military aggression.   Not only that, if completed, this pipeline would make Europe even  more dependent on Russian energy and even more vulnerable to Russian  blackmail. Putin has demonstrated that he is more than willing to cut  off the gas in the dead of winter as economic blackmail against his  neighbors.   This pipeline is being built this very moment. It is near completion.  The legislation we are passing is designed to operate like a scalpel,  specifically directed to the ships that lay in the deep sea pipeline  needed to complete Nord Stream 2.   There are only five companies on the face of the Earth with the  technological capability to delay the deep sea pipeline. Russia does  not have one of those companies.   The Russian Government lacks the expertise to lay this pipeline. As a  result, Russia has contracted with the Swiss company, Allseas. Right  now, as we speak, Allseas has a ship called the Pioneering Spirit that  is laying this pipeline.   The legislation that has passed the House and that is about to pass  the Senate imposes crippling sanctions on any company laying this  pipeline. It is designed to operate like a scalpel so it doesn't impact  anyone else, but if this legislation operates as Congress intends, as  both Republicans and Democrats in the Senate and House intend, then it  will halt construction of this pipeline overnight.   The best estimates we have are that, if uninterrupted, the Nord  Stream 2 pipeline would be completed by the end of January. That means  the window to stop the pipeline is vanishingly small.   When the Senate passes the National Defense Authorization Act, which  will be any day now, and the President signs it, which will be shortly  thereafter, two things need to happen immediately.   No. 1, the Treasury Department and the administration need to  immediately begin working on implementing these sanctions. I am  confident the administration will follow the directives of President  Trump. He has said that Nord Stream 2 is harmful to the national  security interests of the United States of America, and it is harmful  to Europe.   No. 2, there will be a decision made by the CEO and corporate  leadership of Allseas. The instant this bill is signed into law--and we  are only days away from that--if Allseas continues with construction of  the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, even for a single day after this law is  signed, then Allseas risks crippling sanctions that could devastate the  company.   The purpose of this legislation is not to see those sanctions  implemented on Allseas; the purpose of this legislation is to stop  construction. The only responsible and rational decision for the  corporate leadership of Allseas to make is to stop construction.   My understanding is their contract with the Russians has an explicit  escape path in case sanctions were passed. So the day this is signed,  Allseas shareholders are at profound risk if Allseas corporate  leadership does anything other than cease construction and stop the  pipeline.   If and when that happens, that will be an incredible victory. It will  be an incredible victory for Europe, an incredible victory for Ukraine,  an incredible victory for energy security, and an incredible victory  for jobs in the United States of America.   It is far better for Europe to be relying on energy from the United  States than to be fueling Putin and Russia and dependent on Russia and  subject to economic blackmail. That is why, as I noted, the European  Parliament voted by a vote of 433 to 105 to condemn Nord Stream 2.   Passing these Nord Stream 2 sanctions are an incredible victory for  the United States and national security, but it is also an incredible  loss for Vladimir Putin and Russia.   I commend my Democratic cosponsor Senator Shaheen. I commend the  cosponsors that this legislation has had, both Republicans and  Democrats in a bipartisan way, and I commend the U.S. Senate and the  U.S. House for coming together. At a time when so many other issues  divide us, we have united in defense of America, in defense of Europe,  and in opposition to Russia's military aggression. Passing Nord Stream  2 sanctions is a big, big deal, and I commend the U.S. Congress for  acting swiftly in the rapidly closing window we have to stop this  project.   I yield the floor.
