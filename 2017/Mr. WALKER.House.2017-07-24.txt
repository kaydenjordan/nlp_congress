 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to be here  today. Thank you for your leadership on this, Congressman Davis.   Currently, the United States Capitol Police are not allowed to  transfer donations from the USCP Memorial Fund to officers injured in  the line of duty but only to families of deceased officers. The great  thing about this legislation is that it would allow the U.S. Capitol  Police to transfer those donations to injured officers as well as  families of deceased officers to help defray and cover some of the  medical costs.   As a former pastor, I can tell you that one of the biggest stressors  on families is when there has been an illness or injury to these  families that causes additional financial strain. This is common sense.  It is certainly bipartisan, across-the-aisle of doing the right thing.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support this legislation. Again, I thank  Representative Davis for his leadership, as well as Representative  Brady, and I am proud to support this piece of legislation.
