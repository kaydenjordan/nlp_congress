 Mr. Speaker, the so-called rules package  proposed by House Republicans would perpetuate same disorder, division,  and dysfunction that nearly devoured the Republican nominee for  Speaker.   A single-Member threshold for filing a motion to vacate empowers  extremism and rewards rabble-rousing. It would make the House so  dysfunctional as to be ungovernable.   It would give the new Speaker only a Pyrrhic victory because a motion  to vacate makes him arbitrarily removable at any moment, at the whim of  any person, no matter how personal or petty the underlying grievance.   Simply put, this is no way to govern.   Moreover, House Republicans decry the weaponization of the Federal  Government. Yet the Holman rule would enable the Federal Government to  be weaponized against any Federal official who draws the wrath of the  Republican majority.   The Holman rule would enable House Republicans to zero out funding  for a criminal investigation into Donald Trump.   The new rules would defund the Office of Congressional Ethics.   The new rules would enable a Member being investigated by the FBI to  investigate the investigators investigating him.   Mr. Speaker, so much for draining the swamp.
