 Madam Speaker, after visiting the Mariposa Grove of  giant sequoias, Teddy Roosevelt famously declared: ``A grove of giant  redwood or sequoias should be kept just as we keep a great and  beautiful cathedral.''   Madam Speaker, today that cathedral is on fire. The very grove in  which President Roosevelt stood is enveloped in flames as we speak,  threatening to destroy these iconic trees forever.   We are seeing the horrific consequences of decades of forest  mismanagement play out in Yosemite, and it is time to act to save our  sequoias.   Wildfires burn so hot and so intensely that they quite literally  explode giant sequoias and create ``fire-nados,'' sending branches and  bark hurling so far into the air that they have narrowly missed taking  out our firefighting planes. If giant sequoias can't withstand these  raging infernos, no tree stands a chance.   Time is not on our side, Madam Speaker. I urge immediate action on  the Save Our Sequoias Act to give land managers in California the  resources they so desperately need, preventing firefighters from having  to resort to desperate measures to save these national treasures. This  is the only way we can conserve America's most beautiful cathedral for  generations to come.                            ____________________
