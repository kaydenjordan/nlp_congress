 Madam Chair, I rise today to speak out against H.R. 7,  legislation that places unprecedented restrictions and liability on job  creators that will harm the very women it claims to protect.   As a small business owner with over 40 years of experience creating  jobs, I know just how hard it can be for employers to find skilled and  qualified workers.   With 7.6 million available jobs throughout our Nation, the last thing  we need to do is overregulate our businesses, especially when Federal  law already makes it illegal to pay different wages to women for equal  work.   H.R. 7 dramatically increases liability for employers, eliminates a  business owner's ability to contest gender-based pay discrimination  cases, expands damages, and encourages frivolous lawsuits.   Furthermore, this partisan bill offers no new protections against pay  discrimination in the workplace. Rather, H.R. 7 directly benefits trial  lawyers at the expense of working women. Taken as a whole, this bill  will very likely limit or obstruct an employer's efforts to recruit,  hire, promote workers, and to increase their pay--once again, empty  partisan promises from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle.                                time  1430    However, after passing historic tax reform under the Republican-led  Congress and eliminating burdensome red tape under the leadership of  President Trump, our businesses are continuing to empower women across  this country at unprecedented levels.   We have more women working in the U.S. than ever before, nearly 75  million. Women filled nearly 60 percent of the 2.8 million jobs created  in the last year. One in five employer businesses nationwide is owned  by women, including by my wife of 45 years, Robin.   I need to keep this momentum going, not obstruct employers' efforts  to recruit, hire, and promote workers.  [[Page H2854]]    Madam Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote today on H.R. 7.
