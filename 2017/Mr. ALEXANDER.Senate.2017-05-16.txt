 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, last year seems like a long time ago,  but just 5 months ago, 94 Members of this body voted for a bill called  the 21st Century Cures Act. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  called it the most important legislation of the year. The Presiding  Officer, the Senator from Ohio, had a major role in that legislation,  especially the part having to do with opioids. This was legislation to  spur research and development of cures, devices, and treatments for  some of the most deadly and some of the most stubborn illnesses and  diseases.   Dr. Frances Collins, head of the National Institutes of Health--which  he calls the ``National Institutes of Hope''--last year offered what he  called bold predictions about major advances that we could expect over  the next decade with a sustained commitment to medical research. One  prediction of Dr. Collins is that science will find ways to identify  Alzheimer's before symptoms appear, as well as how to slow down or even  prevent the disease. Another is that doctors could use the patient's  own stem cells to rebuild his or her heart. An artificial pancreas will  help diabetes patients by tracking blood glucose levels and by creating  precise doses of insulin. He also predicts a Zika vaccine, a universal  flu vaccine, and an HIV/AIDS vaccine in the next 10 years. To relieve  suffering and deal with the epidemic of opioid addiction, Dr. Collins  predicts new, nonaddictive pain treatments to manage pain.   The 21st Centuries Cures Act became a law last year and authorized  4.8 billion new dollars for medical research, on top of the support  Congress already provides through the annual appropriations process.  Because of bipartisan support, that was an extra $2 billion last year  and an extra $2 billion this year. The way we add up money around here,  over 10 years, that is $20 billion over 10 years last year and another  $20 billion this year, which includes the $4.8 billion authorized in  the 21st Century Cures legislation, all for medical research.   The next step in our efforts to turn Dr. Collins' predictions into a  reality and to help America's patients benefit from all the research we  are helping support is to fund the Food and Drug Administration. The  FDA, as we call it, is the agency responsible for making good on the  promise of the 21st Centuries Cures Act to actually reach America's  patients.   Before September 30 of this year, four different FDA user fee  agreements need to be reauthorized. They need to be acted on by the  Senate, by the House, and sent to the President of the United States.  These user fees are paid by manufacturers of drugs and medical devices  and account for $8 billion to $9 billion over 5 years and over a  quarter of all FDA funding.   Last week, 21 of the 23 members of the Senate HELP Committee voted to  send to the Senate floor a bill reauthorizing those four user fee  agreements based on recommendations from industry and from the FDA  after a thorough and lengthy public process.   The FDA Reauthorization Act, sponsored by me and by Senator Murray,  the distinguished Senator from Washington who is the ranking Democrat  on our Senate HELP Committee, reauthorizes the four user fee agreements  that expire at the end of September. The four agreements are, No. 1,  the prescription drug user fee, which accounted for 70 percent of the  brand drug review budget last year; No. 2, medical device user fee  amendments, which accounted for 36 percent of the medical device review  budget in fiscal  [[Page S2954]]  year 2016; the generic drug user fee amendments, which accounted for  over 75 percent of the generic drug review budget in fiscal year 2016;  and the biosimilar user fee amendments, which accounted for 29 percent  of the biosimilar review budget in fiscal year 2016.   So here is my message to colleagues: The U.S. Senate has the  opportunity to provide Americans with a prompt, bipartisan  reauthorization of the Food and Drug Administration user fee agreements  and, in doing so, take the next crucial step in helping Americans see  the benefits of the results of our 21st Century Cures Act passed last  year. If we do not move quickly to pass these agreements in late July,  the FDA will be forced to send layoff notices to more than 5,000 FDA  employees to notify them that they may lose their job in 60 days.    As I said, these reauthorizations are based on recommendations both  from industry and from the Food and Drug Administration after a  thorough public process. The FDA posted meeting minutes after every  negotiation and held public meetings before discussions began and to  hear feedback on the draft recommendations last fall.   Patients were also involved in developing commitment letters. We have  received support from patient groups asking us to authorize the  agreements expeditiously.   In Congress, over the last 15 months, the Senate HELP Committee, of  which I am chairman and Senator Murray is the ranking Democrat, had 15  bipartisan briefings, some of which were with the Energy and Commerce  Committee of the House of Representatives, and heard, as well, from the  FDA and industry about the reauthorization.   Our HELP Committee held two bipartisan hearings earlier this year on  the Food and Drug Administration medical device and drug user fees and  released a discussion draft of our legislation on April 14, which  provided 2 weeks for public comment.   I go into all this because I want everyone to see how thoroughly this  has been discussed and how important it is.   The committee then worked in a bipartisan way to incorporate comments  from the public and from members of the committee.   The manager's amendment--which we approved in the committee last  week, as I said, by a vote of 21 to 2--includes many priorities that  are broadly bipartisan. Here are a few examples: legislation from  Senators Isakson and Bennet to improve the medical device inspection  process; a provision from Senator Hassan, Democrat, and Senator Young,  Republican, to improve communication about abuse-deterrent opioid  products; from Senators Franken, Democrat, and Senator Enzi,  Republican, a provision to encourage medical device development for  children and make sure FDA has the appropriate expertise to review  devices for children; from Senator Baldwin, a provision to make sure  the full experience of clinical trial participants is studied; from  Senator Burr and Senator Young, additional reporting to make sure that  the FDA is meeting their goals and that we can do proper oversight of  the new agreements. It includes legislation by Senators Casey, Franken,  and Warren on a pilot project on studying medical devices after  approval to make sure they work as intended. A provision from Senator  Cassidy requiring additional guidance for complex generics, like  EpiPens, so manufacturers know what they have to do to make a generic  version, was also included. A provision to make new hearing aid  technology available came from Senators Warren and Isakson, as well as  a provision from Senators Roberts, Donnelly, and Burr to allow more  appropriate classification of accessories used with medical devices.   In the committee markup last week, we unanimously adopted these  bipartisan amendments, which follow: an amendment from Senator Collins,  which reflected legislation from Senators Collins, Franken, McCaskill,  and Cotton on improving generic drug development and helping to lower  prescription drug costs; an amendment from Senators Hatch, Burr, and  Casey to improve patient access to clinical trials.   A delay in reauthorizing these agreements would delay the review of  drugs and devices submitted after last April 1--more than a month ago.  If we don't pass these reauthorizations into law on time, which means  by the end of July, an FDA reviewer who gets started reviewing a cancer  drug submitted to the agency in April would be laid off on October 1,  before the reviewer is able to finish his or her work. In addition to  harming patients and harming families who rely on medical innovation, a  delay in the reauthorization would threaten America's global leadership  in biomedical innovation.   After reviewing the recommendations from industry and from the FDA, I  am convinced these are good agreements for patients. The sooner we pass  this legislation, the better, to give certainty to patients, doctors,  FDA reviewers, and companies.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The MSC       shall, however, consider the laws of the Signatories in       devising its employment and discharge policies, and when it       deems it practical, devise policies consistent with the laws       of the Signatories.        ``29.

Financing        ``40. The Commission's operations shall be funded,       independently of WMATA, by the Signatory jurisdictions and,       when available, by Federal funds. The Commission shall have       no authority to levy taxes.        ``41. The Signatories shall unanimously agree on adequate       funding levels for the Commission and make equal       contributions of such funding, subject to annual       appropriation, to cover the portion of Commission operations       not funded by Federal funds.        ``42. The Commission may borrow up to 5 percent of its last       annual appropriations budget in anticipation of receipts, or       as otherwise set forth in the appropriations budget approved       by all of the Signatories, from any lawful lending       institution for any purpose of this MSC Compact, including,       without limitation, for administrative expenses. Such loans       shall be for a term not to exceed 2 years, or at such longer       term approved by each Signatory pursuant to its laws as       evidenced by the written authorization by the Mayor of the       District of Columbia and the Governors of Maryland and       Virginia, and at such rates of interest as shall be       acceptable to the Commission.        ``43. With respect to the District of Columbia, the       commitment or obligation to render financial assistance to       the Commission shall be created, by appropriation or in such       other manner, or by such other legislation, as the District       of Columbia shall determine; provided, that any such       commitment or obligation shall be approved by Congress       pursuant to the District of Columbia Home Rule Act (Public       Law 93-198; 87 Stat. 774).        ``44.

Official Code (collectively referred to in this section as       the `Anti-Deficiency Acts'), the District of Columbia cannot       obligate itself to any financial commitment in any present or       future year unless the necessary funds to pay that commitment       have been appropriated and are lawfully available for the       purpose committed. Thus, pursuant to the Anti-Deficiency       Acts, nothing in the MSC Compact creates an obligation of the       District of Columbia in anticipation of an appropriation for       such purpose, and the District of Columbia's legal liability       for the payment of any amount under this MSC Compact does not       and may not arise or obtain in advance of the lawful       availability of appropriated funds for the applicable fiscal       year.        ``E. Tax Exemption        ``45. The exercise of the powers granted by this MSC       Compact shall in all respects be for the benefit of the       people of the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of       Virginia, and the State of Maryland and for the increase of       their safety, commerce, and prosperity, and as the activities       associated with this MSC Compact shall constitute the       performance of essential governmental functions, the       Commission shall not be required to pay any taxes or       assessments upon the services or any property acquired or       used by the Commission under the provisions of this MSC       Compact or upon the income therefrom, and shall at all times       be free from taxation within the District of Columbia, the       Commonwealth of Virginia, and the State of Maryland.        ``F. Reconsideration of Commission Orders        ``46. WMATA shall have the right to petition the Commission       for reconsideration of an order based on rules and procedures       developed by the Commission.        ``47. Consistent with section 16, the filing of a petition       for reconsideration shall not act as a stay upon the       execution of a Commission order, or any part of it, unless       the Commission orders otherwise. WMATA may appeal any adverse       action on a petition for reconsideration as set forth in       section 48.        ``G. Judicial Matters        ``48. The United States District Court for the Eastern       District of Virginia, Alexandria Division, the United States       District Court for the District of Maryland, Southern       Division, and the United States District Court for the       District of Columbia shall have exclusive and original       jurisdiction of all actions brought by or against the       Commission and to enforce subpoenas under this MSC Compact.        ``49. The commencement of a judicial proceeding shall not       operate as a stay of a Commission order unless specifically       ordered by the court.        ``H.

Nothing in this section shall be construed to       protect such person from suit or liability for damage, loss,       injury, or liability caused by the intentional or willful and       wanton misconduct of such person.        ``51. The Commission shall be liable for its contracts and       for its torts and those of its Members, Alternate Members,       officers, agents, employees, and representatives committed in       the conduct of any proprietary function, in accordance with       the law of the applicable Signatory (including, without       limitation, rules on conflict of laws) but shall not be       liable for any torts occurring in the performance of a       governmental function. The exclusive remedy for such breach       of contract or tort for which the Commission shall be liable,       as herein provided, shall be by suit against the Commission.       Nothing contained in this MSC Compact shall be construed as a       waiver by the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of       Virginia, or the State of Maryland of any immunity from suit.        ``I. Commitment of Parties        ``52. Each of the Signatories pledges to each other       faithful cooperation in providing safety oversight for the       WMATA Rail System, and, to affect such purposes, agrees to       consider in good faith and request any necessary legislation       to achieve the objectives of this MSC Compact.        ``J. Amendments and Supplements        ``53. Amendments and supplements to this MSC Compact shall       be adopted by legislative action of each of the Signatories       and the consent of Congress. When one Signatory adopts an       amendment or supplement to an existing section of this MSC       Compact, that amendment or supplement shall not be       immediately effective, and the previously enacted provision       or provisions shall remain in effect in each jurisdiction       until the amendment or supplement is approved by the other       Signatories and is consented to by Congress.        ``K. Withdrawal and Termination        ``54. Any Signatory may withdraw from this MSC Compact,       which action shall constitute a termination of this MSC       Compact.        ``55. Withdrawal from this MSC Compact shall be by a       Signatory's repeal of this MSC Compact from its laws, but       such repeal shall not take effect until 2 years after the       effective date of the repealed statute and written notice of       the withdrawal being given by the withdrawing Signatory to       the governors or mayor, as appropriate, of the other       Signatories.        ``56.
