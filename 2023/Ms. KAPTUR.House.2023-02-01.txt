 Mr. Speaker, Social Security coverage is an earned  benefit. In January, Social Security beneficiaries began to see an 8.7  percent cost-of-living increase, the largest since 1981. This COLA  covers retirees as well as workers who become disabled and surviving  children under age 18 whose working parents died.   For nearly a century, America has honored the sacred insurance  promise intergenerationally. Those who work throughout their lives will  benefit from the fruits of their labor.   Yes, this historic cost-of-living adjustment will help Americans  manage their cost of living to pay bills and put food on the table. In  addition, millions of Medicare users will now only pay $35 per month  for insulin. This cost savings will benefit hundreds of thousands of  Ohioans.   The Social Security COLA along with affordable insulin are being  championed by congressional Democrats. We know the foundation of  financial stability for over 66 million retired Americans is their  earned social insurance benefits. Respecting their lives and their  work, Democrats will always honor Social Security and vote to protect  it and to strengthen Medicare.                        Fund New Great Lakes Authority     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to also call upon President  Biden to fund the new Great Lakes Authority in the administration's  fiscal year 2024 budget request.   With support from our Great Lakes colleagues, the Great Lakes  Authority was authorized in the fiscal year 2023 omnibus appropriations  bill and signed into law on January 2, 2023.   Across America, regional development instrumentalities like this have  existed for decades. Until now, the Great Lakes region was the one  major region left out of our Nation's toolkit for regional cooperation,  reinvestment, and revitalization.   Launched initially with Federal resources to drive economic and  environmental recovery, this authority now exists and aims to become  self-sufficient sooner rather than later. This new year brings new  opportunities for public-private partnerships across our Great Lakes  region for investment and revitalization.   The Great Lakes Authority will harness the region's strengths, which  include stewardship of the largest body of freshwater on the continent  and on  [[Page H585]]  Earth. Our region is home to America's industrial and agricultural  strength. We have hardworking men and women who manufacture the  majority of automobiles and trucks this Nation manufactures, as well  as, of course, farmers in our agricultural heartland who feed us all.  We have these massive production assets in this region.   Finally, the wealth of the region has allowed for an array of  educational and corporate institutions, as well, which now can be  mobilized together to reboot and repurpose the region's recovery from  massive job outsourcing and, frankly, outright neglect that has damaged  its potential for far too long.   Investing to strengthen the Great Lakes heartland will usher in a new  era for our communities. It is time to fund the Great Lakes Authority  to be the key economic development engine that becomes self-supporting  through public-private partnerships that make a lasting impact.   Onward Great Lakes Authority.   There is no time like the present to launch a stronger and more  hopeful future for every community across our precious region.                            ____________________
