 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5,  the Equality Act.   I chair the Education and Labor Committee's Civil Rights and Human  Services Subcommittee, and in our hearing on this important bill, we  heard powerful testimony from Kimberly, the mother of Kai, an 8-year- old transgender girl. Kimberly is an evangelical minister from rural  Texas. Her family and Kai's school were not supportive, and, in fact,  school administrators made derogatory comments about Kai.   Kimberly testified that, regretfully, she gave into pressure and  attempted home conversion therapy on Kai when Kai was only 4 years old.  One day she found Kai praying for Jesus to take her home to be with Him  forever.   Let me say that another way: A 4-year-old was suicidal.   Kimberly is now today a fierce advocate for her daughter's rights and  the rights of all transgender kids to go to school in a safe and  supportive environment. This bill will secure that right for all the  kids like Kai around the country and will secure the right to be free  from discrimination for millions of LGBTQ people in our country.   I want to close with the words from Federal Judge Michael McShane,  and his marriage equality opinion. He wrote: ``Many suggest we are  going down a slippery slope that will have no moral boundaries. To  those who truly harbor such fears, I can only say this: Let us look  less to the sky to see what might fall; rather, let us look to each  other and rise.''
