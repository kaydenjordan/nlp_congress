 Mr. Chairman, I would like to echo Mr. Newhouse's  comments et large.   The Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers are a critical aspect of  rural America's ability to fight fires and do good work in rural  America.   I want to applaud Secretary Perdue for reversing his decision. It is  one thing to be here in Washington, DC, and think you are counting the  taxpayers' money very carefully and doing the right thing; it is  another thing to be out in the real world and live the life that we  have out there in timber country and know what valuable lessons they  provide these at-risk youth who, frankly, would have no other options  going forward and, at this point, fight our devastating wildfires. They  are adjunct to the professional people that we have out there.   I thank Representatives Newhouse, DeFazio, Gianforte, and even  Senator Merkley on the Senate side. This is one area where you have  nice bipartisan, bicameral support, and it is an area where it is good  to see Congress come together and the executive branch understand the  realities of the world.   Mr. Chair, I really appreciate everyone's efforts. It has been fun to  work on that.                                time  1515
