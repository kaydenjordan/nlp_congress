 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life  of Mr. Michael Torpy, who passed away on June 10 at the age of 20.   Diagnosed with an aggressive form of bone cancer as a senior in high  school, Mr. Torpy refused to let the disease break his spirit. He spent  nearly 100 nights in the hospital receiving chemotherapy treatment, had  numerous surgeries, and even had a prosthetic right leg.   Yet Mr. Torpy went on to attend the University of Georgia, maintain  straight A's, and was named a Presidential Scholar.   He continued his favorite hobby of backpacking, kept up his wrestling  form with his old coach, and made an effort every day to make his  friends smile.   Although not a long life, Mr. Torpy's mother remembers that he lived  his  [[Page H5088]]  life to the fullest. This should be an inspiration for all of us to  both persevere through tribulations, while also celebrating the gift of  life.   Mr. Torpy's family and friends will be in my thoughts and prayers  during this most difficult time.                          Recognizing Cecil Boswell     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr.  Cecil Boswell, an American hero from Georgia who served our Nation  during World War II.   Originally from Gainesville, Georgia, Mr. Boswell deployed on the  beaches of Normandy during D-Day and fought in the Battle of the Bulge,  where he participated in wrestling Europe from Nazi control and also  contributed to a historical turning point in Western civilization.   Dodging close calls of his own, Mr. Boswell experienced, firsthand,  the bravery and sacrifice of his fellow American soldiers. Until he  passed away in 2017 at the age of 99, he was known for his abundant  patriotism, always flying an American flag in his yard, displaying his  war medals in his home, and marching every year in the annual  Gainesville Memorial Day Parade.   On this 75th anniversary of D-Day, I am proud of the rich military  heritage of Georgia that helped to secure victory for the Allied  Forces. I am especially proud of and thankful for Mr. Boswell for his  bravery and service to help defeat tyranny overseas and protect the  freedom of all of Western civilization.                          Recognizing Dene Sheheane     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr.  Dene Sheheane for his work in helping Georgia universities become  national leaders in access, affordability, completion rates, and  research output.   Mr. Sheheane began his work to better our State's education system  nearly 30 years ago when he worked with Governor Zell Miller, who was  known for spearheading the most important higher education legislation  in the State of Georgia, the HOPE Scholarship.   Since 2014, Mr. Sheheane has continued this effort, working with the  community relations department at Georgia Institute of Technology. In  this role he has secured Federal funding for financial aid, renewal of  the university's library, and projects within the Georgia Tech Research  Institute that promote economic development and research of key health  and environmental issues.   Because of his accomplishments thus far at Georgia Tech, he was  promoted to president of the Georgia Tech Alumni Association, and on  July 1 he will begin serving over 160,000 alumni worldwide.   I want to thank Mr. Sheheane for all he has done for the State of  Georgia and wish him good luck in all his endeavors to come.                            ____________________
