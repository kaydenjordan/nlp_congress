 Mr. President, one of Rhode Island's contributions to  the cultural life of our Nation came from two brothers who grew up in  Cumberland, RI, Bobby and Peter Farrelly. The Farrelly brothers did a  number of movies. One of them was famously called ``Dumb and Dumber.''   This is a good example of dumb and dumber. It was dumb when President  Obama opened the south Atlantic coast to the prospect of oil drilling.  When he did, the reaction was immediate and profound. From Norfolk, VA,  all the way down the red south Atlantic coast to St. Augustine, FL,  city after city, county after county, coastal community after coastal  community passed resolutions saying: Get that offshore drilling out of  here. We don't want it. It was a sweep of that Republican shoreline. It  was called the resolution revolution because so many resolutions were  passed saying: Get your oil drilling the heck away from our coasts.   Ultimately, the Obama administration got smart, and in the final  approval, there was no drilling in the Atlantic and no drilling in the  Pacific. They gave some reasons for their choice: strong local  opposition was one, conflicts with other ocean uses was another, market  dynamics was a third, and comments received from Governors was a  fourth.    So, in the wake of that, here comes the Trump administration, and  they have seriously gone from dumb to dumber, to go right back into  this fight, where it blew up in the Obama administration's face among  the red State communities of the Atlantic coast. Good luck finding  support for this up in New England.   In New England, our ocean economy was valued just a few years ago at  over $17 billion. It employs about a quarter of a million people. Who  thinks we are going to walk away from that? Who thinks we are not going  to defend that ocean economy against an idea as dumb as offshore  drilling in the Atlantic? We are not going to permit it.   I have authored, with my House colleague David Cicilline, legislation  that the whole New England Senate representation supports, to ban this  as a matter of Federal law; to stop this. The attorneys general of  States from Maine down to North Carolina, including Massachusetts,  Delaware, Rhode Island, of course, New Jersey, New York, Maryland, and  Virginia, all have spoken out against this and I expect will litigate  against it. Our Governor, Gina Raimondo, has come out strongly against  this incredibly dumb idea, and she has been joined by Republican  Governors in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maryland, and South Carolina  because this is such a dumb idea.   Why would this administration pursue such a dumb idea, that  Republican Governors oppose, that blew up in the face of the Obama  administration along the south Atlantic coast when they tried it, that  would infringe upon and damage critical coastal economies in States  that are Republican and Democratic? Why would they do such a stupid  thing?   Well, Attorney General Kilmartin of Rhode Island has one suggestion:  ``This decision by the administration is clearly driven by the oil and  gas industry.''   Huh. No kidding. This administration is bought and paid for by the  oil and gas industry. Throw in coal, and we have the complete lock,  stock, and barrel sale. We have complete industry toadies in the  responsible agencies of  [[Page S636]]  government and climate denial of the most flagrant and obtuse variety  coming out of the White House. I mean, it is nonsense land, except for  the fact that it keeps the oil and gas and coal money coming to prop up  the Trump administration and the Republican Party. We are not going to  stand for it. It is crooked. It will not go.   Chris Brown is the head of the Commercial Fishermen's Association of  Rhode Island. He is adamant that ``oil drilling is something that is  incredibly threatening and directly adverse to our well-being.''   We are going to stand and fight for our fishing communities.   Our environmental community is wildly against this: ``The last thing  our coast needs is oil drilling and all of the risks that go with it,''  says our lead environmental organization, Save the Bay.   I will close with the Providence Business Journal, the voice of the  Rhode Island business community, which just editorialized:         Fossil fuels, no matter where they are harvested, are       putting coastal areas across the globe in danger as sea       levels rise. In the name of national energy independence,       public policy would hasten the devastating impacts of burning       fossil fuels and make much of Rhode Island and other low-      lying areas uninhabitable.        At a time when renewable energy in the United States and       across the world is becoming less expensive, and the effects       of climate change are becoming more pronounced, pulling more       fossil fuels out of the ground is not a wise decision, and       one that hopefully will be rescinded before any drilling rigs       park themselves off Block Island.    That is the voice of Rhode Island's business community.   If you want to take a look at why this bothers us, take a look at the  footprint of the BP oilspill laid on the map of the New England coast.  There is Boston, there is Long Island, there is Narragansett Bay, and  that is Rhode Island. That is the footprint of the mess the oil  industry left when it blew up its facility in the middle of the gulf.  That is what they did, and we don't need that up in New England.   We have offshore industries that are vibrant, that support our  economy, that are welcome, that have long traditions and histories. We  do not need oil industry invaders coming where they are not wanted  because they have bought their way into the Trump administration with  their political contributions and their dark money. That will not  stand.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, a number of my colleagues will be  coming to the floor this afternoon to discuss the predicament we face  as the Mueller investigation--the special counsel investigation, the  Department of Justice--closes in on the Trump White House and the Trump  campaign, creating two problems. One is an unprecedented attack on the  law enforcement institutions that are involved in that investigation,  an effort to discredit our Federal Bureau of Investigation and our  Department of Justice, including the suggestion that this whole thing  is a witch hunt, even though every single witness, including Trump  appointees who have come before our committees, has been asked ``Hey,  this investigation, is it a witch hunt?'' and, to a person, has said  no.   Russian interference was real, they are coming back in 2018, and it  is no witch hunt to look into what took place.   You have this whole smear effort going on of individuals and  institutions involved in the institution. You could call that the crime  of commission, if you would. The crime of omission that accompanies  that is, while the majority in both Houses is busy trying to smear the  FBI, the Department of Justice, and various individuals in this  investigation, they are not taking the steps necessary to protect the  2018 elections. We have done virtually nothing.   The one thing we have done--led by Ranking Member Ben Cardin, the  Senator from Maryland--was to get really strong sanctions put through.  We all agreed on that. I think the vote was 98 to 2 in the Senate--98  to 2, powerful sanctions.   You messed in our elections. Pop. Here is one in the nose for you.  Don't do it again.   That was the lesson. We are going after you, Mr. Putin, where it  hurts, which is with all your dirty, corrupt oligarchs who support you  and whom you pay to stay in power. That is the shot we took back. You  messed in our elections; we are going after your crooked oligarchs.   Except guess where that effort stopped dead--in the Oval Office, at  the President's desk, where President Trump will not let the Russia  sanctions go forward. We have this whole smear campaign, discrediting  honorable American institutions just to protect the President from the  investigation. We have nothing being done legislatively to protect the  2018 elections, and you have the one thing we did do to send the  message to the Russians that we are tired of this nonsense and to give  them a little bit of a pop in the nose to get them to knock it off, a  little deterrent, and the President will not act on it.   I am going to be here for the duration of this and have more to say,  but I want to yield to the ranking member of the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee, who was so important in getting these sanctions  through and understands very well, from his work on the Magnitsky  issue, what these Russian oligarchs are up to.    Mr. President, indisputably, Vladimir Putin conducted  a broadly based attack on American democracy and its most important  institutions. Tragically, Putin's broadly based attack on American  democracy and our institutions is echoed by President Trump's attack on  American democracy and our most important institutions. And tragically  or pathetically--I don't know which to say--that attack is echoed by a  broad Republican attack on American democracy and institutions.   We can and should take steps to defend our American democracy. They  are not terribly complicated.   No. 1, stop attacking our own institutions. We can start there. We  are doing Putin's work when we attack our own institutions.   No. 2, step up to protect our own elections. All of our national  security witnesses have warned that they are coming after us in 2018  with more election interference. Yet what have we done?   No. 3, stop sheltering Putin and his oligarchs from consequences. We  passed sanctions against Russian oligarchs and Putin and Russia for  this very thing--messing around in our elections--through the Senate 98  to 2. The effective date of them has run. Yet the President won't  enforce them. Stop sheltering Putin and his oligarchs.   No. 4, clean up the dark channels of foreign influence and  corruption. We know what they are because we have seen this play out in  European countries and former Soviet Union countries. We know how it  works. We have similar vulnerabilities. Fix them.   Those are four things that are not hard to do.  [[Page S646]]    A fifth would be serious investigations by Congress--not tiptoe  investigations but ones where we take hard looks, ask hard questions,  and demand hard evidence.   No one in the Senate has tangled more with Vladimir Putin than our  friend John McCain. Senator McCain has tangled with him so often that  he has actually been blacklisted from travel to Russia. What Senator  McCain said last week is something we should take to heart: ``The  latest attacks against the FBI and Department of Justice serve no  American interests--no party's, no President's, only Vladimir  Putin's.''   He also said this: ``Our Nation's elected officials, including the  President, must stop looking at this investigation through the lens of  politics and manufacturing political sideshows.'' Instead, we need to  be looking at the situation through the lens of our national security.   Here is what America's national security professionals tell us.  First, they concluded: ``Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an  influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election.''   I will continue. ``Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in  the U.S. Democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her  electability and potential presidency.''   They concluded: ``We further assess Putin and the Russian government  developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.''   We went on with this important conclusion in the January 2017  intelligence community assessment: ``We assess Moscow will apply  lessons learned from its Putin-ordered campaign aimed at the U.S.  presidential election to future influence efforts worldwide, including  against U.S. allies and their election processes.''   We know they are coming. We have been warned by Trump's own  appointees that they are coming. Yet we do nothing. Nada. As Putin  would say, ``nichego.''   Well, right now that leaves Congress complicit, but it doesn't have  to be this way, and it ought not be this way. It is not too late to  defend our democracy and to teach Russia and the world some different  lessons about who we are. What are the things we could do? Well, we  could defend our democracy from Russian political influence.   Let's take legislative action to secure election infrastructure,  improve our cyber security, counter and blunt Russian propaganda, and  keep foreign money out of our politics. That ought not to be too hard  to ask.   Let's defend our democracy from future Russian and foreign meddling.  Let's insist on the implementation and enforcement of the sanctions  against Russia. We passed them 98 to 2 for a reason. Why is President  Trump sheltering Putin and the oligarchs from that punch? Let's insist  on the message being delivered that we don't tolerate this behavior and  that we will deter it with serious sanctions.   Let's insist on transparency. Let's insist on transparency about  foreign financial interference in our country, through shell  corporations in particular, and let's insist on transparency about the  President's foreign financial dealings and conflicts of interest.   Finally, let's pass legislation to protect the special counsel from  interference and obstruction. I have been a U.S. attorney. I understand  the role of an independent and honorable Department of Justice. I  understand, as we all should, that no man--not even the President--is  above the law. And like many colleagues who have served in the  Department of Justice, I expect, as they all expect, that even under  the pressure, the threats, and the intimidation brought by the  President against this Department of Justice, it will do its job. As  FBI Director Christopher Wray recently said, ``We expect them to keep  calm and tackle hard.''   I see the majority leader is on the floor.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
