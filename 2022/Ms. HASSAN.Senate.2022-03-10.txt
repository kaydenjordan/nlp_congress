 Madam President, I would also like to thank my friend,  the Senator from Vermont, who has been a champion for helping address  substance use disorders in New England and around the country.

The fiscal year 2021 joint  explanatory statement accompanying the omnibus appropriations bill  directed the Secretary to avoid significant funding cliffs between  States with similar opioid mortality rates. For fiscal year 2022, the  joint explanatory statement ``notes that large swings in funding  between grant cycles can pose a significant challenge for States  seeking to maintain programs that were instrumental in reducing drug  overdose fatalities'' and directs the Assistant Secretary to award  funds in a manner that avoids funding cliffs.
