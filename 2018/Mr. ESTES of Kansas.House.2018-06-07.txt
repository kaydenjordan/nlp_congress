 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3,  the Spending Cuts to Expired and Unnecessary Programs Act.   These spending cuts, or rescissions, address the desire by President  Trump and many in Congress to begin the long overdue process of  reigning in government spending. This package is important because, as  an engineer, businessman, and former State treasurer, I know you can't  build a strong economy on debt and borrowed money.   Spending money we don't have on things we don't need increases our  unsustainable $21 trillion national debt and mortgages the future for  our kids and grandkids. But reducing the size and scope of government  isn't about budget number, it is about returning freedom and liberty to  the American people. It is also common sense.   Kansas families have to live within their means. Our Federal  Government should be no different. H.R. 3 is a great first step.                                time  1515    Today's spending cuts will save the taxpayers $15 billion, the  largest rescission package since the tool was adopted in 1974, which  comes from programs that have expired or can no longer be used.   If we don't pass this rescission bill, it is like leaving cash lying  around the kitchen table, the silverware drawer, or in the corner. It  may leave the money available for use, but it is a poor way to manage  the taxpayers' dollars. Returning the money to our treasury allows us  to make investments in other needed areas without raising taxes or  spending money we don't have.   Over the past 2 years, Republicans in Congress have jump-started our  economy through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and slashing government red  tape and regulation. This has helped our economy reach the lowest  unemployment rate in nearly 20 years. However, now is the time we need  to get serious about cutting spending, and today's vote is a great  first step.   I look forward to passage of H.R. 3 and to identifying even more ways  to cut spending, as well as reforming entitlements and quasi- entitlements and growing our economy in the future.
