 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of subtitle E of title XVI, add the following       new section:       SEC. 1673. PROHIBITION ON REDUCTION OF THE INTERCONTINENTAL                     BALLISTIC MISSILES OF THE UNITED STATES.         (a) Prohibition.--Except as provided by subsection (b),       none of the funds authorized to be appropriated by this Act       or otherwise made available for fiscal year 2018 for the       Department of Defense shall be obligated or expended for--        (1) reducing, or preparing to reduce, the responsiveness or       alert level of the intercontinental ballistic missiles of the       United States; or        (2) reducing, or preparing to reduce, the quantity of       deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles of the United       States to a number less than 400.        (b) Exception.--The prohibition in subsection (a) shall not       apply to any of the following activities:        (1) The maintenance or sustainment of intercontinental       ballistic missiles.        (2) Ensuring the safety, security, or reliability of       intercontinental ballistic missiles.        (3) Reduction in the number of deployed intercontinental       ballistic missiles that are carried out in compliance with--        (A) the limitations of the New START Treaty (as defined in       section 494(a)(2)(D) of title 10, United States Code); and        (B) section 1644 of the Carl Levin an Howard P. ``Buck''       McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year       2015 (Public Law 113-291; 128 Stat. 3651; 10 U.S.C. 494       note).    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 440, the gentlewoman  from Wyoming (Ms. Cheney) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Wyoming.    Mr. Chair, I rise to offer an amendment that will help  ensure the strength of our nuclear deterrent by preventing further  reductions to our deployed ICBM fleet below 400 missiles.   At this point, our deployed fleet at 400 missiles is at the basic  level necessary to maintain a strong and effective nuclear deterrence.  Mr. Chair, our ICBMs are a critical leg of our triad as they provide  our commanders with a responsive, flexible, and survivable military  response ready 24/7, 365 days a year.   Our ICBM leg of the triad also adds significantly to our deterrence  capability by increasing the number of targets our adversaries must  hold at risk.   My amendment is a safeguard that prevents any unilateral disarmament  that would leave our Nation vulnerable to attack. My amendment does not  impact our compliance with the New START, and it does not change our  current alert level or require the deployment of any additional ICBMs  at this point.   The amendment simply reaffirms to our adversaries and our allies that  our nuclear deterrence will remain strong.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, there is nothing in my amendment that has any  negative impact on our submarine fleet. In fact, I support strongly, as  does the NDAA, the importance of the triad, as have administrations of  both parties over many years.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr.  Rogers), the distinguished chairman of the Strategic Forces  Subcommittee.    Mr. Chair, how much time do I have left?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Wyoming has 2\3/4\ minutes  remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Nebraska (Mr. Bacon), a retired brigadier general and the former  commander of Offutt Air Force Base.    Mr. Chairman, we have seen over the years many misguided  efforts to unilaterally cut our strategic forces and to do so in a way  that has been really based on a notion that somehow if we reduce the  level of weapons in our inventory, that our adversaries will do the  same. We know that is simply not the case.   This amendment is crucial to ensure that we maintain the kind of  deterrent that is necessary in a world in which we are facing  increasing threats.   Our ability to deter against the threats of our adversaries depends  in large part both upon their understanding of our will to use our  forces as well as their belief in our capability, and the last thing we  should be doing is reducing below a safe and secure number.   Mr. Chairman, in offering this amendment, my intention is very much  to say, look, our obligation as Members of the House of Representatives  is to provide for the common defense and to ensure that, while we are  overseeing activities by the executive branch, we are not allowing the  kind of irresponsible cuts that could put us at risk.   So I urge the adoption of my amendment, Mr. Chairman, and I yield  back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms. Cheney).   The amendment was agreed to.                   Amendment No. 15 Offered by Mr. Lamborn    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 15  printed in House Report 115-217.
