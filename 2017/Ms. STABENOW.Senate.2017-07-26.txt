 Will the distinguished Senator from Oregon allow me a  question?   This is a very, very important debate. On the point that my colleague  just made, isn't it correct that there is nothing in any of these  versions that lowers the cost of prescription drugs, which is the No. 1  issue for people in this country, as it relates to healthcare, or for  businesses? I hear it all the time. There is nothing in here to lower  the cost of prescription drugs, but there are tax cuts in here for the  prescription drug companies. Is that correct?    There is nothing to go further to use the buying power  with Medicare to negotiate prescription drugs or to allow, with safe  FDA approval, for people in Michigan to be able to drive across a  bridge to Windsor and be able to get the very same prescription drugs  for 40 percent less. There is nothing in there about that, is that  correct?    I wonder if the Senators are aware that in Michigan-- and I share in the deep concerns of the Senator from Vermont about  those opportunities that people have paid into, by the way. This is not  free. This is not an entitlement. People pay into Medicare, pay into  Social Security, which has lifted a generation of seniors out of  poverty and allowed seniors and people with disabilities to live longer  because of Medicare, and it has created a better quality of life-- Medicaid, as well.   There is a great success story in Michigan that I would share on the  Medicaid front. Of course, three out of five Michigan seniors in  nursing homes with Alzheimer's or other kinds of challenges get their  healthcare from Medicaid. In addition to Medicare, Medicaid is there  for middle-class seniors, for low-income seniors, and so on.   When our distinguished Senator from Oregon talks about dollars-- saving dollars or costing dollars--an interesting thing has happened by  setting up Healthy Michigan and expanding Medicaid healthcare to  minimum-wage working people. We are actually saving money.   Ninety-seven percent of our children can now see a doctor in  Michigan. That is great. They have cut in half the number of people who  walk into the emergency room who can't pay. We all pay if somebody  walks in and gets the most expensive treatment through the emergency  room.   The State of Michigan will save $432 million in taxpayer money next  year because they are focusing on children going to a doctor, people  getting preventive care, not using the emergency room. It saves money.   Instead of doing these tax-cut provisions for the wealthiest and for  the pharmaceutical companies that take dollars away, actually doing the  right thing on healthcare in Michigan is a great success story for  saving taxpayer dollars.    If I might ask one final question, would my colleague  agree that rather than this approach, in which we don't even know,  moment to moment, what we are voting on here--unlike what we did in the  Finance Committee in 2009, where there were 100 hearings in the Finance  Committee and the HELP Committee before we even voted on anything on  the Affordable Care Act. Rather than that process, we are looking at a  situation where everything coming before us will take away healthcare  for tens of millions of people and raise costs on everyone. Would my  colleague agree that it would be better to stop this process and go  back to a bipartisan effort to lower costs and increase healthcare  coverage? Would my colleague agree, as well, that we know that there  are people paying too much for copays and premiums, and that needs to  be addressed?   In the private marketplace, there is not enough competition among  insurance companies. In some places, there are none in the individual  market. We need to work together to lower costs, starting with  prescription drugs, and to also continue to increase the opportunity  for people to get healthcare coverage. That is what we ought to be  doing together and doing it in a thoughtful way and getting input and  actually solving the real problems.
