 Madam President, I thank Senator Capito for not letting  this body and this country forget about this terrible addiction crisis  that has afflicted her State, my State, and particularly our region of  the country, but well beyond that, her work has been particularly  important, and I thank her for doing that.   I think it also points to the importance of our doing, during this  pandemic, other things to support local governments that are so  stretched with Medicaid dollars and with local public health dollars.  That is the importance of the next round of pandemic funding--State and  local governments, local communities, and local education.   We know that Senator McConnell's effort--and I put the word  ``effort'' in quotation marks--has fallen so short. He waited and  waited and waited and waited and waited. The House passed its bill in  May. This body, through Senator McConnell, would not even take it up  until--would not even begin negotiations, really, until this week, when  unemployment is about to expire and when the eviction moratorium is  about to expire. If the opioid crisis, public health crisis, is bad now  and we haven't dealt with the coronavirus, well, now imagine what will  happen when people lose their unemployment or when it is reduced to  $200 a week, causing mass eviction. Moratoria are expiring, and  eviction courts are opening up all over the country. Imagine what will  happen with the opioid addiction public health disaster and imagine  what will happen with coronavirus if people lose their apartments in  large numbers.   I just don't think any of us can quite imagine that tragedy. It is  clear that my colleagues on this side of the aisle don't get out very  much, don't talk to people very much, and don't listen to people very  much and see what these huge needs are for people to continue some  semblance of the standard of living they had prior to the coronavirus.
