 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Judge  William S. Greenberg, a dedicated public servant, celebrated jurist,  and fierce advocate for our Nation's veterans.   Born in New York and raised in New Jersey, Judge Greenberg received  his undergraduate degree in 1964 from Johns Hopkins University and his  J.D. in 1967 from Rutgers University in Newark. Upon graduating from  law school, Judge Greenberg enlisted in the U.S. Army as an armored  cavalry crewman beginning his long history of service to our Nation. In  1970, he earned a commission in the Judge Advocate General's Corps and  eventually retired as a brigadier general in 1994 after decades of  honorable service in the U.S. Army Reserves.   Judge Greenberg spent the beginning half of his career in private  practice as a litigator. He was a founding partner of Sterns &  Greenberg from 1970 until 1976 and of Greenberg & Prior from 1976 to  1989. He retired from private practice as a partner in McCarter &  English in 2012, after he was nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals  for Veterans Claims by President Obama. After his confirmation in the  Senate, Judge Greenberg was sworn in for a term of 15 years on December  28, 2012, allowing Judge Greenberg to apply his skills and energy as a  judge to two of his greatest passions: the law and veterans service.   This nomination to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims was the  culmination of a career dedicated to advocating for our Nation's  veterans, both in and out of the courtroom. Judge Greenberg devoted  much of his career to ensuring his fellow veterans had the best legal  representation. After the horrific attacks on September 11, 2001, Judge  Greenberg established the New Jersey State Bar Association's Program of  Military Legal Assistance for members of the military Reserves who were  called to active duty. This pro bono program connects volunteer lawyers  with soldiers who need legal representation for everything from  disability benefits claims, to employment  [[Page S2306]]  and family law issues that they face both during and after deployment.   Judge Greenberg also admirably represented wounded soldiers at Walter  Reed Army Medical Center during their physical disability hearings. For  his remarkable work, Judge Greenberg was recommended by the White House  to become Chairman of the Reserve Forces Policy Board in 2009 and  honored with the Secretary of Defense Medal for Outstanding Public  Service, the second highest civilian award in the Department of  Defense.   Throughout his long career, Judge Greenberg has held many prestigious  positions, including chairman of the Judicial and Prosecutorial  Appointments Committee of the New Jersey State Bar Association,  president of the Association of Trial Lawyers of America, New Jersey,  commissioner of the New Jersey State Commission of Investigation, and  assistant counsel to the Governor of New Jersey. He is also a published  author and has been a professor at Seton Hall University School of Law  and Georgetown Law School. But even with all of these accolades, Judge  Greenberg considers his work on behalf of veterans as the most  important of his career, once quoted as saying, ``I have come to  consider myself, more than any other attribute, a soldier's lawyer.''   Thanks to his extraordinary commitment to justice and public service,  his intelligence and legal acumen, and his tireless work ethic and  compassion, Judge Greenberg is a model for our Nation's judiciary.  Judge Greenberg's dedication to our country, both as a veteran himself  and in his remarkable work on behalf of other veterans, will be his  enduring legacy.   I applaud his many accomplishments and hope my colleagues will join  me in recognizing Judge Greenberg for his remarkable record of public  service.                            ____________________
