 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, we woke up this morning to learn with  profound sadness that our friend and colleague Congressman Elijah  Cummings, the son of sharecroppers who became the chair of the House  Oversight Committee, passed away last night at the age of 68.   It was the first thing I saw when I read the paper this morning, and  it hit me like a punch in the stomach.   In his 23 years in Congress, Elijah amassed a legacy that will live  on long after his sudden passing. He served the people of his Maryland  district with selflessness, passion, and grace.   Since it only happened this morning, I can't do justice to the legacy  of Elijah Cummings, but I would like to share a few reflections, and I  know that my dear friend Senator Cardin was close like this--like  brothers--with Elijah Cummings, and they had worked together on so many  things for Maryland and the country. I know he is here sharing our deep  sadness.   Now, truly, Elijah Cummings was not just a great Congressman. He was  a great man. He had a presence--a commanding presence--when he entered  the room, and he could be strong when he had to be, and he had to be  strong quite often. But he also was always kind and decent and caring  and honorable.   It is a rare combination, that inner strength and that decency and  that kindness. Elijah had it. If we had lived in happier times, maybe  the public would have seen this kind side more often, but Elijah was  never one to shrink from the moment.   I talked to him frequently. We would talk about the goings-on in the  House or the Senate or the political trivia of the day. Sometimes we  would talk about Maryland politics. He was an expert.   Elijah was revered by his constituents and indeed by the entire State  of Maryland. Liberal or conservative, Democrat or Republican, Black or  White, you went to Elijah Cummings for advice. His loss is an enormous  one for his constituents, for his staff and, above all, his family. I  pray for them this morning, as I pray for our country when people like  Elijah Cummings of the world are no longer with us.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on Syria, yesterday, the U.S. military  carried out airstrikes to destroy what only a few weeks ago had been  the headquarters of the American campaign to destroy ISIS in Syria.  Nothing encapsulates the failure of President Trump's decision to stand  aside for Erdogan more than the fact that we are now bombing our own  bases rather than allow them to fall into the hands of Assad, Erdogan,  or Putin.   If Erdogan, Putin, and Assad are such great allies or no problem, as  President Trump told us yesterday at the White House, then why do we  have to bomb our own headquarters after American troops evacuated so it  doesn't fall into Syrian or Turkish or even Russian hands? That one  thing encapsulates the absurdity, the awfulness of President Trump's  lack of policy and erratic, impulsive, and whimsical movements on the  Syrian front.   Yesterday the President said this withdrawal was a ``strategic  move.'' It certainly is not that because this is not the action of a  military that carried out a deliberate withdrawal. It is the action of  a military that was given a fly-by-the-seat-of-his-pants decision of  the President contrary to the recommendations of the commanders on the  ground.   Donald Trump has the nerve, the gall, to think he knows more about  the military than these generals who have served our country for  decades. It is appalling. How does America put up with this? How do our  Republican colleagues put up with this? He doesn't consult the  generals. What a blunder, and it seems to be the result of the  President's inability to say no to dictators. He seems to like a Putin  and an Erdogan and even a Kim more than our allies. This is also a  clear demonstration of the President's fecklessness and recklessness,  both, or as my colleague Senator Lindsey Graham, and one of the  President's staunchest allies in Congress, said, ``I fear that this is  a complete and utter national security disaster in the making.''   Yesterday afternoon, congressional leaders went to the White House,  at its request, to meet with the President about the rapid  disintegration of the situation in northern Syria. Speaker Pelosi and I  talked about it ahead of time, and we talked about it with Senators  Reed and Menendez as well. We had a serious purpose: to find out if the  President actually had a plan to contain ISIS and fix the mess  precipitated by his decision to green-light Erdogan's military  incursion into Syria.   Alarmingly--alarmingly--President Trump had no plan. The greatest  insult that occurred in that room was not any of the name-calling that  Trump did. A far greater insult to America, to all of us, was the lack  of any policy guidance, any policy decisions, any direction from the  President and his top national security advisers on how to contain  ISIS.   I reminded the President that as two New Yorkers, we probably knew  better than most the damage a small band of terrorists can do, even  from a half a world away. I asked: What is your plan to prevent ISIS  from regrouping and resurging? He didn't have one. Secretary of Defense  Mark Esper didn't have a plan.   After we pushed them and pushed them, I said: Who is going to take  care of all these prisoners? The President said there were 70,000 ISIS  prisoners and their families. Who is going to take care of them, make  sure they don't escape, as some have already?   They finally said: Well, the Syrians and the Turks will do that. So I  asked the group if they had any intelligence or assurances that the  Turks and Syrians would do a decent job. Secretary Esper himself said  there was no evidence of that.   This is amazing. Terrorists whom we have spent a decade fighting--we  have spent billions of dollars and lost lives to fight them--are  finally in prison. The Kurds are guarding them. The Kurds are leaving,  understandably, because they have to fight the Turks now. What is the  plan? There isn't any, except to rely on Syrians, Turks, who have not  even close to the interest we have in curbing ISIS.   Assad is much more interested in gaining back his Syrian homeland.  Erdogan is focused on hurting the Kurds, whom he is fanatically  against. So they are not going to pay much attention to ISIS.   It was appalling, just appalling. President Trump has stepped aside  for Putin, Assad, and Erdogan. Our allies, the Kurds, are being  slaughtered as a result of our betrayal. Most importantly, as Secretary  Mattis said, ``if we don't keep the pressure on [in Syria], ISIS will  resurge. It's absolutely a given that they will come back.''   The President didn't like hearing Mattis's words, but all of America  should. He is one of the most respected military minds, one of the most  respected leaders on both sides of the aisle--liberals, Independents,  conservatives. Here is what he said, again repeating:   [[Page S5858]]              [I]f we don't keep the pressure on [in Syria], ISIS will       resurge. It's absolutely a given that they will come back.    So make no mistake, the President's incompetence, his impulsiveness,  his erraticness has made Americans less safe--Americans here in our  homeland. Congress, today, must make the fact clear to the President in  a bipartisan fashion.   We have the opportunity, my colleagues. The House passed a resolution  condemning the President's decision by an overwhelming vote of 354 to  60. That means the vast majority of House Republicans--129 to be  exact--condemned the President's decision in Syria. Leader McCarthy,  Whip Scalise, and No. 3 Cheney all voted for it. They are as loyal to  President Trump as anybody, but they saw the danger, the real danger.  Today the Senate should, and I hope will, follow suit. We can quibble  about the language, but I have no doubt we can agree on the basic  message, and there is no reason we can't vote on a Senate resolution  today.   Time is of the essence. To say, well, I would like to add this word  or add this sentence, as Kurds are being slaughtered, as ISIS  terrorists are escaping--no, no, no. No, no, no. We should move to the  House bill immediately because we all know there is only one person who  can reverse this, and that is the President. The greatest ability to  make him reverse is an overwhelming message from the Republican side-- House and Senate--that this is wrong. He doesn't hear that publicly too  often from our Republican friends. He has heard it from the House,  correctly and courageously.   Please, my friends, my Republican friends in the Senate, let's put  politics aside. Today let's vote the House bill passed yesterday by  them. There is no time to waste. Time is of the essence because the  President still doesn't get it. Our meeting at the White House  demonstrated that to all who were present. Hopefully, an overwhelming  bipartisan vote in the Senate will break through to him. I strongly,  strongly--in the strongest of terms--urge my friend Leader McConnell  and our Republican colleagues to allow a vote on the Syrian resolution  today. Security, justice, fairness demand no less.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on climate, as Senator Cardin well  knows, later the Senate will vote on his resolution of disapproval to  repeal the Trump administration's so-called affordable clean energy  rule. This is one of the few opportunities where the minority can force  a vote on the Senate floor, and there may be no more worthy an issue  than protecting our environment.   Four years ago, the Obama administration put in place new standards  and safeguards for CO2 and fossil fuel emissions from  powerplants--the first of their kind intended to meet the threat of  climate change. Earlier in July, by employing shady science, the Trump  administration so violently obliterated these safeguards protecting our  globe, our world, and frankly a lot of the forests in my home State of  New York. In its place, the Trump administration enacted a new rule  that will allow big polluters to wreck our air, dirty our water, and  poison our Earth with little or no accountability.   Thanks to this new rule, commonsense limits on carbon emissions have  been blurred, and deadlines for implementing the reductions have now  been tripled or even quadrupled, but time is running out for the United  States to meet the existential threat posed by climate change. That is  why this rule is such a grave mistake.   Thankfully, in this case, the minority can do something under the  Congressional Review Act. We are allowed to overturn some of the rules  this administration unilaterally put in place. Later this morning, we  will vote on Senator Cardin's resolution of disapproval, which, if  passed, will repeal the Trump's administration's destructive rule and  reinstitute the safeguards that were originally in place.   Our Republican colleagues have a choice. They can either stop the  rollback of lifesaving environmental protections or they can side with  energy companies that put their fortunes ahead of our future. The  choice is theirs.                            ____________________     Mr. President, one final note. Today marks 1,000 days of  President Trump's time in office. If we were to summarize his  administration over the last 2\1/2\ years in a single phrase, it would  be this: broken promises to working people.   When Candidate Trump ran for office, he promised to drain the swamp,  but after 1,000 days as President, this place is the swampiest it has  ever been, with conflicts of interest crippling this administration and  inexperienced billionaires running our government.   Candidate Trump promised health insurance for everybody, but after  1,000 days as President, costs are higher, coverage is skimpier, and  his administration is suing to repeal the healthcare we have in place  and send prices skyrocketing for millions.   President Trump promised a tax bill that would be a middle-class  miracle, but the only miracle this has been has been to corporate  America, which uses it for stock buybacks instead of increasing  salaries for their workers, increasing their investments in plant and  equipment. So much of these tax breaks went to buybacks. Shame.   One thousand days in, President Trump has failed to follow through on  promise after promise to working Americans, but he isn't the only one  at fault. Democrats have fought to do the work of the American people,  but as the House passes things, Leader McConnell and my Senate  Republican colleagues have simply turned this Chamber into a  legislative graveyard, where good ideas that would help the middle  class and those trying to get to the middle class just come to die.   We could be reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act; we could be  voting on election security; we could be voting on background checks,  but Leader McConnell has buried hundreds of House bills in his  legislative graveyard.   After 1,000 days since President Trump took office, he and his  Republican colleagues have made clear whose side they are on. If you  are ultrarich, you are very powerful, you have great connections, it  has been a great few years, but for everyone else, it has been a string  of disappointing, broken, and heartbreaking promises. Come next year,  the American people will have a chance to vote for real change.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, I am going to speak for a minute before  I make my unanimous consent request.   Now, we have a crisis here in this world and here in America. Because  of the President's precipitous action to take a small number of  American troops out of northern Syria and green-light Erdogan's  invasion, we are in real trouble. We are in trouble in a whole lot of  ways.   Most importantly, we, in New York, know that a small group of bad  people can cause terrible terrorism with huge loss of life, even when  they are 7,000 miles away. There are about 70,000 ISIS prisoners and  their families now being guarded by the Kurds, but because of the  President's action, they will no longer be guarded.   When we went to the White House yesterday and asked the President and  his military folks what is the plan to prevent many of these ISIS  would-be terrorists from escaping, they didn't have one. They didn't  have one because the Kurds have left, and the only people who might  guard them are the Syrians or the Turks, and neither of them have a  great interest in stopping ISIS.   In fact, I asked the Defense Secretary Esper: Is there any  intelligence that shows that either the Syrians or the Turks would do a  good job at guarding the ISIS prisoners and preventing them from  escaping?   No, there was no intelligence to that effect. As a result, ISIS  prisoners are escaping, will continue to escape, and America will pay  an awful price--an awful price. The Kurds will pay an awful price. They  have fought alongside our soldiers. They are our allies.   I talked to my friend from Kentucky who said the Kurds are better off  with the Syrians. Well, the Kurds sure don't think so. They would  rather be back to the status quo. Talk to their leaders. Certainly,  America will not be better off at all with ISIS prisoners escaping.   Who did this? The President. The President's incompetence has put  American lives in danger--simply, starkly put but accurate. In New  York, as I said, we know well how a small group of fanatics halfway  around the world can do incredible damage and kill thousands of  Americans here on our soil.   It should shake every Member of this body, regardless of their  ideology and regardless of their views on Turkey, that the President  made this decision so abruptly without heeding the advice of our  commanders on the ground and now has no plan to manage the  consequences.   After meeting with the President yesterday, it was clear to both  Democrats and Republicans in the room that he does not grasp the  gravity of the situation. He doesn't understand it. The most important  thing we can do right now is send President Trump a message that  Congress, the vast majority of Democrats and Republicans, demand he  reverse course.   I am asking this as a unanimous consent to not go through a long  regular process because the bottom line is, the longer we wait, the  more Kurds will die--our allies--the more ISIS prisoners will escape,  and the greater danger, hour by hour, day by day, America falls into.  We should move this resolution. We need unanimous consent.   I spoke to my good friend from Kentucky. He said he wanted to put a  resolution on the floor about military aid to Turkey, something many on  my side would be sympathetic to. I offered him the ability of moving  his resolution--we would have to, of course, get permission of all  Members, but I would work through that--in return for us moving our  resolution. He still said no. He still said no. I think that is a  horrible decision. I think it could well risk the lives of Americans  down the road. I think it will certainly risk the lives of many more  Kurds, who are our allies.   We will return to this issue. I wish we could pass it now--the same  bill that passed the House with the vast majority of Republicans, 2 to  1, with Leaders McCarthy and Scalise and Cheney voting for it--and go  forward. I understand the motivations of my friend from Kentucky are  sincere and real. He has had these positions consistently. They are not  the positions of the majority on his side nor on our side on many  issues. On some, we have worked together and agreed, but I think it is  so wrong not to move forward. It is so wrong to let the man, both  Democrats and Republicans saw in the White House yesterday, stay in  control without pressuring him to do better--without pressuring him to  do better.   There is no better, quicker, or more powerful way to pressure the  President to undo the damage he has caused than to pass a bipartisan  joint resolution that will go directly to his desk. We will come back  to this issue. It will not go away. It cannot go away for the safety of  America, for the safety of the Kurds, for some degree of stability, not  chaos in the Middle East that the President, President Trump,  precipitously caused.   I plead with my colleague from Kentucky and anyone else who might  object to let us have the vote. Let us make our arguments and prevail.  We are willing to do debate time. Let us not say it has to be my way or  the highway when so many lives and such danger is at risk.   I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate  consideration of Calendar No. 246, H.J. Res. 77; that the joint  resolution be read a third time and the Senate vote on passage with no  intervening action or debate.    I believe history will show that the country, the  Senate, and even the Senator from Kentucky will regret his blocking of  this resolution.   I yield the floor.
