 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Goodlatte for the  opportunity to bring this bill forward. I rise  [[Page H3853]]  today in support of H.R. 5645, the Standard Merger and Acquisition  Reviews Through Equal Rules Act, or the SMARTER Act.   Mr. Speaker, the SMARTER Act is a much-needed piece of legislation to  harmonize and modernize our antitrust procedures. Despite the shared  responsibilities for the antitrust review between the FTC and the DOJ,  both agencies follow dramatically different review processes, meaning  that businesses are held to conflicting standards and procedures,  depending on which agency actually conducts the review. And that  review, as Chairman Goodlatte pointed out, is essentially a coin toss.   We can do better than that. The SMARTER Act in no way weakens or  undermines our antitrust review process. It does not prevent or hinder  either agency from conducting a full and thorough review.   Rather, the SMARTER Act actually strengthens the antitrust review  process by injecting greater consistency, more transparency, and  enhance consumer protection when we have these mergers and  acquisitions.   With that, I urge my colleagues to support the SMARTER Act.
