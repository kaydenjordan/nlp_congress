 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as co-chair  of the bipartisan German-American Caucus to commemorate the fall of the  Berlin Wall.   Last week, November 9, marked 31 years since the Iron Curtain fell  and the Cold War began to crumble.   For nearly three decades, the Berlin Wall stood as a growing reminder  of the evils of communism and the ongoing threat of the Cold War.   In 1987, President Ronald Reagan famously shouted, ``Mr. Gorbachev,  tear down this wall.'' Two years later, the wall finally came down.  East and West Berliners celebrated together at Brandenburg Gate.   The following year, on October 3, 1990, East and West Germany  reunited as one.  [[Page H5735]]    This historic moment was the beginning of the end for the Cold War,  and today we are still celebrating this iconic moment in world history  as an international symbol of freedom.   I join our German friends in celebrating this milestone and would  like to remind all of us that freedom is always worth fighting for.                            ____________________
