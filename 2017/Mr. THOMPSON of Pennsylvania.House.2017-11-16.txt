 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage  all of my colleagues to support H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   For the first time since 1986, this is a real opportunity to  challenge the status quo and simplify the Tax Code.   For the nearly 82 percent of taxpayers in Pennsylvania's Fifth  Congressional District who file jointly under the standard deduction,  they are going to see that nearly doubled to $24,000, up from $12,700.   According to the IRS, 18 percent of taxpayers in the Fifth District  of Pennsylvania choose to itemize their tax returns, averaging about  $21,000 in deductions. Doubling the standard deduction means that low-  and middle-income families, who have been struggling for a long time,  will see their tax burden lowered.   This proposal truly strives to help families keep more of their hard- earned paychecks. Today we have a once-in-a-generation opportunity that  we cannot afford to pass up: more jobs, fair taxes, bigger paychecks.   Mr. Speaker, the American people deserve no less, and I encourage my  colleagues to support this bill.                            ____________________
