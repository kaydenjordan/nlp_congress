 Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate  Elizabeth City State University women's basketball team and North  Carolina Wesleyan University men's basketball team for their remarkable  championship wins this past weekend.   For Elizabeth City State University, this impressive achievement is  the first CIAA championship win in the institution's 132-year history.  The Lady Vikings showed everyone in the arena that teamwork brings home  triumph.
