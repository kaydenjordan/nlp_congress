 Mr. President, now, it may have taken all weekend, but  the Senate is now finally on the precipice of passing major bipartisan  infrastructure legislation.   Last night, an overwhelming bipartisan majority of Senators voted to  surmount the final few procedural hurdles and put the bill on a  glidepath for passage tomorrow morning. The bill will represent a  substantial downpayment toward the level of infrastructure investment  our country needs, and for the first time, the Senate has come together  around such a package in decades. I will have more to say about it  before final passage.                             Budget Reconcilation    Now, Mr. President, all summer, I have spoken about how the Senate  would proceed along two tracks when it came to infrastructure: the  bipartisan bill we will vote on tomorrow as well as the budget  reconciliation bill that will allow Democrats to make historic  investments in American jobs, American families, and efforts to reverse  climate change.   In order to achieve such an ambitious legislative effort, I laid out  two clear goals for this summer work period: pass the bipartisan bill  and a budget resolution to set up the second track of our process  before we leave for August recess.   Many folks called that two-track process unrealistic. Many others  said it  [[Page S6062]]  is unachievable on such a short timeline and in such a slow-moving  Chamber. But we have managed to steer two trains at the same time.  There have been some bumps. There have been some delays. But the Senate  is on track to finish both tracks.   Earlier this summer, I suggested the two-track strategy to President  Biden and Speaker Pelosi. We all agreed it was the best way to move  forward, and we are working in concert to make it happen.   This morning, Senate Democrats unveiled our budget resolution with  reconciliation instructions, which is the first step in unlocking the  legislative process for a budget reconciliation bill later this year.   Several Members--many Members--had a hand in crafting this package.  We worked closely with our committee chairs, but I want to especially  thank the chair of the Budget Committee, Senator Sanders. He kept his  nose to the grindstone and led our caucus on the budget. He always kept  the thoughts and needs of American workers and families at the top of  his mind. As a result, the Democratic budget will be the most  significant legislation for American families since the era of the New  Deal and the Great Society. It is big, bold change--the kind of change  America thirsts for.   I want to thank other members of the Budget Committee, like Senator  Warner, who worked closely with the White House and Chairman Sanders to  develop a framework, and Senators Murray and Wyden and Stabenow and  Whitehouse and Merkley and Kaine and Van Hollen and Lujan and Padilla,  all of whom came together, even though each had different views on  different issues, to produce this result, and a great result it is.   I want American families to understand what this legislation will  mean for them--four simple things to keep in mind. I am borrowing  Senator Stabenow's chart for this. It will lower costs for Americans,  it will cut taxes for American families, it will create millions of  jobs while tackling the climate crisis, and it will be paid for by the  wealthy paying their fair share. These are four goals. The American  people support every one of them overwhelmingly.   In all phases, we will concentrate on communities that have been too  often neglected, including communities of color and Native Americans,  by making education, childcare, healthcare, and housing more  affordable. We can give tens of millions of families a leg up by making  sure that we can get our children out of poverty, and I thank the  Presiding Officer for his leadership on that issue. We can provide  ladders to families who haven't had them before and help them climb  into the middle class.   Many of the policies we are proposing were in President Biden's  American Jobs and Family Plan, but some go beyond, like expanding  Medicare to cover dental, vision, and hearing benefits--something that  was left out of Medicare at the beginning. It never should have been,  and we can rectify it now.   By cutting taxes for tens of millions of American families, we can  expand opportunity and make it easier for parents to pass on a better  life to their children and their grandchildren. By making further  investments in infrastructure, we can create tens of thousands-- hundreds of thousands--of good-paying jobs. By finally tackling climate  change, we can spare our country and our planet the most devastating  effects of global warming.   Just this morning, a major new report from climate scientists at the  United Nations concluded that the nations of the world have only a  small window to ``prevent the most harrowing future''--``prevent the  most harrowing future''--in the words of the New York Times.   Without immediate and bold action, we are staring down ever worsening  floods and heat waves, droughts and sea level rise. The future of our  planet looks bleak until we do something right now. The budget  reconciliation bill will do more to combat climate change than any  legislation ever--ever--in the history of the Senate. That is a  promise.   While my Republican colleagues regurgitate the same tired talking  points about a Democratic spending spree, let me remind America that we  plan to pay for this package by making the wealthy pay their fair share   When our Republican friends held the majority in this Chamber, they  chose to use the same process Democrats are using now--budget  reconciliation--to give corporations and the wealthy a massive tax  break. At a time of egregious income inequality, the former Republican  majority rammed through a bill where 83 percent of the benefits went to  the top 1 percent--83 percent of the benefits.   I have nothing against the wealthy. God bless them--they are doing  fine already--but it is time to cut taxes for American families,  middle-class families, not multinational corporations. To make our Tax  Code more progressive and more fair, that is what Democrats are going  to do. Under this plan, there will be no tax increases on small  business or American families making under $400,000.   We are going to help small businesses create many, many, many jobs.   We are going to give American families a fair shot. We are going to  tell middle-class families we are going to make it easier for you to  stay there with your increasing costs of things like childcare and  school and college and so much else. We are going to tell poorer  families we are going to make it easier for you to climb into the  middle class with things like the child tax credit and better  healthcare and so much more.   We are going to confront the generational challenge of climate change  head on. We are not flinching; we are not wincing; we are going right  at it. As bad as COVID was this year, and it was horrible, 5 or 10  years from now--every year--climate change will make things worse and  worse and worse, even worse than it was this year in COVID, because  when climate changes, it is such an overwhelming force that, unless we  do something now, we may not be able to stop it down the road.   So, taking a step back, at its core, the Democratic budget is about  restoring the middle class in the 21st century and giving more  Americans the opportunity to get there. Unfortunately, the past 20  years in America have been a story of middle-class decline.   We have all watched as globalization and technology transformed the  way our economy works. Industrial manufacturing jobs were shipped  overseas. A global financial crisis cost Americans their homes and  their wealth. Giant conglomerates wiped out Main Street businesses from  Arizona to Arkansas, from Michigan to Maine. The cost of raising a  family--everything from childcare to college tuition--has become  exorbitant, almost unaffordable, even for those solidly in the middle  class.   Now, after the worst pandemic in a hundred years, American families  are just starting to climb out of the rubble and look toward the  future. We want them to look toward that future with hope and with  optimism, not with the sourness and anger that we have seen throughout  the land--exacerbated, played upon by the previous President.   What the future looks like, in large part, depends on what we do here  now. These next few months are crucial for the future of our country,  even for our democracy.   What we need to do in Congress is to give our workers, our  businesses, our families a chance to prosper in a rapidly changing  world, a chance to have hope, a chance to restore that American dream,  which simply says, if I work hard, I will be doing better 10 years from  now than I am doing today, and my kids will be doing still better than  me. When Americans lose that faith, lose that hope, that sunny American  optimism that has been part of our character for centuries, bad things  happen. Bad things happen to our democracy, to our relationships with  one another, to just about everything.   The social contract in America relies on the fundamental promise of  economic opportunity, the chance, through hard work, to do better for  yourself and then give your children and grandchildren a better life  than you have. That is what America is all about. That is what we are  trying to restore and revivify here.   When that promise is broken, when that American dream is no longer  shining brightly in the sky, when faith in economic opportunity  evaporates, we are not the America we were meant to be. We are not  optimistic and entrepreneurial and forward-looking. Instead,  [[Page S6063]]  we are bitter and angry and backward-looking and, as a result, much  more prone to the sway of demagogues like Donald Trump. The divisions  in our country and our politics today have their roots in the decline  of economic mobility.   Now, the American people don't expect one piece of legislation to  solve all our Nation's ills--no single law can do that--but we have to  start in a bold, strong way rebuilding the basic social contract for  middle-class American families and for everyone struggling to get  there: a promise of equal opportunity and equality; helping middle- class Americans stay in the middle class; building ladders to help  others climb into that middle class. At its core, that is what this  budget is all about, and we are going to take the first steps toward  passing it very, very soon.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Well, it has taken quite a while. There have been a lot  of bumps in the road. But in a few minutes, I will announce that we  have come to an agreement for final passage of the bipartisan  infrastructure proposal.   Let me say this: It has taken quite a long time, and there have been  detours and everything else, but this will do a whole lot of good for  America, and the Senate can be proud it has passed this.   As we move forward, we are proceeding on both tracks, the track of  the bipartisan infrastructure proposal and the track of the budget  resolution with reconciliation instructions. On our side of the aisle,  we know we need both tracks--one dealing with traditional  infrastructure and one dealing with climate and the problems American  families face as they move into the new, global, transformational 21st  century.   So this is a very good day. We have come to an agreement after all  the long, hard negotiating, the stops and starts. We are here, and it  is a good thing--a very good thing--for America.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session to consider the following nominations en  bloc: Calendar Nos. 266, 269, 325, 343, 316, and 326; that the Senate  vote on the nominations en bloc without intervening or action or  debate; that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table with no intervening action or debate; that any statements  related to the nominations be printed in the Record; and that the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.   There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the  nominations en bloc.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the following nominations: Calendar Nos. 302, 303, 304, 305,  306, 307, 308, 309, and 310, and all nominations on the Secretary's  desk in the Air Force, Army, and Foreign Service; that the nominations  be confirmed en bloc; that the motions to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate; that no  further motions be in order to any of the nominations; that any related  statements be printed in the Record; and that the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate then resume  legislative session.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs be discharged from  further consideration and the Senate proceed to the immediate  consideration of H.R. 3642.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read  a third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table.    Madam President, just a word, I was proud to be a  cosponsor, along with Senator Gillibrand, of this legislation.   The Harlem Hellfighters are an example of bravery and courage under  fire, and even though this regiment was consigned to racial  segregation, they still loved America and fought hard for America and  died for America. They are brave. They did a great job in World War I.   It is unfortunate that it has taken so long for this country to  recognize their bravery, because so many of our soldiers of color were  not recognized for their service. But this brings us to a wonderful,  wonderful moment where the Harlem Hellfighters will get the  Congressional Gold Medal.   I am very proud that we have done this.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration and  the Senate now proceed to S.

Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order, following the remarks of Senator Wyden and  Senator Whitehouse.    It is not a question. I would just ask the Senator to  yield for 30 seconds so I might inform the Members. I have been getting  questions.   After we finish on the bipartisan infrastructure bill, we will move  immediately to proceed to the budget resolution with reconciliation  instructions and expect to move to vote-arama shortly thereafter.   I yield the floor                                  H.R. 3684
