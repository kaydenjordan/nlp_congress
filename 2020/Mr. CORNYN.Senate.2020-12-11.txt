 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, since last fall, right after the new year,  our country, like the rest of the planet, became embroiled in a  pandemic, sending fear, shock, illness, and fatalities. As we tried to  respond, we were forced to make hard decisions--I am talking about a  collective ``we''--in terms of economic activity, children going to  school, businesses staying open.   And many businesses simply could not, and many of the workers who  worked at those locations simply were out of luck. You can imagine the  anxiety and the fear of many Americans who, through no fault of their  own, found themselves fearful of the virus and the consequences  associated with it, fearful for the possibility that their loved ones-- let's say, a parent or grandparent who is especially vulnerable because  of their age or somebody because of their underlying chronic health  conditions--were more likely to be a fatality, to lose their life, if  they were infected with the virus.   This is something we haven't experienced perhaps in the last 100  years, since the great flu pandemic at the turn of the last century.   Congress responded the best we could. We knew we had to act quickly,  and we knew we had to act in a big way. I am proud of the fact that, in  the face of this pandemic, Congress came together, setting aside  partisan agendas, and we passed four pieces of legislation to address,  first of all, the public health crisis but, secondly, the economic  fallout associated with mitigation efforts. In other words, we did what  Americans always do in a time of crisis: We pulled together.   I am proud of what we were able to accomplish. But at the end of  March of this year, when we passed the last CARES Act legislation, we  didn't have any idea how long this was going to last. We had no idea  that we would be here now in December of 2020 and still grappling with  how to contain this virus and dealing with the economic fallout  associated with it.   Thank goodness we made a priority of providing resources to our  medical scientists and the pharmaceutical industry that have now come  up with therapies and treatments which are saving more lives. Fewer  people who get the virus are actually dying, thanks to the expertise of  our healthcare providers and the therapeutics that they are able to  administer--saving many, many lives.   But the golden bullet in all of this is the vaccine. I am hopeful  that we in America--that the Food and Drug Administration will  promptly, and I expect they will, approve the use of some of the  vaccines that have been developed, once it is determined they are safe  and effective.   So I think this is like the cavalry arriving, and the cavalry is  nearby and will soon be here. Then we will prioritize the people in the  country who will get the vaccine, as we should. I think the folks who  have been on the frontlines, the so-called essential workers--I tend to  think of all work as being essential, but certainly the healthcare  providers, the people who had to show up. They couldn't hunker down at  home. They had to show up for work because we needed them to do that in  order to protect the rest of us.   But then we ought to go through the elderly, people with underlying  health diseases, schoolteachers, and others to help us get our children  back to school. The list goes on and on.   But what I am not proud of is the embarrassing insensitivity of our  Democratic colleagues, starting with the Senator from New York, the  Democratic leader, when it comes to people's fear about the  consequences associated with the pandemic that relate to the liability  that may ultimately be imposed upon them because they didn't guess it  right the first time.   I am talking about lawsuits by people who will sue, claiming--I am  sure many with some merit--that they have suffered as a result of this  virus and attempt to pin the responsibility on some business, some  school, some church, some synagogue, some mosque, anywhere where they  might have gotten the virus. Anybody with a liability insurance policy,  I am sure, will be fair game by the trial lawyers.    And I am not here to disparage members of the legal profession. I  happen to be one. But I do know that we ought to be focused on what is  the greatest good for the greatest number, and we shouldn't let the  tail wag the dog when it comes to providing commonsense liability  protection, which is what brings me to the floor this afternoon.   I heard the Senator from New York give a fevered speech about what he  called corporate immunity, as if our desire to provide some  predictability and some fairness in the context of civil liability was  somehow a desire to protect nameless, faceless corporations. That is  wrong, and that is why I came to the floor--to say it is wrong and to  explain why it is wrong.   The minority leader tries to frame this as a green light for big, bad  businesses to ignore public health guidelines and to put every person  who walks through their door in danger of contracting COVID-19. That is  a false narrative. That is not true.   For starters, what we have proposed is not blanket immunity. No one  wants to give--let's say somebody is running a meatpacking plant and  one of the workers shows up and says: Boss, I don't feel very good  today; I think I may have something. And he says: You shut up; go to  work. And they end up having the virus and infect all their peers and  fellow employees.   That is reckless and intentional misconduct, and we do not limit  lawsuits based on reckless and intentional misconduct at all. So this  is not a ``get out of jail free'' card or whatever you want to call it.  This will not protect the people who recklessly put other people in  danger of this virus.   In cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct, where the  applicable public health guidance is not followed, the person who  suffered a harm has every right to sue and be made whole, and no one-- no one--wants to change that.   But what we do need to acknowledge is that we are all living through  what I hope is a once-in-a-lifetime catastrophe for everybody involved,  so I don't think we should be creating an opportunity for people who  want to profit off of this pandemic to do so, particularly when a  handful of people will presumably benefit from what the Democratic  leader is proposing--no liability shield--and hundreds of millions of  Americans will benefit from it.   These are unprecedented times, to be sure, much like we owe the  American people more support, and that is part of what is being blocked  by the demands of the Democratic leader to eliminate any sort of  liability shield. We need to put some safeguards in place to ensure  that those who are operating in good faith and following all the  relevant public health guidelines cannot be sued out of existence.  Imagine if you are a small business, hanging on by a thread. Somehow  you have applied for your PPP loan, your paycheck protection loan, and  you have been able to hang on to your business and  [[Page S7440]]  keep your employees on the payroll--somehow, some way.   Well, if you face the prospect of limitless liability, opportunistic  litigation is going to cost you a lot of money and all of your energy  just to defend, even if the claim is meritless. You might think twice-- probably more than twice--about whether you want to stay in business,  whether you want to keep those jobs, whether you want to contribute to  our economy.   We need those people. We need those businesses and those jobs. And I  am not talking about the trial lawyers. They will be fine. They are not  disadvantaged by having to hunker down, wondering where the next  paycheck will come from. They will be fine.   But there are a lot of people who are hurting, and it causes me great  distress to see us--at least some of us--oblivious to the pain, the  anguish, and the desperation of so many Americans.   The number of suicides is up dramatically. The number of reports of  child sexual abuse is down because kids aren't going to school where  their teachers, hopefully, will be trained to help identify those  people.   People are self-medicating with drugs and alcohol. People are  suffering mental health crises. And some folks here in Congress act  like, that doesn't affect me; it is not my problem. It is shocking to  me that there are some who seem to have that approach.   The minority leader knows the facts. When he talks about corporate  immunity, he wants to frame it in the most negative light possible,  which, of course, is why he said that.   What we are proposing will help people. It will help medical workers,  doctors, nurses, aides at hospitals--those who have been on the  frontlines trying to save lives. They didn't have any choice but to  show up. They didn't ask ``Well, are your liability insurance premiums  paid up at the hospital?'' or ``Maybe I need to up my limits because I  know I am going to get sued after this.'' They didn't ask those kinds  of questions; they went and did the job we wanted them to do, and God  bless them for it.   What we are proposing will help a lot more people, a lot more  organizations. And by that, I mean not just businesses; it will help  nonprofits, and it will help restaurants that have tried to follow the  guidelines and opened at limited capacity, as they have gotten guidance  from the local and State and national officials. This will help  everybody.   First, it will help, as I said, our healthcare heroes, the brave men  and women who have led in this battle for months. They have made  tremendous physical and mental sacrifices to save lives, but without  some liability protection from Congress, they could soon find  themselves staring down the barrel of a wave of medical malpractice  lawsuits.   I hope the minority leader will see why this can't happen. New York  State did. His State acted to provide medical liability protection for  healthcare workers in his State. We need to make sure that the kinds of  things that his State did for healthcare workers in New York are  expanded to include others around the country. We need to ensure that  our healthcare workers aren't taken to the cleaners for doing  everything in their power in good faith to respond to the crisis.   Again, the protections his State has provided set a willful  misconduct or gross negligence standard for coronavirus medical  liability suits to ensure that only legitimate cases are brought  against healthcare workers in New York. If that is good enough for New  Yorkers, for his constituents, why deny the same protection to my  constituents or the Presiding Officer's constituents or everybody else  who is on the frontlines of fighting this battle during these  unprecedented times?   I know the minority leader got a letter this summer from a long list  of national medical associations, which represent hundreds of thousands  of healthcare workers, calling for these very same types of  protections. That letter detailed the challenges these workers were up  against and, you can imagine, scarce personal protective equipment.   It would be the easiest thing in the world to blame those healthcare  workers for not adequately providing personal protective equipment and  somehow contributing to the spread of the disease when we know that due  to China's actions--hoarding a lot of the PPE that they themselves  manufactured--when they didn't tell the rest of the world that the  virus was running rampant in China, they were hoarding that PPE, making  it less available to local hospitals and doctors for the benefit of  their patients.   So it would be easy to see, now looking back with the benefit of  hindsight, that somebody said: Well, you knew or should have known you  didn't have adequate PPE to take care of your patients. As my dad  always liked to say--he said: Hindsight is 20/20.   That is just one example. These groups who wrote to the Democratic  leader said that these physicians and other healthcare professionals  are now facing the threat of years of costly litigation due to the  extraordinary circumstances. And these are the same institutions, the  doctors and the hospitals, that we have sent hundreds of billions of  dollars to, and now we want to throw them to the wolves? We can't allow  our healthcare heroes to wake up in this pandemic only to find  themselves facing a legal nightmare.   But as I have said, it is not just healthcare workers who need our  help. The list of organizations and institutions that rely on this  legislation is a long one. There are, for example, our public schools,  our colleges, our universities, which have tried to adapt in trying  circumstances and are trying to allow our K-12 students and our young  people who attend our colleges and universities an opportunity to  continue their education safely, to the best of their ability.   A number of national groups representing education leaders, including  superintendents, school boards, and other leaders, sent a letter to  Senator Schumer and other congressional leaders about the urgent need  for these protections. They said: ``We believe any protections should  be limited in scope and preserve recourse for those harmed by truly bad  actors who engage in egregious misconduct.'' And I agree with that.  That is exactly the type of protection we have proposed.   I am looking at a letter--it is dated May 28, 2020--from the American  Council on Education which I think does a pretty good job of summing of  what I just described, the challenges that our educators and our  students and our administrators are facing trying to get back to some  semblance of normalcy, because we all understand the importance of  providing our next generation of leaders with a good education.   In this letter from ACE, the American Council on Education, Ted  Mitchell, its president, writes:         Unfortunately, all colleges and universities, two- and       four-year, public and private nonprofit, are facing       unprecedented challenges as a result of the COVID-19       pandemic. The impact on the operations and revenues of many       institutions has been catastrophic, for some even       existential, which has had a terrible ripple effect in       communities large and small. The pandemic is also causing       massive disruption to students and families. Many are       grappling with sudden changes to their financial       circumstances.        In the wake of prior crises, Congress came together to pass       timely and targeted liability protections with strong       bipartisan support because lawmakers understood the acute       economic threat of lawsuits at moments of maximum economic       vulnerability. While Congress has acted to provide some       limited COVID-related liability protections for volunteer       healthcare providers and some manufacturers of PPE in the       CARES Act, much more needs to be done. While some governors       and state legislatures have enacted COVID-19 liability       limitations, this is a national problem requiring a national       solution.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  this letter following my remarks   The president and executive director of the American Dental  Association wrote a letter thanking the Judiciary Committee for  reviewing liability protections and asking Congress to pass these  reforms. Similar to the other comments that have been made by other  organizations, they said: ``While safeguarding their patients, their  staff, and themselves from the spread of COVID-19, dental practices  must also safeguard their businesses from bad-faith actors pursuing  frivolous financial gain for coronavirus injuries.''   We have heard from a long list of groups, and it is not the Fortune  500, like the Democratic leader has proposed. This isn't corporate  protection. This is common sense. This is what we have done before--in  connection with  [[Page S7441]]  Y2K, in connection with 9/11, in connection with providing some limited  liability protection to pharmaceutical companies that we depend upon to  produce vaccines that will save lives. Those are all examples where  Congress has come together with a national response to a national  crisis.   We have heard concerns from everything from the U.S. Youth Soccer  worried about their volunteers being sued, the American Heart  Association worried about their fundraisers, churches worried about  their ability to serve their communities with this cloud hanging over  their heads. So who is acting in bad faith here? Not the schools. Not  the charities. Not the healthcare providers who are calling for the  limited protections this legislation would provide. No, it is the trial  bar. It is the trial lawyers who are trying to use this pandemic to  make money.   I am not here, again, to disparage members of the legal profession. I  am just saying, who are we here going to bat for? Are we going to bat  for a small group of wealthy lawyers, or are we going to bat for 330  million Americans? That is the choice, it seems to me. And the  Democratic leader is carrying water for that wealthy elite minority,  the members of the trial bar, by mischaracterizing this effort and  blocking relief for his own constituents.   Again, Governor Cuomo apparently was able to do this by some form of  executive action, was able to provide some liability protections for  medical malpractice lawsuits in New York. I wonder if the Democratic  leader would come to the floor and call that corporate protection. No.  It made sense. Good for Governor Cuomo, and shame on us if we don't do  something similar.   I want to close on another ironic statement by the Democratic leader  this morning. He said: The American people deserve an outcome. I agree  with that. But he said: It is not going to happen if the Republican  majority insists on getting 100 percent of its partisan demands.   Well, we are not insisting on 100 percent, but how about the 80  percent we can agree on? That just makes sense to me. They are the ones  who are killing the COVID-19 relief bill by their insistence that no  liability protections be included in this bill. It is the Wild Wild  West, and they want to keep it just like that.   The Democratic leader has been the one who has held up negotiations  over the last several months. By my count, our Democratic leaders have  blocked at least three, maybe four pieces of COVID-19 relief. That was  at a time when they could have worked with us to make the bills better  and to provide timely relief to our constituents, but no--they refused  to accept anything short of a partisan, multitrillion-dollar bill that  passed the House earlier this year, that Nancy Pelosi knew would never  have a prayer of passing because it included such unrelated matters as  tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires in places like New York and  California and included diversity studies on the marijuana industry.  What in the heck does that have to do with COVID-19? They claimed that  anything less than that $3-trillion white elephant was unworkable, so  they gave our efforts the Heisman and allowed the distress from the  pandemic to go on for months and months and months while they blocked  every attempt to deliver relief to the American people.   Liability protections--commonsense liability protections for a  limited period of time, which are not designed to take over State tort  law on a permanent basis--we can agree on what the timeframe should be,  but liability protections will allow our most important and vulnerable  institutions and people to recover from this crisis, and I believe the  Democratic leader would be wise to acknowledge that and work with us  and get a result.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                  American Council on Education,                                                       May 28, 2020.      Re COVID-19 Limited Liability Protections.       Representative Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker of the House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Senator Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Representative Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Senator Chuck Schumer,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi, Minority Leader McCarthy, Leader       McConnell, and Minority Leader Schumer: On behalf of the       American Council on Education and the undersigned higher       education associations, I am writing today to urge you to       quickly enact temporary and targeted liability protections       related to the COVID-19 pandemic. While these crucial       protections are likely necessary for many sectors of the       American economy, this letter focuses on the need to       safeguard higher education institutions and systems,       affiliated nonprofits, and healthcare providers and       facilities from excessive and speculative lawsuits arising       out of the pandemic.        Encouraging, enabling, and supporting the safe reopening of       college and university campuses for in-person learning is       essential to educating our nation's future workforce,       preserving employment for millions, and helping restart       America's economy. As colleges and universities contemplate       whether and how to safely reopen this fall, their overriding       concern is keeping students, faculty, staff, and local       communities safe. These decisions are not premised on making       a trade-off between safety and the economy. Nor are       institutions of higher education seeking a free pass to avoid       responsibility, much less immunize themselves for their own       or others' bad acts.        But as colleges and universities assess how quickly and       completely campuses can resume full operations, they are       facing enormous uncertainty about COV1D-19-related standards       of care and corresponding fears of huge transactional costs       associated with defending against COVID-19 spread lawsuits,       even when they have done everything within their power to       keep students, employees, and visitors safe. To blunt the       chilling effect this will have on otherwise reasonable       decision-making leading to our nation's campuses resuming       operations in a safe and sensible manner, we ask that       Congress quickly enact temporary COVID-19-related liability       protections for higher education institutions and systems,       affiliated entities, as well as their faculty, staff and       volunteers. These protections should be conditioned on       following applicable public health standards, and they should       preserve recourse for those harmed by truly bad actors who       engage in egregious misconduct.        Colleges and universities, including their health care       facilities and research enterprises, are engaged in every       sector of critical infrastructure necessary to support       American communities. In addition to educating and training       our country's future workforce, they provide health services,       cultural resources, spectator sports venues, and recreational       amenities to their communities. Our medical schools, teaching       hospitals, and research labs are working around the clock to       find the best treatments and vaccines for COV1D-19. Moreover,       our higher education institutions maintain full service       utilities, telecommunications, and computing networks; they       provide housing and food services; and they operate       transportation networks, hotels, retail shops, daycares,       gyms, and museums. To support this broad array of activities,       they directly employ tens of thousands of skilled workers in       various trades, from electricians and linemen to plumbers and       HVAC technicians; from landscapers and painters to carpenters       and fabricators.        Unfortunately, all colleges and universities, two- and       four-year, public and private nonprofit, are facing       unprecedented challenges as a result of the COVID-19       pandemic. The impact on the operations and revenues of many       institutions has been catastrophic, for some even       existential, which has had a terrible ripple effect in       communities large and small. The pandemic is also causing       massive disruption to students and their families. Many are       grappling with sudden changes to their financial       circumstances.        In the wake of prior crises, Congress came together to pass       timely and targeted liability protections with strong       bipartisan support because lawmakers understood the acute       economic threat of lawsuits at moments of maximum economic       vulnerability. While Congress has acted to provide some       limited COVID-19-related liability protections for volunteer       healthcare providers and some manufacturers of PPE in the       CARES Act, much more must be done. While some governors and       state legislatures have enacted COVID-19 liability       limitations, this is a national problem requiring a national       solution.        Higher education's need for temporary and targeted       liability protections and relief is clear. Now is the time       for Congress to act.            Sincerely,                                                      Ted Mitchell,                                                         President.
