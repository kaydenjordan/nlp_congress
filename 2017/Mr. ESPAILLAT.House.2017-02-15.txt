 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.J.  Res. 67, which is yet another assault on working families.   Mr. Speaker, not only are my Republican colleagues launching a broad,  overreaching attack on increasing access to retirement savings  opportunities for our workers, but through H.J. Res. 67, they are  directly targeting my  [[Page H1220]]  home of New York City and the constituents of New York's 13th  Congressional District. Once again, without any regard to the  consequences of these reckless actions, Republicans are playing  politics with the lives and financial security of our citizens.   If passed, H.J. Res. 67 will nullify a Department of Labor rule, just  1 month after it went into effect, that supports the efforts of large  cities or counties, like New York City, in establishing retirement  savings plans for their residents.   This rule is narrowly applied to jurisdictions that are populous  enough to be their own State and whose States do not already have  provided statewide payroll deduction saving plans. This is to ensure  that the policy only goes into effect in cities where the people are in  real need.   In New York City alone, 1.5 million private sector workers--almost 60  percent of the private sector workers throughout the city--do not have  access to a retirement plan through their employer or business.                                time  1545    This rule gives New York City the ability to expand access for  private sector workers to retirement savings plans. Rolling back this  rule rips the opportunity to save for retirement out of the hands of  millions of people.   Mr. Speaker, rushing to overturn this innovative rule without  offering a single constructive alternative is irresponsible. This is  just another example of Republicans attempting to hastily undo  provisions that have helped people in real need without even providing  a replacement plan to ensure working families have financial security  after their retirement.   To make matters worse, using the Congressional Review Act to roll  back this rule will prevent the Department of Labor from reissuing any  substantially similar rule in the future. This is all on top of last  year's Congress' abuse of the CRA in an attempt to nullify the  fiduciary rule, which ensured that the advice workers receive is in  their best interest.   This only further solidifies that House Republicans are not  interested in helping workers. Instead, they are interested in  deconstructing rules that protect our workers. House Republicans have  failed to pass comprehensive and potentially bipartisan legislation to  address our Nation's retirement security crisis and, instead, are  pushing partisan legislation that is harmful to our Nation's workers.
