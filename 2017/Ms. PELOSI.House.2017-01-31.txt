 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up Congresswoman  Lofgren's H.R. 724, which would rescind President Trump's refugee ban  on individuals, like the 30-year-old Iranian citizen who entered the  U.S. to visit his family in San Francisco, then was detained and  transferred to county jail.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair would advise that all time has  been yielded for the purpose of debate only.   Does the gentleman from Washington yield for the purpose of this  unanimous consent request?
