 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of  Quincy Ramon Nelson-Sweatt of Rineyville, KY, who passed away Friday,  September 2, 2022, at his home, surrounded by his closest family and  covered in love.   Quincy was born 9 years ago today, on February 1, 2014, to Timothy  Sweatt and Natalie Nelson in Elizabethtown, KY. He was a student at  Rineyville Elementary School, where he was in the third grade. He chose  to be extraordinarily positive in the midst of the most challenging  time, bravely facing diffuse midline glioma, a terminal cancer of the  brain and spinal cord.   He never lost his sweet smile that could put anyone at ease--or the  way his copper-brown eyes could light up the whole room. He always took  such pride in his appearance. From his haircuts and sun-kissed curls to  his outfits, he always loved to look his best. Quincy was truly  beautiful both inside and out.   Before the date of diagnosis, November 11, 2021, he was a perfectly  healthy, active, fun-loving little boy. Within 10 months, he underwent  emergency surgery to try to remove the tumor, which was unsuccessful  and left him a quadriplegic; he also had 55 rounds of radiation to his  brain and spinal cord, along with trying multiple chemotherapy drugs.   He endured the toughest days with grace and positivity that was  unmatched. He exhibited such joy, which was undeniably shared with  anyone in his presence. Whether he was singing and dancing to his  favorite songs or snuggling with his mama or his cats, Sprinkles and  Peaches, he knew how to savor the time he had.   His love for life is indescribable. His list of loves was long and as  big as his heart. He loved cars, trampoline jumping, singing to his  jams, dancing, playing with his cousins that were like siblings,  farming, running outside, and time with his family and friends. His  favorite hobbies were singing and listening to music, baseball, go-cart  riding, swimming, and playing outside. He was passionate about it all.   Quincy was an empathetic and intuitive old soul that made everyone  around him feel special and loved. If you ever need inspiration,  meditate for just a minute on his life and the love he shared and  choose to live with love.   Quincy was preceded in death by his paternal grandmother Gwendolyn  Sweatt. Quincy is survived by his parents, Timothy Sweatt and Natalie  Nelson; paternal grandparent, Timothy Buckler; maternal grandparents,  Byron and Mary Nelson; aunt and uncles on his father's side, Frederick  Sweatt, Freda Sweatt, and Stephen Buckler; on his mother's side aunt  and uncles Erin Riffle (Jason) and Clint Nelson; his cousins on his  mother's side Ava, Caleb, Hudson, and Charlotte Riffle; and his cousins  on his father's side Dallas, Rashaud, and Nia Sweatt.   Quincy will live in the hearts of his family and will be missed more  than words could ever describe. Happy Birthday, Quincy.                            ____________________
