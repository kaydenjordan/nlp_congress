 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, not far from here, on the slopes of Capitol Hill, is a  small, serene, and unassuming memorial. On its walls are names not now  known to too many Americans but indelibly etched in a dark chapter of  our national story.   Tule Lake, Poston, Manzanar--these are the internment camps where  120,000 ethnic Japanese, most of them American citizens, were locked up  in the hysteria of the Second World War just because they were  Japanese.   This amendment, proudly sponsored by many of my colleagues in our  Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, including our chair, the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Judy Chu), asked us a question that  must be asked: Are we repeating history or in danger of doing so?                                time  2015    In these recent years of justifiably heightened scrutiny on the  intelligence activities of the People's Republic of China, a  disproportionate number of Americans of Chinese descent have been  investigated and prosecuted for espionage.   Those convicted have received disproportionately high sentences, and  the too many exonerated have had their careers ruined nonetheless.   No doubt, China seeks to recruit Chinese Americans to its goals, and  no doubt, our government should and must review specific cases of  potential espionage by China on specific facts. But have we fallen into  the same trap all over again of justifying investigations and other  actions toward the ends of national security by means of general  profiling and targeting based solely on ethnic identity?   The Committee of 100, a group of prominent Chinese Americans in  diverse fields, reviewed the empirical evidence and concluded that  ``Asian Americans, whether immigrant or native-born, may be facing  unfair and increasing racial prejudice in this era of geopolitical  competition.''   It stated, and I believe correctly: ``A definite line can be drawn  between appropriate prosecution that is based on actual evidence and  free of bias and overreaching persecution that is triggered by  unfounded suspicions and tainted by racial prejudice. All Americans,  regardless of ethnicity, depend on that line.''   This resolution is a flashing red light to our intelligence  community: Stop, look, and listen. Take some time to think it through  to be sure you are staying on the right side of that line, and then  report back to us here in Congress that you have done so and have the  procedures and mindset in place to ensure that we won't repeat history  with Chinese Americans or any other broad ethnic or interest group.   Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Schiff), the committee chair.    Madam Chair, I strongly urge adoption of this amendment. It  is the right amendment. We certainly want our intelligence community to  do its job, but we also want them to be very conscious of the decisions  that they are making and are in line with our basic civil liberties.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
