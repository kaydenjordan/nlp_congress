 Mr. Speaker, let's look at the historic timeline. The  Reagan administration and other administrations have failed in the past  to veto anti-Israel resolutions, and that failure has not been helpful  to the cause of peace. Over the last two decades, Israel has frozen or  removed settlements in an effort to negotiate peace, all to no avail.   On November 29 of last year, this House unanimously urged our U.N.  Ambassador to veto any U.N. resolution that sought to impose peace  settlement terms. But a month later, our U.N. Ambassador ignored the  input of this House and allowed the U.N. to adopt a one-sided  resolution that sought to impose peace terms on the parties.   Worse yet, that U.N. resolution equates the Western Wall, Judaism's  holiest site, with outposts deep in the West Bank that are illegal  under Israeli law.   Today we consider a House resolution that has over 30 Democratic  cosponsors. It is not a pro-settlements resolution. It strongly and  repeatedly reaffirms our support for a two-state solution, achieved  through direct negotiations, and it objects to a U.N. resolution that  set back the cause of peace. Vote ``yes.''
