 Mr. Speaker, more than one million students started  2022 with closed schools: another year of disrupted learning.   In Chicago, more than 300,000 kids spent 4 days locked out of their  classrooms. This is the same Chicago that received nearly $2 billion  from the Democrats' so-called COVID relief bill to keep schools open.   We have an education and a mental health crisis on our hands. Every  student who is trapped behind a screen knows it. Every mom and dad who  is anxious about another year of last-minute closures know it. Even  Democrat mayors and voters know it.   And yet, President Biden said yesterday, America is on the ``right  track'' with regard to the pandemic.   Mr. President, in what world is this considered the right track?   Disrupted learning means we are leaving behind a generation of  struggling students. It might be the single most destructive policy  imposed on our children this century. The negative consequences can  last a lifetime.   The only question we have now is, how do we save our kids from more  disruption to their education in the days and weeks to come?   The President of the United States could have gone to Chicago or any  of the 5,400 schools that started off this year closed to send a clear  signal that kids belong in the classroom.   Instead, he was in Atlanta yesterday delivering a speech that was so  self-serving and out-of-touch that even Stacey Abrams kept her  distance.   But I have a simple principle that every parent knows well: Our kids'  education is not dispensable. Their futures are not dispensable. I  believe that as a parent, as a lawmaker, and as an American citizen,  and I know every House Republican believes it, too.   We must be a society that pushes to do the best we can for the next  generation, a society that finally achieves the goal of allowing every  kid in every neighborhood to go to the school that their parents  believe is best for them.   House Republicans will work to make sure our children are the  national priority they should be, even if this administration and House  Democrats won't.                            ____________________
