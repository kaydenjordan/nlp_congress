 Mr. Speaker, I am here this evening to  emphasize the importance of reforming our Nation's policies concerning  cannabis. This issue has grown to be increasingly bipartisan over the  years, yet some in this administration have largely ignored the rising  public support for legal, State-regulated cannabis.                                time  2030    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Gaetz), a  distinguished colleague from the panhandle.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  leadership, his honesty, and his sincerity on this issue, and I am  proud to say that I have cosponsored this legislation.   Now I will yield to one of the original cosponsors of Mr. Gaetz's  legislation and one of the great leaders in this institution on this  issue for many years, the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer), who  has been educating colleagues and the American public on  [[Page H3502]]  cannabis. Tonight, I am pleased to be joined by him here on the floor  and to yield to him.    Mr. Speaker, I truly admire and appreciate my  colleague. He is a man of principle, but he is also someone who is  always at the table trying to find common ground, trying to see how  this institution can work better, how we can all work together for  commonsense solutions, for what, in this case, so many Americans are  asking of this institution: to allow each State to come up with its own  laws, its own regulations for this industry.   So I thank my colleague very much for spending a little time with us  here this evening and also for all of his work over many years,  because, as he said, many in this institution are coming around on both  sides of the aisle. But it is Mr. Blumenauer who, for a long time, led  these efforts, and it was always an issue of consensus, the way it is  today. So thank you very much to my distinguished colleague.   Mr. Speaker, nine States and the District of Columbia have legalized  the recreational use of marijuana, and medical marijuana is legal in an  additional 29 States, including my home State of Florida. Over 70  percent of Florida voters supported legalizing the use of medical  marijuana in the 2016 elections, including 80.3 percent and 68.3  percent in the two counties I represent, Monroe and Miami-Dade,  respectively.   As a matter of fact, the President was in Monroe County Thursday, and  many people greeted him in the streets. Many of those were supporters,  considering 80 percent support in that district of this issue.   On Friday of last week, a report published by the Florida Department  of Health indicated the State's medical marijuana patient registry has  risen to 100,576 people, a dramatic increase from the 23,350 patients  registered in June of 2017. This milestone also happens to coincide  with the opening of Miami Beach's first medical marijuana dispensary,  Surterra Wellness.  [[Page H3503]]    Despite overwhelming support from the public and medical community,  however, legitimate businesses such as Surterra face financial and  legal uncertainty because of a witch hunt opened up by Attorney General  Sessions last year. To make matters worse, he is now hamstringing  scientific research to analyze the medical applications of cannabis.    I, along with my colleagues from both sides of the aisle, have taken  a multipronged approach to improving our country's irresponsible and  ill-advised laws on cannabis. Congressman Blumenauer and I are  addressing the industry's significantly disproportionate tax burden  through the Small Business Tax Equity Act, legislation which provides  tax parity to marijuana businesses operating in compliance with State  law.   I am also working with the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Garrett) to  urge the Department of Justice to order the Drug Enforcement  Administration to immediately approve additional registrations for the  bulk manufacture of cannabis for exclusively federally-approved  research purposes.   Compliant manufacturers are attempting to provide State and Federal  Governments and medical professionals with fact-based research on  cannabis' effects, both adverse and therapeutic, but their applications  to do so aren't being assessed. It is difficult for me to comprehend  the logic behind blocking scientific research to analyze the medical  applications of cannabis because I believe it is critical for  policymakers to possess objective data on the effectiveness of cannabis  as an alternative treatment for anxiety, depression, pain, psychosis,  post-traumatic stress disorder, opioid addiction, and epilepsy. We owe  it to American patients to open up the field of research on this.   Now, the only logical explanation I can think of is that the Attorney  General knows the facts of this field of research won't support his  policies or the witch hunt he and his Department have been conducting  on legal State-regulated operators across the country.   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, drug  overdoses claimed nearly 68,000 lives throughout the United States in  2017 alone, with over 45,000 of those as a result of opioids, legal  drugs.   An aptly timed article was published this morning by CNN Chief  Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta in which he details the results of  his investigation into the benefits of cannabis over the course of a 5- year study.                                time  2045    Though admittedly skeptical at first, after dedicating countless  hours with both patients and scientists scattered throughout the globe,  Dr. Gupta began to view the plant in a different light: as a source for  healing instead of a gateway for substance abuse.   At the conclusion of Dr. Gupta's in-depth examination, he came to the  deduction that ``not only can cannabis work for a variety of conditions  such as epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, and pain; sometimes, it is the  only thing that works.'' Referenced in this article is an analysis  conducted by researchers from the RAND Corporation, and supported by  the National Institute on Drug Abuse, which showed an approximated 20  percent decline in opioid overdose deaths between 1999 and 2010 in  States with legalized medical marijuana and functioning dispensaries.   Mr. Speaker, this analysis is similar to countless others I have  heard that prove cannabis can quell both the disease of addiction and  the pains associated with it. Now, some may view this investigation and  others as if they are anecdotal, and to them I say, ``Let's find out.''  Let's stop hamstringing Federal research of the issue and let's let the  facts speak for themselves.   As I have said before in this Chamber, Mr. Speaker, the best ally  that illegal operators like drug cartels and drug traffickers--who do  not pay taxes, who target children, who have no safety standards for  their products--the best ally they have are the policies that the  Attorney General has embraced. Because by continuing to hamstring  Federal research, over tax, and stoke uncertainty, legally operating  businesses that are State regulated, that pay taxes, that are helping  patients who are suffering, can no longer compete. And when these  businesses can no longer compete, people turn to the black market.   So inadvertently, I hope, the Attorney General is actually doing a  great favor to the criminals operating outside the law by punishing  law-abiding Americans trying to control the substance and make it  safer.   So I am here today to, once again, call upon this administration to  not just allow, but encourage, meaningful reform on our Nation's  cannabis policies. On this issue, we have an opportunity to reinforce  the 10th Amendment and ensure the Federal Government does not overstep  its boundaries and supersede the will of the States. On this issue, we  have an opportunity to afford businesses selling legal products the  chance to contribute to our economy and create jobs, while  simultaneously crippling the criminal enterprises empowered by and  prospering under the Attorney General's policies. And perhaps most  importantly, we have an opportunity to change--and possibly even save-- the lives of Americans suffering from opioid addiction and other  diseases and conditions.   Mr. Speaker, there are a lot of colleagues in this Chamber who say  people should be able to buy whatever health insurance or get whatever  kind of health coverage they want, and the government should interfere  as little as possible, and I agree. But on this issue, there seems to  be a hypocrisy, and many colleagues want to impose a Federal view or a  Federal perspective on States, on the people of States like Florida,  who have already decided explicitly and clearly and overwhelmingly.   So I thank my colleagues who joined me here tonight, and I truly look  forward to the day where this institution can legislate in a way that  respects the people of Florida, respects the people of Oregon, respects  the people of Colorado, and American citizens in 36 States in the  union, who have spoken loud and clear.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
