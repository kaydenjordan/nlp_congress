 It is good to be back. Thank you for the inquiries about  my well-being.   To all my colleagues, I appreciate the good wishes and the phone  calls and the food.   I made it. I think the worst is behind me.   I want to reinforce a simple message: If you haven't been vaccinated  regarding the COVID problem, get vaccinated. I have been vaccinated,  and I got COVID anyway; a couple of really bad days, but I am doing  better and I feel on the mend. And I am confident that, if I hadn't had  the vaccine, it would have been a lot worse.   So in my State, about 50 percent of the people are still  unvaccinated. Just for your own good and the good of our State, I would  urge you to consider getting vaccinated. I think the vaccine is safe,  and it works. I am glad I had it. And the sooner we can get to herd  immunity through vaccinations and other means, the better off we will  be.   To all my colleagues and people back home, thank you for the kind  words and inquiries.   We are back at work, and I am glad I was able to make this debate. I  think this debate is worth having. We just passed a $1 trillion  infrastructure bill. The Presiding Officer, Senator Sinema, from  Arizona, was one of the architects of the bill.   Congratulations.   I voted for it because it made sense to me. We have been talking  about infrastructure here for 5 or 10 years. In this $1 trillion  package, 550 of new spending, which I believe will be paid for, goes  into ports, roads, and bridges, and rural broadband; and 19 Republicans  voted for it.   I am hoping we can make it reality and get it to President Biden's  desk because I think infrastructure is much-needed, and we were finding  bipartisanship in that space.   Now we are moving on to something completely different--I dare say  radical. Right after the majority was seized by the Democratic Party,  they pushed through a $1.9 trillion package that had a lot of talk  about COVID--but most of it wasn't related to COVID as we know it-- after we had worked together on $4 trillion of spending.   Now, this budget resolution is proposing $3\1/2\ trillion of  additional spending, and we will talk about how that affects you, the  public, here in a minute. But the first thing I want you to know is it  is not $3\1/2\ trillion. That is not accurate.   When you look at the increase in public debt and the authorization of  new discretionary spending, it is at least $4.2 trillion. So it is not  $3\1/2\ trillion; it is over $4 trillion. The first thing you have to  do is be honest with the product you are selling. This will cost well  over $4 trillion if fully implemented.   What else does this bill do that people in this body need to know  about?   It changes the rule regarding emergency spending. Right now, we can  spend, through an emergency, basically, unlimited money and not have to  worry about offsets and all that good stuff because there is truly an  emergency. But you need 60 votes to declare  [[Page S6206]]  something an emergency. This budget resolution will change that rule so  that a simple majority of Senators can determine anything they would  like to be an emergency and spend without any accountability.   I think that is a bad idea for the body because anything you can do,  we can do, and it really is an assault on the idea of minority rights.  I think it is the biggest blow to the institution yet. It is buried in  this bill, but it eliminates the 60-vote requirement to declare items  emergency spending, replace it with a simple majority, allowing a  majority--a single party--to spend without restriction in the name of  emergency.   So to my friends on the other side, you need to look at what is in  this bill, and I hope you will find that to be an unacceptable change  to the U.S. Senate because, when it comes to spending, it guts the idea  that the minority matters because all you have to do, if this budget  resolution is implemented the way they have written it, is to declare  something an emergency, get 50 votes, and spend. Very bad idea. We are  going to try to change that, and we are hoping we can find some  bipartisan support.   Let me tell you about this bill. I am going to ask some questions. On  the immigration side, Senator Sanders said that this bill creates  millions of new green cards for people here illegally.   So here is a question: If we told the world that in the budget  reconciliation we are going to increase millions of green cards for  people here illegally, do you think that would entice more people to  come here illegally?   Here is what I think. I think that is the dumbest idea I could think  of. In the middle of an invasion of this country by illegal immigrants,  the Democratic Party, through budget reconciliation, is going to  authorize millions of new green cards for people here illegally. It is  in your document. Senator Sanders admitted that.   Here is what is happening as I speak: These statements are being  translated into Spanish and every other language, and human traffickers  all over the world are going to let the word get out that, Hey, the  Senate is about to increase the number of green cards available for  illegal immigrants; why don't you go and get in line?   Nobody has asked the Border Patrol: How do you think this would  affect our illegal immigration problem?   Have you spent 15 minutes talking to anybody at the border about what  this policy change would do to a broken immigration system?   I guarantee you haven't, because if you talked to anybody with common  sense on the border, they would tell you the last thing you need to do  right now is incentivize more illegal immigration by allocating green  cards to people who are here already illegally   What has happened in the last 6 months?   A 262-percent increase compared to last year.   Does any Democrat have any idea what is happening here? Have any of  you come to the floor to explain to the American people what the hell  is going on at the border?   You don't have a clue; you don't care.   The same people who are writing this budget resolution to spend $4  trillion on liberal wish lists are the same people in charge of the  border. They haven't asked one Border Patrol professional the effect of  this bill on a broken immigration system.   We have had 1.2 million people come to the country illegally already.  Let's compare that to last year--a 262-percent increase.   Illegal crossings by unaccompanied minors have surged 186 percent  compared to last year. Why? The Biden administration has kept the COVID  deportation title 42 law in place, but it has made exception by  unaccompanied minors. If you are a certain age, you can stay. Guess  what. The human traffickers have found that out, and word is out all  over the Northern Triangle countries--but, really, the world.   And we have had a 186-percent increase in unaccompanied minors  because of policy changes made by the Biden administration. Twenty- seven percent of unaccompanied minors recently deported tested positive  for COVID-19.   How many of the unaccompanied minors have been released into the  country? Of the 1.2 million people who have come here illegally: How  many of them have been released? How many have them been tested? How  many are positive for COVID?   Nobody knows these numbers because nobody seems to have a clue of  what to do about it.   So what are the trends?   Look at this chart. Look at 2020 compared to `18, `19, and `20--an  explosion of illegal immigrants, 1.2 million, almost. Year to date, in  2020, we had 458,000. A 260-percent increase in illegal crossings at  the border because the Biden administration did away with the ``Remain  in Mexico'' policy.   So asylum claims went through the roof. We are allowing unaccompanied  children to stay as an exception to title 42, along with families. And  guess what. You have an explosion of illegal immigrant crossings in  this country.   If you pass this budget resolution the way Senator Sanders described,  you are going to throw jet fuel on this. This number will go through  the friggin' roof.   Every human trafficker in the world is going to get the word out  throughout the world that they are increasing the number of green cards  made available to illegal immigrants to America: Come now, the time is  right.   What a dangerous idea, but it is part of this grand, new vision for  America. Let me tell you about this vision for America: open borders;  dropping people by the thousands off into the interior of the United  States, not adequately tested; enticing young people to take a very  dangerous journey; destroying all of the gains we had; stopping a wall  that was almost built. That is the vision being created by the budget  resolution and then some.   The idea of increasing green cards for illegal immigrants already  here will make these numbers explode beyond what they already exploded.  Only God knows.   Has anyone told you the price at the pump? Has anybody mentioned to  you on the other side what is the cost of this bill when we implement  change reforms to you as a consumer?   Senator Markey, who is a very passionate believer in climate change,  said the Green New Deal is part of the DNA of this bill.   Senator Sanders is an avowed socialist, one of the most honest people  in this building. Senator Sanders' vision for the last 20 and 30 years  is in this budget resolution. This budget resolution is a dream for  those who want to socialize America; it is a nightmare for working  people.   How much have gas prices gone up in the last 6 months?   A dollar.   Here is what I think: If you implement the provisions of this budget  resolution regarding climate change, you are declaring war on the  internal combustion engine; you are going to shut out coal-fired plants  in rural America.   The question I have for my Democratic colleagues: How much will gas  prices go up if this bill becomes reality? How much will your heating  bill go up because you shut down supply? How has there been an increase  of a dollar at the pump? Policy matters.   I dare say that, if this bill is ever implemented, you are going to  double gas prices.   I hope you are listening out there, America. If they implement this  radical transformation of our energy economy, you are going to have a  dramatic increase of gas prices and heating prices.   This is the worst thought-out idea I have ever seen. They are just  throwing every liberal idea and hope it sticks to the wall, and their  whole reason for being on the left is in this bill.   There is a border-adjusted carbon tax proposal floating around out  there. What does that mean to you? What the hell is a border-adjusted  carbon tax?   The best I can understand is it is going to be a tax on products  coming into the country because the way the product was made is not  sufficiently green enough. So they are going to charge for that  product, put a tax on it at the border. Guess what. That is going to  increase the cost of whatever good we are talking about.   And where do you think that cost goes?   It goes to you.   This is the most inflationary idea I have ever seen. We have had 5.4- percent increase in inflation recently, wiping out all the gains in the  economy.  [[Page S6207]]    How could that be?   You are spending money like drunken sailors. And if this bill ever  becomes law, if it is ever implemented and there is a border-adjusted  carbon tax, it is going to be passed onto the consumer.   If you are on a fixed income, this whole idea is a nightmare for you  because your gas prices are going to go up, your heating bill is going  to go up, and all of the things that they are going to make for free  will create an inflationary effect.   The size of the government is going to increase dramatically.  Interest rates will have to go up. So if you own a home, you drive a  car, you breathe air, get ready for more taxes and more spending.   All I can say is that I believe in climate change, and I would like  to have a rational approach to solving the problem. But this is not  rational; this is partisan. And this $4.2 trillion bill--it is not  three and a half--is going to lead a wave of illegal immigration, the  likes of which you have never seen before; a 262-percent increase in  the last 6 months. If this bill, this idea, ever becomes reality, you  can double that. If this bill ever becomes reality, a dollar increase  in gas prices is going to be the good old days.    If they shut down all the coal-fired plants without any way to  replace them, other than a bunch of BS, good luck with the heating  bill.   They are going to change your country. It is going to be more like  Venezuela and less like America.   This idea that it is going to be paid for by taxing the rich is a  bunch of BS. If you took the entire wealth of the 1 percent, including  their cars and their dogs, it is less than half of what we need to deal  with the entitlement problems we already have.   And you are growing exponentially the size of government--more  government to pay for. Eventually interest rates are going to have to  go up.   You are putting in motion, I think, the demise of America as we know  it. You are putting in motion a government that nobody's grandchild  could ever afford to pay. You are putting in motion the destruction of  energy independence. You have declared war on the fossil fuel industry  in this country, and you have not done a damn thing about China, India,  Russia, or Iran.   The bottom line here is, if you believe in energy independence, then  you need to vote against this budget resolution because we will lose  it. If you believe that inflation is the death blow to the middle  class, you need to vote against this budget resolution. If you don't  know how much gas prices are going to be increased, they owe you an  answer.   So I am going to ask this question for the next 15 hours: Do you have  any idea, if all this becomes reality, how much increase at the pump  will be affected by the average consumer the next year? How much will  our heating bills go up? As to the border-adjusted carbon tax, will it  be inflationary? Where does the money go from the tax? Who gets it?  Little details like this.   All I can say is that everybody has a dream in America. There is the  American dream and the American socialist dream for America. This  budget resolution sets in motion an assault on free enterprise, the  destruction of energy independence, incentivizing illegal immigration  at a time we can afford it the least.   If you don't believe these things, then you haven't read what is in  this blueprint. Have you ever asked yourself the question: What the  hell has happened in the last 6 months; why are we up $1 a gallon at  the pump? Because they declared a war on fossil fuels made in America.   Why do we have a 262-percent increase in illegal immigration? Because  they changed all the policies that worked at the border.   Why is inflation rising? Because the fiscal policies of the Biden  administration and our friends on the left are driving up prices.   The worst is yet to come. If this budget resolution becomes a  reality, God help the American middle class. We will be less energy  independent. Our money will go not nearly as far.   You are going to have to automatically raise taxes if you intend to  pay for this monstrosity. And some Democrats say it has to be paid for.  There is no way in hell to pay for this bill unless you fundamentally  raise taxes across the board--at a time when we are struggling to get  back on our feet.   This is why we have elections. In 2022, this idea will be on the  ballot. My goal and my Republican colleagues' is to fight like hell to  stop the increase at the pump, stop the increase of the heating bills,  and to stop an invasion in our country by illegal immigrants all driven  by bad policy choices.   But everything they have done in the last 6 months pales in  comparison with what they are going to do to this country if this  budget resolution ever becomes a reality.   Yes, sir, we are going to have one hell of a fight. I don't know how  long we are going to be here, but as long as it takes. America is worth  fighting for. And America, we know, is at risk with this budget  resolution.   Thank you.    I yield the remaining Republican time on the resolution.    Mr. President, I want to say a quick thank you to my  Budget Committee staff who have worked very hard over the past couple  of weeks. They worked late nights, crunched the numbers, provided  support to Republican offices on amendment drafting and more.   Starting with our support staff, who help both sides of the aisle on  committee: chief clerk Katie Smith, staff assistants Ben Mason and  Maeve Poulson, and computer systems administrator George Woodall.   Our senior staff, who manage an excellent team and keep everyone on  track: staff director Nick Myers, who worked up until the buzzer, but  couldn't be here for vote-arama as he and his wife, Christine, welcomed  their first child.   Deputy staff director and chief counsel Joe Keeley, deputy staff  director Matt Giroux, and budget policy director Becky Cole.   Executive assistant Katherine Rossi is an invaluable member of our  team and helps to keep our team organized and operating at our best.   Our team of analysts who dig into the numbers of the budget  resolution and interpret what it means for the country, they also do  important work coordinating with other offices on amendments:   Professional Staff Members: Kevin Dawson, Chris Devine, Derek Gondek,  Chad Miller, Alyssa Palisi, and John Stout; along with economist Eric  Hartman, senior policy adviser Walker Truluck, and general counsel  Krisann Pearce.   Our director of coalitions and outreach Blair Bjellos did an  excellent job communicating with outside groups and stakeholders to  keep them informed and involved throughout the process. She also makes  sure Republican Senate offices are plugged in on amendment order and  details during vote-arama.   My committee communications team, communications director Taylor  Reidy and senior communications adviser Joe Brenckle help to translate  [[Page S6250]]  the sometimes not-so-exciting budget materials into content that is  easier to digest and understand.   And finally, our intern Eleanor Clark was a great help to all our  staff during this time as well.                            ____________________
