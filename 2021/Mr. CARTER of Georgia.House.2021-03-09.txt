 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize an  amazing public servant. The city clerk of Hinesville, Sarah Lumpkin, is  retiring after over three decades of service in local government.   Sarah began her career with the city of Hinesville when she joined  the city team as an accounts payable clerk and rose to the rank of  assistant city clerk by 1991.   Throughout her career, she accumulated a long list of awards and  accomplishments, including being named the first recipient of the  Hinesville City Hall Employee of the Year Award in 1994, and being  designated Certified Municipal Clerk by the International Institute of  Municipal Clerks in 1996.   She took her leadership skills to new heights when she served as  president of the Georgia Municipal Clerks and Finance Officers  Association of the State of Georgia from 2006 to 2007.   Sarah's guidance and expertise throughout her career paved the way  for tremendous growth and success for the city of Hinesville, and I am  very grateful for all she accomplished.   I wish her the best of luck as she begins her retirement.                      Congratulations to Britnee Kinard     Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate SD  Gunner Fund's Britnee Kinard for receiving the President's Lifetime  Achievement Award because of her outstanding service to fellow  Americans.   The AmeriCorps President's Lifetime Achievement Award is the highest  honor of the President's Volunteer Service Award and it recognizes  individuals, families, and groups who achieve a remarkable number of  service hours.   In receiving the lifetime achievement award, Britnee is being  recognized for her over 4,000 hours of service to ensure the  continuation of America's unrivaled commitment to improving countless  lives.   Britnee is the founder and president of SD Gunner Fund, which is an  incredible organization that assists veterans, exceptional children,  and first responders in receiving vital resources, such as service  dogs, therapy dogs, emergency assistance, community advocacy and  education, and much more.   She was inspired to start the successful SD Gunner Fund when she left  her high-profile career in business to become a full-time caregiver to  her husband after he suffered life-altering injuries while serving our  country in Operation Iraqi Freedom.   I want to thank Britnee for her selfless commitment to service  through SD Gunner Fund, and I wish her the best. I am extremely proud  to have Britnee here in the First Congressional District of Georgia.                           National Pharmacist Day     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize  National Pharmacist Day, which takes place in January annually to  recognize and honor pharmacists across the Nation.   As a pharmacist myself, I thoroughly understand the role each  pharmacist plays as an integrated member of the healthcare team. Every  day, pharmacists are directly involved in patient care, and pharmacists  are the most accessible healthcare professionals in the country.  Ninety-five percent of Americans live within 5 miles of a pharmacy.   As we battle COVID-19, pharmacists should be recognized, as they are  on the front lines dispensing the vaccine. Because of their work, lives  will be saved. They have been vital resources throughout the COVID-19  pandemic, and they will continue to play an active role in combating  the virus.   I ask that you join me in recognizing all pharmacists by thanking  them for their work.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to call  up H.R. 682, the Reopen Schools Act, to get our kids out from behind  screens and back in the classroom.
