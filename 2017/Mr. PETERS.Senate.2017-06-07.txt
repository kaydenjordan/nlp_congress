 Mr. President, I rise to speak about legislation I am  introducing with my colleague from Michigan Senator Stabenow to  authorize funding for a new Soo Lock.   Since 1855, locks at the St. Mary's River have allowed ships to pass  between Lake Superior and Lake Huron. In modern times, this waterway  has allowed large freighters to move coal, iron ore, and agricultural  products throughout the Great Lakes. The Soo Locks are the most  important link in a critical supply chain that connects iron ore mines  in Minnesota and Michigan's Upper Peninsula with steel mills and  manufacturing facilities all across the country.   During World War II, Congress authorized funding for a new lock  because it was clear the country's ability to move iron ore to steel  plants in Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania was absolutely critical for  the war effort. It took less than 2 years to complete that project  after Congress authorized the funding in 1942.   President Roosevelt signed an Executive order establishing the  military district of Sault Saint Marie, and the Army stationed 10,000  troops there to defend the Soo Locks by land, air, and sea--so great  was the fear that a German attack would instantly cripple Allied  efforts to produce steel and weapons.   Today, there is only one Soo Lock--the Poe Lock--that is large enough  to accommodate modern freighters, especially the 1,000-foot-long  vessels that move millions of tons of iron ore each and every year.  Over 80 percent of the commodities that flow through the Soo Locks must  pass through the Poe Lock, and each one of those 1,000-foot freighters  carries the equivalent of 3,000 truckloads of commodities. It is not  possible to move that amount of iron ore in these 1,000-foot freighters  by rail or by road, and on top of that, the steel mills are only  equipped to handle the iron ore supply by water.   A study conducted by the Department of Homeland Security in 2015  confirmed that it is the Achilles' heel of our economy. Key findings  from the Department say: ``A disruption of the Poe Lock likely will  cause an almost complete shutdown of Great Lake steel production.''   The report goes on to say: ``A shutdown of Great Lakes steel  production likely will cause almost all North American appliances,  automobiles, construction equipment, farm equipment, mining equipment,  and railcar production to cease within weeks.''   Within weeks. The Homeland Security report estimates that 11 million  Americans would lose their jobs if this were to happen.   Consider the fact that the jobs of millions of American workers  depend on the ability of large ships to pass, as depicted, from here to  here on the St. Mary's Falls Canal. Currently, there is only one lock  that can accommodate this task. If this lock shuts down, steel plants  in Ohio and Indiana and Kentucky shut down. Auto plants in Texas,  Tennessee, California, and Michigan shut down. The American economy  shuts down. The losses would be felt throughout the United States,  wherever steel is used in the manufacturing process.   We are taking an unacceptable risk if we do not act swiftly to ensure  that there is a backup in the case of a lock failure. That is why I am  joining Senator Stabenow and members of the Michigan congressional  delegation from both parties to introduce a bill that would authorize  the funding for constructing another larger Poe-sized lock. The current  authorization for the project is far below projected cost estimates.  Our bill, which was introduced today, if enacted, will allow the Army  Corps to move directly into the design and construction phase. We do  not have a moment to lose.   Just last week, I traveled to the Soo Locks for a tour with members  of the Michigan congressional delegation, and we saw firsthand how the  dedicated men and women of the Army Corps are working to keep the locks  functioning. They go to work each and every day with a full  understanding of how the safety and security of the Nation rests with  their ability to maintain this critical infrastructure. It is a credit  to the skill of the Army Corps of Engineers that freighters have been  able to pass through the St. Mary's on their journeys around the Great  Lakes almost without interruption. But they are working with equipment  that has been maintained well beyond its life cycle and in some cases  beyond two life cycles. When I was there last week, I saw 100-year-old  water pumps still in use.   We cannot continue to rely on the infrastructure investments made by  our grandparents and great-grandparents. It is time to invest in our  country and the well-being of our economy for future generations and  pass the Soo Locks Modernization Act.                                  ______                                         By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Grassley, Mrs.          Feinstein, Mr. Corker, Mr. Brown, Mr. Heller, Mr. Wyden, Mr.          Rubio, Mr. Coons, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Burr, and Ms. Heitkamp):   S. 1311.
