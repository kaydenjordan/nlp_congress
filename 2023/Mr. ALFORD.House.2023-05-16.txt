 Mr. Speaker, I grew up on AM radio: listening to the  news; listening to Dr. Demento; the ``CBS Radio Mystery Theater,''  falling asleep at night in my bed while listening to that on the  weekends; and Rush Limbaugh, who not too long ago sat right up there in  that gallery recognized by President Trump. I even interned for the  late Larry King. I love AM radio.   I rise today to address an urgent concern that is impacting our  Nation's heartland and America in general: the decision by some car and  truck manufacturers to eliminate, do away with, AM radio from their  systems, including the F-150, the Ford F-150 that is made in Claycomo,  near Kansas City, not too far from my district.   You see, AM radio is an essential platform for conservative voices  like Pete Mundo and Chris Stigall and listeners who rely on the truth  that they hear from AM stations, like KCMO, KRMS, KMMO, KOKO, KDRO,  KWTO, and KSGF.   AM radio is the lifeblood of information for our farmers and ranchers  in particular, providing crucial updates on weather patterns, market  shifts, and agricultural news. It is also a vital platform for  emergency information. Under the Communications Act of 1934, AM radio  is there for a reason. It is there to operate in the public interest,  and that is exactly what it does.   Mr. Speaker, farmers are the backbone of our Nation's food security,  yet they operate in some of the most isolated regions, often lacking  access to modern high-speed internet or digital services.   Did you know, Mr. Speaker, that there are more than 4,000 AM radio  stations in the United States, with more than a third dedicated to  agricultural programming? That is one-third of the stations. That is a  big number.   This is not a dying medium, Mr. Speaker. It is a vibrant network that  connects diverse communities across our Nation. We must remind our car  manufacturers to consider the wider impact of their decisions.   Let's make sure that conservative voices are protected. Let's make  sure that emergency communications are protected, as well, for our  farmers and ranchers in particular. Let's make sure our rural  communities, our farmers and ranchers, the unsung heroes of our Nation,  remain connected, remain informed, and remain respected.   Mr. Speaker, in the 1980s, I remember when MTV first came on and the  little jingle, ``I want my MTV.''   Mr. Speaker, it is 2023, and I want my AM radio.                            ____________________
