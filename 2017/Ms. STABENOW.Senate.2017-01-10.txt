 Mr. President, let me first say to the distinguished  chairman of the Budget Committee that we look forward to seeing the  replacement as well because that is really the key right now. People  across the country are saying: Wait a minute. You are going to unravel  a system. You are going to repeal and take away the health care that I  have and the patient protections that I have, and we don't even know if  it will be better.   Why in the world would that be done if the new system wasn't going to  be better than the old system?   Right now we don't see anything. We see 6 years of repeals coming  from the House and Senate and no plans. We still don't see a plan, and  we have no idea. More importantly, there are millions of people with  insurance who are either getting patient protections or affordable care  they couldn't get before or have Medicare strengthened or Medicaid  support, and no one knows what will happen next. Doctors, nurses,  health care providers--no one knows what is going to happen next. I  think it is the most irresponsible approach to addressing one of the  basic needs for all of our families that we could ever have. So we know  that in the end, when you pull the thread, essentially, you unravel the  whole system. That, minimally, creates instability in the entire  economy. There is no plan being held up that would improve health care,  which we are all for. I am all for making the health care system more  affordable for families, strengthening health care. Let's do it.  Unravelling and creating chaos in the health care system--no. It makes  absolutely no sense, and we know that it is just going to make America  sick again.   I want to share a couple of stories. First, we hear from Mary of  Dundee, who owns a small business and has a 20-year-old daughter with a  preexisting condition. For her, coverage--but, also, what we call the  Patients' Bill of Rights--is absolutely critical. That is part of the  Affordable Care Act that affects everybody with insurance. Seventy-five  percent of Americans get their insurance through their employer. In the  past, they could get dropped if they got sick, if they had diabetes or  had a child with juvenile diabetes or had a heart condition or high  blood pressure. Women who were of childbearing years could be viewed as  having a preexisting condition. In the past, insurance companies had  total control to decide who got coverage, when they got dropped, what  would happen when you got sick and needed medical care. That changed  with a Patients' Bill of Rights in the Affordable Care Act. There are a  whole range of protections to make sure the insurance you pay for every  month actually provides the medical care when you need it for you and  your family.   Let's start with Mary's story. She wanted to express her concern  about repealing the Affordable Care Act, and I appreciate very much the  fact that she shared her story with me. She says:         My family and I have purchased our coverage through the       [ACA] marketplace for 2015, 2016, and 2017. This opportunity       has allowed us to become self-employed. . . .    They could open their own business. They weren't tied to their job  because of the need of health insurance. They now have opened their own  small business in Dundee, MI.         Prior to the ACA, I was working to provide coverage--    How many times have we heard that? I have heard that even in my own  extended family--       then I lost my full time status and as a part-time employee,       the hours I worked barely covered my portion of my employer       provided healthcare.        By enrolling for coverage through the marketplace, I was       able to pick the coverage needed for our family at an       affordable price . . . not knowing what the future held       becoming self employed. We have three daughters. Our oldest       has life threatening allergies and asthma. I did not need to       worry that we would be denied coverage due to preexisting       conditions.        As Congress proceeds to dismantle the ACA, I am concerned       for my oldest daughter who is in her sophomore year at the       University of Michigan-Dearborn. She is 20 years old. . . .       Will she continue to have coverage through our insurance       until she is 26 as the ACA provides? If not, what kind of       coverage will she be able to afford due to her preexisting       conditions? Why put more obstacles in the way of our young       adults?    That is a really good question, Mary. It makes no sense to do that.   She goes on to say:         The ACA, we're sure, has faults . . . and like everything,       could be improved, but to scrap it and not use it at least as       a ``seed'' to grow and improve is beyond my understanding. To       suggest that there is nothing to keep is absurd and 20-30       million Americans enrolled . . . agree with us.    I agree with you as well, Mary. Thank you for sharing your story.   The coverage in the Affordable Care Act and the strengthening of  Medicare and Medicaid are critical, as are the patient protections--the  Patient Bill of Rights that affects people who buy insurance now, who  finally got control  [[Page S187]]  back from insurance companies that made every single decision. Being  able to know that, if, in fact, you get sick or your child has a  serious health condition, they won't be denied care for the rest of  their lives, and also being able to have them on your insurance as they  start off in life--there are so many protections. The caps on  treatments and the number of treatments and services provided have been  eliminated. The Patients' Bill of Rights is absolutely critical.   I want to take just a moment to speak about another piece of this,  which relates to the Patients' Bill of Rights as it relates to women.  In the past, the majority of plans--about 70 percent of the insurance  plans in the private sector that a woman might try to choose and  purchase--wouldn't cover basic maternity care. I couldn't believe it  when I first heard that. Wait a minute. It wouldn't cover basic  maternity care? Now every plan has to cover basic maternity care. It  makes sense. No longer is just being a woman a preexisting condition.  That is part of the Patients' Bill of Rights.   The capacity to now get preventive care, a mammogram, cancer  screenings, and other types of preventive care is done without a copay.  So we want people to go and get that checkup and, if there is a  problem, to be able to tackle it early. That is most important because  it is better for the person, but it also means there will be less cost  to the health care system if you can catch something early. So the  Patients' Bill of Rights is really critical to that.   There is something else that is also in here that is appalling to me  and goes directly to the question of women's health care, and that is  the fact that this bill repeals Planned Parenthood services and,  basically, guts health care for women across Michigan and women across  the country. For 75 percent of the women who use a Planned Parenthood  clinic in Michigan, their visit will be the only health care they get  all year.   We have rural counties in northern Michigan where the only health  care clinics doing preventive care--cancer screenings, basic services,  OB/GYN visits--are the Planned Parenthood clinics. So many women across  Michigan will see their access to health care denied if this passes and  Planned Parenthood loses its funding. There were 71,000 patients, the  majority of them women, in Michigan in 2014, who received care--breast  exams, Pap smears, prenatal visits. Again, tying this all together, we  want to cover maternity care, but we also want healthy moms and healthy  babies, and that means prenatal care. We have communities in these  small towns, as well as in the big cities. But it affects small towns  and rural communities around Michigan, where women are going to be  denied services, and it is the only clinic that is there.   I want to share a story from Laurie in Jonesville about the  Affordable Care Act and her particular situation. She said:         I have had type I diabetes for 54 years and when I needed       to retire early at the age of 62 because of complications       related to diabetes, I looked at the ACA for health       insurance. . . . I couldn't afford COBRA.        I was able to buy health insurance at what I consider an       affordable price with a small copay for my medications, the       most expensive one being insulin at a retail price of $296 a       month. As you know, my preexisting conditions of type I       diabetes, heart disease and a visual impairment, both       complications of diabetes, would have been uninsurable       without the ACA. I would have been uninsurable.    That is without the Patients' Bill of Rights, which says she has a  right to be able to purchase health insurance.         In June of 2016 I was diagnosed with breast cancer, luckily       diagnosed at Stage 1 in a routine mammogram. Without the ACA       I wouldn't have been able to afford the mammogram or the       subsequent treatment without depleting our life savings. I       quickly reached my maximum out of pocket cost and while some       people would complain about having to pay that, not me! My       total bill so far is over $150,000. . . .    That is for her cancer treatment.   There is the combination here of repealing Planned Parenthood funding  for health clinics that allow someone like Laurie to go in and get a  mammogram rather than waiting until she has a level of breast cancer  that cannot be effectively treated or might otherwise cause loss of  life. She was able to catch this early because she was able to get a  screening--a mammogram--the kind of treatment that women in small towns  all over Michigan have the capacity to do now because of the reasonable  copays for care and partly because there is no copay for that mammogram  but also because they have a clinic available in their community where  they can get the care. All of this fits together--the access to  preventive care for women, the health care clinics that are available  around Michigan and around the country, and the Patients' Bill of  Rights, which says you have a right to care. This is not just about the  insurance company basing every decision on the fact that they want to  make more money rather than cover you. You have a right to make sure  that when you get sick, you don't get dropped, and, if you have breast  cancer or diabetes, you have a right to have access to affordable  health care.    So I would hope that our colleagues would join together, stop this  craziness of trying to repeal health reform and protections for every  single American, and, instead, sit down together and look at how we can  make it better.   Our Republican colleagues will find willing partners in making the  system more affordable and better, but we will continue to be the  strongest possible opponents of ripping the system apart and creating  chaos for American families.   I yield the floor.
