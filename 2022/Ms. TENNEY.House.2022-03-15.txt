 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember and celebrate  Vincent Augostini, who lost his life due to complications from  neurofibromatosis on January 27, 2022.   Vince, as his friends and family called him, was born in Johnson  City, New York, on September 7, 1979. He was the seventh child of his  mother, Dolores, and father, Louis.   Vince was a quintessential upstate New Yorker. He loved New York and  especially the southern tier, where he spent his entire life in his  cherished hometown of Johnson City, New York.   Vincent enjoyed all things New York, from our terrific sports teams  to our delicious and unique regional food choices. He loved rooting for  the New York Yankees and the New York Giants. He savored hearty chicken  spiedies, a Binghamton specialty, and enjoyed extra-crispy Buffalo  chicken wings.   When he was not watching the Yankees or the Giants, Vince was also a  huge fan of professional wrestling. However, few things brought him as  much joy as following the New York Yankees, and God loves Yankees fans.   Decked out in Yankees gear, with a large Yankees logo displayed  proudly on the back window of his van, Vince made several sacred trips  from Johnson City to the Bronx to watch his beloved Bronx Bombers play.   For his 34th birthday, Vince trekked to the Bronx to watch the  Yankees take on their biggest rivals, the Boston Red Sox. Before the  game, Vince had the special honor of being escorted onto the field at  Yankee Stadium, a high pride for him. He continued to attend every  Saturday home game at Yankee Stadium until his declining health made it  impossible for him to travel.   But the one thing Vince cherished most in the world was his devoted  and loving family. As the youngest of seven siblings, the Augostini  siblings were a source of mutual love, support, and inspiration to each  other.   From family reunions to holidays and birthdays, Vince spent countless  hours with his family, especially his mother, Dolores, with whom he  shared a special bond.   As Vince's health inevitably declined, Dolores devoted her life to  providing him with loving care. The relationship Vince and his mother  shared was the epitome of unconditional love.   Even when his health began to deteriorate rapidly, Vince was more  worried about his own mother than even about himself. In his final  moments on Earth, and as his family tearfully expressed emotional and  final good-byes, Vince mouthed the words to all of his brothers:  ``Please help Mom.''   Vince was selfless. His courage in the face of a difficult battle to  fight a lifelong and terribly debilitating disease is beyond inspiring.  Most importantly, despite all the pain he endured throughout his life,  Vince was unwavering in his compassion and care for all of those whom  he encountered.   Vince was forever grateful for the kindness of the Make-A-Wish  Foundation. Vince was the 500th kid chosen from the Make-A-Wish  Foundation of Central New York. In November 1997, Vince had the  amazing, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to bring his brothers and  father to Chicago to meet Bulls superstar, Michael Jordan, the greatest  of all time.   Vincent was truly generous at heart and wanted to make sure other  children got the same opportunity, which  [[Page H3719]]  is why he was a frequent donor to the Make-A-Wish Foundation of Central  New York as well as the Neurofibromatosis Foundation.   Vince spent most of his last 2 years at the Willow Point Nursing and  Rehabilitation Center. However, this did not stop him from doing what  he loved: watching sports, eating spiedies and chicken wings, and, of  course, loving his family and friends.   The Augostini family wishes to express their immense appreciation to  the staff at Willow Point for the loving care that was provided to  Vince through his final days on Earth. When the pandemic restrictions  prohibited visitors, the staff at Willow Point made extraordinary  efforts to ensure that Vince was treated as a family member and had  constant virtual access to his own family at home.   Sadly, Vince passed away on January 27, 2022, surrounded by his  loving family.   Although neurofibromatosis created many challenges for Vince, he  refused to let his disability affect his spirits or his passion for  life. He never let the disease define him.   Vince will always be remembered for his infectious smile, his  charming sense of humor, and his zest for life.   As President Abraham Lincoln said, in the end, it is not the years in  life that count; it is the life in your years. In the short 42 years of  his life, Vince made every single day count.   He lived every day with kindness and gratitude. Vince's perseverance  and tenaciousness were an inspiration to his family, friends, and all  of those who were lucky enough to know him.   I ask today that all of my colleagues join me in observing a moment  of silence to remember the incredible life of Vincent Augostini.   To the Augostini family, please know that we send our deepest  condolences and prayers. May Vincent rest in peace.                            ____________________
