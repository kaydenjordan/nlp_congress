 Mr. Speaker, this body just spent several weeks  considering a massive spending bill proposed by the Democrats. In my  case, as a member of the Ways and Means Committee, we went through a 4- day markup considering the bill and debating the bill, and I want to  just share some of my thoughts and takeaways.   The number one takeaway is that I just cannot comprehend how my  Democrat colleagues on this bill are thinking. In fact, I hope the  American people are paying attention because I have never seen such  divergent views about how to create prosperity for all Americans. I  have never seen such differing opinions about how to do it.   Now, I will give this to the Democrats: I believe they do want to see  the American people prosper. They want to help people. I know we as  Republicans want to do that, and I hope they grant us that same  courtesy of believing that. But this administration has already spent  trillions of dollars in the past 6 months, trillions of dollars, and  now, with this bill, they want to spend another $3\1/2\ trillion.   Democrats literally believe that Big Government is the answer. They  believe Big Government will solve these problems and will help  Americans prosper.   At the same time, they are disincentivizing work and advancing  policies that increase dependence on the Federal Government as if they  don't even understand that those who are working and businesses  creating jobs and prospering are the ones who are paying the taxes that  will pay for these programs. I just don't get it.   Republicans have a far different answer. We believe in the American  people. We believe in their creativity, their hard work, their  ingenuity. We believe in achieving the American Dream. I have lived  that American Dream.   I was born in an Old Order Amish family, number 10 of 12 children. My  father was first a farmer and then a roofer, raising 12 children on  that income. I was the first in my family to graduate from high school.  I paid for my own education. My parents required me to attend a private  Christian school.   I bought a small business when I was 17 years old, operating out of a  spare bedroom in my parents' home, and lived the American Dream. Over  25 years, I grew, with other family members, that company to be a  leader in the type of construction we were doing, creating jobs for  hundreds of Americans, family-sustaining jobs.   There are stories like that all across this body, all across the  district that I represent, all across the country. It is what we call  the American Dream, the idea that every generation can do better than  their parents' generation and their grandparents' generation before  them.   I think we have a choice in this body, and I think the choice is  clear. Will we allow the government to dictate every facet of American  life, or will we renew our trust in the American people and in their  freedom? That is a question that will determine how our kids and our  grandkids will be able to live and whether they have the same  opportunities that we had.   I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, whose side I am on. I am on the side of  the American people. We have already seen the damage done as a result  of these policies that the Democrats have implemented.   We are seeing inflation where the American people are paying more for  goods, and their paycheck is buying less than it did before. It is only  going to get worse if we continue going down this path. These programs  can only be paid for with more debt, printing money, or raising taxes  on hardworking Americans. It doesn't work.                                time  1115    Tell me a time in history when it has worked, when a country has  overdelivered, overspent, and overpromised.   Mr. Speaker, we have a choice in this body. Every American's desire  to achieve greatness is what has made our country the envy of the  world.   Let's reject these policies and let's put us on a path to allowing  every American the chance to achieve their own American Dream.                            ____________________
