 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Neal for  yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I support H.R. 6 as a step to the puzzle to address  substance abuse. However, I think we need to expand this bill in an  important way as it moves forward.   To prevent opioid addiction, we must address the social and emotional  harm caused by trauma that often underlies opiate use.   Research demonstrates that exposure to four or more adverse childhood  experiences, such as neglect, experiencing a parent battling addiction,  witnessing violence, or observing domestic violence, makes an  individual 10 times more likely to misuse illicit narcotics. These  drugs serve as a coping response to traumatic life experiences.   The Senate's bipartisan Opioid Crisis Response Act included  provisions from my Trauma-Informed Care Act with Senator Durbin to help  improve the Federal response to trauma to help prevent opioid abuse.  These provisions would expand the workforce capacity to help children  exposed to trauma, they would improve our understanding of trauma by  improving Federal data and best practices, and they would increase  services for children exposed to trauma to help these young people  heal.   Our efforts to prevent the opioid crisis will be insufficient unless  we address the role of trauma in it, which is why 28 organizations  supported my effort to amend H.R. 6 to focus on trauma--organizations  like the Child Welfare League of America, the Jewish Child and Family  Services, the National Association of Social Workers, Partners for Our  Children with the University of Washington, and the YMCA USA--but my  amendment was not made in order.   The science is clear that trauma has devastating effects on a child's  healthy development well into adulthood. When children experience  traumatic events, stress alters the developing brain, which harms them  physically and mentally.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record this outline of the research by  [[Page H5521]]  the Society for Research in Child Development documenting the harm  caused by trauma and parental separation.    [From the Society for Research in Child Development, June 20, 2018]   Statement of the Evidence--The Science Is Clear: Separating Families     Has Long-Term Damaging Psychological and Health Consequences for                    Children, Families, and Communities         After the United States Department of Justice announced the       ``Zero olerance Policy for Criminal Illegal Entry,''       Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE--an arm of the       Department of Homeland Security) separated approximately       2,000 children from their parents in April and May 2018 as       they approached the U.S. border. Children and parents were       placed in separate facilities as they were being processed       and were not told when or how they would be reunited. This       policy and its consequences have raised significant concerns       among researchers, child welfare advocates, policy makers,       and the public, given the overwhelming scientific evidence       that separation between children and parents, except in cases       where there is evidence of maltreatment, is harmful to the       development of children, families, and communities. Family       separations occurring in the presence of other stressors,       such as detention or natural disaster, only adds to their       negative effects.            Evidence on Harmful Effects of Parent-Child Separation         The evidence that family separation is harmful dates back       to studies on the effects of parent-child separations on       children's well-being during World War II. This research       documented far reaching effects of these separations into       adulthood, including increased risk for mental health       problems, poor social functioning, insecure attachment,       disrupted stress reactivity, and mortality (Pesonen &       Raikkonen, 2012; Rusby & Tasker, 2009; Mitrani, Santiste-ban,       & Muir, 2004). Other research similarly documents the harmful       effects of parental separation on child wellbeing in a       variety of other child populations including children in       Romanian orphanages (Zeanah, Nelson, Fox, et al., 2003),       children in foster care (Flannery, Beauchamp, & Fisher, 2017)       and children of incarcerated parents (Geller, Garfinkel,       Cooper & Mincy, 2009; Miller, 2006). More recent work has       documented the increased mental health risk faced by both       parents and children when they are separated in the       immigration process (Suarez-Orozco, Bang, & Kim., 2011; Rusch       & Reyes, 2013). Parent-child separation has long-term effects       on child well-being, even if there is subsequent       reunification. After being separated, reunited children can       experience difficulty with emotional attachment to their       parents, self-esteem, and physical and psychological health       (Smith, Lalonde, & Johnson, 2004; Gubernskaya & Debry, 2017).       For some children, time does not appear to fully heal these       psychological wounds (Shonkoff et al., 2012).         Parents Buffer Children from Adverse Effects of Toxic Stress         Parental separation is considered a toxic stressor, an       experience that engages strong and prolonged activation of       the body's stress-management system (Bridgman, 2014) The       physiological and psychological toll of early life stress,       including parental separation, changes how the body responds       to stress in the long term, disrupting higher-order cognitive       and affective processes as well as negatively altering brain       structures and functioning (Lupien, McEwen, Gunnar, & Heim,       2009; Pechtel & Pizzagalli, 2011; Kumar et al., 2014). Such       stressors put children at greater risk for a multitude of       health and psychological impairments, including anxiety,       depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, lower IQ,       obesity, immune system functioning, physical growth, cancer,       heart and lung disease, stroke, and morbidity (Granqvist,       Sroufe, Dozier, Hesse, & Steele, 2017, Heim & Nemeroff, 2001;       Mamam, Antornadis, & Morris, 2014; Pechtel & Pizza-galli,       2011; Shirtdiff, Coe, & Pollak, 2009; Taylor, 2010).        Children depend on their primary caretakers to successfully       navigate stressful and traumatic events. Children's       physiological responses to stress can be significantly       reduced by access to their primary caretaker (Hostinar,       Sullivan, & Gunnar, 2013). The separation of the family unit       under extreme conditions of stress worsens the psychological       and physiological ramifications of that stressor on children,       especially younger children (Masten & Narayan, 2012).       Conversely, ongoing contact with primary caregivers under       conditions of stress can protect against risk (Rodriguez &       Margolin, 2015).          Child-Separation from Parents Impacts Children at All Ages         Much of the research on family separation has focused on       the impacts on children early in development. However,       puberty is also an especially vulnerable time of rapid change       (Doom & Gunnar, 2013). Stressors during adolescence can have       lasting impacts--the effects of which may not become evident       until adulthood--(Humphreys, Gleason, Drury, et al., 2015;       Lupien, McEwen, Gunnar, & Heim, 2009). Further, the effects       of traumatic experiences are cumulative; children and       adolescents who have already faced previous adversity are       particularly susceptible to long term further negative       consequences (Brown, Anda, & Tiemeier, et al, 2009,       MacKenzie, Bosk, & Zeanah, 2017) Thus, the research shows       that across infancy, childhood, and adolescence, child-family       separations can be related to negative outcomes across the       lifespan.             Impact of Border Family Separations on U.S. Citizens         There is also evidence that family separations harm U S.       citizens whose family members experience border detention or       deportation. Parental separation increases the risk for these       U.S. children's mental health problems such as anxiety,       depression, behavior problems, and symptoms of post-traumatic       stress disorder (Allen, Cisneros, & Tellez, 2015; Rojas-      Flores, Clements, Hwang Koo, & London, 2017; Zayas, Aguilar-      Gaxiola, Yoon, & Rey, 2015). U.S. citizens of Latino descent       also report heightened worries and concerns for their       families and their communities as a result of changes in       implementation of immigration policies such as the Deferred       Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy (Roche, Vaquera,       White, & Rivera, 2018). Moreover, countries with supportive       integration policies are more likely to have child       populations with better overall health and mental health       indicators than those with less supportive approaches (Marks,       McKenna, & Garcia Coll, 2018). Thus, there is evidence that       policies about parental separations can negatively affect       American citizens.                      The Policy Implications are Clear         The scientific evidence is conclusive. Parent-child       separations lead to a host of long-term psychological,       social, and health problems that are not necessarily resolved       upon reunification. In particular, the disruption of       biological stress regulation mechanisms in the body induced       by the need to seek refugee or asylum status are further       taxed by the absence of parental support. The science is       clear: policies that separate immigrant families upon entry       to the U.S. have devastating and long-term developmental       consequences for children and their families.     DAVIS of Illinois. That is why the administration's  intentional infliction of trauma on children by separating children  from their parents is so cruel and inhumane. Causing intentional harm  to children is a human rights violation and is un-American. We must  stop this appalling policy immediately, reunite parents and children  without delay, and provide intensive services to help these families  heal.
