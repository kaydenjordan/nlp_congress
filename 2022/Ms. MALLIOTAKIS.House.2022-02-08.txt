 Madam Speaker, I proudly rise today in support of  this bipartisan Postal Service Reform Act.   Our postal workers are the reliable chain that links Americans and  businesses, from coast to coast.   This bill improves the efficiency of the Postal Service by  streamlining the transportation network, optimizing the workforce to  avoid costly overtime, and requiring reporting accountability.   Additionally, it eliminates the requirement that the USPS prepays 75  years' worth of retiree health benefits, saving $27 billion over the  next 10 years. It also improves customer service by requiring 6-day  delivery.   It is time for us to pave a better path for our neighbors who rely on  and work for the U.S. Postal Service, like John Byers, who recently  retired after 40 years of dedicated service to my district.   I strongly encourage my colleagues to stand alongside our postal  workers and vote for this bill.
