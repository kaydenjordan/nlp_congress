 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, first, on the topic of healthcare: I was  very happy to hear the statement from Chairman Alexander and Ranking  Member Murray yesterday in which they pledged the HELP Committee to the  task of restabilizing and strengthening the markets, particularly by  guaranteeing the cost-sharing reduction program. As Chairman Alexander  said: ``Without the payment of these cost-sharing reductions, Americans  will be hurt.'' That is clear. Everyone has said it, even the insurance  industry, and yet President Trump continues to treat this critical  program as if it is some kind of political hostage. The President  treats the critical program as if it is some kind of hostage.   Insurers in three States--North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Iowa--have  each released separate rates for 2018: one if the payments are made,  and one that is 20 percent higher if they are not. In these three  States, premiums will be 20 percent higher if President Trump refuses  to carry out the law. Every American will see that increase in their  monthly bill and know it is a Trump premium tax.   Insurers from coast to coast have said that uncertainty surrounding  the cost-sharing reductions are the No. 1 threat to the stability of  our markets. State insurance commissioners--many of them Republican-- are announcing higher rates for next year and directly blaming the  President's failure to guarantee these payments, as the insurance  commissioner of Idaho did yesterday.   We have enough problems in the world right now without President  Trump creating entirely new ones out of political spite and a petty  vindictiveness. When you lose politically, you don't take it out on the  American people. That is not Presidential; that is just small.   So we would say to the President: Stop holding this critical program  as if it is some kind of political hostage, stop the sabotage, make the  payments this month so Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray can  get to work in a bipartisan way on a longer stabilization package.   Let me salute a large number of my Republican colleagues who agree we  have to do cost sharing. They have realized that just sticking with  President Trump--particularly when his motivations are not Presidential  but are sort of nasty, vindictive--is a bad idea. I salute you because,  for the good of America, we have to work together.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now, on taxes, another matter. Yesterday,  my friend the majority leader brought down the curtain on bipartisan  tax reform before a discussion between our two parties could even  start, dismissing the prospect of Democratic  [[Page S4699]]  input, promising the Republicans would again use reconciliation to lock  us out of the process, repeating the same mistake they did with  healthcare.   Leader McConnell's announcement just came a few hours after 45  Members of the Democratic caucus sent him a letter saying we were open  to bipartisan discussions on tax reform. We had three simple,  straightforward principles. Let me read the Democratic principles on  tax reform: First, don't cut taxes for the 1 percent--the top 1  percent. They are doing fine. God bless them.   Second, don't increase the debt and deficit, something many of my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle have been talking about for a  long time.   Third, negotiate in a fair and open process, not reconciliation but  hearings, amendments, the things that have made America great and have  brought this Senate the acclaim over the decades it has had.   Now, I would like to know which of these principles the majority  leader does not agree with. I would like to know. Is he closing the  door on bipartisanship because he so dearly wants to cut taxes on the  top 1 percent? The wealthy are doing great right now--God bless them-- but they don't need another tax break while middle-class families and  working Americans are struggling just to make ends meet. Many of us on  this side of the aisle suspect that to some, that is the No. 1  motivation--not tax reform, not close loopholes, not clean up the  system but give that top 1 percent a huge tax break to please so many  like the Koch brothers.   Again, I would ask the leader: Are you closing the door on  bipartisanship simply because you want to cut taxes on the top 1  percent or maybe the leader is closing the door on bipartisanship  because he has a fervent desire to blow up the deficit? That sure  doesn't sound like something Republicans have been interested in over  the years--they have been spending lots of time, with good reason,  deficit scolding and debt scolding--or is my friend from Kentucky, our  majority leader, closing the door on bipartisanship because he thinks  reconciliation, which means you exclude the Democrats from the get-go,  is a good process because he doesn't want to have hearings, because he  doesn't want amendments, and maybe it is the same reason on healthcare?  Maybe they are ashamed of their proposal. I would like to see somebody  on the floor get up and say: We believe in tax cuts--on the Republican  side get up on the floor and say: We believe in tax cuts for the top 1  percent. That is why we want to do this.   But, no, they want to hide it, cloak it, give a crumb to the middle  class, and say: See, we are helping you.   We all know that what happens after we have a big deficit, they come  back and say: Now, let's cut Social Security, now let's cut Medicare  because we don't have the money. We don't have the money because they  cut taxes on the rich, the very wealthy.   I don't know which of these three principles the majority leader is  against, but when he closed the door on Democrats--when we sent him  this letter which simply outlined our principles, that is all we wanted  to do, give him notice we agree on these three things, at least on our  side--which one or all of them made him close the door?   We Democrats hoped we could work together on tax reform, but the  majority leader has drawn down the curtain before the play has even  begun. Republicans will spend the entire first year of this Congress  trying to pass their agenda on reconciliation, a process that  deliberately excludes Democrats, excludes hearings, excludes  amendments, with no shred of bipartisan input. Just like with  healthcare, I believe it will be another dead-end road for Republicans.   I tell my friend the majority leader--I quote his speech in 2014,  entitled ``Restoring the Senate.'' I truly believe--I truly believe  that Leader McConnell believes in the institution of the Senate, and he  has shown examples of that most recently when he said we don't want to  change the rules, despite President Trump pushing to do that, but here  is what he said in 2014:         When the Senate is allowed to work the way it was designed       to, it arrives at a result acceptable to people all along the       political spectrum. But if it's an assembly line for one       party's partisan legislative agenda, [it creates] instability       and strife rather than good, stable law.    Those are the majority leader's words. Well, if you believe that, my  dear friend from Kentucky, then why are you instituting reconciliation,  the exclusionary process, before we even begin the debate? And why-- might the American people ask--haven't you learned the lesson of  healthcare that that process doesn't work?   The American people want to see us work together. We may not always  succeed. It may not be easy. It is hard work, but we ought to try. This  assembly line of partisan legislation--no Democratic input, no  hearings, no amendments--is not what any of us want to see. It is not  what the American people are calling out for, and it will not produce  good, stable law.   Again, I would ask the majority leader to reconsider these three  principles probably supported by 80 percent of the American people. Why  aren't our Republicans supporting them? Why are they running away from  them?                            ____________________     Finally, Mr. President, on the issue of trade, according  to reports, the Trump administration is preparing an open investigation  into China's trade practices, focusing on economic espionage and the  theft of intellectual property.   I certainly applaud the sentiment. I have been decrying for years how  the Chinese have been taking advantage of us in a way that has sent  trillions of dollars of American wealth to China and millions of jobs  to China so we should certainly go after them. The problem is, we don't  need another investigation to know what China is up to. That is what  the President called for: Let's investigate--another investigation.   It is clear what China is up to. By dumping counterfeit and  artificially cheap goods into our markets, denying U.S. companies fair  access to its markets, and relentlessly stealing and exporting  intellectual property of U.S. companies, China, as I said, has robbed  the U.S. economy of trillions of dollars and caused the loss of  millions of good-paying U.S. jobs.   Estimates by our own government--already made estimates; we don't  need a study, President Trump--pin the cost of cyber espionage alone at  $400 billion a year to the U.S. economy--$400 billion a year, and 90  percent of it comes from China's Government. This is not a benign  process. This is not some rogue company. This is the Chinese  Government.   Here is what our four-star general, Keith Alexander, the former  Director of the National Security Agency and commander of the U.S.  Cyber Command said. He called the loss of industrial information and IP  through cyber theft ``the greatest transfer of wealth in history''--the  greatest transfer of wealth in history.   That pains me--this country, with its entrepreneurial vigor, with its  acceptance of people from all corners of the globe for centuries to go  work hard and create good things, China is stealing it. They are not  doing it on their own. Every American, when they hear that statement,  it should make them cringe. It makes me cringe almost every day.   Those are the facts. So I would say to President Trump: We don't need  another study that takes months and months to complete while no action  is taken. We need a plan of action now.   Unfortunately, this is what the Trump administration is doing on all  issues of trade. They really talked tough on the issue of steel and  aluminum dumping. As someone who has aluminum plants in the State up  there in Massena--Alcoa--and all along Lake Ontario--what used to be  called Alcan is now called Novelis--I know the issue of aluminum  dumping. It hurts jobs in my State. The President early on talked  tough, tweeted tough on illegal steel dumping, illegal aluminum  dumping, but it is 7 months into this administration, and we are still  reviewing its effects on our economy.   The administration failed to secure any deal with China in a number  of forums, and they continue to delay on action that was promised in  June. Tough talk and tweets are cheap, but strong and decisive action  on trade is  [[Page S4700]]  required. American workers have waited too long for our country to  crack down on abusive trade practices that rob our country of millions  of good-paying jobs.   Today, I am proud to announce that the Democratic Party will be  laying out our new policy on trade, which includes, among other things,  an independent trade prosecutor to combat trade cheating, not one of  these endless WTO processes that China takes advantage of over and over  again; a new American jobs security council that will be able to review  and stop foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies if they are likely to  have a detrimental effect on U.S. jobs; penalties for Federal  contractors that outsource jobs; stronger ``Buy American'' rules; and  an outsourcing tax on companies that leave the United States.   On the issue of NAFTA negotiations, we are laying out a set of tough  principles that must be a bottom line for any new NAFTA text. I voted  against NAFTA in 1994. That was 23 years ago. We have seen how it has  hurt us in so many ways. There have been some benefits, but overall the  loss of jobs is painful. More jobs and higher wages have to be our  guiding principle, and it needs full transparency with workers and the  public at the table, not just corporations.   So I hope the administration--and I always said when I heard Donald  Trump campaign that my views on trade are probably closer--I am closer  to his views than I was to either President Obama's or President  Bush's. I hope he will listen to us and work with us. These are good  things to do. We can do them quickly. We can save jobs, create good- paying jobs. But I say to the President: We don't need another  investigation, another study that languishes for months and maybe even  years. We need strong, bold action on trade, and Democrats will offer  those strong bold ideas later this morning.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
