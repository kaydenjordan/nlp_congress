 Mr. Speaker, I rise to express a sense of righteous  indignation about the violence peaceful people of faith must now  concern themselves with in places of worship all over America.   We have come to the point in this Nation where we can no longer  attend church or go to the synagogue or the mosque without fearing the  worst. How many lives must we lose before we decide there is not any  room in America for hate?   Martin Luther King, Jr., once said: ``Hate is too heavy a burden to  bear.'' We must bring an end to wanton gun violence before it robs this  Nation of its very soul.   The people in my district pray without ceasing for the victims of the  Poway shooting.   As leaders of this Nation, let's commit ourselves today to bring this  violence to an end here and now.                            ____________________
