 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, Americans want safer streets, affordable gas, and  freedom. Instead, Democrats give us record crime levels, record  inflation, and another  [[Page H7607]]  bill attacking President Trump sponsored by the guy who spent years  misleading the Congress and, more importantly, the country on the  Trump-Russia investigation, on the Mueller investigation, and on  impeachments.                                time  1400    Remember when the sponsor of the bill said that his office didn't  meet with the whistleblower? Found out that wasn't true.   Remember when the sponsor of the bill told us that we would hear from  the whistleblower during impeachment; we would actually have real  process instead of having hearings and depositions in the basement in  the bunker of the Capitol?   Remember when the sponsor told us this: There was more than  circumstantial evidence that President Trump colluded with Russia? That  turned out to be false. Bob Mueller said it was false. Everyone knew it  was false.   In fact, it was such baloney, even The Washington Post has had to  retract and change things from stories because they said, oh, yeah,  yeah, there was a lot of false information in that dossier that they  used to go spy on President Trump's campaign.   And I think this is important to understand. The sponsor of this  legislation wasn't just any Member of Congress, Mr. Speaker. He wasn't  just any chairman of a committee in Congress. He was the chairman of  the Intelligence Committee, the committee that gets additional  information from anyone else in the country, making those claims that  were not accurate.   So maybe, instead of having another bill that attacks President Trump  because Democrats are afraid he is going to run and he is going to win  in 2024, so they want to do everything they can to attack him--maybe  instead of another bill attacking President Trump, we should actually  focus on things that the American people care about.   You know, you can attack President Trump all you want. I know one  thing: A year ago, the border was secure. It sure was. A year ago,  cities were safe, safer than they are today. A year ago, we didn't have  a 31-year high inflation. We actually had wages going up, real wages. A  year ago, we didn't have a Department of Justice, attacking moms and  dads, putting a label, a designation, a threat tag on parents who  simply go to school board meetings and speak out against a racist,  hate-America curriculum. No, we didn't have that a year ago.   But you guys can keep attacking the President all you want; not  addressing the issues that the American people care about. We are going  to speak about the issues they care about. We are going to try to do  everything we can to slow down your crazy agenda that is driving up the  price of everything. And we are going to speak out against and do  everything we can to make sure the Department of Justice quits  attacking parents.   God bless the whistleblower that came forward and gave us the  information sent from the Counterterrorism Division of the FBI. We  could be dealing with that issue today. We could be holding the  Attorney General accountable, the Justice Department accountable for  what they are doing.   No, no, no. We are going to attack President Trump again. Democrats,  that is the only thing they can do because they can't talk about  anything else.   I hope we defeat this bill.
