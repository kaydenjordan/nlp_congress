 I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the en bloc amendment, which  includes my amendments to increase funding for the ocean acidification  program and increase coastal monitoring and assessment of algal blooms.   Oregon's economic vitality is dependent on the ocean economy. Ocean  acidification and harmful algal blooms threaten ocean health, the  tourism industry, and our valuable fisheries.   Communities along the coasts are vulnerable to the effects of our  changing climate. I applaud NOAA's acidification program and coastal  monitoring and assessment programs that give our coastal community the  tools they need to understand and address these threats.   I thank the chairman and ranking member for including these  amendments and for their hard work on this bill.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of the en bloc amendment, which  includes my bipartisan amendment to highlight the need to fully fund  Student Support and Academic Enrichment grants.   These grants are critical to the successful implementation of title  IV of the Every Student Succeeds Act. Schools across the country can  use the Student Support grants to give all students access to a well- rounded education.   The grant program is also important because it was created to  allocate funding by formula, which levels the playing field so small  school districts can get their fair share of funding.   I am disappointed that this bill funds Student Support grants  significantly lower than the original $1.65 billion authorized in the  Every Student Succeeds Act, and I hope there will be an opportunity in  the Senate to increase funding for these critical Student Support  grants.   I thank the chairman and ranking member for including my amendments  in an en bloc package and for their hard work on this bill.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 767, line 24, insert ``(increased by $51,000,000'')       after the dollar amount.

Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentlewoman  from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Oregon.

Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to  increase funding for senior nutrition programs under title III of the  Older Americans Act. My amendment funds these programs at levels  authorized by the House just last year.   We are in the middle of an unprecedented demographic shift as this  country ages. The population of older adults is growing faster than at  any point in history. As we grow older, we all want people across the  country to be able to age with dignity, health, and independence in  their own homes and communities for as long as possible.   For more than 50 years, the Older Americans Act has supported  community-based providers that reach more than 11 million seniors and  caregivers annually in each and every one of our districts providing  person-centered assistance to help people age in place. These critical  OAA services include home-delivered and congregate meals to make sure  that older adults are getting the nutrition needed to keep them healthy  and engaged, which reduces the risk of falls, depression, and other  negative outcomes.   Just a few weeks ago, I had the pleasure of joining dedicated  volunteers to deliver Meals on Wheels to seniors in northwest Oregon. I  highly recommend this to my colleagues. You can see firsthand the value  of these programs and how important these meals and visits are to our  constituents who rely on them.   The Older Americans Act also covers transportation to get older  adults to the doctor, the grocery store, or even to a local senior  center to engage with friends and avoid isolation. The OAA funds  critical disaster assistance response efforts for seniors and  communities like those just devastated by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.   Unfortunately, funding for the Older Americans Act has drastically  lagged behind the growth in the older adult population, the increasing  need for services, and the rising cost of delivering these supports.  This stagnant and, in some areas, eroding Federal investment in OAA  programs costs us more in the long term. When seniors can't stay  healthy at home, they end up in hospitals paid for by Medicare or in  institutional long-term care, often funded by Medicaid. Both are far  more expensive than adequate investments in the Older Americans Act to  keep seniors healthy at home for as long as possible.   Support for the Older American Act is strongly bipartisan. Last year,  Congress voted without opposition to reauthorize the Older Americans  Act, a bill that included modest increases in authorized funding  levels.   Unfortunately, annual appropriations still fall woefully short of  these  [[Page H7292]]  amounts we clearly and firmly approved. This amendment will increase  funding for core OAA programs delivered through title III--which  include critical nutrition, home- and community-based support, and  caregiver services--to the amounts that were just so broadly supported  last year.   These investments in OAA are necessary if we are to provide the  person-centered, cost-effective in-home services and supports needed to  keep our expanding older population healthy and independent in their  homes and communities. This amendment is an essential first step toward  rectifying the recent depletion of these important funds for these  vital programs.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Scott), who is the ranking member of the Education and  the Workforce Committee, and is someone who understands the importance  of these investments.    Mr. Chair, may I please inquire as to the remaining  time.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Oregon has 1 minute remaining.    Mr. Chair, may I please inquire as to the remaining  time.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Oregon has 1 minute remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 45 seconds to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Lee), who serves on the Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to support this  important amendment that is a good investment to save in the long term  and take care of our seniors.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
