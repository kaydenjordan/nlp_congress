 Mr. Speaker, at the age of 93, on February 5, America  lost another hero from our Greatest Generation. I rise today to honor  the life of Robert Martin of Spring Hill, Arkansas, for his heroic  actions in World War II and his life of service.   Mr. Martin enrolled in the Army on June 6, 1944, a day we know as D- day. We think of it as the beginning of the end of the war; although,  it was just the beginning of his service. But he had a lot of service  to give.   During his time overseas in the war, he served in England, France,  Belgium, Holland, and Germany. Mr. Martin fought in the Battle of the  Bulge, was wounded in December of 1944 and January and February of  1945, and spent several months in the hospital recovering from serious  injuries.   Upon his return to the U.S., he was awarded three Purple Hearts, a  Bronze Star Medal, Combat Infantryman Badge, Prisoner of War Medal, a  World War II Victory Medal, and several others.   Mr. Martin was a proud resident of Arkansas and became known as the  community historian to everyone who lived in Spring Hill, sharing his  stories with anyone who would listen.   Mr. Martin was a true American hero. He spent his life serving his  fellow man, and, for this, we remember his legacy.   It is with great pride that I honor Mr. Robert Martin.
