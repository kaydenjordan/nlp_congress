 Mr. Speaker, this week, I joined rice farmers in  Crowley, Louisiana, the rice capital of the world, to recognize  National Rice Month.   With more rice mills per square mile than anywhere else in America,  the small town of Crowley was a fitting place to celebrate the  beginning of the harvest for American-grown rice. Rice is a part of our  Southern culture and is a major agricultural commodity for Louisiana.   There are more than 400,000 rice acres in Louisiana, generating over  $700 million in economic output each year, supporting many thousands of  Louisiana jobs. Rice farmers and farm families are solid Americans, and  south Louisiana would not be what it is without rice.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be a strong advocate of American rice, and  I commend the nearly 125,000 Americans who work to provide this  quality, nutritious crop to our Nation and the world.                            ____________________
