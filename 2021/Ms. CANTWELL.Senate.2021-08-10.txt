 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, many States in the United States need  infrastructure investment, but I would put the State of Washington high  on the list of States that desperately need infrastructure investment.   We have been blessed with a growing economy and a big trade economy  based on the Pacific rim and the actions of the Pacific rim. So we need  to keep moving products. We need to keep moving services, and we need  infrastructure investment to do so.   I wanted to take this opportunity to thank the work done by the  Commerce Committee and those who worked on the Infrastructure  Investment Act, specifically: Kara Fischer, Michael Davisson, Joanie  Lofgren, Zeb Schorr, Ronce Almond, Alex Simpson, G.G. Slais, Nicole  Teutschel, Jennifer Quan, Matthew Bobbink, Jami Burgess, David Martin,  Amit Ronen, Stacy Baird, Devon Helfrich, Patrick Eckroth, Naseem  Mehyar, Hannah Albert, Eric Vryheid, Elle Wibisino, John Branscome,  Shawn Bone, Brian McDermott, Mary Claire York, Jared Bomberg, Shannon  Smith, John Beezer, Noam Kanter, Jordan Blue, Tiffany George, Lucy  Koch, Hunter Hudspeth Blackburn, Kelly Ryan, Dave Stewart, Melissa  Porter, and David Strickland.   These are some of the individuals who were involved in putting  together the commerce piece of this underlying bill. About 20 percent  of the underlying bill was the focus of the Commerce Committee and its  jurisdiction.   I want to thank Ranking Member Wicker and his staff for the hard work  to pull off what was the bipartisan bill that came to the Senate floor  as part of this package.   Our legislation, I think, is a historic investment to rebuild our  transportation infrastructure, including investments in things like  megaprojects, basically helping to eliminate our problems at grade  crossings, improve our freight network, improve our environment by  removing culverts, and helping Amtrak better serve the United States of  America.   All these were important investments, but we should look at the  firsts. First, we are authorizing for the first time megaprojects.  Megaprojects often take up so much of our budget in our States and  federally they never get funded, but that doesn't mean they aren't  critical to the United States.   In the Northeast Corridor, we certainly have megaprojects. In the  Pacific Northwest, we have megaprojects that would be critical, like  the Columbia River Crossing between Vancouver and Portland, or the  Highway 2 trestle in Everett. These projects deserve the attention of  the Nation and, with this first-time authorization, will get so.   The bill also puts a historic investment in freight and in Amtrak. As  I mentioned, the economy of a global nature is demanding that we be  able to  [[Page S6194]]  move competitively our products. But if we don't continue to invest in  freight, we are not going to get that job done. So this provides $66  billion to improve our passenger rail and freight system, the single  largest investment that we have had in our Amtrak system that was  funded 50 years ago.    The Commerce Committee's bill lays the foundation for this funding,  which I believe will do three things. It will mean more investment to  fix the problems in the Northeast Corridor; more specifically, it will  give us the ability to have more sequencing of trains throughout the  United States of America; and it will provide for new service in city  pairs that, I hope, will help economies all across the United States  with more investments.   I know, specifically, the Senator from Montana, Senator Tester, is  very adamant about our Amtrak funding and the services that Montana  demands. I want to thank him for his help on this.   I want to thank Senator Duckworth for her hard work in making sure  that Amtrak complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act. This is  so important for us to do, and her language, making sure that we also  have someone from the disabilities community on the Amtrak board, is  the kind of thing that should be followed in other examples in this  legislation.   I also want to say, for the first time, we are addressing  specifically at-grade crossings. This is the instance where there is  congestion in freight, in my State, multiple times the increase in  freight traffic. Again, you know, a lot of Midwest product moving to  Asia has increased a demand in safety and transportation. Somebody  quoted one of our reports that it took freight 3 days to get through  just the city of Chicago because of the amount of congestion.   Our job here is to make sure that our product, made and grown in the  United States of America, gets quickly to its destinations or we will  be outcompeted by other nations that have an infrastructure system that  can beat us to those marketplaces. So this provides, for the first  time, a focused program on improving at-grade crossings to continue to  make the investments that need to be made to keep our freight moving  and our public safe.   It also, for the first time, authorizes transportation improvements  to repair culverts. Culverts and other transportation infrastructure  have done damage to our environment. They have done damage to fish;  they have basically blocked spawning grounds. They have caused other  infrastructure challenges to species all along our coastal States. This  program will help to improve that situation by repairing some of the  fish passage that has been blocked for so many years. This is so  important for us in the Pacific Northwest, but it is also important  throughout the South and for our many, many coastal communities.   So this transportation legislation that went through the Commerce  Committee, as I said, also, you know, makes other investments. This  floor bill also makes other investments for bridge repair, for transit  systems, for climate resiliency, and specifically for our airports. You  probably haven't heard too much about that out here on the floor, but  in the Commerce Committee, I can tell you that aviation,  transportation, and competitive--I know that the Presiding Officer  knows this very well; that in Las Vegas or in Reno that infrastructure  like our airports is essential to our economy continuing to grow.  SeaTac is probably one of the fastest growing airports in the United  States right now, and under this legislation, we will also see an  important improvement for our airports so they can continue to grow and  so we can continue to make investments.   I also want to, as I mentioned, thank Senator Wicker in the title for  vehicle safety. These are important provisions that he and I and others  on the committee--Senator Blumenthal for his work on safety legislation  that related to both the Northeast Corridor and to individuals in  transportation, including, with Senator Wicker, the lifesaving  technology, like an automatic emergency braking system, preventing  child heat stroke deaths, and impaired driving faculties.   So I again thank all of the members of the Commerce Committee for  their hard work in getting this legislation as part of this package.   I think we can see that we have some firsts here: first investing in  megaprojects; first in cleaning up our environmental problems with  culverts; getting our freight product through our most congested  corridors with improved at-grade crossing; and making the major  investment so that Amtrak can continue to expand.   So I look forward to working with my colleagues as we move through  the legislative process and continue to make improvements in our  transportation infrastructure.   I yield the floor.                      Recognition of the Minority Leader
