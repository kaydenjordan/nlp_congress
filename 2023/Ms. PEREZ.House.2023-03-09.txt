 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Napavine  High School football team for a fabulous season. They have brought home  yet another State championship in football.   The Tigers put up an impressive 41 points in one game. The defense  stood tall, paving the way to secure the title.   Victories like these really highlight the importance of team sports  and competition. These experiences bring communities together and teach  students the value of teamwork and hard work.   Congratulations, Napavine Tigers. You have made your community and me  very proud for an amazing season.                     Recognizing Sandra Bedrosian Sermone     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Sandra  Bedrosian Sermone, a resident of my district, for her work on ADNP  syndrome, a rare neurodevelopmental disorder.   In 2016, Sandra founded the ADNP Kids Research Foundation after her  son was diagnosed with this disorder. Additionally, Sandra helped  discover a  [[Page H1216]]  new biomarker for the ADNP gene, helping her spearhead efforts to  diagnose and cure ADNP.   Through her efforts, the ADNP Kids Research Foundation has donated  over $2 million to studying ADNP syndrome, making it the world's  largest contributor to ADNP research.   The foundation is based out of Brush Prairie, Washington, in my  district, and I want to take this opportunity to thank Sandra and her  entire team for their trailblazing work. I wish them the very best as  they endeavor to find a cure for ADNP syndrome.                      Celebrating Longview's Centennial     Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the centennial  anniversary of Longview, Washington.   Longview was created north of the Columbia River and west of the  Cowlitz River in 1923 by the Long-Bell Lumber Company. It was, at the  time, the first city of its size created entirely by private funds.   Previously, the Long-Bell Lumber Company was located in Missouri, and  I think they judiciously relocated to the Northwest, where timber grows  on trees.   Longview was dedicated in 1923 and then incorporated as a municipal  government in February 1924. Today, Longview is a thriving community of  over 37,000 people. It is a major port hub and continues to be a  powerhouse in timber, cardboard, and paper industries.    As part of its celebrations, Longview celebrated a Centennial Kickoff  Celebration on January 20. I look forward to celebrating with them  throughout the year, particularly during this summer's annual cardboard  boat regatta.                  Celebrating the Mecha Mules Robotics Team     Madam Speaker, I rise today to give a huge shout-out to  the Wahkiakum High School Mecha Mules robotics team. Somebody needs to  make a movie about these guys. They are phenomenal.   Wahkiakum High School actually did not have hot running water in many  of their bathrooms. It is a rural and, in many ways, a very  underresourced school.   These kids, ranging in age from eighth grade all the way to seniors,  placed second at the International SeaPerch underwater robotics  competition. They are doing phenomenal work. They placed 17th out of  over a hundred competitors in Washington State's competition.   I was so honored to visit with them last month. These kids really  know their stuff. I am behind them 100 percent, so much so that I  actually offered or agreed to jump in a pool if they are successful in  their next competition. Hopefully, we will have more on that.   Again, congratulations. We are all so proud of you. You have made  your community very proud, and I am very excited to see what you all  continue to do.      Thanking U.S. Coast Guard and Columbia River Bar Pilots for Their                                  Service     Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank the U.S. Coast Guard  and Columbia River Bar pilots in southwest Washington for their  dedicated service every day on the Columbia River Bar.   This is one of the most dangerous bodies of water in the world. It is  where the mighty Columbia meets the Pacific Ocean. In winter, waves  reach over 30 feet to 40 feet in height.   Every day, these folks risk their lives to save lives and livelihoods  and ensure that the Columbia River can be a connecting route for  Washington State and the entire world for trade. I am so grateful for  the work they do guiding cargo ships and providing aid to stranded  vessels.                            ____________________
