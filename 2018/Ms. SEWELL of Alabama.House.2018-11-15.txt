 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the  extraordinary life and amazing career of Alabama State Senator Hank  Sanders, also known as The Rock.   For the past 35 years, State Senator Sanders has been a powerful  voice in the Alabama Legislature, ably representing the 23rd District  since 1983. He was the longest serving chair of the Senate Finance and  Taxation Committee from 1996 and served for four consecutive terms  until Republicans took over the statehouse in 2010.   Senator Sanders is a lawyer; a statesman; a native of my hometown of  Selma, Alabama; and a true Renaissance man. Along with his numerous  legislative accomplishments, Senator Sanders has also penned more than  1,600 newspaper articles and columns known as Senate Sketches as a way  of communicating directly with his constituents.   Senator Sanders' years of service to the State of Alabama and to the  Alabama Legislature will be missed. For you see, Mr. Speaker, after 35  years, this lion of the Alabama Senate is retiring. Choosing not to run  in 2018, he will be ably replaced by his daughter, who recently won  that election.   Unlike many who found themselves in positions of power, Senator  Sanders did not come from a privileged background. Senator Sanders came  from humble beginnings, 1 of 13 children born to Sam and Ola Mae  Sanders in Baldwin County, Alabama.   Growing up, Senator Sanders said what his family lacked in money,  they more than made up for in love and support. The Sanders family  provided constant encouragement for their children, pushing each of  them to further their dreams through education.   At the age of 12, Senator Sanders was inspired to become a lawyer  after reading an article about Thurgood Marshall. Following his  graduation from Douglasville High School, Senator Sanders began  pursuing his legal career, graduating near the top of his class at  Talladega College.   After earning his bachelor's degree, Senator Sanders went on to  enroll and graduate from Harvard Law School. He attended Harvard Law  School in the 1970s on a Felix Frankfurter Scholarship, an award for  underprivileged students who showed exceptional promise. During his  time at Harvard Law School, he was president of the Harvard Black Law  Students Association.    It was during law school that he found his life mate, his beloved  wife, Faya Ora Rose Toure, formerly known as Rose M. Sanders. After  graduating, Senator Sanders and his wife moved back to Selma, Alabama,  my hometown.   Their decision to go to Selma was one that was made because they knew  how important it was to do things in the Black Belt, saying they grew  up to love and cherish the city, which provided an opportunity to build  both of their careers and raise their family.   They started a very productive law firm by the name of Chestnut,  Sanders, and Sanders.   During their 41 years together, they produced six beautiful children  and nine grandchildren.   In 1971, Senator Sanders founded the law firm of Chestnut, Sanders,  Sanders, and Pettaway, which was one of the top African American-owned  law firms in the State of Alabama, as well as one of the largest in the  country.   Senator Sanders dedicated his life to making sure he pursued justice  on behalf of the underserved. He gave a voice to the voiceless, and he  still works tirelessly today.   In 1982, Senator Sanders decided to pursue his passion for helping  others on a State-wide level, winning a seat in the Alabama State  Senate for the 23rd District. During his 35 years representing the  largest political region in Alabama, Senator Sanders won seven bids for  reelection.   Senator Sanders has proudly championed issues such as childhood  education and nutrition, healthcare, women's issues, and removing the  sales tax for food. He served as chair of the Finance and Taxation  Education Committee, and he was voted Outstanding Legislator by the  Alabama Legislative Black Caucus.                                time  1015    Senator Sanders was voted a finalist for the Legislator of the Year  Award by his fellow Senators. He has numerous awards to his credit.   On a personal note, Senator Sanders was my State senator for those 35  years representing my hometown of Selma. He is a legal and political  giant in our community, and I join with our community this weekend in  acknowledging his 35 years of service to the State of Alabama and to  this Nation.   He is truly a renaissance man. He has a brilliant legal mind, and not  only is he politically astute, but he is also a family man who begins  every day with prayer and meditation. I think it is so important for  those young folks who come behind us that we know and respect and honor  Senator Sanders.   It is with great honor, Mr. Speaker, that I ask my colleagues to join  me in acknowledging the lion of the Alabama State Senate, a man who has  left an indelible imprint on the lives of so many in the Black Belt of  Alabama, a community that he has represented for more than 35 years.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in acknowledging the  accomplishments of State Senator Hank Sanders. He has served his  constituents well, and his contributions to the State of Alabama and to  this Nation will shape the political and social landscape of this great  Nation for years to come.                            ____________________
