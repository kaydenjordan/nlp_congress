 Mr. President, due to unforeseen circumstances I  was unable to be present today for votes on amendment No. 5192 to the  Resolution of Advice and Consent to Ratification for the Accession of  the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden to NATO. I offer this  statement for the Record in support of amendment No. 5192 and in  support of the underlying resolution.   Amendment No. 5192, offered by my good friend from Alaska, Mr. Dan  Sullivan, would amend existing language in the Resolution of Advice and  Consent to say, ``the Senate declares that all NATO members should  spend a minimum of 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense  and 20 percent of their defense budgets on major equipment, including  research and development, by 2024, as outlined in the 2014 Wales Summit  Declaration.'' This language is stronger and clearer than the current  resolution language, and it would deliver a clear message to the  President that Congress expects him to engage our allies on alliance  spending obligations.   Finally, the Resolution of Advice and Consent to Ratification for the  Accession of the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden to NATO  would add two excellent allies who will be significant contributors to  the NATO Alliance. Finland and Sweden both possess fully funded,  modern, self-sufficient, highly capable militaries. Their addition to  the NATO alliance will help to share the burden of NATO defense  [[Page S3907]]  obligations among NATO allies. This will enable the U.S. to focus its  own forces where they are needed most, be that in Europe or in the  Indo-Pacific.                            ____________________
