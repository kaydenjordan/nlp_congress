 Mr. Speaker, we are now on the eve of the 25th anniversary  of the historic Belfast/Good Friday Agreement, historic in large  measure because of the American dimension through a negotiated  settlement which helped to bring about the longest-standing political  dispute in the history of the western world.   It was the people of goodwill and both parts of the island that voted  referendum questions to help bring about this remarkable achievement.   In this House, the question of Ireland has always been bipartisan,  and it has been celebrated by both political parties here with great  enthusiasm and so recognized.   Mr. Kelly of Pennsylvania and I, as chairpersons of the Friends of  Ireland, will be asking Members to sign the proclamation that we are  offering through this resolution that will celebrate this historic  achievement as we prepare across America, the UK, the Republic of  Ireland, and Northern Ireland for this celebration. These have been  ``it will never happen'' moments that we have all had a chance to  participate in, and I hope that Members will all sign this historic  resolution celebrating and acknowledging this achievement.                            ____________________
