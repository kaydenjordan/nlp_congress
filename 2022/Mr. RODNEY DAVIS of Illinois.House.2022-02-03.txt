 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor my  friend John Thomas Long. We all knew him as Tom. You know, I got a  chance to meet Tom Long through my former bosses, my former direct  boss, Craig Roberts, and my big boss at the time, a guy named John  Shimkus, who used to serve in this Chamber.   Tom was a friend to them, and he immediately became a friend to me.  Tom was somebody who was a giant in the legal community in and around  the metro east area of Illinois. He served as a law clerk for the  Department of Justice. He was the CEO of Argosy Gaming. He was a member  of the White House advance team. He was a delegate to the 1988  Republican Convention, but I met him when he was the Madison County  Republican Party chairman.   Tom was a guy who was active all throughout his community, but what  he was most active in doing was loving his family and making sure his  family was his highest priority.   Tom passed away just this past week, and my heartfelt prayers and  thoughts go out to his wife, Robin, and his three daughters: Margaret,  Erin, and Emma.   Madison County, Illinois, and Illinois and this country lost a giant  in Tom Long. He will be missed. May God rest his soul.                            ____________________
