Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 5905, the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5905, the Department of Energy  Science and Innovation Act of 2018.   This legislation authorizes the Department of Energy's Office of  Science programs for fiscal years 2018 and 2019. It also authorizes  upgrades and new construction of major user facilities at the  Department of Energy national labs and universities.   Over the past 4 years, the Energy Subcommittee has met with  stakeholders, held hearings, and worked extensively with our colleagues  to draft the language included in today's legislation. During this  comprehensive process, we spoke with DOE officials, directors of DOE  national labs, academia, and industry representatives about the right  priorities for these Office of Science programs. The result was a  series of bills that the Science, Space, and Technology Committee has  advanced through the House this Congress, including H.R. 589, H.R.  4376, H.R. 4377, and H.R. 4675.   The legislation we will consider today combines these bills to form a  bipartisan authorization of the department's basic science research.  This includes more than $6 billion in fundamental research and  discovery science, largely performed at DOE national laboratories and  user facilities around the country.   Last month, I had the opportunity to visit a number of these  facilities at Argonne National Laboratory and Fermi National  Accelerator Laboratory with several of my Science, Space, and  Technology Committee colleagues. We got to see firsthand the incredible  work that those researchers do for our country and for the world.   From advanced scientific computing to nuclear physics to fusion  energy science, focusing on basic research at our national labs  provides the best opportunity for U.S. economic growth and technology  innovation.   H.R. 5905 authorizes funding for critical infrastructure projects at  these national labs. In the Basic Energy Sciences program, it  authorizes upgrades to world-leading X-ray light source facilities  around the country, like the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National  Laboratory and the Advanced Light Source at Lawrence Berkeley National  Laboratory.   These facilities give American scientists the tools they need to  study the structure and behavior of both physical and biological  materials, enabling innovation in many fields, including creating new  materials for industrial as well as pharmaceutical use.   This legislation also authorizes the construction of new DOE research  facilities for physics and high-energy physics. This includes  construction of the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams, or FRIB, at  Michigan State University, which will enable critical nuclear physics  research across a wide breadth of fields, ranging from astrophysics to  medicine, and eventually the construction of the Long-Baseline Neutrino  Facility at Fermilab, an internationally coordinated project to build  the world's highest intensity neutrino beam. The research at this  facility will help shed light on the universe and its origins.   This bill, Mr. Speaker, also specifically authorizes basic research  in fields that are critical to U.S. dominance in science and  technology. It authorizes research in exascale computing, electricity  storage, and fusion energy sciences. It establishes a DOE exascale  computing program, a low-dose radiation research program, and programs  for managing our Energy Frontier Research Centers and Bioenergy  Research Centers, while also ensuring that we fulfill our commitments  to the ITER project for fiscal years 2018 and 2019.   Significant investments in basic science research by foreign  countries like China threaten America's global standing as the leader  in scientific knowledge. To maintain our competitive advantage as a  world leader in science, we must continue to support  [[Page H5778]]  the research and research infrastructure that will lead to next  generation technologies.   H.R. 5905 is a commonsense bill that will maintain American  leadership in science. I want to thank Chairman Smith, Representative  Lofgren, Vice Chairman Lucas, and many of my Science, Space, and  Technology Committee colleagues for cosponsoring this important  legislation. I am grateful for the opportunity to work with the members  of this committee to gather research that will help America compete  around the world.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Smith).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Marshall), the distinguished doctor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, by harnessing the strength of our national labs and  investing in basic research, H.R. 5905 will help ensure Americans'  leadership in science and technology.   Mr. Speaker, I again want to thank my 11 colleagues on the Committee  on Science, Space, and Technology who have cosponsored H.R. 5905,  including Chairman Lamar Smith, Representative Zoe Lofgren, and Vice  Chairman Frank Lucas. I also want to thank the dozens of researchers  and stakeholders who provided feedback as we developed this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of this commonsense, bipartisan  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H5779]]         Mr. Speaker, this is great legislation. Again, I  want to urge the adoption of this commonsense, bipartisan legislation,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
