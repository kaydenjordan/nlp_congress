 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call  up House Resolution 71 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                 H. Res. 71         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the joint resolution (H.J.       Res. 41) providing for congressional disapproval under       chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of a rule submitted       by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to       ``Disclosure of Payments by Resource Extraction Issuers''.       All points of order against consideration of the joint       resolution are waived. The joint resolution shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the joint resolution are waived. The previous question shall       be considered as ordered on the joint resolution and on any       amendment thereto to final passage without intervening motion       except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled       by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Financial Services; and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the joint resolution (H.J.       Res. 40) providing for congressional disapproval under       chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule       submitted by the Social Security Administration relating to       Implementation of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of       2007. All points of order against consideration of the joint       resolution are waived. The joint resolution shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the joint resolution are waived. The previous question shall       be considered as ordered on the joint resolution and on any       amendment thereto to final passage without intervening motion       except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled       by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       the Judiciary or their respective designees; and (2) one       motion to recommit.    The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Costello of Pennsylvania). The gentleman  from Colorado is recognized for 1 hour.    Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Colorado?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Colorado?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying resolutions.   Before us is a resolution of disapproval that restores constitutional  rights and empowers individuals with disabilities. Many of us know  someone who struggles with a disability. We know friends or family who  have mental challenges. We know these people, and we know they deserve  the same constitutional protections as everyone else.   That is why this resolution is so important. It ends discrimination  against individuals with disabilities. It restores due process rights.  It keeps the Social Security Administration focused on its duty.   Mr. Speaker, the Obama administration's last-minute regulation to  strip disability benefit recipients of their constitutional rights is  deeply troubling.   The regulation at hand declares that just because an individual needs  assistance in managing their disability benefits, they are also unfit  to own a firearm. But this kind of thinking is discriminatory, forcing  those with disabilities to choose between their constitutional rights  or their disability benefits turns back the clock on disability rights.   This regulation singles out a single constitutional right to strip  away from a group of Americans. It doesn't make sense.   Why take away one right and not others? Why not also strip those  citizens of the right to vote or the right to trial by jury or the  right to free speech?   In this country, your rights can't be limited without due process,  but this regulation limits a constitutional right and only offers the  recourse of appeal after the decision has been made. When it is easier  to have your rights stripped away than to have them restored, it means  your due process rights have also died in the process.   Mr. Speaker, this resolution restores the due process rights of  individuals with disabilities. This resolution also refocuses the  Social Security Administration. The agency's job is to administer  benefits to Americans, not adjudicate cases concerning constitutional  rights.   Mr. Speaker, I am also worried that this regulation will divert  precious Social Security Administration resources from vital agency  tasks. We trust the agency to fulfill our commitments to seniors and  those with disabilities. This regulation distracts from those sacred  promises.   I thank Mr. Johnson and my colleagues for their hard work on this  resolution. We need to pass it.   Mr. Speaker, we also need to pass the joint resolution of disapproval  for the Dodd-Frank section 1504 regulation. This resolution restores  competitiveness to American energy companies. It allows American  companies to comply with foreign and domestic laws, and it protects  American workers abroad.   Section 1504 of Dodd-Frank requires companies to report their  payments to our government or foreign governments related to oil,  natural gas, and mineral extraction. After reporting this to the SEC,  the agency publishes these disclosures. This process is costly and  unfair to American businesses.   By forcing disclosure of project-level sensitive business  information, American energy companies will face a disadvantage against  government-owned energy companies. Since government-owned companies  control three-quarters of the world's oil supply, this regulation could  drastically impair the competitiveness of American companies. And the  actual cost of compliance limit, estimated by the American Petroleum  Institute to take 217,000 employee hours over a 3-year period, would be  devastating.   Section 1504 must also be rolled back because it might force American  companies to break the law of foreign countries. Some foreign nations  prohibit the very disclosure requirements  [[Page H832]]  required by this SEC regulation. Our companies should not have to  decide between following the rule of law here and following it abroad.   Finally, by forcing such detailed and specific disclosures to the  public, section 1504 could make energy extraction sites prime targets  for terrorists. Whether in the U.S. or abroad, we need to wisely  protect American workers from terrorism and other threats.   Mr. Speaker, this resolution restores competitiveness to American  companies, allowing them to contribute to the global energy economy in  a safe, secure, and legal manner.   It is time for Congress to reassert its authority and fix this poorly  implemented legislation.   I commend the work done by Representative Huizenga and my colleagues  on this important resolution, and I urge its passage.   I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)   Mr. McGOVERN. I thank the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Buck) for  extending me the customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, we are only one month into 2017; and today we have  another closed rule or, as I call them now, Putin rules. This is the  kind of process they have in Russia: no amendments, no debate, no  nothing, completely shut down. It is your way or the highway.    This is not the way the United States House of Representatives, the  greatest deliberative body in the world, should be run. This is  shameful. I have very serious concerns about the road that we are  traveling down, Mr. Speaker.   The 115th Congress is only a few weeks old, and we have already  ushered in a process that is alarmingly restrictive. Sadly, it has  become routine in this Republican House for the majority to close down  the process, rush bills through the House without regular order,  enforce the rules for Democrats but not for Republicans, and insist on  spending all of our time on partisan legislation instead of working  together to find bipartisan compromises and solutions to the real  problems facing American families and workers.   Mr. Speaker, today's legislation makes clear that the Republicans are  eager to repeal protections put in place to help the American people.  We should be working to expand opportunity for hardworking families and  strengthen safeguards to put the American people first, not  corporations, not wealthy CEOs, not big donors, and not special  interests, but the people ought to come first.                                time  1230    Today is another sad day. We are engaged in what I would call  mindless legislating. While my Republican friends say they want to  repeal needless regulation--something that we all want to do--the  process my Republican friends have embraced, to put it gently, is  reckless. No matter what you think of a particular regulation, or  rule--or, in many cases, they are protections--no matter what you may  think of a particular regulation, there is no denying that these rules  that my Republican friends are bringing to the floor to repeal went  through a vigorous process that took months and months, and even years  to complete.   They went through agency review. They went through a lengthy comment  period, oftentimes thousands, if not tens of thousands, of people  weighed in on the pros and cons of a particular idea. But the idea that  we would just erase them with the blink of an eye, no hearings, no  markups, nothing, it is a mindless way to legislate and a disturbing  way to govern.   The ``act first and think later'' approach was on full display with  President Trump's Muslim ban. It was so hastily enacted that his own  Secretary of Homeland Security didn't even know that the President was  signing the executive order until he saw it on cable news. The Trump  White House did such a poor job of briefing the Federal agencies  charged with enforcing the policy that airports across the country were  caught completely off guard, and there was widespread confusion and  chaos about how to carry it out.   That is what happens when you don't embrace a process that is  thoughtful. You get confusion, you get chaos, and you usually get bad  policy.   The mindless approach to governing by Republicans continued this  week. On Monday, President Trump announced that, for every new  regulation passed, two regulations must be repealed. That is it. No  details on what kind of regulations would be repealed, or why they  would be repealed. This is a blind shotgun and arbitrary approach to  our Nation's laws. We shouldn't be dumbing down the way we govern. The  American people deserve better from their leaders in Congress, and I  think they deserve better from their leaders in the White House.   Now, when this legislation came before the Rules Committee the other  night, there were plenty of questions. The hearing went on for a long  time. Lots of the questions came from my Republican friends. And I will  tell you, the chairman's answers were not always that enlightening. I  think maybe some more hearings would have helped. But in response to  some of these objections, namely, did the bill undergo any review by a  committee, one of my Republican friends--and it may have been the  gentleman from Colorado--said: We don't have time. We don't have time  for hearings. We have so many regulations that we want to repeal.   Don't have the time for a hearing? Don't have the time to understand  what we are doing? I thought that was part of our job. We were supposed  to deliberate. We were supposed to read the bill. We were supposed to  understand the impact of the actions that we may or may not take in  this Congress. That is our job.   The American people have given us the responsibility to take the time  to do our job right and to carefully consider the laws we pass. To say  that we don't have time for hearings and deliberation--never mind, we  don't have time to allow an open process where people might want to  offer amendments--is ridiculous. It is shameful. And I will tell my  Republican friends, stand up to your leadership on this. This is not  the way this House should be run.   So as we consider the repeal of the NICS rule, we should remember  that Congress has failed to take any meaningful action on gun violence  at all. We have massacres on a regular basis in this country. All we do  is we have a moment of silence. That is our response. We have a high  rate of suicides in this country due to gun violence. It is something  we ought to talk about. And I think that the NICS rule is a  commonsense, responsible gun safety measure that could potentially save  the lives of thousands of people in this country. I think Congress has  the responsibility to keep our families safe, not remove safeguards  that help prevent gun violence.   Far too many have lost their lives to preventable gun violence. This  rule is intended to keep firearms out of the hands of those suffering  from severe mental illness. That is a commonsense idea that I think we  all should agree on. In 2007, President George W. Bush signed a  bipartisan bill to identify individuals ineligible to possess firearms  because of severe mental health issues. This rule allows for a  reporting method to ensure that the law is implemented effectively.   It is intended to save lives. Every year in the United States, more  than 21,000 people kill themselves, and mental illness is also an  important factor. A gun is used in the majority of these cases. The  people listed on NICS are the 75,000 dealing with the most severe  mental illnesses. These are people who need help, not access to a  dangerous weapon like a gun.   I think this rule is a critical step, but we must close the online  gun show loopholes, and we must ensure universal background checks. I  think we ought to bring to the floor a bill that says that if the FBI  and our security agencies have put you on a terrorist watch list and  think that you are too dangerous to fly on an airplane, then you ought  not to be able to go out and buy a gun.   But under the way this House is run, we can't even bring those things  to the floor for a debate. The Republican leadership and the Republican  Rules Committee blocks it so that there can't be real deliberation on  the House floor.   When people ask me all the time, Why can't you have a debate on this,  or why can't you have a vote on it, I have to explain that the House  Rules Committee, run by nine Republicans, says  [[Page H833]]  no to everything, says no to every idea that they don't absolutely  embrace. And that is not the way Congress should be run.   Mr. Speaker, even if you disagree with me on the value of this rule,  I think it is an important enough issue that there ought to have been a  hearing. There ought to have been that opportunity to deliberate and to  talk about it and what the impacts are. But no, nothing. We don't have  the time. So here we are.    Mr. Speaker, the other bill before us is a naked attempt by  Republicans to undo anticorruption rules. The rule that they are so  upset about would require energy companies on the U.S. stock exchange  to disclose payments they make to foreign governments for access to  their natural resources.   Now, there are reasons for this. It is important that there be  transparency. We heard all about the plans to drain the swamp, but  President Trump and the Republicans are doing all they can to turn the  swamp into a cesspool.   Putting aside all of his conflicts of interest that, I think, are on  a collision course with corruption, I mean, repealing things like this,  is just a bad idea. The Republicans in Congress are trying to roll back  regulations like this one that are aimed at increasing transparency and  fighting corruption.   ExxonMobil heavily lobbied against this rule. And now, with former  ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson on the cusp of becoming our country's new  Secretary of State, Republicans are proposing to kill this  anticorruption rule that benefits Big Oil. That is reckless, and it is  irresponsible.   When this rule was enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank bill in 2010,  the Big Oil lobbies strongly fought against it in court, but Congress  fought back to assert America's traditional role as a global leader in  fighting corruption. American leadership delivered results. The  European Union promptly moved to enact nearly identical legislation, as  did Canada with support of its global mining companies.   But now, Big Oil is back seeking repeal of the rule so their payments  can be kept secret from the American people. They claim they will be at  a competitive disadvantage to foreigners, or they will have to reveal  commercially sensitive information.   But with Europe and Canada in the same disclosure system, the playing  field is now level and the companies already filing have suffered no  commercial harm, nor revealed vital secrets. The fact is, this won't  cost a single American job, and the only thing oil companies will need  to do differently is report their numbers.   Aside from Big Oil, those most eager to repeal this rule are  autocrats in places like Russia, Iran, and Venezuela--with oil wells,  gas fields, or copper mines--who want to keep the money secret from  their citizens. Why should we do their bidding? Why should we be in  league with them?   On top of that, this rule is our most affordable and effective way to  fight corruption abroad. We cannot afford to betray our own principles  and severely undercut our allies in Europe and Canada. It would cost  countless lives over the long run and endanger our security. We need to  put American interests first, ahead of the special interests, ahead of  the corporate interests, and retain that important rule.   Obviously, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the repeal of these  two rules, but you got to do what you got to do. But I urge you to vote  ``no'' on this rule.   And I ask you to vote ``no'' because it should be a principle vote.   This place is becoming so closed up, so restrictive, that this is not  a deliberative body anymore. We are not talking about things anymore.  It is basically whatever the leadership wants, whatever Donald Trump  wants, you bring to the floor, rubber stamp it, and that is it.   I don't care what political party you are in, nobody who got elected  by the people of this country should stand for that kind of process.   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I appreciate my colleague from Massachusetts raising the issue of a  thoughtful process and whether this legislation was rushed to the  floor.   I think it is worth noting that the original legislation, which this  rule seeks to amend, became law in a time when my colleague was in the  House and his party was in the majority. The NICS Improvement  Amendments Act of 2007 was introduced in the House on June 11, 2007.   The bill was moved by Congressman Conyers under suspension of the  rules and passed by the House on June 13, 2007. There was no markup in  the Judiciary Committee. There was no meaningful debate on the floor.  The bill was rammed through the House in 3 days without any thought to  the potential consequences of its passage. It passed the Senate by  unanimous consent.   I did not see others standing up to leadership at that point in time.  In its implementation, we are seeing the consequences. They involve the  stripping away of constitutional rights and due process rights. They  involve the elimination of due process rights. They involve  discrimination against individuals with disabilities.   As for the point that this rule that we are now debating somehow  encourages corruption, the fact is that this regulation puts U.S.  companies at a competitive disadvantage to state-owned entities abroad  that are not subject to SEC regulation.   Additionally, it costs hundreds of millions of dollars in compliance  costs for U.S. businesses. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act already  prohibits bribes to foreign governments to obtain or retain business.  These are legitimate payments being made to foreign governments, the  payments that we are discussing here, and we should still prosecute any  corruption to the full extent of the law.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   With regard to the NICS bill, I have a very different version of  history than the gentleman does, including one that represents a  bipartisan compromise with the Bush White House.   So I have a very, very different recollection of history than he does  on that. And on the other bill, it is all about corruption, and it is  all about giving Big Oil what they want.    At the end of the day, the two interests that are most happy with the  repeal of this rule are Big Oil and Russia. And if that is where we  believe that we ought to be using our energy to help then go ahead and  vote to repeal it. But again, I think that this process speaks for  itself.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to urge my colleagues to defeat the previous  question, and, if they do, I will offer an amendment to the rule to  bring up Representative Lofgren's bill to overturn and defund President  Trump's immoral, unconstitutional, and discriminatory executive order  banning Syrian refugees and suspending immigration from certain  countries.   President Trump's executive order flies in the face of our Nation's  values. It compromises our national security by providing terrorist  groups with a recruiting tool. This executive order needs to be  overturned, and, if we defeat the previous question, we will bring up  legislation to do just that.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Massachusetts?   There was no objection.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lofgren) to discuss our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Does the gentleman have any other speakers?    I am waiting for one. I do not have a speaker now, but the  gentleman's eloquence would be welcome at this point and any way that  the gentleman would like to inform us on important issues.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, again, as my distinguished colleague, Ms. Lofgren,  stated, we want to defeat the previous question because we are  horrified, quite frankly, by the impact that President Trump's  executive orders on immigration have had on a lot of good, decent  people, many of whom have already been vetted. We have students who  have been held up who have student visas, we have dual citizens who  have been caught up in this mess, and we have people coming to get  human rights prizes. I could go on and on and on, but we need to  correct this. We are better than this.   I would suggest to my Republican friends, rather than circling the  wagons to try to defend the indefensible, they ought to join with us  and defeat the previous question so that we can actually do the right  thing and overturn this narrowminded, misguided, and discriminatory  policy.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions).    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions).    Mr. Speaker, I have a few comments before I close, and then  I would like to recognize the chairman for additional comments.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Rules Committee for being  here today and just reinforce some of what the chairman had to say.   As I travel Colorado, I hear from individuals of all walks of life  about the regulatory burdens that they face, the burden that has been  placed upon them by their own government and how those burdens have  impeded their life, liberty, and certainly pursuit of happiness. Small- business owners who would not open their business today because of the  change in the business climate find that their tax burden, their  regulatory burden, and the attitude of Federal regulators is such that  they would choose a different path had they had to do it all over  again.   I talked to school administrators who are, again, facing a pile of  paperwork to comply with school and nutrition requirements that have  been promulgated by this previous administration.                                time  1300    I talk to veterans who have to wait on long, long lines and fill out  ridiculous paperwork because the Veterans Administration is unable to  recognize the necessity, the importance of what those veterans are  trying to accomplish at the VA. I am deeply concerned about the  regulations, and I am proud that my colleagues have decided to address  some of these regulations in the way that they have. I appreciate the  chairman standing up on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Sessions).    Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Hultgren). The gentleman from Colorado  has 7\1/2\ minutes remaining. The gentleman from Massachusetts has 9\3/ 4\ minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Massie).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   I thank the gentleman from Texas and the gentleman from Kentucky for  their remarks, and I appreciate the insightful remarks from the  gentleman from Massachusetts. I am troubled right now. I am struggling  to remember--as the gentleman describes Russia with its terrible record  on human rights, I am trying to remember exactly who it was who had the  reset button with Vladimir Putin, and I don't think it was the Trump  administration. I could be wrong.   Mr. Speaker, America has come so far in advancing the rights of those  with disabilities. We have also fought long and hard to protect our  constitutional rights. The rule before us achieves both of those ends.  The Obama administration's last-ditch effort to strip constitutional  rights from individuals with disabilities must not stand. We also  cannot stand for regulations that place American companies at a  disadvantage and place their workers at risk.   The rule before us will undo the costly and dangerous reporting  requirements placed on America's energy companies operating abroad.  When we repeal this unwise regulation on American energy companies,  they can again fully contribute to the world's energy economy.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this rule and the underlying  measures.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the rule  governing debate on H.J. Res. 40, and the underlying legislation,  because in a nation that leads the civilized world in deaths by gun  violence, the last thing we should be doing is making it easier for  persons suffering from a very severe, long-term, mental disorder that  makes them incapable of managing their financial benefits and unable to  do any kind of work in the U.S. economy, even part-time or at very low  wages to obtain deadly firearms.   The Republicans have brought to the floor this week a Congressional  Review Act (CRA) of Disapproval to overturn Social Security  Administration (SSA) regulations to comply with existing federal law  governing the submission of records to the National Instant Criminal  Background Check System (NICS).   H.J. Res. 40, would vacate an important rule issued by the Social  Security Administration implementing the NICS Improvement Amendments  Act of 2007.   That law, which we adopted in the wake of the tragic mass shooting at  Virginia Tech, requires federal agencies to report to the National  Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) records of individuals  who are statutorily prohibited from purchasing or possessing firearms.   The statute was enacted with bipartisan support, and we should stand  together to defend efforts to see that it is fully implemented.   Let us be clear what a submission vote on this legislation is about:  the Republican's goal is to weaken our firearms background check  system.   The shootings at Virginia Tech in April 2007 presented the deadliest  shooting rampage in U.S. history.   On April 16 2007, the violence began around 7:15 a.m., ending in the  deaths of 32 students and teachers after being gunned down on the  campus of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University by Seung  Hui Cho, a student at the school, who later died from a self-inflicted  gunshot wound.   Only four months prior, on December 13, 2005, Cho had been ordered by  a judge to seek outpatient care after making suicidal remarks to his  roommates and was subsequently evaluated at Carilion-St. Alban's mental  health facility.   On February 9, 2007, Cho picked up a Walther P-22 pistol that he  purchased online, just days before, on February 2 from an out-of-state  dealer at JND Pawn shop in Blacksburg, across the street from Virginia  Tech.   In March of 2007, Cho purchased a 9mm Glock pistol and 50 rounds of  ammunition from Roanoke Firearms for 571 dollars.   The attack, resulting from these preventable actions, left 30 people  dead and another 17 wounded.   In all, 27 students and five faculty members died as a result of the  actions of a known mentally unstable individual who was nonetheless  allowed to purchase a firearm.   On December 14, 2012, Lenny Pozner dropped off his three children,  Sophia, Arielle, and Noah, at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown,  Connecticut.   Noah had recently turned 6, and on the drive over they listened to  his favorite song, for what turned out to be the last time.   Half an hour later, while Sophia and Arielle hid nearby, Adam Lanza  walked into Noah's first-grade class with an AR-15 rifle.   Noah was the youngest of the 20 children and seven adults killed in  one of the deadliest shootings in American history.   Depending on whom you ask, there were twenty-six, twenty-seven, or  twenty-eight victims in Newtown.   It is twenty-six if you count only those who were murdered at Sandy  Hook Elementary School; twenty-seven if you include Nancy Lanza--Adam's  own mother; twenty-eight once Adam turned the gun on himself.   There are twenty-six stars on the local firehouse roof.   On the anniversary of the shootings, the governor of Connecticut  asked churches to ring their bells twenty-six times.   Americans have spoken and they are outraged by the countless,  needless gun related deaths claiming the lives of their children.   To ensure the continued safety of American families, the Gun Control  Act of 1968 prohibits certain categories of individuals from possessing  firearms, including those who, using outdated terminology, are  ``adjudicated as a mental defective.'' (This is referred to as the  ``federal mental health prohibitor.'')   The 1993 Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act requires federally  licensed firearms dealers to run background checks on prospective gun  purchasers through NICS.   NICS includes records from various databases on individuals who are  prohibited by law from purchasing and possessing firearms.   In response to the mass shootings at Virginia Tech, prior to which  the shooter's mental health prohibitor should have been, but was not,  reported to NICS, Congress in 2007 unanimously approved legislation to  adopt the NICS Improvement Amendments Act.   As senior member of the House Committees on Judiciary and Homeland  Security and Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime,  Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations, I supported the 2016  Social Security Administration (SSA) rule, which committed the SSA to  submit records to the gun background check system for social security  recipients prohibited from possessing guns due to severe mental  illness.   It is a critical process for enforcing the law that bars prohibited  people from passing background checks and purchasing firearms.   The only way we are going to prevent guns from getting into the hands  of people who should not have them, people who pose a known and  documented danger to themselves and others, is through a system based  on robust, accurate and complete information.    Prior to the new SSA rulemaking, the agency had no process for  submitting records of prohibited people to the National Instant  Criminal Background Check System (NICS).   NICS therefore, has been missing records for those prohibited  individuals.   NICS is only as good as the records it contains.   With those records missing from the system, these individuals are  able to pass a background check and complete a purchase even though  they are legally prohibited from purchasing guns under longstanding  federal law.   The SSA regulation closes this gap by committing the agency to begin  submitting prohibiting records into the gun background check system.   The rule does not impact any beneficiaries who are not already  prohibited under law, and does not impact people based on disability  findings that have been made prior to the rule taking effect.   Americans have spoken and they are outraged by the countless,  needless gun related deaths claiming the lives of their children.   Under the regulation, only individuals with the most severe mental  impairments, who are (1) unable to earn any income due to their mental  incapacity, and (2) have been found incapable of managing their own  benefits meet the NICS reporting system cautionary criteria to report  the names of certain individuals who are prohibited by law from  purchasing or possessing firearms to the National Instant Criminal  Background Check System (NICS).   SSA has evaluated legal, medical and lay evidence and determined that  these individuals are not capable of managing their own benefits.   SSA estimates that about 75,000 people per year will meet these  criteria for reporting to NICS.   Disability examiners make the determination based on medical and  other evidence, but physicians or psychologists review the evidence and  sign off on the cases.   An individual who has a diagnosis of schizophrenia, suffers from  hallucinations and delusions, and most days cannot care for herself-- feeding, dressing, communicating with those around her.   Her symptoms and medical history meet the criteria in the listing for  schizophrenia.  [[Page H838]]    She receives disability benefits and has a representative payee.   She would meet the criteria for reporting.   An individual who has significant intellectual disability that  prevents him from working at any level (i.e., he meets the listing for  intellectual disability), and is unable to understand how to pay rent  or use his benefits to buy food.   He qualifies for disability benefits and has a representative payee.   He would meet the criteria for reporting.   Placing anyone into the NICS as a ``prohibited person'' is not  something we should take lightly, but it is a task that must be done in  limited circumstances and as required by statute.   The circumstances addressed by this rule require that we work  together on this serious and unfortunate issue.   The Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution of Disapproval would,  if passed by the House and Senate and signed by the President, deem the  rule to have not been in effect at any time and would also prohibit SSA  from reissuing a rule that is substantially the same.   The Republican's use of the CRA process to overturn the rule is an  extreme exercise in bad governance.   Rather than fixing or improving the rule, it would ban reporting by  the SSA entirely.   There would be no opportunity to simply improve aspects of the rule,  and we would prevent full implementation of the law we enacted after  the Virginia Tech shooting.   I cannot support that result and therefore oppose this resolution,  and I urge my colleagues to do the same.   Subverting long-standing gun safety laws under the guise of  protecting Constitutional rights, while simultaneously pushing for  repeal of health reform laws that provided care to these communities  rings hollow.   Now is not the time to weaken our background checks system by  excluding those with the most severe and incapacitating forms of mental  impairment.   The Social Security Administration should be commended for its  efforts to keep children and families safe by following the lead of  other agencies and enforcing laws that have been on the books for  decades.   I urge you to oppose this Republican scare tactic of a rule, and the  underlying bill.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:             An Amendment to H. Res. 71 Offered by Mr. McGovern         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       724) to provide that the Executive Order entitled       ``Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the       United States'' (January 27, 2017), shall have no force or       effect, to prohibit the use of Federal funds to enforce the       Executive Order, and for other purposes. All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate       shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour       equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After       general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment       under the five-minute rule. All points of order against       provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion of       consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall       rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as       may have been adopted. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to       final passage without intervening motion except one motion to       recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of       the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution       on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House       shall, immediately after the third daily order of business       under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the       Whole for further consideration of the bill.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 724.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous  question.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair  will reduce to 5 minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote on  the question of adoption of the resolution.
