 Mr. President, the Senate is preparing to vote on  Congressman Mick Mulvaney to lead the Office of Management and Budget.  This nomination may seem like it doesn't deserve a lot of attention  because we don't hear much outside of Washington about the OMB, the  Office of Management and Budget. It is kind of a wonky, obscure office,  with fewer than 500 staff members.   At a time when there are so many looming questions about this  Republic, about this administration, it is easy to overlook the  Congressman's nomination, but it actually matters very much,  particularly at this moment, and that is because the person who  controls the budget, the person who has the final say on fiscal and  financial priorities for the administration has immense power. This  position controls the President's budget, and that means that this  person can give the green light to programs and policies across the  Federal Government or stop them in their tracks. And because he has a  long track record as a legislator, Congressman Mulvaney has already  shown what kind of decisionmaker he will be if he is in charge of the  Office of Management and Budget, OMB.    I will be blunt. His record and his ideas are worrisome. It should  concern every Senator who is worried about some of the biggest issues  facing Americans, from Social Security, to public health, to the basic,  uninterrupted operations of the government itself. So this vote is a  moment of truth. It will determine where we really stand on the issues  that shape both individual lives and our country's future.   Let me highlight just four issues to show why this person is the  wrong person to run OMB.   The first is Social Security. More than 80 years ago, President  Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act into law. In doing so, he  created a national plan to provide economic security for American  workers. Since then, Social Security has proven to be the most  successful anti-poverty program in our history. Each year, it lifts  more than 20 million Americans, including 1 million children, out of  poverty.   It is hard to imagine a world without Social Security, but I want  everybody to understand that pre-Social Security, we had tens of  millions of Americans--more than we do now--who would be in poverty  upon retirement. So this program has actually reduced poverty among the  elderly more than any other program could possibly have accomplished.   Nowhere is Social Security more important than in Hawaii. More than  200,000 people receive Social Security benefits. For more than one in  four Hawaii seniors, Social Security is their only source of income.  And the money just isn't enough; it is about $14,000 a year. Just to  give folks an understanding of Hawaii, we are considered the second or  third most expensive housing market in the United States. We are after  New York and sometimes in second place or third place, depending on  where San Francisco is, but we are one of the most expensive places to  live in the United States. For one in four Social Security recipients,  that is all they get--$1,200 a month. Usually that will cover your  apartment. That will not cover your electricity, it won't cover your  utilities, it won't cover your food or clothing, and it won't cover  your healthcare.   Today, most working households have little or no retirement assets at  all, and many rely entirely on Social Security. This is partly because  employer-provided pensions are becoming a thing of the past. So Social  Security is more important than ever. It has become a pillar of our  retirement system  [[Page S1211]]  that continues to work well. It is a universal guaranteed source of  income that workers earn and depend on when they retire, but it is just  not enough.   I will just add that it is only in Washington, DC, where entertaining  the idea of cutting Social Security is considered moderate or  mainstream or conservative, even, or adult. I mean, there is this sense  that the way we ought to fix the challenges we have fiscally as a  country is to take it out of the hides of people who get $1,200 a month  to live.   Instead of strengthening the program, Mr. Mulvaney's ideas are very  radical. He has said he wants to systematically alter Social Security  by raising the retirement age to 70 years old. He wants to raise the  retirement age to 70 years old. This is not an obscure person being  appointed to an obscure post; this is a Member of Congress being  appointed to be the head of the Office of Management and Budget. We are  going to vote on him tomorrow, and everybody who says they are for  Social Security is about to vote for a person who wants to raise the  Social Security retirement age to 70 years old.   He has called Social Security a Ponzi scheme. When he worked in the  South Carolina State Senate, he voted to declare Social Security  unconstitutional. Again, he voted to declare Social Security  unconstitutional, and I predict he will get all of the Republican  votes. And all of these folks who say they wanted to protect your  Social Security, after they put Tom Price at the head of HHS, they are  about to put someone who is dedicated to undermining the most  successful anti-poverty program in American history.   When asked in his confirmation hearing--because, look, you are a  Member of Congress; you represent a certain constituency; you have  certain views. Some people are able to sort of pivot from their role as  a legislator, as a politician, and into a role as an appointee, a  Secretary, a nominee. So when he was asked in this confirmation hearing  if he would recommend that the President break a campaign promise to  leave Social Security alone, the Congressman said that he would  recommend that the President make cuts to the program. So this isn't  something he has recanted; this is something he stands by--up until and  including through his confirmation and his service at OMB.   But why make cuts to the most successful anti-poverty program in  American history? Why would we make cuts to a program that is financed  by its own revenue stream and by law does not add $1 to the deficit?  Why would we cut benefits now just because we may have to cut them in  20 years? If we are going to change Social Security, let's do it in a  way that expands benefits for generations to come. Let's lift the cap  on taxable earnings. Let's remove the wage cap that unfairly shelters  the highest earning Americans from paying into the Social Security  trust fund that the majority of hard-working Americans do.   Here is how it works. The cap is roughly $120,000. So you pay Social  Security--almost everybody pays Social Security tax, up to $120,000 in  income. That is mostly everybody, right. But if you make $120,000, all  of that is taxed up to $120,000. If you make $70,000, it is taxed up to  $70,000. If you make $120 million in income, your first $120,000 is  taxed for Social Security purposes; everything else is taxed at zero  for Social Security purposes.    My view is that every dollar of income should be taxed for Social  Security purposes, and that does two things: First, we are going to be  in a position to increase benefits--not massively, but every little bit  counts. Second, we will be able to increase the solvency of the Social  Security trust fund to the year 2049.   Most every family has a Social Security story, whether it is a  grandmother who relies on the program's benefits to pay for groceries,  a father who suffered a debilitating injury after decades of hard work  and receives much needed Social Security disability benefits, or a  widowed mother who relies on Social Security survivors benefits to  bring up her children.   In my own home, we have three generations living together--my wife  Linda and me; our kids, Tyler and Mia; and Linda's parents, George and  Ping Kwok. George Kwok lived the American dream. He ran a chop suey  house, a Chinese restaurant in Honolulu, Kwok's Chop Suey, and worked  hard all his life to give opportunities to his kids, until his eyes  gave out. Like 200,000 seniors across Hawaii, he now relies on Social  Security--SSDI--Social Security disability.   I tell you about my family not because we are unique but because we  are not, because we are like so many families in Hawaii and across the  country. And with the number of retirees growing, we need to do  everything we can to strengthen this program, not to weaken it.   After a lifetime of hard work, seniors deserve to retire with the  dignity and the benefits they have earned. This is a promise from the  Federal Government. The current generation of Americans must keep our  promises to seniors, but given his record, I am convinced that  Congressman Mulvaney will try to do the opposite.   The second issue I am concerned about is the basic operations of  government. Whether you are a member of the military, a visitor to a  national park, or a worker looking to retire in the near future, we all  need for the government to fulfill its basic obligations. But  Congressman Mulvaney voted to default on the U.S. debt several times,  and he did it in the face of warnings from the U.S. Treasury that this  would be unprecedented and catastrophic for our economy and that it  could drive the world deep into another recession just as we were  finally recovering from the last one.   Think about how markets would react if the U.S. Government declared  that it would not make good on its financial obligations. The stock  markets would go crazy, and not in a good way. That would be terrible  for the millions of people who invest their savings in the market for  their retirement.   The Congressman has also voted several times to shut down the Federal  Government, all in the name of getting his way. I cannot emphasize  enough how dangerous his approach to government is. It is one thing as  a Member of the House Freedom Caucus, as a Member of the U.S. House of  Representatives--there are 435; you can take positions--but it doesn't  have quite the direct impact that the Office of Management and Budget  does. He has put party and partisan views over some of the most  fundamental and basic principles of our government. To close the  government, to stop paying our bills, to make people across the planet  question the full faith and credit of the United States is beyond  comprehension.   It should take a real crisis to pull Congress away from the  negotiating table and all the challenges in front of us. But it  actually wasn't a crisis that led the Congressman to vote to close our  government; it was Planned Parenthood and the ACA. While we may  disagree about the best approach on healthcare and even on reproductive  choice and women's health, those disagreements should never get in the  way of the U.S. Government going about its business. Yet Congressman  Mulvaney's actions went against that basic principle.   With respect to our Democratic institutions, the procedural violence  that was done to the U.S. Congress is hard to overstate in this case.  The idea that a faction of a party would demand concessions--and I  think we remember this--would demand concessions in exchange for  satisfying their infliction of pain on the United States is  unbelievable. And why? Because we are all Americans here. We all want  to do right by our country. So the idea that one party would be willing  to inflict terrible pain on the country, or else, was so beyond the  pale that there is no rule against it, there is no law against it. And  do you know why there is no rule and no law against it? It is because  nobody contemplated that a major political party would behave in such a  way. The assumption has always been that elected leaders would find a  better way to stand up for their strongly held beliefs than by  threatening to bring the American economy to its knees. Up until the  shutdown led by the Congressman, that had been a safe assumption.   In 2011, Congress's delay in raising the debt limit forced the  Department of Treasury to take what they call extraordinary measures to  ensure that our government could pay its bills.  [[Page S1212]]  GAO estimates that this raised Treasury's borrowing costs by about $1.3  billion in fiscal year 2011. That is $1.3 billion in added government  costs just for coming close to defaulting. The Bipartisan Policy Center  projects that the full cost of that crisis to the Federal Government  alone--not to the private sector economy, just the Federal Government-- was around $20 billion over the maturity of that debt.   There is nothing conservative about defaulting on what we owe. It  cripples free markets. It is Russian roulette playing, with a bullet in  every chamber. There is nothing conservative about that.   When the government closed in 2013, we paid Federal workers to stay  home. I want everybody to understand what we ended up doing. Listen, it  wasn't their fault. These government employees are not the ones who  screwed up; it was the Congress that screwed up. We paid dedicated  Federal workers who want to do their jobs, not to do their jobs. We  forced them to stay home and paid them anyway. I defy you to find a  conservative outside of the Halls of Congress who finds that to be a  conservative proposition. It is one thing to shut down the government  for a couple of weeks and accrue the savings. I think that is inhumane,  I think that is bananas, but at least you would save the money. These  folks ended up paying all the money out and just forcing government  workers to not do their jobs. This is not the left or right; this is  upside down. We prevented Federal workers from doing their important  work, like assisting small businesses and combating terrorism.   Ultimately, the 2013 shutdown was a bad move for our economy and for  our budget. It cost us money instead of saving us money. In just the  first week, it cost the economy $1.6 billion in lost economic output,  and it cost about $160 million a day on the private sector side.   Worst of all, the Congressman has not seen the error of this. There  were a lot of Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle who--in  the heat of the battle, you sort of think the other side is going to  back off and listen. We all learn lessons. We all make mistakes. There  are a lot of Republicans who went through that shutdown and said: We  never want to do that to the country again. But Congressman Mulvaney  has not seen the error of his ways. He still believes the government  shutdown was a good idea, and he said so at the confirmation hearing.   Senator McCaskill asked if he still thought the shutdown was the  right way to go about things, and he answered yes. He answered yes.  This kind of budget brinkmanship is not good for our government, to say  the least, but it is certainly a bad fit for the person running the  OMB.   The third issue I want to talk about is the Congressman's rejection  of the role of public health and science. If we look at some of the  biggest issues our country faces, it is clear that we need an OMB  Director who understands the value of science, research, and public  health. But the Congressman has said that climate change is based on  ``questionable science'' and ``baseless claims.'' He has asked if we  need government-funded research at all. These are not the views we  should see from the person who directs the budget of the executive  branch.   In September of last year, Congressman Mulvaney posted a statement  about Zika on Facebook. He said:         I have received all sorts of email and Facebook comments       this week on Zika. Some people want me to pass a ``clean''       bill (which I suppose means not paying for it with spending       reductions elsewhere.) Other folks want us to fund more       research if we can find a way to pay for it.        No one has written me yet, though, to ask what might be the       best question: Do we really need government research at all?       Do we really need government funded research at all?    In his statement, he goes on to ask questions that many have asked  about what we are seeing in Brazil, as opposed to other countries  affected by Zika. But that is exactly why you do the research. It is  not for a Member of Congress to referee how much money should go to CDC  and play amateur scientist. We have expert agencies. The CDC did an  extraordinary job, not just on Zika but on Ebola. They have done  extraordinary work over the decades in keeping people safe. If he is  saying there are some scientific mysteries remaining around Zika, that  is absolutely true. That is why we need to give the CDC and the  National Institutes of Health money to try to figure this out. Those  questions are the very reasons we need government-funded research, not  an excuse to get rid of it.   I want to be clear as to why this matters so much. I am not trying to  catch him saying something that is a little off. There is a  foundational, bipartisan consensus around public health research, and  the person who has been nominated to run the Federal budget doesn't  appear to believe in that research. This isn't just out of the  political mainstream. People will die if he implements his point of  view.   Look at some of the diseases where government-funded research has had  a significant impact on saving lives: Ebola, HIV/AIDS, malaria, polio,  to name a few. We have made the advances we see today because the  government stepped in and invested in the research, and that has to  continue.   Right around the time we debated funding for Zika, I visited the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, in Atlanta to learn  more about their efforts to combat Zika, dengue, and other diseases. I  left Atlanta feeling totally confident that the CDC will help our  country with challenges like Zika. Millions of Americans are counting  on the government to maintain that confidence. But that can happen only  if CDC has the strongest funding possible so they can continue to do  their good work.   Taking money away from the Prevention and Public Health Fund would  strip the CDC and other important agencies of the funds they need to  protect our country from within and from without. That is what happened  in Congress. The legislative branch did not fully step up to the plate  and do its job in addressing Zika. Because of that, we forced the Obama  administration to pull money from the CDC to address Ebola or from  States to address other public health risks. Doing so disrupted public  health infrastructure planning across the world that we still need to  make sure that Ebola never ravages communities again.   Regardless of your side of the aisle, we can all agree this is the  one thing that government has to do; that is, to keep us physically  safe. Investing in CDC and other agencies that protect our citizens  from diseases shouldn't depend on your philosophy of government. Unless  you believe in, literally, no government, this is money well spent.  This is the kind of thing the government does. We cannot walk away from  our country's legacy of funding good research that saves lives, but  that is exactly what Congressman Mulvaney suggests we do.   He has also made deeply disturbing comments about the science behind  climate change. There can be no doubt that climate change is real, that  it is caused by humans, and that we have a responsibility to take  action. We ignore the science that shows us this at our own risk, and  it is a risk our country cannot take.   The fourth and final issue I want to touch upon is healthcare-- specifically, Medicare and Medicaid. I am a little worried that people  feel reassured because of the rhetoric they heard last year from the  President. He did reassure his voters that he was going to save  Medicare and Medicaid and protect it from cuts. He promised several  times that he wouldn't make any cuts whatsoever to Medicare and  Medicaid. But when a Senator reminded Congressman Mulvaney about this  during his confirmation hearing, he did not say he would support the  administration's promises to the American people. He said that he would  advise the President to break that promise. He said that he would  advise President Trump to break his campaign promise and change  Medicare and Medicaid. Why are we voting for this person? He said that  he would advise the President to break the promise and change Medicare,  Medicaid, and Social Security.   He wants to cut Medicaid--a program that millions of people rely  upon. More than 50 years ago, when Medicaid was created, Congress made  a really smart decision and designed the program so that if and when  healthcare costs rise or the economy starts to struggle, Medicaid would  be there for the American people, no matter what. Now the counselor to  the President says that as part of the ACA replacement plan, Medicaid  will be converted to block grants.  [[Page S1213]]    I worry a little bit about the phrasing ``block grants'' because that  doesn't sound that bad. I used to work in the not-for-profit sector. I  like grants, and I used to pursue Community Development Block Grants,  Community Services Block Grants. I like grants; I like Medicaid. I am  not sure whether ``block'' means anything positively or negatively, but  I want everybody to understand what block-granting Medicaid means: It  means cutting Medicaid. That is exactly what it means. It is a  euphemism. People in this administration and people nominated to be  part of this administration share that view, and they have a long  history to back it up.   The term ``block grants'' is a euphemism. It is not quite a lie, but  it is a way to describe something so that you don't know what it is.  They are calling it a block grant because they don't want to say they  are cutting Medicaid. That is what they are doing; they are going to  cut Medicaid, and these cuts will hurt millions of people. They will  hurt working families.   Everybody understands Medicaid is there for the economically  indigent, in the case of an emergency. But the thing that people also  don't realize--and that is a really important aspect of that program-- but it is also really important for nursing home care. That is not just  an issue for people who are down on their luck financially or while  they are young or while they are parents. When people get older, it is  really difficult to afford nursing home care. For most people who are  not extraordinarily wealthy, Medicaid is the way to handle nursing home  care. It is reimbursable.   I know that nursing home care in Hawaii costs $8,000, $9,000 a month.  I don't know anybody who can run through $8,000, $9,000 a month for  very long. I know a couple of people, but most people I know can't do  that without Medicaid. Certainly, Medicaid is an issue that affects the  very poor, but it also affects the rest of us. It affects people who  aren't just lying on a pile of cash to take care of their grandmother  or their mother or their father or their spouse when they are in their  golden years.   These cuts will hurt women who need Medicaid for maternal health  services, as well as seniors and people with disabilities. These people  have nowhere else to turn. Medicaid is their only option.   Some people point to expanded local control as a reason to move  forward with block grants. That is just nonsense. They are basically  going to flatten out or cut the amount a State gets, and then they can  sit there and divide up an increasingly smaller pie. I am not sure if  that is even a euphemism. That is just nonsense. That will not help any  State to meet their needs. That is why Republican Governors--anybody  with responsibility for actually governing, delivering services to  their constituents--don't want to cut Medicaid. They don't want to  reduce Medicaid expansion under ACA, and they certainly don't want a  block grant because they know what that will mean. Even if you are a  fiscal conservative, if you are in charge of a State, you understand  exactly what is going to happen to your constituents if Medicaid is  cut.   This is another instance of a party that promised not to touch  Medicaid. But here we are, debating a nominee to lead the OMB who wants  to make cuts to this program. This is a deal breaker for me and for  many others, and it will be a disaster for millions of Americans. That  is why today we have to stand up for seniors, for women, for children  and fight any cuts to Medicaid. That starts with voting no on this  nomination.   I have heard about Congressman Mulvaney from hundreds of people from  the State of Hawaii. I want to share a few of the messages that I have  received from people in Hawaii.   Here is what one man from Oahu wrote:         As a researching scientist, I recognize the very       significant damage these appointees will have on US health       and competitiveness in the world.        A break in research funding, or politically-directed and       censored research, impacts long term research. A brief hiatus       can result in many years set-back of programs and resulting       societal benefits.    A woman from Volcano Village on the Big Island sent me this message:         [This administration's] agenda lies in [the] nominees for       the department of Health and Human Services and the Office of       Management and Budget who have spent their congressional       careers trying to destroy [Social Security, Medicare, and       Medicaid].    Another woman wrote me with this:         [The] nominees for HHS and OMB are walking disasters for       the department they'd lead.        Both have spent their congressional careers trying to       destroy [Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid]. Oh, yes,       and the ACA/Obamacare, which has proven to be resoundingly       popular.    We are hearing from so many people on these issues because they  understand how this works. They understand that personnel is policy.  You don't get to say you are for protecting Social Security, and then  vote for someone who wants to eliminate Social Security as we know it.  You don't get to say you are for protecting Medicare and Medicaid, and  then vote for someone who has dedicated their career to eliminating or  at least seriously undermining this program.   If you want to increase the Social Security retirement age, then this  is your nominee. If you aren't opposed to seeing our country go through  a series of precipices with the shutdown of the Federal Government-- from the huge drops in the market to the closing of our National  Parks--then this is your nominee. If you think Federal investments in  public health, disease control, and prevention should be eliminated,  then this is your nominee. If you want to see cuts to Medicare and  Medicaid by 25 percent or more, then vote yes.   But if, like me, you know that this is not the right approach to  governing, that this is not how we should go about caring for our  people and preparing for the future, then you need to vote no.   At the end of the day, the leader of the Office of Management and  Budget will need to understand how to build a budget for our country  and make sure U.S. Government agencies have the resources they need to  pursue the mission. This person will need to understand why diplomacy  matters, why Medicare and Medicaid matter, why job training and  education programs matter, and why financial and fiscal stability  matters. Ultimately, he needs to know that government matters and that  it can make a difference in people's lives. It determines how bright  tomorrow can be for our kids and grandkids and how safe of a world we  can create for them.   Congressman Mulvaney does not have that record or a confirmation  hearing record that can convince any of us that he understands the  potential we all have--the obligation we have--to make the right  investments that reflect who we are and the future that we want as a  country. That is why I will be voting no on this confirmation, and I  urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
