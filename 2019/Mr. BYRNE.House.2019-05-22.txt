 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mel Showers upon  his retirement from WKRG in Mobile, Alabama, after a remarkable 50-year  career.   Mel holds a special place in the hearts of many in southwest Alabama  and the Florida panhandle. So many grew up watching his reporting and  grew to trust him over the years.   Mel's career is notable not only because of its length, but also  because of the barriers he overcame to become one of the first African  American reporters and, later, anchors in the Deep South. A man of  lesser perseverance and integrity could not have overcome these  obstacles with such grace.   Mel deserves our utmost respect, and we will miss seeing him every  evening.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Mel. I offer my heartfelt thanks for his  many contributions to our community over the years, and I wish him the  best of luck in his retirement.                         Remembering Billy Middleton     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mourn the loss of the  longtime mayor of Loxley, Alabama, Billy Middleton. After a long, hard- fought battle, Mayor Middleton succumbed to cancer last week at 78  years old.   Billy was first elected mayor in 1988, and before his passing, he was  serving a remarkable seventh term.   His longevity was no accident. A former marine, Mayor Middleton was a  true public servant whose dedication to his community extended far  beyond his official duties and endeared him to the people of southwest  Alabama. His community is better because he was a part of it.   Mr. Speaker, I offer my sincerest condolences to his wife, Lilly, and  the many family and friends he leaves behind. Billy's memory and  service to the close-knit town of Loxley will last long beyond his  death.                            ____________________
