 Madam Speaker, I retired from law enforcement 8 years  ago, but I am still amazed by and grateful for the men and women who  rush towards danger with little regard for their own safety.   First responders already do so much, but when there is a true  emergency, a crisis, there is no one else who can do the job. That is  why, when America was attacked on September 11, off-duty firefighters,  law enforcement officers, and medical professionals showed up, and they  joined their brothers and sisters on the front line, rushing into  burning buildings.   Being a first responder is not just what they do, it is who they are.  They have earned our unwavering and timely support. We cannot ask our  first responders to do this job while failing to cope with the  consequences.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this critical  legislation. Let us never forget our heroes.
