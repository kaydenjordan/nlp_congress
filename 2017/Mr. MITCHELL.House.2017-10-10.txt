 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a fallen hero. Tragically,  Michigan State Trooper Timothy O'Neill made the ultimate sacrifice in  an on-duty motorcycle accident.   I rise to offer my support and love to Trooper O'Neill's friends,  family, and all who were fortunate enough to know him. As the proud  parent of a police officer, I can only imagine the pain you must feel.  Words are inadequate at such a time of sorrow, but please know you are  in my prayers.   Trooper O'Neill was known by his friends, fiancee, and family for his  sense of humor, compassion for animals, and deep love for his family.  He is also remembered for his commitment to bettering our community and  our safety.   I ask my colleagues and all those watching to join me in a prayer for  Trooper O'Neill; his fiancee, Carli Hicks; parents, Kristine and  Michael O'Neill; siblings, Sara O'Neill and Brian O'Neill; and his  entire family.   May God bless them all.                            ____________________
