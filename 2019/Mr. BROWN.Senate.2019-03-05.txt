 Madam President, I thank my friend from Cincinnati for his  work on both the issues he spoke about--both, on sex trafficking, which  is a terrible affliction in our country and especially in Ohio, and on  the issue of opioid deaths. We lose almost 100 people a week in Ohio to  overdoses, and more than 11 a day on opioid overdoses. So I thank my  colleague from Cincinnati for that.                            ____________________     Madam President, this week, General Motors is set to lay  off thousands of workers in Lordstown, OH, and around the country.  Tomorrow is the day that most of the first shift lose their jobs.  Several months ago, the second shift lost their jobs. A couple years  ago, the third shift lost their jobs. That totals about 4,500 human  beings with families.   What is the President's response? He boasts nonsense and rubs salt in  these workers' wounds. Last week, as if he didn't know about Lordstown  and other places, he said: We have car companies opening up in Michigan  and Ohio and Pennsylvania and so many other places.   I don't know where those mystery factories are in Ohio that the  President brags about. They aren't in Lordstown, where people are about  to lose those jobs. President Trump's remarks, his uncaring feelings,  and his ignorance of even knowing what has happened in Ohio--the State  he seems to boast about and credit for his victory--are a slap in the  face to the workers, and there is the fact that he has done nothing to  help.   Think about the workers who are out of a job at the end of the week.  Think about their families. Think about the other families in Lordstown  who are about to lose customers.   Senator Portman and I spent a lot of time working with General  Motors, visiting a restaurant near the plant and talking to the workers  there who know their jobs are affected as fewer Lordstown workers come  to that restaurant. Multiply that with hardware stores, police and fire  jobs and teacher jobs and all that afflicts the Mahoning Valley when GM  does what it does.   Remember what Donald Trump promised people in communities like  Youngstown. He said that he would fight for them, that he would fight  for their jobs. Last year, he told the people of Mahoning Valley-- Mahoning Valley is Youngstown, Warren, Lordstown, and that area:  ``Don't move.''   These are the President's words:         Don't move, don't sell your house. We're going to fill up       those factories or rip them down and build new ones.    He said:         We never again will sacrifice Ohio jobs and those in other       states to enrich other countries.    Think about that. The President of the United States comes in, in the  midst of these GM layoffs, and says: Don't sell your house. Don't move.  We are going to fill those factories up. If  [[Page S1667]]  we don't fill them up, we are going to rip them down and build new  ones.   He went on to say: Workers will come back. Jobs will come back from  these countries.   Then, even when I called and talked to him about the second-shift  layoff, he didn't even know about it. I am not sure what his staff is  telling him. Maybe FOX doesn't cover these stories, but the mainstream  media does. These are real stories. These aren't political opinions.  Some 4,500 people lost their jobs, and the President doesn't seem to  know or care.   Those weren't the only promises he made. Over and over, Candidate  Trump and then-President Trump promised American autoworkers that he  would fight for their jobs.   In Warren, just a few miles from Lordstown, in 2016, he said: ``If  I'm elected, you won't lose one plant, I promise you that.'' ``If I'm  elected, you won't lose one plant, I promise you that.''   In Michigan in the fall of 2016--another State with a lot of auto  jobs--he said: ``We will bring back your auto manufacturing business  like you have never seen it before.''   In February 2017, he promised again: ``A lot of jobs are going to be  coming back into Ohio and Michigan and Pennsylvania and all the places  that have been hurt so badly.''   In March 2017, he said: ``The assault on the American auto industry,  believe me, is over.''   Last year, after GM announced the layoffs, he said: ``Ohio is going  to replace those jobs like in two minutes.'' ``Ohio is going to replace  those jobs like in two minutes.''   First of all, why would he say this stuff? Second, does he not ever  follow the news? Does his staff not tell him what has happened in the  seventh largest State in the country and the State that he in part  credits for his election? He lost the popular vote by 3 million votes.  He won the electoral college because of Ohio and because of two or  three other States. But wouldn't he know that a valley of 450,000  people, just during the time since the election, has lost 4,500 jobs  just in that plant alone, and another 5,000 manufacturing jobs that  make the components that go into the Chevy Cruze, and another 5,000 to  6,000 to 8,000 to 10,000 jobs? Nobody knows for sure how many they will  lose in restaurants, hardware stores, and car dealerships and cuts in  public dollars because the local governments have lost tax revenue so  there are fewer police and fire and street cleaners and people who work  in the cities, the counties, and the school districts.   The workers who are going to be out of a job by this week are still  waiting. These people trusted him. President Trump did really well in  the election in this valley of 450,000 people. He did really well.   He did really well. He did better than Republicans ever do, but what  did he do for them after he made those promises? I am going to make a  statement that is provably true but almost doesn't even make sense that  it could be true. His tax bill says: If you do your production in  Lordstown, OH, you pay a 21-percent tax rate, but if you move your  production to Mexico, you pay a 10.5-percent tax rate.   In other words, because of Trump's tax law that, frankly, was written  down the hall in Senator McConnell's office but with the President's  signature on it, these companies get a 50-percent-off coupon for moving  overseas. Think about that. If these companies move overseas, they get  a 50-percent-off coupon on their taxes.   I talked to the President about that. I asked him to reconsider that  law, and he said: ``Where did that law come from?''   I said: ``Well, Mr. President, it was in your tax bill, and you  signed it.''   Then I talked to him about the American Cars, American Jobs Act and  how he can fix this. Here is what the bill does. Customers who buy cars  made in the United States get a $3,500 discount at the dealership. If  the American car is electric or a plug-in hybrid, they get an even  bigger discount. These are the cars GM said it was going to start  making instead of the Cruze. There is no reason they can't make them in  Lordstown instead of Mexico.   Second, companies that cut the number of American jobs they had on  the day the GOP tax bill passed, if they move those jobs overseas, they  lose their tax breaks. Under my bill, the American Cars, American Jobs  Act, they lose their tax breaks, they lose that 50-percent-off coupon,  and then that money they have to pay because they lose their tax break  goes to car consumers at the dealerships, meaning they will buy more  American cars. So what will happen is it will actually do what  Candidate Trump said he wanted to do and promised that he would do, and  that is to bring American jobs back.   This President who says: ``I am the workers' best friend, and I fight  for these jobs,'' that is phony populism. Do you know something?  Populism is never racist. Populism is never anti-Semitic. Populism  doesn't divide people. Populism doesn't push people down to lift people  up. Populism doesn't give tax cuts to rich people and then turn around  and cut Medicare and Head Start. Populism fights for people and fights  to lift up all workers. That is what we are not seeing here now.   I am calling on the President, again, to try keeping his promises and  actually fight for autoworkers, fight for these communities like  Lordstown, and help us pass the Americans Cars, American Jobs Act, end  the tax cut for corporations to shut down American plants and move jobs  overseas, and take this 50-percent-off coupon away that some of the  richest people and biggest corporations in this country enjoy when they  send jobs overseas because if you love your country, you fight for the  people who make it work.                            ____________________     Madam President, the last vote we took today was about  Americans' healthcare. It was about consumer protections for  preexisting conditions that are at risk because of partisan judges.   The Presiding Officer was running for the Senate at the time and  wasn't in this body, but I assume she knows, and all of us remember the  day when the repeal of the Affordable Care Act failed.   The people on that side of the aisle, the Republicans, were all  voting to take away consumer protections for preexisting conditions.  That was part of the vote for the repeal. Among other things, it was to  cut people off Medicaid, many of whom were getting treatment for opioid  addiction, and it was to take away the consumer protections for  preexisting conditions. That is when people can't get insurance because  they are sick or they get their insurance canceled because they are too  expensive. They are sick, their insurance is too expensive, and the  insurance companies come down on them.   So the stage was set. The Republican Members who said they wanted to  preserve preexisting conditions, many of them ran their campaigns on-- because they knew the voters were very upset with Republicans for  trying to take away the consumer protections on preexisting conditions,  they ran their campaigns on that issue. So the Republicans quickly  flipped and said: Well, we are going to protect you too.   Well, tomorrow is the day we have a chance to really protect the  consumers with preexisting conditions and to keep the protections for  consumers with preexisting conditions. The problem is, they can't do it  in Congress. They can't take it away because voters don't like it if  they take away the protections so they do it through the Federal  judiciary. That is how they work around here.   These partisan judges who are voted out of here--maybe the worst one  yet is from Columbus, OH, named Chad Readler. Last summer, Readler did  what three career attorneys with the Department of Justice refused to  do--he filed a brief challenging the law protecting Americans with  preexisting conditions.   He was the person in the Trump administration who was the point  person for taking away the consumer protections protecting Americans  against losing their insurance because of a preexisting condition.   Do you know what? After he filed that brief, the very next day the  lights went on. The very next day, Chad Readler was nominated for a  lifetime appointment to the Sixth Circuit Court--the next day.   He did his work for the insurance companies. He did his work for the  Trump White House. He did his work for the Republican majority who is  going to take away any consumer protections. What is his reward? I  guess  [[Page S1668]]  you can't say ``payoff'' because there were no dollars actually  exchanged, but the reward that this party--the Senate majority leader  down the hall and the President of the United States--gave the guy who  wants to take those protections away and do the bidding of the  insurance company is a lifetime--I don't know, $180,000, $200,000-a- year, whatever it is--Federal judgeship. It is for life. Mr. Readler is  in his forties, so lifetime could be a very long time.   The arguments he made were unprecedented. Three career attorneys  withdrew from the case after Readler made that decision. One went so  far as to resign in objection to the Department of Justice's  unprecedented actions.   Our Republican colleague Senator Alexander from Tennessee called  Readler's arguments as farfetched as he had ever seen. This is a  Republican saying that the Trump White House's Department of Justice  Chad Readler's, Acting Assistant Attorney General, logic was as  farfetched as he had ever seen.   We saw what happened with the Texas decision in December, going along  with Readler's arguments and threatening the healthcare coverage of 20  million Americans; that is, 20 million people because of a decision he  made.   Judges are deciding the fate of Americans' healthcare right now.  Judges are. It is not their elected body. It is judges who are taking  away healthcare. The elected officials failed to take it away. They  tried. They tried, and they tried. They did it 50 times in the House.  They tried in the Senate. We defeated it by one vote. The Vice  President was here on behalf of the President just in case he had to  break the tie. He didn't have to because we defeated it by one vote. He  didn't get to break the tie.   Now it is judges. Judges decide right now. We can't afford to put one  of the White House's ringleaders in the fight to dismantle healthcare  protections on the bench for life.   It is not just healthcare. It is LGBTQ rights. It is women's rights.  It is voting rights. Judges make decisions right now that eliminate and  limit Americans' rights for a generation.    On these issues, the President's nominees for the Sixth Circuit, Chad  Readler and the other one, Eric Murphy, have a proven record of  fighting to strip Americans of their rights.   Get this. Chad Readler not only supported the death penalty for  minors, for 16-year-olds, as a private citizen, he took it upon himself  to pen an op-ed saying he wanted to allow the execution of 16-year- olds--the execution of 16-year-olds. Think about that.   Apparently, he thinks it is OK for a mistake someone makes as a child  to not only get them locked up for life but to actually take away their  life altogether. What kind of person writes an editorial calling for  the execution of 16-year-olds, and we are going to put him on the  Federal court for life?   At a time when we are taking important bipartisan steps forward on  sentencing reform, how do you turn around and put someone on the bench  for life who supports executing children? A 16-year-old is still a  teenager, a child, in our State, in our country, and in our society.   During his nomination hearing, Readler stood by his op-ed. He refused  to disavow his support for using the death penalty on high schoolers.   As for Eric Murphy, he argued against marriage equality in the  landmark Obergefell v. Hodges case. That is why Jim Obergefell has  spoken out against his nomination.   He worked to restrict access to contraceptives for women, and my  favorite, he defended Big Tobacco because those companies were doing  such useful things for our country. As a lawyer, he defended Big  Tobacco.   He also defended Ohio's voter purge. Think about the anniversary we  will mark this week. This Thursday will mark 54 years, to the day,  since Bloody Sunday.   Last weekend, my wife Connie and I were in Selma and walked across  the Selma bridge. For me, it was the fifth time. I took my teenage  daughters once. I took my mother, who was born in a small town in the  South and taught me about civil rights. My wife and I went. We went  back again this year to walk across the Edmund Pettus Bridge.   I listened to their stories. Women and men were beaten, their blood  was spilled, and their homes were broken into. Why? Because people of  color couldn't vote in many places in this country, and Alabama was one  of those places. They were willing to suffer and, in some cases, die so  they could have a right to vote. That was only a half century ago. That  happened only 54 years ago.   Judges around this country, all the way to the Supreme Court, are  systematically dismantling those rights. Without question, they are  taking away people's right to vote by voter suppression. We can't let  the sacrifices of the foot soldiers in Selma be in vain.   It is pretty despicable that a bunch of Members of Congress who have  health insurance are willing to take it away for millions of people.  That is pretty despicable. It is also despicable that Members of this  body are going to mark this anniversary by putting another judge on the  bench for life who will work to undo that legacy, who will likely be  another judge ruling to send us back to those days, and who will  rubberstamp modern-day poll taxes and literacy tests. They will not  exactly do poll taxes and literacy tests, but they will find plenty of  ways to take voters off the rolls.   We know the Governor's race in Georgia was essentially stolen from  the African-American woman who was the nominee because of the sitting  Secretary of State--oh, yes, who happened to be running for Governor.  We know that. We know the election in Georgia was stolen. We know  voters were purged prior to that election by the Secretary of State,  who happened to be running for Governor.   I ask my colleagues, if you will not listen to me, listen to those  foot soldiers in Selma, listen to the civil rights leaders who ask you  to reject these judges.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
