 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 100th  anniversary of the 115th Combat Support Hospital headquartered in Fort  Polk, Louisiana.   The 115th Combat Support Hospital was established in 1918 and is  recognized as having the highest combat injury survival rate in the  world. The unit has been deployed in World War I, World War II, Desert  Storm, and the Iraq war.   In World War II, the 115th Combat Support Hospital received the  Meritorious Unit Commendation for its work while on the front lines  across Europe.   The 115th Combat Support Hospital has become the standard for all  medical units and a central asset for Fort Polk, the Joint Readiness  Training Center, and the United States Army.   I had the incredible opportunity to witness the work that the  hospital does when the unit set up at Camp Beauregard in Pineville,  Louisiana, to celebrate their centennial anniversary.   These soldiers enter the field, build a facility, and become a fully  functioning hospital in a matter of hours. The unit and its facilities,  which include an emergency room, operating room, pharmacy, and lab, are  all trained to set up in 12 to 18 hours.   The 115th Combat Support Hospital also contains subordinate units  that provide optical care, veterinary services, preventive medicine,  and a ground ambulance company.                                time  1115    The work they do saves lives and allows troops to return home and  back to their families. I am thankful for the honorable men and women  that comprise the 115th Combat Support Hospital, as they reflect the  absolute best of the United States Army.   The 115th Combat Support Hospital is truly a great asset to our  military. Today, I join our country and all members, both past and  present, of the 115th Combat Support Hospital in celebrating 100 years  of lifesaving work. I look forward to continuing to witness their  successes and achievements at Fort Polk for many years to come.                            ____________________
