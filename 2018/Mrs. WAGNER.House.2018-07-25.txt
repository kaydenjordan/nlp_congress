 Mr. Speaker, in April, my bill, the Fight Online Sex  Trafficking Act, or FOSTA, became law. FOSTA allows Federal, State, and  local prosecutors to go after the online businesses that are  trafficking our children.   Signing FOSTA into law has decimated the online sex trade that fuels  human trafficking in America. Scores of major websites that promoted  sex trafficking and prostitution have shut down, and countless lives  have been saved.   Our communities are better off now because of FOSTA: fewer victims  are being trafficked; buyers are no longer able to easily purchase  women and children; and fewer pimps are getting their payday.   The online slave trade has never been more fragile than today.   After passage of FOSTA, global ad volume declined 87 percent from the  daily average. Websites that dominated the illegal sex trade shut down  for fear of being prosecuted. Websites like Massage Tolls, The Erotic  Review, and Escorts in College are gone.   Household names like Reddit, Google, PayPal, and Microsoft updated  their terms of service to ensure that platforms aren't being abused by  traffickers.   Additionally, the Department of Justice shut down backpage.com, and  its owners were arrested.   Right now, we have this criminal enterprise on its heels. Buyers and  pimps don't know where to turn, and traffickers are getting 90 percent  fewer responses than they got on Backpage and the other leading  trafficking sites that shut down.   The bottom line is websites are doing everything they can to avoid  criminal liability, while trying to keep their criminal enterprise  alive. But the loopholes that they were utilizing no longer exist.   Financial institutions are also cracking down on accounts used by  trafficking. CC Bill, the payment processor of these porn and  trafficking hubs stopped processing credit cards for websites that  facilitate prostitution.                                time  1100    CC Bill was the domestic credit card processor of last resort, and  websites are now struggling to find a viable alternative.   Together, we are putting the online slave trade out of business. As  trafficking becomes less profitable, fewer victims will ever be sold  and raped.  [[Page H7166]]    FOSTA is striking fear in the hearts of America's pimps and online  predators.   Law enforcement is seeing real results, and that is why FOSTA is  being called the most significant anti-trafficking law in nearly 20  years. Experts have repeatedly said that sex trafficking will flourish  until market force of risk is increased and we create a real criminal  deterrent. FOSTA establishes that deterrent, and as a result, fewer  businesses will ever, ever enter the sex trade.   Sex advertising is at a new low for this decade. And this Congress  has demonstrated that we can and will hold accountable the businesses  that profit from the sale of our most vulnerable.   It is because of the massive bipartisan majorities of both the House  and the Senate that FOSTA is law today. The results we are seeing in  our communities are proof that Congress can, and does, work together to  achieve real results for the American people.   Lives have been saved, fewer children and women are being sold into  slavery, and trafficking and prostitution websites are being shut down.  We are delivering real results for real people and our country is  better off now because of it.                            ____________________
