 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember our  13 fallen servicemembers who made the ultimate sacrifice to save the  lives of Americans and our allies in Afghanistan.   These brave men and women--including southern California marines  Lance Corporal Dylan Merola, Lance Corporal Kareem Nikoui, and Corporal  Hunter Lopez--were young, many in their 20s and incredibly brave,  valiantly putting their lives on the line for others.   Their valiant efforts, courage, and heroism in the face of danger  will never be forgotten.   We remember their names and their stories always, and we rally with  our new Gold Star families.   My heart is also with our wounded soldiers, including Marine Corporal  David Nick Traylor from La Habra in my 39th Congressional District.  Thankfully, he is safe and is in good care. I am praying for safety for  them and their loved ones.                            ____________________
