 Madam President, I come to the floor today to discuss  the urgent need for Congress to provide relief for recent agricultural  disasters.   I appreciate that circumstances around the appropriations process  have changed somewhat since we prepared these remarks, but what I  really want to do this afternoon is to highlight the devastating  experiences of New Hampshire growers this year and explain why it is so  urgent for them that Congress provide disaster relief.   In New Hampshire, our growers have faced an unprecedented difficult  year. A late frost on the evening of May 18 caused enormous damage to  fruit crops across New Hampshire but especially to our apple orchards.   These photos really depict what happened to most of the apple crops  in New Hampshire. You can see that these almost look like chestnuts as  they are so small and stunted and brown. In this, you can barely make  out that it is an apple, and you can see the size of them based on the  impact from the frost.   This event followed an extreme freeze in February that wiped out  virtually 100 percent of our peach crops and other stone fruits.   My office has been hearing from apple growers who lost 80 to 100  percent of their crops this year as well as from New Hampshire growers  who lost up to 100 percent of other crops, such as peaches, pears,  plums, blueberries, strawberries, grapes, and cherries.   For people who think ``Well, you don't have that many orchards in New  Hampshire,'' we have the largest apple orchard of New England in New  Hampshire.   This is a big concern for our farmers in the State, and they make up  a considerable percentage of our small businesses. What we have seen is  total crop losses for some growers and near-total losses for others.   The business impact of such catastrophic damage goes way beyond the  direct cost of damage to the crops because, in New Hampshire, we have a  strong tradition, as I know they do in other States, of families who  visit their local orchards every year to ``pick your own'' apples and  other fruit. For local farms, these visits aren't just about that  actual apple picking; it is an opportunity to showcase everything their  farms have to offer, to display other products for families to  purchase--vegetables that have grown during the season, baked goods,  apple cider, applesauce. Everything that can be made from apples is  available at those farm stands.   Apple picking marks the start of autumn in New Hampshire. We are  currently well into September and what should be apple-picking season.  This past weekend should have seen busy crowds at farms across New  Hampshire, with families apple picking, eating cider doughnuts, and  sipping apple cider, but, sadly, this was not the case.   I heard from growers like Trevor Hardy from Brookdale Fruit Farm in  Hollis, who called his counterparts at Meadow Ledge Farm in Loudon, at  Poverty Lane Orchards in Lebanon, and other orchards to learn that it  wasn't just his farm that lacked the usual bustling energy of children  and families on the farm. Local growers across the State, like Windy  Ridge Orchard in North Haverhill, are concerned that families won't  come this season for their annual farm visits, and the total resulting  revenue losses will be enormous.   For a lot of families--and my family is no exception--going to the  local pick-your-own orchard to get whether it be apples or pumpkins or  vegetables is an annual event. My daughter and her four children have  had pictures taken in the pumpkin patch in the nearby farm every year  that those kids have been home.   I had a chance to meet with a number of farmers last Friday. One of  the things they talked about was the concern that they have longtime  customers who are not going to be able to enjoy their farms this year  because of the impact from the frost. New Hampshire growers are  estimated to be facing as much as $20 million in disaster-related  impacts from these freeze events. This estimate doesn't even include  the ongoing impacts to vegetable growers and forage crops from flooding  and excessive moisture. The total cost for that is still being  tabulated.   This is the Brookdale Fruit Farm, which is the biggest orchard in New  Hampshire. It is in Hollis. It is the biggest orchard in New England.  We can see this is a rainstorm that happened about 2 weeks ago, and you  can just see the water cascading through the orchard because of the  flooding. The impact that this is having on next year's crop, on  vegetables, is really still being tabulated but is excessive across the  State.   I am hearing from longtime New Hampshire growers that they have never  seen crop damage this bad before. Last week, when I visited with  farmers, I went to Apple Hill Farm in Concord along with a number of  apple growers from different regions in the State. Chuck and Diane  Souther, who own Apple Hill Farm, showed me the severe losses their  apple crops have suffered this year. They showed me apples that looked  very much like these apples. They told me about the devastating effects  of the late frost on their orchards and how they stayed out all night  on May 18, during the freezing-cold temperatures, to try to protect  their crop and save as many of their trees as they could. They told me  in heartbreaking detail about the impact on their businesses and how  disappointed they are not to be able to provide apples to their annual  customers.    I hope that families in New Hampshire will still visit their local  orchards. Some still have some apples to pick, and they still have  other products to buy and other activities for kids to enjoy. In a year  like this, we need to support our local farmers more than ever.   Before I close, I want to read some comments from a letter that was  shared with my office from Ken Merrill, who is an apple grower in  Londonderry, NH. His family owns and operates Oliver Merrill & Sons,  which is a  [[Page S4623]]  fifth-generation farm in Londonderry. They specialize in growing apples  and other kinds of fruit as well as other products. I think his  comments here really show the experience of so many growers in New  Hampshire this year.   Ken says:         I am writing you this letter on Labor Day 2023. Labor Day       weekend is usually a busy time on the farm. The farm stand is       packed with people buying apples, peaches, and other fruit.       Some years Pick-your-own apples is beginning and people are       coming to the orchard for outings.        Not this year.        I am sitting in my office, writing this letter, because       there are no peaches or other stone fruit, pears, and few       apples.        At least 95 percent of the apple blossoms were killed by a       severe frost on May 18, 2023. The peaches and stone fruit       were killed by an unusually cold night in February.        The consequences of these weather events are dramatic. The       farm stand is operating at a reduced level selling the few       vegetables we grow.        Most years we hire three to five people for the harvest       season to pick, pack and help sell the crop. This year, we       have to tell the people that have worked for us for many       years that there were not jobs for them.        We have had to cancel all our wholesale contracts with       supermarkets, no apples.        We have had to stop selling to other farm stands we have       sold to for years as well as telling the New Hampshire Food       Bank that we had nothing to sell them this year.        This is the first time in more than 50 years, since I have       been associated with the family business, that we have not       had an apple crop.    Ken's experience reflects that of almost all of our growers in New  Hampshire.   In July, the Secretary of Agriculture declared a Federal disaster for  New Hampshire growers as a result of the frost. However, for  agricultural disasters, as the Presiding Officer knows, there is no  Federal relief that is automatically triggered even after the Secretary  of Agriculture has declared a Federal disaster.   Instead, Congress must specifically appropriate funds. There is  plenty of precedent for this. In 2023, Congress provided $3.7 billion  for agricultural disasters that had occurred in calendar year 2022, and  in 2022, Congress provided $10 billion for agricultural disasters that  occurred in 2020 and 2021.   Federal disaster relief is particularly urgent for farmers like those  in New Hampshire who are underserved by existing Federal agricultural  programs. In fact, many of our apple growers don't even have crop  insurance because they have found that it doesn't really work for their  businesses the way it is currently structured.   I hope we can come together to support appropriations bills, but I  hope we can also come together to provide the urgently needed relief  funding for our farmers--those who have been so affected in New  Hampshire and New England.   I urge my colleagues to support this effort and to ensure that  agricultural disaster relief is enacted promptly.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
