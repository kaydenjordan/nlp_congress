 Mr. Speaker, Americans are alarmed by the unsafe and  unhealthy situation along the Southwest border. A caravan of thousands  and thousands of Central Americans has made its way through Mexico to  [[Page H9808]]  camp just on the other side of the border fence in Texas.   Now, my heart, Mr. Speaker, goes out to these people, but we cannot  let them be allowed to overwhelm our border and to enter our country  illegally.   These individuals, Mr. Speaker, have been offered asylum and work  permits by Mexico, but they have refused.   Homeland Security has confirmed that 600 known criminals are among  those in the encampment, and beyond that, we simply do not know, Mr.  Speaker, who these people are.   This dangerous situation is going to get only worse, unless it is  addressed. That is why, Mr. Speaker, I have connected with almost every  one of our 235 Republican Members in the House, asking them to join me  to solve this national security and immigration problem.   There is overwhelming support, Mr. Speaker, to do so, and I will  bring this up tomorrow at conference, along with lots of other  Republicans.   The primary responsibility of Congress is to protect our families,  Mr. Speaker. This is our last chance as Republicans in the majority to  fix this mess. Otherwise, next year, the Democrat majority has signaled  they will push for open borders and amnesty legislation.   This is our last chance as Republicans in the majority to get this  right.                            ____________________
