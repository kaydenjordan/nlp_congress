 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the Honoring our PACT Act, which will  ensure that veterans who have been exposed to toxic substances,  materials, or environments during their military service, particularly  toxic burn pits and Agent Orange, will receive the care and benefits  they deserve.   Exposure to these toxins has led to devastating health conditions  suffered by veterans, including neurological disorders, pulmonary  diseases, rare forms of cancer, and many other conditions.   In the past, the government has been too slow to recognize the link  between exposure to toxic substances and the medical problems that  veterans have dealt with when they returned home.   As a result, veterans and their families have been denied benefits  and much-needed disability compensation to deal with the health effects  of these toxins.   The Honoring our PACT Act would correct these errors and renew our  solemn commitment to our Nation's veterans.   I urge my colleagues to support the Honoring our PACT Act to ensure  that our country fulfills Abraham Lincoln's promise to care for him and  her who shall have borne the battle.
