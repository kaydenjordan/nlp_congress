 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 218.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Utah?   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 454 and rule  XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House  on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 218.   The Chair appoints the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Palmer) to preside  over the Committee of the Whole.                                time  0958                        In the Committee of the Whole    Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the  Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill  (H.R. 218) to provide for the exchange of Federal land and non-Federal  land in the State of Alaska for the construction of a road between King  Cove and Cold Bay, with Mr. Palmer in the chair.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the  first time.   The gentleman from Utah (Mr. Bishop) and the gentleman from Arizona  (Mr. Grijalva) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah.    Mr. Chair, I include in the Record my statement  on the ABCs of Izembek.   Alaska's ardently asking for action and assistance to acquire acute  acres to always allow actual access across areas and assuredly avert  atrocious aviation accidents after appalling administrative blockades  on building basic boulevards between beautiful bays before blizzards.   The bill doesn't bombard birds like Black Brants because Congress can  carefully craft conveyances to create consistent courses for certain  care in this Cove community. Construction cop outs and crumbling  commitments cause a cacophony of complex concerns and constitute  considerable consternation when crossing channels in choppy conditions.  Don's diligently doting on his district, dutifully demanding  demonstrable developments daily so the Department doesn't dawdle on  their domain. Despite dangerous dashes and emergency evacuations,  expanding elevated environmental evaluations exploded expenses. Exact  exchanges exempt events to enhance embarking on equally enjoyable exits  in eleven expanses. Frankly, fifty-five frigid flights fleeing fast  from freezing fields in furious flurries found frighteningly few fancy  facilities for fearful families.   Geese gradually got generally greedy, grimly generating genuine grief  on giant goals of going great grounds on gravel and grabbing glory from  good glacial gateways.   Historically, hovercraft hijinks harmfully hampered hurrying to  hospitals and hobbled healing, harpooning hope and hardening hardships  near the harsh harbors. The House must hastily have a helpful hand in  halting havoc and hindering hefty hazards for Izembek inhabitants  instead of idling indefinitely. Interior's indecision impeded  infrastructure and informally interrupted implementing instant  improvements, isolating irate individuals in increasingly impassible  journeys. Jewell jumped into jeopardy when justifying juxtapositions  and jarring, jolty jaunts from King Cove that keep killing kind kin  without kindling key kernels of keen knowledge.   King Cove lacks life-saving lanes linking lonesome localities on land  while lofty liberals lamely lament losing limited landscapes and maroon  many who might make mends with medical ministration. Masterful  mandatory medivacs must make miraculous moves after miniscule mainland  migrations. Narrow native neighborhoods need necessary navigable  networks now that nasty neglect notched nineteen needless obituaries.  Other offered options outlined aren't okay or optimal for opening  outbound opportunities over a one-lane, non-paved preferred path across  a pulchritudinous peninsula. Patients patiently practice peacefully  praying to postpone pain and postmortems while partisan panels  prioritize protecting a percent of the preserve over the perishing  population.   Perhaps people quietly question this quixotic quandary, quickly  quarreling over quality, quaint routes. Resilient rural Refuge  residents require really rapid resolutions to reliably ride on  requisite roads routinely in rough situations. Seventy segments of  street are still stationed in the sanctuary, so small sections won't  subvert the surroundings. The State swap saves the site's sheltered  status while swelling up safety and security for this scorned society.  1,000 tormented townsmen tempt their tombs in terrifying travels. They  take threatening treks that traverse the tough tundra between the two  towns in treacherous temperatures. United, we urgently untie this  unbelievably unjust ultimatum for a unique unwinding of unfortunately  unreliable voyages.   Valid in vibrant victory we venture to vote to viciously vanish  vanity and vacate this wrongdoing. When we want wins, wavering  willfully won't work. We weigh wishes of wilderness with wild winter  weather while ways wane for wandering within windstorms. Xylophone.   Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're yawning and yearning for me to yield and  stop yapping like a yelling yahoo while you're still young. So I'll  zig-zag and zoom past zany zealots in Zen like Ryan Zinke.    Mr. Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman  from Alaska (Mr. Young), the author of the bill, the only  Representative Alaska has here on this floor, and someone who  understands this issue because he has been dealing with it for a number  of years.   (Mr. YOUNG of Alaska asked and was given permission to revise and  extend his remarks.)    Mr. Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman  from Alaska (Mr. Young), the author of the bill, the only  Representative Alaska has here on this floor, and someone who  understands this issue because he has been dealing with it for a number  of years.   (Mr. YOUNG of Alaska asked and was given permission to revise and  extend his remarks.)    Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman  from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman), who is hurriedly making his way to the  front podium.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman  from Arizona (Mr. Gosar), a subcommittee chairman of the Natural  Resources Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. McClintock), the chairman of the Federal Lands  Subcommittee.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding me  time.   Mr. Chairman, we have just heard a very familiar theme from the  Democratic side of the aisle. It is a theme they have sounded for the  past decade and goes a long way to explain why America's prosperity has  been stagnating. It has literally been on hold during these past 8  years.   God forbid there should be more jobs to support struggling families  in this little community. God forbid our roads should ever be used to  get products to people who desperately need them.   Now, it is hard for me to understand how a one-lane gravel road is  going to accommodate all of that commerce. What it is going to  accommodate are people who desperately need access to the neighboring  city of Cold Bay.   Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of this bill, Mr. Young's H.R.  218, on behalf of the people of King Cove, Alaska.   I want you to imagine being a resident of that tiny little community.  Its only outside access is by a gravel airstrip and a little tiny  harbor. It is just 20 miles from the city of Cold Bay. Cold Bay has got  a regional airport, they have got medical facilities, but there is no  road connecting that little town with the life-sustaining civilization  just 20 miles away.   We all know of the exceptionally harsh weather conditions in that  area; they routinely prevent air and sea travel out of King Cove. If  you are in trouble in that weather, there is help just down the road,  but there is no road.   Why is there no road? Well, we have just heard a sampling of why. It  is not because of natural barriers. It is not for lack of need or  financing. It is because a national wildlife refuge in a section of the  Alaska Peninsula National Wildlife Refuge is in between these  communities and the Federal Government and leftwing environmental  activists just won't hear of it.   For over 20 years, the people of King Cove have begged for this  lifesaving road for their safety--not a major interstate, not a  parkway, just a one-lane road. It requires only 206 acres out of the 59  million acres of designated Federal wilderness in Alaska.   Just in the last 4 years, this has been pointed out, 55 emergency  medical evacuations have been made, a number of which required Coast  Guard involvement or extended patient waiting times or both.   Mr. Westerman has told us just last year of the King Cove woman in  her seventies suffering from heart issues medevaced from King Cove to  Cold Bay by Coast Guard vessel after high winds prevented an air  ambulance from landing at King Cove. In the end, it took the woman over  7 hours to reach a hospital in Anchorage.   A road between King Cove and Cold Bay would go a long way to  preventing similar situations from recurring, and it would provide a  potentially lifesaving evacuation route for King Cove citizens in the  event of an emergency. And if it helps provide additional jobs for that  little community, well, I say so much the better.   Congressman Young has tried for more than a decade to get this done,  but it has been stymied by leftwing environmental activists and by  ideological zealots in the bureaucracy. During  [[Page H6123]]  our hearing on the bill, opposition came not from any of the  communities involved, but from environmental activists hundreds of  miles away from King Cove, although they seemed to have mouthpieces  here in this House.   In exchange for use of the 206 acres of Federal land for this road,  the State of Alaska is willing to transfer 40,000 acres of State land  to the Federal Government. This bill facilitates that transfer and,  after two decades, finally gives permission for this little road to be  built. It is long overdue.    I salute Congressman Young for his persistent pursuit of justice for  the long-suffering people of King Cove.   Mr. Chair, I ask for speedy adoption of this bill by this House.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire of the ranking member if  he has any germane speakers left on this issue.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   This is an issue that people have, for three decades, been trying  calmly discuss and find an alternative. Unfortunately, the people of  Alaska, who have been engaged in this effort for the last three-plus  decades, have been rebuffed at every turn in which the only answer they  got was the Federal Government here in Washington giving them an  alternative, and forcing upon them an alternative that flat out didn't  work, and it hasn't worked in the last 7 years.   One of the things we should realize is that this idea of building  this road is not new. The House has voted to build this road. The  Senate has voted to build this road. Unfortunately, they didn't vote it  on the same bill, except, in 2009, when there was a piece of  legislation that went through both the House and the Senate, which was  very clear at the time that it was the intent of both the House and the  Senate to build the road, but it did require the Interior Department to  do the NEPA process. They took 4 years.   Now think of that. It was in 2009 when the bill was passed and the  intent of Congress was very clear. Four years later, the Interior  Department finally got around to doing the study, a study which, I  might add, had five options that were added to it, one of which was to  do nothing, and the Interior Department chose, after 4 years of study  as their preferred option, to do nothing.   Therefore, all of the efforts and anguish of these people in Alaska  went to naught because a bureaucracy here decided, despite what the  House had said and despite what the Senate had said, that they knew  best, despite what the people of Alaska needed, they knew best and  their option simply was to do nothing.   This bill, let me remind you, all of the masses of people who are  here, is not about a road. It is about a land transfer for a road. The  State of Alaska is putting up 43,096 acres for new wilderness in  exchange for 200-plus acres--240, I think, acres to be a road, a road  that already exists. There is a 30-mile road that exists. The only  problem is, only 19 of the 30 miles are constructed. They exist. They  are there now.   What Alaska is asking is: Simply give us the last 11, so the road  that does exist can be used. It can be used for them, for their medical  needs, for their recreation, if they want to. I mean, it has been  brought up that, heaven forbid, this might be used for economic  advantage. I don't know why this community of around 1,000 people,  about 80 percent are Native Alaskans, would ever have the audacity to  think that they ought to have a job, or the audacity to think that  maybe they should try and use something that is there to further their  economic ability to actually earn a living.   How uppity can you get, when we realize that those of us sitting here  6,000 miles away really have the superior wisdom to tell those people  living in King Cove how they actually should live their life, and we  did it. We did it in the 1990s. We said: No, you can't have a road  because we have a philosophical opposition to it. Instead, we will  spend a heck of a lot of money to come up with a hovercraft that  doesn't work, and is too expensive, and is useless, and it no longer  exists.   And now you are saying, ``No, no, no, you can't have access to the  mainland. You can't have access to an all-weather airport. You can't  have access for medical care; you can't have access for jobs. You can't  have access for anything. Instead, let's work together to come up with  another really stupid idea that won't work as well,'' when the solution  is simply to build a road, 11 miles to connect an existing road so  people who live in King Cove can do it.   You have already heard the data that has been presented. In the last  30 years, 19 people have died. Nineteen people have died, and it can be  traced specifically to the fact that they didn't have access to  healthcare.   In the last 3 years, they have had over 50 cases when medevac had to  be used, very expensively, by the Coast Guard to try and help people  out there. You wouldn't have to do that if you simply had the silly  road; the 70-year-old woman who had to wait 7 hours, suffering a heart  attack before she could get medical care; the woman in labor who had to  go 6 hours before she could get someplace to have medical care; the man  who had the saw accident, who had to wait 12 hours before he was able  to get any kind of medical care, simply because there is not an 11-mile  single-lane gravel road to connect to the rest of the 30-mile road that  already exists.   And we sit here and try and tell these people in Alaska what is best  for them, what is good for them? And that is emotional? And that is  irrational?   No. What is irrational is that we are going through this again, the  same thing we did last decade, the same thing that happened in the  1990s. And it is going to continue until we finally say: People should  have a right to decide for themselves what is best for them.   The people who live in this community want a road. It is not going to  hurt anything. It is 200 acres, and this is a land exchange. Actually,  I have to admit, I don't like that. Alaska is giving up 40,000 acres-- 40,000 acres--so they can do 200 acres of a road. I think that is an  exorbitant fee that is being extracted from the State of Alaska just so  they can give these people, the overwhelming majority of whom are  Native Alaskans, the opportunity of having access to their community so  they can get medical care or whatever else they need so they can have  it.   And we are sitting here because we don't want to do a precedent. This  is the right thing to do. We should do this. We should have been done  it back in the Clinton administration when it first came up. We should  have gone through with it in 2009 when they finally passed it in both  the House and the Senate, and then had to wait 4 years for the Interior  Department to study the issue, and their conclusion was: let's not do  anything. That doesn't exist.   It is time for us to do something to help people, to put people above  ideology, to pass the bill.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   The CHAIR.

The CHAIR. No amendment to that amendment in the nature of a  substitute shall be in order except those printed in part C of House  Report 115-235. Each such amendment may be offered only in the order  printed in the report, by a Member designated in the report, shall be  considered as read, shall be debatable for the time specified in the  report equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent,  shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand  for division of the question.                    Amendment No. 1 Offered by Ms. Tsongas    The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in  part C of House Report 115-235.    Mr. Chairman, I can say I don't support this  because even though I had three bills in that package, I voted against  it. It was a bad package going through.   But the problem is that this amendment does nothing more than  reinsert the language that caused the problem in the first place. This  language is the reason that we don't have the solution right now.  Remember, the solution was no action, not to do anything whatsoever.   I understand sometimes we have distance issues that come here. The  gentlewoman from Massachusetts has not an inch of BLM land in her  entire State. Only 3 percent of the land is controlled by the Federal  Government, which is much different than having 90 percent controlled  by the Federal Government as in Alaska. I would contend that if there  was any other area in the Nation--especially the eastern part of the  Nation that had a situation like this--they would not tolerate this  existing.   They also had the ability of actually solving the problem on the  local level, which is what they are asking in this bill to simply do.  Eighty percent of these people are Native Alaskans. They don't have the  lung power to come up here and express for themselves. They don't have  the resources to hire special interest groups to come express for  themselves. They are depending on us to do it for them.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Holding) having assumed the chair, Mr. Palmer, Chair of the Committee  of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that  Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 218) to  provide for the exchange of Federal land and non-Federal land in the  State of Alaska for the construction of a road between King Cove and  Cold Bay, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to  the motion to recommit.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to  the motion to recommit.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the efforts of the  gentleman from California. I would remind him, when he was in the  Clinton administration and the Clinton administration forced the  community to buy a hovercraft instead of building this road, that was  made in Canada.   However, I want you to know that I am actually livid for the people  of King Cove, Alaska, because they lack a lifesaving lane on the land  to link this lonesome locality that has been left alone while lofty  litigious liberals lamely lament losing a little landscape.   Mr. Speaker, the arguments are limited and they lack love for the  Aleuts who are there.   This amendment is a loser. Vote ``no.'' Vote ``yes'' on passage, and  let's get out of here.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is  ordered on the motion to recommit.   There was no objection.
