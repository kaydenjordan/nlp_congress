 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, good morning.   Before I get into everything, I have just seen that President Trump  has resumed his Twitter war with another Member of this body, our  friend from Tennessee. It is long past time for the President to quit  his daily compulsion of engaging in Twitter feuds and, instead, get to  work for the American people. We have a lot of serious issues to deal  with in this country. Our challenges are too entrenched and complex to  be solved if the President spends his time in a meaningless war of  words on Twitter--today with this person, tomorrow with another.   We need President Trump to roll up his sleeves and get to work--to  stop tweeting and start leading. Let me repeat that. Maybe the  President will hear it. For the good of America, we need our President  to roll up his sleeves and get to work--to stop tweeting and start  leading.                            ____________________     Mr. President, concerning North Korea, instead of  undermining his Secretary of State and picking Twitter fights with Kim  Jong Un that risk a war, President Trump should formulate a serious  strategy to put the heat on China to pressure the North Koreans and  resolve this crisis. China holds the cards here, but they have done  nothing to help us or very little at least.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on healthcare, President Trump should  stop playing games with America's healthcare and publicly declare his  support for the Alexander-Murray compromise.   President Trump is meeting with the Senate Republicans at their  caucus lunch today, with Senator Alexander and all other 11 Republican  cosponsors of the bill. Why not provide some clarity? Why not say, as  he has said in the past, that he supports Senator Alexander's work? I  believe many more Republican Senators want to sign their name onto this  bill, but they are waiting to hear definitively from the President  before they announce their support. After all, nearly every Republican  here voted to extend the cost-sharing program already. It was part of  their first healthcare bill. Every Democrat supports cost-sharing.   So the President has talked to me about wanting to be bipartisan on  healthcare, and the best way to do it is to support Alexander-Murray.  It is time that the President catches up to the rest of us and supports  the bill. Right now he is the barrier.   Leader McConnell has said that if the President will sign it, he will  put it on the floor of the Senate. It will get an overwhelming vote. It  will then have to be put on the House floor. So Speaker Ryan will have  no choice, or the rise in premiums will be on his back and the backs of  his Members whom he seeks to protect.                            ____________________     Probably most of all, when we talk about the President,  it is time to stop tweeting and start leading on taxes. Mr. President,  it is time to start really engaging with the substance of the tax plan  that your staff and congressional Republicans have put together  because, Mr. President, your rhetoric does not match the reality on the  tax bill.   The President has been selling his tax plan as a boon for the middle  class. He told a group of truckers earlier this month that his tax plan  is ``a middle-class bill.'' He said: ``The biggest winners will be  everyday American workers.'' In his words, the Republican tax plan  would bring about a ``middle-class miracle.''   President Trump, I urge you to look closely at the tax plan that your  staff and congressional Republicans have put together. Ask the advisers  around you what about this tax plan benefits the middle class and the  everyday American worker more than the wealthy and the powerful,  because trickle-down, if that is the only thing that benefits the  middle class in your thinking, doesn't work. No one believes in  trickle-down anymore except a small group of very wealthy business  people who have undue influence on the Republican Party and, I hope,  not on you, Mr. President.   Let's look at this plan that supposedly is a middle-class plan. It  repeals the estate tax. That applies to a small number of families with  estates over $5 million. It lowers the rate on passthrough entities.  That benefits wealthy law firms and hedge fund managers so they can pay  less in taxes than the average citizen. It lowers the top rate while  raising the bottom one. The cut in the corporate rate would hardly help  the American worker. This is trickle-down. Our Republican colleagues  don't talk about trickle-down because they know most of America doesn't  believe in it.   Our corporations are flush with cash already. They are flush with  cash. Giving them more cash is not going to change their behavior. What  are they doing with this cash? Most of the large corporations are not  creating jobs with the cash they now have. Stock dividends, stock  buybacks, dividends, increases in CEO salaries--that is where it goes.  So this bill is not a middle-class bill. I believe the President  believes it is. You have to read it. No more tweeting, no more  superficiality--read the bill. Don't let your advisers just walk in and  say: Mr. President, it is a great, middle-class bill, and you just let  them go by.   It has already been shown--not just by me but by many others--that  Mnuchin and Cohen don't tell the truth about this bill, and they know  better. The Tax Policy Center said that the top 1 percent of our  country will reap 80 percent of the benefits from this plan. They also  said, Mr. President, that it is a middle-class bill. According to the  Tax Policy Center--no one has disputed it--a third of all middle-class  taxpayers will see their taxes go up. Is that a middle-class tax bill,  Mr. President, one in which taxes go up, not down, on nearly 30 percent  of middle-class taxpayers?  [[Page S6721]]    Now, if this is such a middle-class tax plan, then, why do  Republicans here on the Hill keep floating new middle-class deductions  to cut--the very deductions on which the middle class depends. First,  it was the mortgage deduction and, then, the elimination of State and  local deductibility, which made it into the plan. Now they are even  talking about capping pretax contributions to 401(k) plans.   There are such huge tax breaks for the wealthy and such a huge  deficit hole that the tax writers have no choice but to raise taxes on  the middle class and cut deductions. Even the great doubling of the  standard deduction, Mr. President, is undone by the elimination of the  personal deduction. If you are a family of three, you break even. If  you are a family of four, you lose money even before they cut the other  deductions.    Now, on State and local, in many Republican districts in the House,  in many of our Republican colleagues' States, over 30 percent-- certainly, 20 percent, and the lowest number is 17--of taxpayers would  use that deduction. Eliminating the State and local deduction is a  dagger to the heart of the middle class, Mr. President. You should tell  your tax writers in the House and Senate to take it out of the bill.   Here is what PricewaterhouseCoopers just found out. Home values would  go down 10 percent if we eliminated the State and local deduction.  Homes are the piece of the rock for the middle class. People wait and  struggle and pay every month so they can own their own home free and  clear, and then that value declines because we eliminated State and  local deductibility. Every homeowner is affected, even those who take  the standard deduction.   If this were such a middle-class plan, I would say this to the  President: Why wouldn't Republicans on the Hill scrap the repeal of the  estate tax, which only benefits the very rich--not one drop goes to the  middle class--instead of looking for more middle-class deductions, like  the 401(k), to reduce or eliminate?   President Trump says he wants to do a middle-class bill, but if the  only benefit to the middle class is this trickle-down theory, it is not  a middle-class bill at all.   We Democrats have said all along that we want to update our Tax Code  to provide middle-class tax relief. My caucus wants to provide tax  relief to small businesses, not to big corporations. They are the ones  that need the money to create jobs, not the big corporations who are  flush with money.   Incidentally, as for AT&T, which is leading the charge for this tax  cut, their average tax rate over the last 10 years was 8 percent, and  they eliminated 80,000 jobs. So much for the idea that when you pay a  low tax rate you are creating jobs.   So we offer this to the President: Come work with Democrats on a real  middle-class tax bill. The plan your advisers put together with  Republicans on the Hill doesn't do what you say it does. We can put  together a tax bill in a bipartisan way that actually gets the job done  for the middle class and that tells the rich corporate leaders and  financiers that they shouldn't be in control of the bill, which they  are now, and you, Mr. President, are going along wittingly or  unwittingly. Either way is no good for you, no good for your party, and  no good, most of all, for America.                            ____________________     Now, Mr. President, one final word here on wildfires,  which I know my colleague from California is ready to speak about. She  has seen the damage and is working so hard to help the people of her  State.   So we are going to talk about wildfires, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin  Islands. First, we can't forget about the 3.5 million American citizens  in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, who continue to suffer the  terrible effects of Hurricane Maria, the strongest storm to hit the  island in a century. It has been more than a month since Maria, and 75  percent of Puerto Rico is still without electricity, only a third of  the island's cell sites are functional, and many who have diseases like  diabetes and other diseases or who are in need of dialysis have been  unable to receive their specialized treatments and medication.   One million Americans in Puerto Rico are suffering without access to  clean water. We have seen the pictures of them drinking sewage and  water from Superfund sites. I read this report that they have  accidentally used wells located in one of the most contaminated  Superfund sites, Dorado, to get water, because they are so desperate.   I have called on the White House to put a point person in charge of  the recovery, and I repeat that request today. The administration  should appoint a CEO for response and recovery for Puerto Rico, someone  with the ability to bring all the necessary Federal agencies together,  cut redtape on the public and private side, turn the lights back on,  get clean water flowing, and help bring recovery. It is a national  tragedy that deserves the most organized and efficient response. A CEO  for response and recovery with a direct line to the President in the  White House would help get the house in order.   Now, at the same time, we can't forget the devastation brought by  wildfires out West. A group of Senators will be speaking on the floor  today--my colleague from California is about to do just that--in  support of swift passage of disaster aid for those regions, and I  wholly support the effort.   As the number of forest fires and the cost of fighting these fires  has risen dramatically, it has left the Forest Service and the  Department of the Interior at a severe funding deficit. This has forced  the Forest Service to take money from other accounts within the agency  to cover the firefighting deficit, in a process called fire borrowing.  Fire borrowing prevents the agency from carrying out its other  missions, including investing in forest fire prevention.   As we have seen, the terrible forest fires rage across the West,  hitting so hard the State of California, which my colleague is going to  address. We must take action and provide the Forest Service with a  long-term wildfire funding fix.   Some Members want to bog down this process with environmental and  forest management riders, but I stand with Secretary of Agriculture  Perdue and others who have called to simply fix the funding problem,  without riders, to allow the agency to carry on its mission.   I yield the floor and ask unanimous consent that my colleague be  given the time she requires to finish her remarks because I went a  little over.    Thank you, Mr. President.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I want to first thank my colleagues,  particularly Sherrod Brown, our ranking member of the committee,  Senators Whitehouse, Blumenthal, Franken, and so many others who have  spoken so eloquently on this issue. I don't think it is a coincidence  that many Members on our side have spoken and very few on the other  side. Once again, it is one of those instances where the powerful will  get more powerful. Everyone knows it, and people are not out there  beating their breasts about this if they are trying to support it, and  maybe there is a little bit of being ashamed.   This is what has happened here. We finally have an agency to protect  the consumers against large institutions, most of which are good  institutions, but some of which typically take advantage of the average  person. They do it in a whole variety of ways. We saw with Equifax the  idea that they didn't have to protect people's information and were  almost nonchalant about it. We saw it with Wells Fargo, where people  came up with a scheme. We see it all the time. The average consumer  doesn't have the lawyers, the time, and the ability to study what is  happening. They don't understand the long contracts where they sign  away their rights to go to court. They need a bank account. They need a  car loan. They need something, and, yes, their only recourse in this  case may be a class action suit, particularly if it is $20 or $30. You  are not going to go to court individually, but if it is thousands of  people, a trial lawyer will make some money, yes, to protect those  people. How horrible that people might have the ability to come  together and hire a lawyer.   What is happening in the last 9 months is that--we have a lot of  people who are disaffected. Many of the campaigns, including President  Trump's campaign, understood that. But when President Trump campaigned,  he campaigned as a populist against the powerful institutions, against  the Washington lobbyists, and said: Let's do something for average  people. But once he got into office, he embraced the hard right, whose  goal in most cases is to just protect the powerful. They got this sort  of drumbeat going on: Poor innocent people have too much power, and big  banks and big corporations don't have enough. Let's go after unions,  even though incomes are down and only 6 percent of private America is  unionized. Let's go after them. They are too powerful. They make these  big corporations squirm or pay a little more money to people or pay a  benefit or pay some healthcare--how horrible. Let's go after the trial  lawyers. I don't always agree with their tactics. I voted against them  on occasion. But let's go after them, even though they are one of the  few recourses that average people have. That is hardly as reprehensible  as an Equifax or a Wells Fargo in doing what they do. But people on the  other side somehow have this mythology because of the hard right and  its machine and their think tanks and their media messaging--FOX News-- that somehow the powerful are getting a bad break in America and the  average person has too much power.   What is wrong?   I will say this. It is going to lead to people being even more  disillusioned, more angry, more sour, and we will move further away  from what the American dream, ideal, and optimism are.   Our colleagues on the other side, my dear friends--I like them, I  really do--wittingly or unwittingly are part of this movement, and it  is a shame. It is a shame.   Community banks aren't beleaguered by these cases. They don't usually  do this stuff. When I talked to community bankers who lobbied me on  this, they basically said to me: No, we are with the whole banking  association. The big banks want this.   This is not little banks. These are the Wells Fargos and the  Equifaxes. We shouldn't do it. We shouldn't do it.   I worry about this country. I love this country. It has been so good  to me, my family, and my people. I still believe to this day that it is  what the Founding Fathers called it when they left Constitution Hall-- God's noble experiment.   We are one nation under God, noble. We are a noble country. No one  has had the ideals we have had for hundreds of years. We are an  experiment. We keep evolving, changing, and adapting, as we should. But  when I see what has gone on in the last 9 months--a combination of the  President's appeal to lower instincts of people, to divisive instincts,  and the hard right machine, which has too much power on the other side  of the aisle--I worry. I worry. I worry about the country. I worry  about our standards of decency and honor.   Everyone heard Senator Flake speak today. It moved all of us. It is a  shame he is leaving this body because he has been a voice and a beacon.  I didn't agree with him on most issues, as is pretty obvious by our  voting records, but he stood for the right thing. I say to my  colleagues, somehow we are doing too many wrong things around here. We  are trying to take away people's healthcare. We say we want better  healthcare at lower costs. That is what the President says, but we put  a bill on the floor that does the opposite. We know it. We are doing it  on taxes. We say we want to help the middle class, and the tax bill  dominantly helps the wealthy.   Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are afraid to say they  are helping the wealthiest because they think that is the way to create  jobs because they know that Americans don't believe it--nor should  they.   Most recently, the great Kansas experiment, the Koch brothers' own  laboratory, totally flopped.   They say unions have too much power, and yet incomes in the middle  class have declined. There are abuses. There are abuses everywhere, but  middle-class incomes decline, fewer people have bargaining power, more  people are paid lower, and there are 7 million fewer good-paying jobs  in America today than 15 years ago. In part, that is because we don't  have unions and because the hard right has learned through legal  tactics to destroy them, and now with government legal tactics on the  absurd argument that the First Amendment says you don't have to join a  union or pay dues to a union.   This is just one of many issues where once again we are helping the  powerful against the powerless. There is a political benefit, I  understand. There is a fear if you go against these hard-right forces.  I have heard it from my colleagues, but it is wrong for the country. I  wish that maybe a bell would ring. There are lots of issues we don't  agree on, but some of these issues don't have a basis in fact. That is  why the floor is empty on the other side.   I respect my dear friend. He is a good, good man, in the Flake mold.  He has to be here all night and defend it. He doesn't have too many  others backing him up, and I think I know why, because deep down they  know it is wrong. They can figure out that there is an abuse of trial  lawyers, but they still know it is wrong. They still know it is wrong.   To sum it up, a ``yes'' vote is handing a ``get out of jail free''  card or the equivalent to Wells Fargo and Equifax. It is that simple. A  ``yes'' vote is saying you believe that Americans who get taken  advantage of don't have the right to seek recourse. A ``yes'' vote  tells rapacious financial institutions that they can continue to hose  consumers without any serious consequences or accountability, because  we all know that average folks don't have the ability to go to court on  their own to sue. We know that. Everyone knows that.   If there are abuses, let's fix them, but don't totally denude people  who don't have much power from the little power they might have through  going to court. I hope that maybe there is somebody, because the vote  is close. It took a long time to bring this resolution to the floor  because there were some people who wanted to stand up, but they  [[Page S6755]]  got ground down by this hard right machine that always wants its way.   They are doing great. Corporate America is making more money than  ever before. Financial institutions are healthier than ever before, but  it is not good enough. More--we want more. The ``more'' is fine if it  didn't come at the expense of average folks when somebody is abusive.   The CRA is a meat-cleaver approach. Those who have issues with this  should try to address them with a scalpel, not a bludgeon. I urge my  colleagues one final time, those on the other side of the aisle, to  vote no on this disapproval resolution on behalf of our constituents,  who deserve to have more rights when standing up to the powerful when  they are right, not less.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
