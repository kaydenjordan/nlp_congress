 Mr. President, I rise today to talk about my amendment,  Heller amendment No. 288.   My amendment reinforces the important role Medicaid has played in my  home State and in the States of many of my colleagues here today.   Let me explain the impact Medicaid has had on the State of Nevada. As  many of you know, the State of Nevada was the first to expand Medicaid.  Before Nevada made that decision, the State's uninsured rate was at 23  percent, and it was one of the highest in the country. So think about  that for a minute. One in four Nevadans did not have healthcare  coverage. Under expanded Medicaid today, Nevadans' uninsured rate is  between 11 percent and 12 percent. I have also seen the number of  uninsured people living in Nevada's rural communities cut in half, and  I have seen major gains with the number of children in our State with  healthcare coverage.   In fact, Nevada has seen one of the most significant decreases in  uninsured children in the country. In 2013, our State had the highest  rate of uninsured children in the country. We were ranked 50th in the  nation. Now I can proudly say that Nevada is the most improved State  when it comes to addressing our rates of uninsured children. Our State  has made significant progress since the State's decision to expand  Medicaid, and that has made a big impression on me.   Over the past few months, I have had the privilege of meeting with  Nevadans here in Washington, DC, as well as back home, to discuss  healthcare. The resounding message I continue to hear is that, because  of Medicaid expansion, more than 200,000 Nevadans have health insurance  today who otherwise wouldn't. The other resounding message I hear is  that drastic cuts to the Medicaid Program threaten the critical  services that Nevadans rely on.   Let me read you a letter I received from a woman in Las Vegas. She  said:         My oldest child has Down Syndrome and has depended on       Medicaid since the day she was born, and was denied       healthcare because of preexisting conditions that she was       born with. My husband and I are hardworking Americans. We       started our own business 5 years ago and have seen that       business grow more and more each year. We do not rely on the       government for assistance, other than Medicaid coverage.       Without it, we would be unable to afford the numerous       appointments with specialists and surgeries that keep our       daughter happy, healthy, and progressing in life.   [[Page S4261]]     This is one example of the real stories behind the numbers, and I  want to do everything I can to make sure they are protected and their  coverage is not threatened. I want to make sure their daughter has  healthcare coverage today and tomorrow.   Medicaid also plays a crucial role in Nevada when it comes to  covering the elderly and people with disabilities. More than 30,000 of  Nevada's seniors receive healthcare through Medicaid, including nursing  home care and services that help them live at home. In fact, more than  half of Nevada's nursing home residents are covered by Medicaid. Nearly  50,000 people with disabilities in Nevada now have access to care that  helps them live independently, thanks to Medicaid.   Karen from Henderson recently contacted me and said that her adult  son has MS and depends on Medicaid to help cover the cost of his  medication, which costs $300 per month. Without Medicaid, he can't  afford it.   One Nevadan traveled all the way from Las Vegas to talk with me about  her two sons with cystic fibrosis. She is worried about any legislation  that would jeopardize access to care for people with serious, chronic  illnesses, such as the ones her sons are struggling with.   In total, over 631,000 people in Nevada are covered by the Medicaid  Program. That is low-income children, pregnant women, seniors, and  people with disabilities. It is why I have said since the beginning of  the healthcare debate, that I will only support a solution that  protects Nevada's most vulnerable. The House bill didn't go far enough  to do that, and neither did the Senate's bill, and that is why I voted  against it last night.   Nevada faces unique challenges when it comes to healthcare. I have  spent the past few months trying to find ways to protect Nevadans who  depend on Medicaid and provide coverage for those with preexisting  conditions, all the while bringing down costs and improving quality and  access to care. I have also been having discussions with Nevadans in  Washington and back home to hear from them how potential changes could  impact their care.   Whether it is a mom in Reno who has a son with a heart condition and  is terrified about the future of his treatments or the nurses from Las  Vegas who came all the way to DC because they are worried that their  patients could lose coverage, I have been listening and I do  understand.   Make no mistake, ObamaCare needs fixing. It has led to higher costs  and fewer choices in my State. For the past 7 years, I have said that  we need more competition to drive down costs and increase competition  for Nevadans. My discussions with Nevadans in Washington and back home  have also allowed me the opportunity to hear from them how potential  changes could impact their care. I believe we can achieve these goals  while recognizing the role that Medicaid plays in our States and  ensuring that those who have coverage today are protected.   My role as a Senator is doing the very best I can for my State, and  that means standing up for Nevadans who depend on Medicaid. We are  having this debate because I do believe there are commonsense solutions  that can improve our healthcare system, and I voted to give us the  opportunity to have that discussion and to fight for them. But, as I  have said all along, healthcare reform cannot be balanced on the backs  of Nevada's low-income families and sickest individuals. That is  something I cannot and I will not stand for.   We can work to find a way to lower costs, increase choices, and  improve the quality of care for Nevadans everywhere, but we can do it  in a way that also protects our most vulnerable. That is why for the  past few months I have been working with my colleagues in the Senate  who also understand the unique challenges expansion States face, and we  have been fighting for solutions that will protect those who currently  rely on the Medicaid Program. It hasn't been easy, but that is the way  it is supposed to be, and that is OK.   I am here to roll up my sleeves, get to work, and fight for policies  that will be in the best interests of all Nevadans. So I encourage my  colleagues to support this amendment, Heller No. 288, today to  reiterate the value of Medicaid in our States. We have much work ahead  of us to do to improve the healthcare system for Nevadans and Americans  across this country.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk that would  express the importance of Medicaid in our individual States. I would  like to read from it two provisions that I think are important to this  whole body; that is, the Senate prioritizes ``Medicaid services for  individuals who have the greatest medical need, including individuals  with disabilities;'' also, that we ``should not consider legislation  that reduces or eliminates benefits or coverage for individuals who are  currently eligible for Medicaid.''   That is the amendment. I want everyone to express for their own  States how important the Medicaid Program is for their States, and I  would urge a ``yes'' vote from my colleagues.    Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the  Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and the waiver provisions of  applicable budget resolutions, I move to waive all applicable sections  of that act and applicable budget resolutions for purposes of amendment  No. 288 and, if adopted, for the provisions of the adopted amendment  included in any subsequent amendment to H.R. 1628 and any amendment  between Houses or conference report thereon, and I ask for the yeas and  nays.
