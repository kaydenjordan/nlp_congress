 Mr. Speaker, parents have a God-given right and role in  the raising of their children.   When they send their kids to the public schools, they expect the  schools to deliver a quality education to their children in order to  prepare them for success in the future. Unfortunately, government  schools have abused this trust and have been indoctrinating children  with far-left lies and poisoning their minds with woke gender ideology.   School administrators and teachers unions seem to think they own  America's children, that they alone have the right to decide what these  children think and believe, and that they alone should be the sole  authority in a child's life.   Schools across this country have been caught trying to convince  vulnerable teenagers that their bodies are wrong, filling their heads  with lies and convincing them to see their parents as enemies. This  line of thinking is morally wrong.   In my own district, a school district is being sued by a parent for  secretly changing her daughter's pronouns and identity without her  parent's knowledge or consent. Woke administrators have no moral  authority to experiment with children's minds in this way.   Parents have a moral right to be involved in their children's  education and should never be kept in the dark about issues that their  child is going through at school.   Congress must take action to enshrine parental rights over their  children.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Johnson for leading these  opportunities for us to communicate with the American people openly and  freely in a more casual, unhurried way of doing so.   It is good to be able to talk about these issues. Hopefully, folks  are paying attention. We are just trying to get the truth out and call  out the issues that are extremely important to them that we are working  on in Congress.   When I get up here, a lot of times I am talking about our food supply  and the farmers who grow it--as a Californian, we grow a lot of  different crops--the water it takes to grow those crops, our energy,  the condition of our energy in this country.   Tonight, I will talk more about our fiscal condition in this Nation  and of this government. It is troubling because a recent report issued  by the Congressional Budget Office found that the net interest of our  national debt--Mr. Johnson was talking about that a little bit ago on  spending--just the interest payment on our national debt will amount to  a $10.5 trillion burden for our taxpayers over the next decade.   We talk in these 10-year numbers. If you average that out, that is  $1.05 trillion per year just in interest service. For comparison, those  interest costs over the previous decade amounted to only $3 trillion,  again, versus $10.5 trillion for the coming decade. That is crushing on  our national budget and crushing on the discretionary portion that we  have over that budget.   That is not to take away from the fact that the Federal Government  already is taxing and extracts more in taxes from American families  than at any point in history.   This kind of payment on interest will devour a lot of our budget if  we don't get a handle on this. I shudder to think if interest rates go  up much more, the service on that debt becomes that much more  extensive. Of course, Federal spending coupled with that is rising at  an even higher rate. The increased spending has pushed our national  debt over that magic $31 trillion number, again, that we were speaking  about.   As high as this is, it pales in comparison to the United States'  unfunded liabilities, which amount to about $182 trillion. Unfunded  liabilities, meaning the debt obligations that do not have sufficient  funds set aside to pay them, include Social Security, Medicare, Federal  debt held by the public, and Federal employee and veteran benefits.  Social Security and Medicare's liabilities add up to $57 trillion.  These numbers clearly show the United States Federal Government is  living beyond its means.   Social Security and Medicare are called entitlement programs. Let me  stop on that for a moment.   Sometimes that word ``entitlement'' is thought of as a dirty word,  right?   It gets used pretty freely around here.   However, when you are talking about the entitlement as applied to  Social Security and Medicare, it is not necessarily a dirty word  because the people that paid into them are entitled to draw out from  them. That is not a bad word in that sense. They are entitled to what  they paid in and the amount that it grew during the time, hopefully,  while it was being held for them more or less in trust by the Federal  Government.   The CBO, Congressional Budget Office, predicts that Social Security  will run out of money in 2033 and Medicare in 2026. The fund will be  depleted.   We need to have an honest conversation about these funds, about these  programs going forward. No one wants to take away Social Security.  Nobody wants to deplete Medicare, but if they are going to be on the  rocks in the year 2033 for Social Security, for example, then we better  be doing something now. There needs to be an honest, bipartisan  discussion about doing so.   What are we going to do to head that off and have the numbers not  crunch badly by the time that time comes?                                time  1900    There are ways we can do that, but it is going to take an honest  bipartisan discussion, not scaring people saying, oh, Republicans are  going to take away Social Security. The President stood right up there  and tried to claim that until he had to walk it back just a few weeks  ago. There needs to be an honest discussion, not one used as a talking  point or a political weapon.   What we have is 47 million retirees in America today, and 40 percent  of the 47 million live entirely off Social Security. For these  Americans, their benefits being reduced in the future could be  disastrous. That is why we have to figure out how to make the fund go  beyond 2033 and be sustainable, well, permanently.   If we are going to save these programs for the current and future  generations, Congress must act swiftly, honestly with a real debate and  set these finances in order and return to the fiscal responsibility  that we should have had all along.   As stewards of the public's dollars, it is important that Congress  spend the public's money wisely and respectfully. The House must use  its powers to allocate government funds in a reasonable,  [[Page H1202]]  responsible way. There is a lot of room for debate on how that is, but  if we are having an interaction, instead of hurrying through or doing a  last minute patch-up at the end of the fiscal year, it is going to be a  lot better in the light of day doing so.   The current D.C. model of taxing, borrowing, and spending money that  we don't have will saddle our grandchildren with the burden of paying  off today's debts. We don't even have to wait for our grandchildren. It  is our children. It is us that are still in the work world. We are  stuck with this. We have to do better.   Failure to fix Washington, D.C.'s, spending today will mean our  children will have to live at lesser standards. We have always aspired  that our children should always do a little better than us, to leave  something a little better off. Why should they have to live under a  worse standard only because we are spending like crazy? They will be  saddled with a higher debt, higher taxes, and less opportunity.   America's strength on the world's stage depends on a strong American  economy at home. We must get to getting it actually balanced and not  take so long to truly balance our budget. It is our responsibility.
