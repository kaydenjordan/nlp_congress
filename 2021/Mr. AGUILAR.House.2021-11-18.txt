 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding time.   Sometimes what happens in Congress is complicated. It is wrapped in  parliamentary procedure and language that is hard to understand.   So let's be very clear about the legislation that we are discussing  today. The Build Back Better Act is a tax cut for working families. It  is an extension of the child tax credit and preschool access to help  parents get back to work. It is the largest ever initiative to fight  climate change. It is a tool to give every American a chance to  succeed.   Passing this bill will lift children out of poverty, expand our  middle class, and make healthcare more affordable. It is simple.   Madam Speaker, we need to pass this bill because the American people  deserve this investment.
