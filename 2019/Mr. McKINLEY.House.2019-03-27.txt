 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Wheeling  Park High School Speech and Debate Team, which has won the West  Virginia State championship for 40 years in a row.   Think about that.   Their uninterrupted string of victories began when Jimmy Carter was  President, and now has extended through the administrations of  Presidents Reagan, Bush 41, Clinton, Bush 43, President Obama, and now  President Trump.   Their winning streak is longer than most of my staff has been alive.  Their 40-year record may very well be the longest in the country's  history.   Their students are part of a dynasty. Some even have a personal  family legacy because they are following the footsteps of their  parents, who also won when they competed in the high school competition  at Park.   Look, Generation Z suffers from a lot of negative stereotypes, but  the team members on the Wheeling Park Speech and Debate Team are  examples of a great new generation and what they can do.   These students are dedicated. They work year-round and compete in  competitions to hone their skills. They are able to convey emotions and  sway an audience while passionately arguing today's most pressing  topics.   We couldn't be prouder of these students. There is no doubt in my  mind, they have a bright future ahead of them, and that has everything  to do with their work ethic and dedication.   I would also like to congratulate and thank their coaches, Bill  Cornforth, Kayla Nelson, Isabella Droginske and Brigitte Mazure, as  well as the team's founding coach, Fran Schoolcraft, who led them  through their first 25 victories.   Congratulations on their first 40, and here's to the road to 41.                                time  1045         Congratulating American Association of Critical-Care Nurses     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 50th  anniversary of the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses.   My wife, Mary, was a critical-care nurse for over 45 years and served  as the past president of AACN. Her time as a critical-care nurse taught  me how difficult it is to have a career in nursing.   It requires working long hours, weekends, and caring for people  during the most challenging times of the patients' lives. And while  sometimes nurses get to see happy endings, other times, they share in  the emotions of families making very difficult decisions.   That is why it is important to honor the American Association of  Critical-  [[Page H2836]]  Care Nurses, their dedication to their patients, and their push for  excellence because, like their mission statement says, ``Nothing less  is acceptable.''                            ____________________
