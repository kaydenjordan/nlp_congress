 Mr. Speaker, I have traveled to the southern border  dozens of times over the years, and the problem is always the same. The  people who defend our border--really, defend our country--do the best  they can with what they have got, but they are outmanned, outgunned,  and outfinanced by the drug cartels and the people coming across from  the other side.   The continued failure to protect our border threatens our national  security and the sovereignty of America. The reality is that the  majority of the southern border territory is controlled by someone  other than the United States. Why? Because there is no workable plan.  Also, there is no moral will by this administration to protect our  border.   My bill, the SMART Border Act, outlines a robust border protection  strategy that includes achieving operational control of the border  within 1 year, provides smart border technology, and mandates more  boots on the ground, including 10,000 National Guard troops at the  request of the four border State Governors.   Mr. Speaker, we must have the moral will to protect our borders. All  types of people are crossing the border into the United States  illegally--the good, the bad, and the ugly--and those days need to end.  No one should come into America without America's permission.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
