 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Arkansas for  yielding and also my colleague from Oklahoma for introducing these  commonsense amendments to rein in spending and counteract the bloated  spending package that our Democrat colleagues are ramming through this  House.   It is past time we tighten the purse strings in Washington. There is  no doubt that we are in the midst of a Biden economic crisis, thanks to  wasteful Washington spending.   Just this morning, I hosted a telephone townhall, and I asked my  constituents in Georgia's 12th Congressional District if they are  feeling the impact of Biden's inflation. Overwhelmingly, 93 percent  said they are paying more for everyday goods and they got less money  every week.   This inflation is a result of Biden's and congressional Democrats'  spending spree, and here we are, debating more irresponsible and  unrealistic spending that will do more to harm the pocketbooks of  American families.   When in the history of civilization has any Nation survived this  insane spending? It is not sustainable.   Families work hard to live within their means and manage their  household budgets, and it is a dereliction of duty as elected officials  to keep spending money we don't have.   While many American families are suffering now due to the rise in  inflation, our future generations are the ones who will eventually have  to pay the price. I urge my colleagues to support the Hern amendments  so that we can start to get our fiscal house back under control.
