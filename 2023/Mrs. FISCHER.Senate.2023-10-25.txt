 Madam President, 18 days ago, terror shook the Middle  East. Eighteen days ago, Hamas tore children from their parents and  tore mothers, fathers, brothers, and sisters from their families.  Eighteen days ago, terrorism swept across Israel, destroying everything  in its path.   We all know this. We have heard about these attacks repeatedly with  every news cycle. Even as we continue reading articles, hearing  analyses, and seeing new information, let us not forget the reality of  these terror attacks, the seriousness of such a massive loss of human  life.   Hamas killed over 1,400 people, over 1,400 innocent civilians, in its  attacks this month. Death touched thousands of friends and family  members, and its aftereffects are still rippling across Israel and  across the world.   Let us resist our modern impulse to leave this tragedy behind in  favor of the next headline, the next crisis. Let us allow the abuse,  the torture, and the murder of Israelis and Americans alike to strike a  fresh sense of grief and anger in our hearts every time we hear about  them. That grief and anger must drive us to respond to the horror of  terrorism.   Israel is responding, yes, but the response to terrorism should not  be bound by Israel's national borders because terrorism itself is not  bound by national borders.   Hamas killed American citizens in its attack on innocent people  across Israel. Terrorists are still holding American citizens hostage  in Gaza. Hamas has American blood on its hands.   One American, Hayim Katsman, hid in a closet with his neighbor as  Hamas militants rained gunfire on an Israeli village. A neighbor told  CNN that Katsman covered him with his body and saved his life by  absorbing the bullets.   American Deborah Matias and her husband sacrificed themselves for  their 16-year-old son, acting as human shields against Hamas's fire.   Two American brothers, Igal and Amit Wachs, died together, both  trying to save those around them. Amit, who volunteered as head of the  village's self-defense unit, ran outside to help his neighbors at the  beginning of the attack. In the process, he was killed. Igal was killed  as he searched for a weapon to defend himself and his family.   These are real people--real Americans--whose lives were extinguished  far too early by the terror in Israel.   It is critical that we see the return of every American stranded in  Israel or held hostage in Gaza. Every American must be accounted for  and safely brought home.   Following the coldblooded slaughter of both Americans and Israelis,  the United States must stand firmly with Israel. We must send a clear  message to Hamas, to Hezbollah, and to their state sponsor, Iran: We  will not equivocate in our support for Israel. We will stand with them  and provide the assistance they need as they make difficult decisions  to defend their sovereign nation.    Congress and the administration must work together to gather all of  our diplomatic and economic strength against Iran. We must work  together to aid Israel, whether through economic support, lethal aid,  or increased intelligence sharing.   We know Israel will need more defensive capabilities, including Tamir  interceptors for its Iron Dome air defense system, the backbone of its  missile defense architecture. I support the Department of Defense's  current plans to send our two Iron Dome batteries to Israel to bolster  their security.   My colleagues and I introduced a bill to reallocate aid funding to  Israel's Iron Dome that could have ended up in Hamas's pocket. This  legislation would be an important first step in defending Israel  against future attacks.   We know Israel will need more offensive capabilities, including  precision-guided munitions to hit specific ground targets. We know  Israel will need our intelligence on the Middle East so it can  eliminate the Hamas threat completely. And we know standing with Israel  against terror will buttress and fortify our own national defense and  our own national security. Our support for Israel will help it triumph  over terrorism, and our support for Israel will help us show strength  and deter our adversaries. By protecting Israeli interests, we will  promote American interests as well.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, on August 30, Nebraska made history.  Thousands of spectators streamed into Lincoln's Memorial Stadium for  two women's volleyball matches: the first between the University of  Nebraska at Kearney and Wayne State College and the second between the  University of Nebraska-Lincoln and the University of Nebraska Omaha.   On Volleyball Day in Nebraska, we broke a world record. Our Nebraska  team set the new record for attendance at a women's sporting event:  92,003 fans. Volleyball Day in Nebraska took months of preparation to  pull off, but the University of Nebraska did it successfully. Our  Nebraska colleges planned and worked hard in anticipation of this new  record. It is a picture of Nebraska. We are a State that is defined by  dedication, drive, and--most of all--by community.   Nebraskans showcased that dedication and drive as they came together  to get as many people as possible in the stands. And when they got  there, they supported and encouraged players and fans alike. Whether  the spectators were Husker, Maverick, Lopers, or Wildcat fans, they  showed sportsmanship and good will.   In response to Nebraska's exciting new record, we are passing a  resolution today that would celebrate women's collegiate athletics in  our home State. This resolution will recognize the historic Volleyball  Day in Nebraska on a Federal level.   In addition to attendance at a women's sporting event, Volleyball Day  in Nebraska broke several other records. The event exceeded the  previous attendance record for NCAA women's volleyball. The new women's  volleyball record of 92,003 fans in attendance is almost five times  more than the old record of 18,755. The August 30 match also exceeded  the attendance record for UNL's Memorial Stadium.   Our resolution specifically honors Nebraska's former coach Pat  Sullivan, who started the University of Nebraska volleyball program in  1975. It also honors former coach Terry Pettit, who built the  volleyball program from 1977 to 1999, and current coach John Cook, who  has sustained excellence in this program since the year 2000.   And the team has sustained excellence ever since Volleyball Day in  Nebraska. Our UNL women's volleyball team won the battle of the  undefeated against Wisconsin this past weekend, and our team is now  ranked No. 1. This Senate resolution celebrates a special day for  women, for volleyball players, and for all Nebraskans. I am proud to  bring well-deserved recognition to this unique accomplishment. As we  often say, there is no place like Nebraska.   And I would yield the floor to my colleague from Nebraska, Senator  Ricketts.    Mr. President, I would like to thank my colleague  Senator Ricketts for his great comments in recognizing the women's  volleyball team, the State of Nebraska, and the great people that we  have.   Mr. President, and with that, I would ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 428, submitted earlier  today.    I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to,  the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I yield the floor.                            ____________________
