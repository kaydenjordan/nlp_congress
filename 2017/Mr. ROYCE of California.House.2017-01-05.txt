 Mr. Speaker, the problem with this U.N.  resolution is not simply that it criticizes Israeli actions; it is that  it is fundamentally one-sided. It is anti-Israel, and that is a  departure from longstanding, bipartisan U.S. policy.   U.N. Security Council Resolution 2334 does not address the  Palestinian Authority's failure to end incitement of hatred. Frankly,  they encourage it. The violence that we see against Israeli civilians  comes from the encouragement of PA officials. It doesn't address the  Palestinian Authority's continued payments. An incentive payment in  their budget--over $300 million a year--is paid to those who would  carry out attacks against Israeli civilians. The more mayhem you  create, the longer the term you have in prison, the larger the stipend.  That comes right out of the budget of the Palestinian Authority.   The U.N. resolution did not call upon Palestinian leadership to  fulfill their obligations towards negotiations. The Middle East Summit  is planned next month. So, first, the administration abstains on this,  and next month in France there is real concern that another damaging  Security Council resolution should follow.   That is why this dangerous policy must be rejected, hopefully  unanimously, by this House.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution  22, I call up the resolution (H. Res. 11) objecting to United Nations  Security Council Resolution 2334 as an obstacle to Israeli-Palestinian  peace, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous material in the Record.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan), the esteemed Speaker of the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I want to begin by thanking the ranking member, the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Engel). I thank him for working with me in a bipartisan  manner not just on this resolution but on the one that we worked on  late last year--a unanimous vote by this body directing the  administration not to take the steps that the administration has taken.   I appreciate the leader and the Speaker as well working with us to  ensure this resolution was brought quickly to the floor of this House.   Today, we put Congress on record objecting to the recent U.N.  Security Council resolution that hurt our ally, that hurt Israel, and I  believe that puts an enduring peace further out of reach.                                time  1730    Mr. Speaker, the United States has long recognized that a solution to  the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can only come about through direct  bilateral negotiations between these two parties, and that is why it is  longstanding U.S. policy to veto the many one-sided, the many anti- Israel resolutions at the United Nations Security Council that violate  that principle.   But just the other week, the Obama administration broke with this  longstanding U.S. policy by failing to veto U.N. Security Council  Resolution 2334. This dangerous resolution effectively states that the  Jewish quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem and the Western Wall,  Judaism's holiest site, are, in the words of the resolution, ``occupied  territory.'' Why would we not veto that?   It also lends legitimacy to efforts by the Palestinian Authority to  put pressure on Israel through the U.N. rather than to go through the  process of engaging in direct negotiations, and it puts wind in the  sails of the shameful boycott divestment and sanctions movement.   Unquestionably, this U.N. Security Council action damages the  prospects for peace. The resolution and the bullying and harassment of  Israel that it will spur only happened for one reason: the Obama  administration let it happen--and that went against the distinct  warnings from this body.   Mr. Engel and I engaged in letters, in conversations with senior  administration officials seeking their assurance that the United States  would veto one-sided, anti-Israel resolutions. In November, the House  unanimously, all of us, passed a resolution which warned the  administration against taking such last-minute action.   With that resolution, H. Con. Res. 165, the House unanimously stated  that the United States Government should continue to oppose and veto  United Nations Security Council resolutions that seek to impose  solutions to final-status issues or are one-sided and anti-Israel. Yet  the administration rejected the call from Congress and chose a course  that will bring harm for years to come by failing to veto U.N. Security  Council Resolution 2334.   If the Palestinians want a lasting peace, they must accept that  Israel, not the U.N., is their negotiating partner; and that means  ending the incitement to violence against Israelis that goes on in so  many of the mosques, that goes on in the schools, that goes on in the  newspapers and on television there. It also means ending--and I think  this is the most important fact, because leaving this out of the  resolution at the U.N. is beyond me--their pay-to-slay scheme.   You talk about a lack of balance. Here we have a situation where,  since 2003, it has been Palestinian law to reward Palestinian  terrorists--terrorists--to go out, and they are given this incitement,  this stipend for life. The more mayhem they create, the more horrific  the number of civilians they attack and, therefore, the longer the  sentence, the more they know: Well, I can serve my time, and then when  I get out, I can get this stipend for the rest of my life--and it is  larger and larger, depending upon the amount of mayhem--and if I don't  make it, or if I am a suicide bomber, my family gets the stipend.   That, by law, is the way the Palestinian Authority has engineered  this, costing the lives--and you can read  [[Page H149]]  about it every month of those civilians attacked on the streets. It is  not just Israelis, of course. Taylor Force, a U.S. Marine, was killed  simply because he was in Israel, but it was by someone responding to  the incitement.   So $300 million per year spent by the Palestinian Authority to do  that. No mention of that, of course, by the United Nations. And that is  why today's action is so important, to demonstrate our united  opposition to U.N. Security Council Resolution 2334, call for its  repeal, to head off any more moves the Obama administration might have  in the next few days with respect to the Paris conference next week as  well, and to provide the foundation for the next administration to move  forcefully to counteract its dangerous impact.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in response briefly, we did  have a substitute from Mr. Price, and we looked at that substitute, but  it did not once mention the United Nations Security Council Resolution  2334.   Mr. Engel and I have worked hard together, in good faith and in a  bipartisan manner, to develop a measure that rejects and repudiates  this dangerous U.N. resolution that was passed; and also, ours warns  the White House against taking additional measures in the last few  weeks of the current administration. I think it is important to remind  the body that this is very concerning, given the backdrop of the Paris  conference on the 15th of this month and the very real concern that the  President could take further steps at the U.N.   Again, Mr. Price's amendment did not include this urgent warning. I  want to say that I am happy to work with Mr. Price in a bipartisan  manner once the Committee on Foreign Affairs organizes, but time is of  the essence. We must act to reject United Nations Security Council  Resolution 2334, not remain silent on it, and we have got to limit the  damage that the administration has caused to prospects for a lasting  peace.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Ros-Lehtinen), chairman emeritus of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), the longtime chairman of the  Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human  Rights, and International Organizations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), who has served for years as chairman of  the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and  Trade.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. DeSantis).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Zeldin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Trott).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Lance).    Mr. Speaker, just by way of the facts, what  this resolution attempts to do is to reject the U.N. resolution that  calls for a Palestinian state but not a Jewish state, a resolution that  opens the door for those who want to impose boycott, divestment, or  other sanctions measures against Israel or Israeli companies and, in  essence, declares Judaism's holiest site as occupied territory. That is  what is in this resolution. Those are the facts that we are debating  here. Those are the facts that need to be rejected, my colleagues.   I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Costello).    I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Hill).                                time  1830     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Taylor).    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Mr. Speaker, in short, United Nations Security Council Resolution  2334 has harmed our ally Israel. It has harmed the prospects for peace.  It is one-sided. It is an anti-Israel resolution, the kind of which it  has been longstanding U.S. policy to veto within the U.N. Security  Council, and it is not hard to see why because this resolution opens  the door for those who want to impose boycott, divestment, or other  sanctions measures against Israel or against Israeli companies. And, in  essence, it declares Judaism's holiest site, the Western Wall, as  occupied territory.   Mr. Speaker, this is reminiscent of another action by the United  Nations, the infamous ``Zionism is racism'' resolution whose damage  took decades to undo.   Fortunately, the bipartisan rejection of the President's U.N.  decision provides an opportunity for the House to rally around a more  constructive policy and renewed U.S. leadership in the region.   I strongly urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support  this resolution so that the bipartisan policy of rejecting this harmful  U.N. Security  [[Page H163]]  Council resolution and encouraging direct negotiation is endorsed loud  and clear. It is far past time for the incitement to stop and the  budgeting of $300 million by the Palestinian Authority to pay people to  slay Israeli civilians be discontinued.   I yield back the balance of my time.
