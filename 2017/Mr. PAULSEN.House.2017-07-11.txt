 Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the Minnetonka High  School boys tennis team on their recent extraordinary State tournament  victory. The Skippers won their second consecutive State title, led by  Senior Adam Thompson and Junior Ben Wheaton.   The team worked hard to win, with a final score of 4-3. This close  victory displayed their competitive skill, and the way the Skippers  carried themselves after the victory epitomizes the virtue of  sportsmanship and humility.   Mr. Speaker, with their strong determination and commitment to  excellence, these student athletes exemplify the very best of their  school and of our community. They excel both on the court and in the  classroom.   I offer my congratulations to the players, the coaches, and the  parents. Congratulations to the Minnetonka boys tennis team on their  victory and becoming State champs.                            ____________________
