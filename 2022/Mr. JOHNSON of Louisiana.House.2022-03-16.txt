 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on the subject of my  Special Order.    Madam Speaker, we have another crisis, yet  another crisis, created by the policy choices of this White House.   The national average price for a gallon of gas reached $4.32 on  Sunday; and, yes, that is the highest price in U.S. history.   Last Thursday, we also learned that U.S. inflation soared 7.9 percent  over the past 12 months. That is the largest spike in consumer prices  in 40 years.   Now, the Washington Democrats' blame game is in full swing. Just to  get this straight, at first, according to Democrats, they said  inflation ``wasn't happening.'' Then inflation was ``merely  transitory,'' they tried to convince us. Then inflation somehow only  hurt  [[Page H3764]]  rich folks; that was the only line of reasoning.   But Washington Democrats' latest fiction might be their greatest yet:  That the past year of steady, unrelenting price increases for gas and  consumer goods is actually Vladimir Putin's fault.   Yes, that is right, Madam Speaker, Vladimir Putin. He didn't kill the  Keystone pipeline. Joe Biden did. Vladimir Putin didn't ban drilling  for oil on Federal lands. Joe Biden did that. Vladimir Putin didn't  pass trillions upon trillions in unnecessary government spending in a  single year. Joe Biden and the Washington Democrats did that.   Madam Speaker, what is so hard about just being honest with the  American people? President Biden should accept responsibility for the  past year of rising prices and pledge to correct course. He had better,  or we are in for more and more pain.   The President should do everything in his power to make it easier,  not harder, for America to produce more oil and gas. This would lower  prices for the American people. It would make our country and Europe  less dependent on foreign energy. But instead, President Biden says he  actually ``can't do much right now'' about the skyrocketing gas prices.   The Democratic Caucus leader said the issue of gas prices ``hasn't  come up'' during his party's caucus meetings. Really? You haven't made  time to discuss any solutions to the number one issue facing Americans  right now?   Now that the Biden administration and Congressional Democrats know  they are in a tight spot, here is the thing: They are trying to  convince the American people that an American President can't control  gas prices in the United States but Russians can. Good luck with that.   I thank my colleagues for being here tonight for my Special Order  hour this evening.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Meuser).                                time  1730     Madam Speaker, from energy States like  ours--Pennsylvania, Louisiana, and the others--we have been saying this  for a long, long time: Energy security is national security. Now,  everybody recognizes it.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Tiffany),  another gentleman who knows quite a bit about this issue.    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for his  remarks.   Madam Speaker, when we think about energy States, of course, we  probably think about Texas first. I am delighted to yield to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin), who represents that State so well.     Madam Speaker, I thank Dr. Babin. That is  Texas strong, as we expected.   Madam Speaker, one of the strongest Republican delegations in our  Congress comes from another State, Tennessee. I am delighted to yield  to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Rose), one of the hardest working  men in Congress.    Madam Speaker, a lot of comments there from  the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Rose), and we will stay on that theme  for the great State of Tennessee.   Madam Speaker, I am happy to yield Mr. Burchett, another gentleman  from that great State, for more common sense.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate my friend. He  has been a faithful participant in the Special Order hours, getting the  message to the American people, and it is so important right now.   Madam Speaker, I yield next to the gentleman from California (Mr.  LaMalfa), another gentleman who has been very faithful to deliver this  message to the American people week in and week out.    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for his  comments. There are so many consequences to these bad policy choices,  and I appreciate his illuminating many of those tonight.    Madam Speaker, I yield next to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Clyde), another faithful messenger for the truth in America.    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend. He has a  way of putting it so clearly, and I am grateful for his voice. It is so  consistent.   Madam Speaker, I yield next to the gentleman from Florida ( Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Florida for bringing that  wisdom to the floor tonight. There has been a theme here this evening  with all of my colleagues who have participated in this Special Order  hour. We have an energy crisis, the latest crisis that has beset the  American people because of terrible policy choices from this White  House and the Democrats in Congress. It is just plain and simple, those  are the objective facts.   It seems like almost a decade ago now, but just a little over a year  ago, if you rewind to the Trump years, you can recall, and everyone  will know again more objective truth, objective facts, how well we were  doing in all of these areas.   President Biden came in and did exactly the opposite. I mean, when  President Trump took office, he came in--I remember very vividly the  first time he came and spoke with the House Republicans in our  conference, and he told us, among the first commitments he made to us-- I mean, this is January of 2017. He was just taking office. We had just  begun that Congress, and he came and spoke to us and said, ``I don't  want to talk about energy independence anymore. I want to talk about  energy dominance.'' Dominance, he said.    Of course, from an energy State like mine in Louisiana, the Louisiana  delegation was delighted to hear that because we know what it means not  only for our State's economy but for the stability, the security of our  entire country.   I will tell you what, more objective fact, President Trump delivered  on that promise. In a very short period of time, we became not only  energy independent again, but energy dominant, just as he said. We  became a net exporter. All boats were rising. The economy was doing  well. In fact, we had the best economic numbers in the history of the  world, not just the history of the United States. Prior to COVID, we  had the best economy because of the policy choices that were made. We  advanced those policies through the Congress; President Trump led on  them, and his administration did a fantastic job. Because of that, our  energy stability, our energy security, all of that was well in place.   And then President Biden comes in, and he does instinctively, I  guess, exactly the opposite. Again, in very short order, he reversed  all of those great trends. As has been articulated so many times  tonight, among the first executive orders he issued--I mean immediately  upon taking office in January 2020--was an executive order that killed  the Keystone pipeline. There were more than 42,000 jobs related to that  project just killed overnight; as well as all the energy independence  and energy dominance that that would have meant for us.   And then he issues the moratorium on Federal production on Federal  lands. Well, that killed a State like Louisiana. Not just on the land,  but right offshore as well. Of course, that is a big part of our  economy and in the other energy States. It was just devastating.   At the same time, while he is killing the Keystone pipeline, he is  ending Federal production on Federal lands, he green lights the Nord  Stream 2 pipeline. That was Putin's project. So he empowers Russia, he  fuels the war machine for Putin because, of course, he can supply oil  all over Western Europe, and that filled his coffers.   Listen, it was mentioned tonight these stickers that are on the gas  pumps all over the country, these ``I did that'' stickers that have  President Biden's picture. It is funny. We don't support vandalism,  right? But, I mean, I see them all over Louisiana, and it is  devastating.                                time  1800    President Biden is pointing to the sticker shock, the cost that it is  taking everyone to fill their tanks, and it is exactly right. That is  very telling. A picture is worth 1,000 words. He is responsible. These  are the results of policy choices.   And as Mr. Franklin of Florida said a few moments ago, these problems  are completely self-inflicted. And because of that, let's always  remember, they can be easily reversed. The President could just do the  opposite of what he has done since he took office; reverse course and  fix this dilemma for the American people.   But you know what? He won't do that. I don't know if it is because he  is beholden to the radical left environmentalist agenda, the climate  agenda, or if he has some sort of ulterior motive. I am not sure.   But I will tell you what: My constituents are asking that question  openly right now, and millions upon millions of the American people who  are suffering because of these policies are beginning to ask that as  well.   Madam Speaker, I am delighted to yield to the gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Steel), who has a few more things to say about this  issue.    Madam Speaker, I am so grateful the  gentlewoman came to participate. We know she is very busy. It has been  a long day in the Education and Labor Committee. We are grateful she is  doing that great work.   Madam Speaker, I know that the time is winding up for our Special  Order hour. There was a lot going on on Capitol Hill today. I am  grateful to my Republican colleagues for coming in and participating  and helping to share this very, very important message with the  American people.   There is a lot of spin going on in the country right now, from TikTok  influencers, to media types who are engaging in the spin for the White  House at their request, and the American people see through it. They  are making and being made to make difficult choices for their families.   Hardworking Americans are suffering right now because of these policy  choices. There is crisis after crisis after crisis everywhere we look  because of, frankly put, poor leadership in the White House.   I believe that we will have a change in all of this come November in  the next election cycle, and with the presidential election that will  follow 2 years later. And it can't happen soon enough because the White  House has shown no intention, no indication that they will reverse  policies, as they should, as we mentioned a moment ago could be easily  done to alleviate the pain for all these Americans. But for whatever  reason, they will not do it.   Madam Speaker, I will wind down this evening. I want to thank my  colleagues for being here, participating in this really important  Special Order hour, and I yield back the balance of my time.
