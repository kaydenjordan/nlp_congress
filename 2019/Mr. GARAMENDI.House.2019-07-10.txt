 Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this legislation. It  is a good piece of legislation.   I thank Chairman Smith; Ranking Member Thornberry; and my colleague,  Mr. Lamborn, for working with our committee. We worked closely with  members of the committee on and off to ensure that the bill addresses  four priority areas affecting our military.   First, we ask the question: Is the military ready for climate change?  It is not. In the last 12 months, severe storms have devastated Marine  Corps  [[Page H5346]]  Base Camp Lejeune, Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, Tyndall Air  Force Base, and Offutt Air Force Base. This NDAA will accelerate and  enhance readiness by requiring the Department of Defense to plan for  and respond to the threat that climate change poses to military  installations and operations.   Second, the bill includes a number of bipartisan provisions aimed at  addressing problems associated with the management and oversight of  military housing for families.   Third, the bill authorizes additional funding and includes bipartisan  provisions to mitigate drinking water contamination resulting from  fluorinated compounds used in military installations.   Fourth, the bill continues to uphold the committee's responsibility  to conduct oversight of, and provide support for, military training  maintenance and infrastructure. For example, the mark authorizes $256.4  billion, an $8.8 billion increase over fiscal year 2019 authorized  levels, for operation and maintenance accounts. This includes an  additional $834 million to address submarine and surface ship  maintenance shortfalls and an additional $309 million for the Air Force  weapon systems sustainment accounts. It also includes $11.5 billion for  military construction, family housing, and implementation of previous  Base Realignment and Closure activities.   This includes $168 million above the budget request for construction  projects associated with the European Deterrence Initiative and  authorizes 31 additional programs.   Mr. Chair, today I rise in support of the fiscal year 2020 National  Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). I would like to start by thanking  Chairman Smith and the House Armed Services Committee staff who have  worked many long nights putting together this year's NDAA. The bill  that is before the House is a good bill and I encourage my colleagues  to support its passage.   As the Chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee, I worked closely with  members on and off the committee to ensure the bill addressed three  priority areas affecting our military. First, the bill includes a  number of bipartisan provisions aimed at addressing problems associated  with the management and oversight of military family housing. The bill  does the following:   Requires the military services to establish a tenants' bill of rights  for residents of privatized military family housing;   Requires the Secretary of Defense to develop an assessment tool to  identify and measure health and safety hazards in housing;   Prohibits the use of non-disclosure agreements in connection with  entering into, continuing, or terminating a lease for on-base military  housing;   Authorizes an additional $140.8 million to hire additional civilian  personnel to improve oversight and management of military family  housing; and   Creates a public database for complaints related to military housing,  requires annual financial audits of randomly selected privatized  military family housing, and annual congressional reports on the  condition, maintenance, and management of privatized military family  housing.   Second, the bill authorizes additional funding and includes  bipartisan provisions to mitigate drinking water contamination  resulting from fluorinated compounds around military installations:   Prohibits the release of fluorinated firefighting foam (AFFF) at  military installations except in cases of emergency response or in  limited circumstances;   Requires the Secretary of Navy to complete a new military  specification by January 2025 for a fluorine free firefighting agent to  be used at all DoD installations and a complete ban on fluorinated  foams on military installations by September 2029, or sooner if  possible;   Authorizes the National Guard to access Defense Environmental  Remediation Account funds, for five years, for the limited purpose of  addressing Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) exposure and  contamination;   Prohibits the use of fluorinated AFFF in training exercises and  encourages the Department to ensure adequate training for individuals  in regular contact with AFFF about the potential dangers associated  with PFAS;   Requires a report on the Department's understanding of best-practices  for cleanup and disposal of PFAS;   Provides an additional $121.3 million in environmental restoration  accounts for remediation activities related to perfluorinated chemicals  in drinking water on or near military installations; and   Authorizes DoD to provide fresh water and treatment of contaminated  water for agricultural purposes adjacent to a military installation  where water is contaminated due to military activities.   Third, the bill contains a number of sensible provisions requiring  the Department of Defense to plan for and respond to the threat that  climate change poses to military installations and military operations:   Requires DoD to develop installation master plans that assess current  climate vulnerabilities and plan for mitigating the risks;   Limits DoD's ability to spend planning and design funds until it  initiates the process of amending the building standards for military  construction to ensure that building practices and standards promote  energy, climate, and cyber resilience at military installations;   Requires all proposals for military construction projects to consider  potential long-term changes in environmental conditions, and  increasingly frequent extreme weather events, as well as, industry  best-practices to withstand extreme weather events;   Authorizes an additional $40 million for the Department's Energy  Resilience and Conservation Investment Program; and   Directs the Secretary of Defense to develop a climate vulnerability  and risk assessment tool to assist in providing standardized risk  calculations of climate-related impacts to military installations and  capabilities.   Further, the bill also includes important provisions to reform border  deployment and ensure funding for our military is spent wisely and as  Congress intended, and not on an unnecessary border wall:   It prevents the President from diverting Defense funding to pay for  an unnecessary border wall;   Includes a blanket prohibition on funding for the construction of a  wall, barrier, or fence along the southern land border;   Prohibits reprogramming of funds into the counter drug account, which  has been used by the Administration to do construction along the  southern land border;   Does not include the $7.2 billion requested by the Administration to  backfill MILCON projects and/or forward fund portions of the wall;   Modifies an authority the DoD uses when deploying active duty  personnel to the border to require all support to be reimbursable and  require a wavier that the deployment won't affect readiness, the  support task aligns with the unit's mission, the task is inherently  government and can't be contracted; and   Amends the emergency construction authority (10 USC 2808) to limit  the total cost of military construction projects undertaken during a  national emergency to $500 million, with a further limit of $100  million for construction projects within the United States and would  add elements to required congressional notifications.   In addition, the bill continues to uphold the committee's  responsibility to conduct oversight of, and provide support for,  military training, maintenance, and infrastructure. For example, the  mark authorizes $256.4 billion, an $8.8 billion increase over fiscal  year 2019 authorized levels, for operation and maintenance accounts.  This includes an additional $834 million to address submarine and  surface ship maintenance shortfalls and an additional $309 million for  Air Force weapon systems sustainment accounts. The mark also included  $11.5 billion for military construction, family housing, and  implementation of previous Base Realignment and Closure activities.  This includes $168.6 million above the budget request for construction  projects associated with the European Deterrence Initiative and  authorization for 31 additional construction projects valued at over $1  billion, that were not included in the budget request, but that the  committee were able to accelerate from the military departments'  unfunded priority lists.   Additionally, this year's NDAA funds important priorities at Travis  and Beale Air Force Bases in my district. The military construction  projects authorized in this bill will support the new KC-46 mission at  Travis Air Force Base and will improve resilience and power supply at  Beale Air Force Base, enabling it to continue to support intelligence,  surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and multidomain operations.   I'm proud of the funding authorized by, and legislative provisions  included in the Readiness mark. I believe the mark ensures Congress  fulfills its oversight responsibilities, helps advance our military's  near-term readiness goals, and drives the Department to plan for and  take action against long-term threats.   I'm also pleased this NDAA includes a 3.1 percent pay raise for our  troops and includes the text of my bill, H.R. 2617, the Occupational  and Environmental Transparency Health Act. This will require DoD to  input any Occupational Environmental Health hazards exposure into  servicemembers' records while deployed, so it is tracked throughout  their career and into veteran status. It will also require the VA to  retroactively update records based on information contained in the Burn  Pit Registry, since many veterans' health records do not account for  their exposures.  [[Page H5347]]    Additional provisions I'm pleased are included in the fiscal year  2020 NDAA are included below, many of which are related to the critical  oversight the Strategic Forces Subcommittee is conducting over our  nuclear weapons enterprise:   Requires a report from the Secretary of Defense on military-to- military dialogue with foreign countries to reduce the risk of  miscalculation, unintended consequences, or accidents that could  precipitate a nuclear war;   Prohibits funding for the deployment of new, low-yield nuclear  missile warheads;   Clarifies the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board's authorities  by providing prompt and unfettered access to defense nuclear facilities  for independent nuclear oversight;   Facilitates implementation of the Open Skies Treaty and prohibits  funding for withdrawal unless Russia is in material breach or DoD and  State provide a certification that withdrawal is in the best interest  of national security and have consulted with U.S. allies;   Increases funding for Nuclear Command, Control and Communications.   Repeals the requirement to demonstrate plutonium pit production of at  a rate of 80 pits per year by 2027, and instead prioritizes producing  30 plutonium pits per year by 2026;   Until the National Nuclear Security Administrator submits an analysis  of alternatives with respect to replacing the ICBM W78 warhead, this  bill cuts $103 million from the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent, cuts  $59 million from the related warhead, and fences remaining funding for  the warhead;   Requires an independent technical study of the W78 replacement and  potential problems; and   Repeals the conventional requirement for the Long Range Stand Off  Weapon.   I'm proud of the hard work that's been done to put together a strong  National Defense Authorization Act this year, and I urge my colleagues  to support the fiscal year 2020 NDAA.                                time  1745
