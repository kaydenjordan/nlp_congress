 I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) is  necessarily absent.    Madam President, last Saturday was a historic day in  Springfield, IL, my hometown. It was the biggest snowfall in one day in  our city's history. I spent that Saturday not shaking hands with my  constituents but shaking hands with my shovel, trying to shovel snow  away. It was a historic day in Springfield but, sadly, it was a  historic day for America too.   Saturday marked the longest shutdown of the U.S. Government in the  history of the United States. As of today, the shutdown has continued  for 26 days. Day by day, the harmful effects of this government  shutdown are getting worse. Alarmingly, the President seems not to  really understand or appreciate the real-life impact this shutdown is  having on many Americans.   In all, more than 8,000 Federal workers in my home State of Illinois  are going without a paycheck during this shutdown--8,000 people who are  concerned about paying their bills, as most working families are. These  are hard-working Americans.   I want to show you a photo of one of them. He happens to be a friend  of mine. His name is Toby Hauck. This is Toby here. Toby is a veteran  of the U.S. Air Force. His job in Aurora, IL, is to make sure that my  plane, when it arrives at O'Hare, lands safely. Toby Hauck is an air  traffic controller. Air traffic controllers have some of the most  important and most stressful Federal jobs in America, and this shutdown  is a kick in the gut to Toby Hauck and all of these air traffic  controllers.   Many air traffic controllers, like Toby, are already working 6 days a  week. I am not happy to report that. Pushing them to the limits of  physical exhaustion isn't in the best interest of safety when it comes  to our aircraft, but because of staffing shortages, that is what they  are faced with, working 6 days a week. The shutdown is making staff  shortages in the air traffic control facilities across the United  States even worse.   The shutdown has closed down the FAA academy where new air traffic  controllers are trained and has stopped training in each facility to  implement new procedures and new equipment.   Toby's father and grandfather, incidentally, served in the U.S.  military, as he did. This picture depicts his great son and Toby's  granddaughter. I wanted to bring another point home. Toby's son is  deploying overseas this month. Toby and his wife will be looking after  their 2\1/2\-year-old granddaughter during the 10-month deployment.  Toby's lack of a paycheck since December 31 of last year adds stress to  an already hectic life.   Toby says:         Veterans are very proud of our heritage and what we have       done for the country. And those of us who continue to serve       the Federal Government as Federal employees continue that       pride throughout their careers.    Toby says:         We are hardworking, proud American employees doing a job       for the American public that is essential as an air traffic       controller. It's not acceptable as a veteran, as a federal       employee, as an air traffic controller to use my profession       and my livelihood as a political football.    Toby doesn't stand alone as a veteran working for the Federal  Government. Veterans are some of the hardest hit Federal employees of  the Trump shutdown. Today as many as 250,000 Federal workers and  Federal contractors are going without pay during the shutdown.  According to the Office of Personnel Management, as of the end of  fiscal year 2016, veterans represented 31 percent of the Federal  workforce. This is more than a 5-percent increase since 2009, when  President Obama encouraged veterans to apply for employment with the  Federal Government to boost the hiring of men and women who served our  country in uniform.   In Illinois, we have 50,000 Federal workers, and almost 28 percent of  them are veterans. More than one-quarter of all veterans working in the  Federal Government also have a Department of Veterans Affairs  disability rating.   For example, if SNAP, the food stamp program, runs out, 38 million  Americans could lose their food stamp benefits. That includes veterans  living in households that participate in SNAP. You don't think about  that very often, do you? Do you mean there are veterans on food stamps?  The figure has averaged about 1.4 million veterans a year between 2015  and 2017, according to the Census Bureau. Illinois is home to nearly  50,000 veterans who are beneficiaries of food stamps and HUD rental  assistance programs on an annual basis as well. So the very programs  that are going to be hampered, slowed down, and stopped because of the  Trump shutdown affect veterans across my State of Illinois and across  the Nation. About 1,150 contracts under the project-based rental  assistance program have lapsed, with hundreds more scheduled to expire  because of this shutdown. People are suffering around the country.   Federal workers are suffering. Their workers are suffering and  veterans are suffering because of this Trump shutdown. More than  380,000 Federal workers have been furloughed; 450,000 or more are being  forced to work without pay. These are hard-working Americans like the  TSA officers I met last week at O'Hare and met just a few days ago when  I flew to St. Louis Lambert Airport. They go to work every single day,  and their job is to make sure that dangerous people don't get on the  airplanes with you, your children, and your family. They can't afford  to have their paychecks held hostage by a manufactured crisis.   These families of Federal workers have bills to pay. A worker at the  Environmental Protection Agency, Cynthia Colquitt, is going without a  paycheck after serving 26 years as a Federal employee. How hard is it?  She is a single mom, and she says, quite honestly: I get by paycheck to  paycheck. She has never missed a mortgage payment; she is very serious  about those things. But now she is worried the shutdown will impact her  credit rating if she doesn't have a paycheck to pay her bills on time.   Shutdowns not only hurt our Federal workers, but the impact is also  felt by small businesses around the country that rely on the business  of Federal workers and the government. This shutdown is hurting our  economy and only adding to economic uncertainty. Remember what happened  in December? If you happen to have a retirement account with  investments in stocks, you noticed that December was a pretty horrible  month. There was an 8.7-percent drop in the stock market in December-- the worst December for the stock market since 1931, during the Great  Depression.   The CEO of JPMorgan Chase is now warning that if this shutdown lasts  another several weeks, it could reduce our Nation's quarterly growth to  zero. The victims of the shutdown will not be the Federal employees; it  will affect the entire economy because the input into the economy--the  things they buy and pay for--will be diminished.   Just why are we in this mess? Well, as the President said several  weeks ago on camera in the Oval Office, it is his shutdown and he is  very proud of it. He said that he was going to hold the hard-earned  paychecks of Americans hostage in an attempt to fulfill his campaign  promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States, a  concrete wall, as he described it, ``from sea to shining sea,'' which,  incidentally, he promised would be paid for by the Mexicans.   Let me say that again. All of the pain of this shutdown is caused  because the President made a campaign promise to build this almighty  wall. Well, we know something about walls. They don't work very well.  We know it  [[Page S260]]  might have been a great response several hundred years ago to build a  wall--not so much today. There are better ways to make America safe,  other than building a wall. Yet the President said: It is my wall or a  shutdown.   If we have a debate about border security, I want to be a part of it,  but we shouldn't do it while holding the Government of the United  States hostage. Every day of the government shutdown is another day  that President Trump is harming innocent Americans, preventing hundreds  of thousands of Americans from getting their paychecks and millions  more from getting access to vital Federal services.   We should reopen this government and we ought to do it this afternoon  and we can. One phone call from the President to Senator Mitch  McConnell, Republican leader of the Senate, is all it takes. Nancy  Pelosi, the new Speaker of the House, has already passed the spending  bills to open the government. She did it last week. She sent them over  here. They are sitting at the desk up here. We are not touching them  because Senator McConnell said: I am not going to solve this problem  until the President gives me permission. A little reminder to my  colleague Senator McConnell, under the Constitution, we are a separate  branch of government. We don't wait for a permission slip from the  President of the United States to do the job we were elected to do.   Today we had a vote earlier, and I looked at the other side of the  aisle and talked to a number of my Republican colleagues. I wasn't a  bit surprised to find so many of them fed up with this government  shutdown. They want it to end today, and so do I. Then we can sit down  and negotiate border security and do it the right way, not with a gun  at our head--I should say, a gun to the head of 800,000 Federal  employees. Let's reopen the government and then continue to negotiate.  House Democrats have given us the bills we need to do that. Now it is  up to Senator McConnell. Will he come forward through that door onto  the floor, call these bills, and end this shutdown before 5 p.m. today?   He could. He has the power to do it. He can pass the spending bills.  He warns us that President Trump may not sign these bills. Well,  Senator McConnell has been around the Senate for decades. He has been  around so long that I am sure he is familiar with our Constitution. Do  you know what? If the President vetoed these spending bills, we have  the constitutional authority and opportunity to override his veto--to  come up with 67 votes in the Senate, two-thirds in the House to  override any Presidential veto. I think the votes are there, and I  think that is the reason Senator McConnell is afraid to call the bills.   It is time for the Senate to act. Let's not wait for a permission  slip from President Trump. Let's do what we were elected to do. Let's  spare Toby Hauck and 800,000 Federal employees, including many  veterans, the hardships their families are facing.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, Aurora, IL, is blessed with a long history  of visionary leadership. The first public school district in my State  was founded in Aurora in 1851. Aurora was a center of abolitionist  activism before the Civil War.   In 1881, Aurora, of Chicago's northwest suburbs, became one of the  first cities in America to line its streets with electric lights, and  people began to call it a City of Lights--Paris on the Plains.   Sadly, last month, 2 days after Christmas, one of Aurora's brightest  lights was extinguished. Former Aurora mayor Tom Weisner died after a  long, brave, and public struggle with cancer. He was 69 years old.   Tom Weisner spent his earliest years in nearby Batavia, IL. He came  to Aurora in the 1960s to attend Marmion Military Academy. It was  during his time at Marmion that Tom met his future wife, Marilyn Hogan,  who was then a student at Marmion's ``sister school,'' Aurora Madonna  High School.   What a great pair. As a young couple in the 1980s, Tom and Marilyn  served together in the Peace Corps, helping rainforest dwellers in the  highlands of Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands. They were married for  46 years.   After finishing their Peace Corps service in 1986, Tom and Marilyn  returned to Aurora, and Tom was hired by the city's then-mayor, David  Pierce, to be Aurora's director of emergency services. Over the next 18  years, he headed a number of city agencies, including the departments  of motor vehicles, public property, and community services and  organizational development.   ``It was in his three terms as Aurora's mayor, from 2005 to 2016,  that Tom Weisner left his greatest mark. His keen understanding of  organizational efficiency, his commitment to public service, and his  passion for children, for a vibrant, sustainable economy, for the arts  and environment, and many other concerns helped to make Aurora a better  place to live, own a business, and raise a family.   There is one statistic that says a lot about the kind of leader Tom  Weisner was: In his 11 years as mayor, Aurora rehabilitated 11 bridges.  At a time when government at all levels is struggling and often failing  to maintain basic public infrastructure, Aurora repaired 11 bridges in  11 years. The strengthened bridges helped spur a rebirth of Aurora's  downtown.   The Fox River is one of Aurora's greatest economic and cultural  assets. Mayor Weisner authorized the city's first long-term plan for  the river. He oversaw the removal of a dam on the Fox River, which  opened up space for bike paths and new commercial ventures, and he  helped organize a regional coalition of communities to improve the  southern portion of the Fox River.   Tom Weisner championed new conservation and sustainability policies  that made Aurora a greener city. At the same time, he supported changes  that made it easier and faster to obtain city building and other  permits.   He oversaw the construction of a new police headquarters, with new  tools and more resources, and crime in Aurora decreased.   Children were a special concern of Mayor Weisner. Under his  leadership, Aurora created a new program called SPARK to help children  from birth to age 5 to prepare for kindergarten. SPARK stands for  ``Strong, Prepared, and Ready for Kindergarten.'' It is a collaboration  involving Aurora's public schools and public library, the local United  Way, and other groups. Nearly 5,500 children and their families have  benefited from its services.   Next year, a new Paramount School of Performing Arts will open and  offer young people a chance to study under some of the best teaching  artists and professionals in the country. Tom helped raise money to  make this happen.  [[Page S267]]    The DuPage Mayors and Managers Conference honored Tom in 2015 as its  Governmental Leader of the Year. The American Public Works Association  awarded him its Exemplary Service Award in 2017, the year after Tom  retired.   Tom Weisner's public achievements are even more remarkable, given the  private pain that he and Marilyn endured during his years as mayor. In  2006, they lost the younger of their two sons, Thaddeus, to  complications of cerebral palsy. The following year, Tom was first  diagnosed with colon cancer. He continued to serve the people of Aurora  through two surgeries and long bouts of treatment. When his cancer  became public, he used his own health challenges as a public service  reminder, urging people to get colonoscopies and early treatment.   In 2013, Aurora welcomed RiverEdge Park, a tremendous new waterfront  open space and concert venue. Years earlier, when the Great Recession  threatened to derail the project, Mayor Weisner helped ensure that it  continued. In 2016, the Aurora city council voted unanimously to rename  the park in Tom Weisner's honor. It is a fitting tribute to a leader  who loved few things more than enjoying music in his city's parks,  dressed in a brightly printed Tommy Bahama shirt and sandals.   Loretta and I offer our condolences to Tom's wife Marilyn, their son  Anthony, their two granddaughters, and to Tom's many friends.   He ran the race, he fought the good fight. Now he is gone, but the  light that Mayor Tom Weisner helped to bring to Aurora will continue to  shine for a long while.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I want to take a moment to thank a leader  who has worked for nearly 60 years to create a strong economy built on  pride, progressive values, and shared prosperity for all Americans.   Ronald Powell is the legendary president of Local 881 of the United  Food and Commercial Workers International Union. He is also a vice  president on the UFCW International Union and a vice president of the  Illinois State AFL-CIO. He is retiring this month after an astonishing  58 years as a proud union member and leader.   You may not be familiar with the initials UFCW, but you almost surely  benefit from the good work of its members. The men and women of the  UFCW include grocery store workers and bakery clerks, hospital and  nursing home employees--even barbers and beauty shop employees.   When Ron Powell joined the United Retail Workers union, a forerunner  to Local 881, in 1961, the union had fewer than 5,000 members. Fifty- eight years later, UFCW Local 881 represents more than 34,000 working  men and women in Illinois, northwest Indiana, and parts of Missouri and  Kentucky. The growth of Local 881 in an age when the labor movement is  under relentless attack and many unions are losing members is a  testament to Ron Powell's leadership and his commitment to dignity and  fairness for working people.   Ron Powell became president of UFCW Local 881 in 1983, just 2 years  after the local was chartered. Strength, vision, and compassion are the  hallmarks of his service. Illinois' working families and our State's  economy have both benefited from his progressive and innovative  leadership.   In addition, under Ron Powell's leadership, Local 881 Ron has raised  hundreds of thousands of dollars for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society,  with the hope to find a cure. It has also raised funds for the Jackson  Park Hospital in Chicago and for the Little City Foundation, which  helps Chicago-area children with developmental disabilities.   My old friend, Senator Paul Wellstone, liked to sum up his definition  of good economic policy by saying, ``We all do better when we all do  better.''   Ron Powell believes in that same, proven plan for economic growth and  justice. Working families in my, State of Illinois and far beyond are  better off because of his decades of service on their behalf. I am  honored to join those families in honoring Ron Powell on his  distinguished career, and as a former member of UFCW's early unions, I  wish him the very best as he begins the next chapter in his remarkable  life.                            ____________________
