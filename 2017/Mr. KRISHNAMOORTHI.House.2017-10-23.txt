 Mr. Speaker, recent media reports have suggested  that the House will consider a plan to cap employees' 401(k)  contributions as part of tax reform. I urge all my colleagues in the  strongest possible terms to reject this proposal. This cap on 401(k)  contributions would present a crippling and unnecessary burden on  working families across the country by making it harder for everyday  Americans to save for retirement.   There is already growing bipartisan opposition to this proposal as  President Trump tweeted against it this morning, and in September, the  majority leader said that this plan would punish people when they are  actually saving for their own retirement.   I agree with the majority leader. Working families already face  enormous challenges in saving for retirement. This proposal would  create another, and I urge all of my colleagues to strongly oppose it.                            ____________________
