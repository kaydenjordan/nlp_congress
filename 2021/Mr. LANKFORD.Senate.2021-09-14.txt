 Mr. President, last week, President Biden announced  that he had lost patience with the American people and that he was  demanding people get a vaccination.   Now, I have had the vaccine. I am grateful for the vaccine. But it is  an entirely different issue for the President of the United States to  wag his finger at the American people and to say: I know what you have  chosen, but I choose something different, and you are going to follow  me.   To literally instruct every employer with 100 employees or more,  every Federal contractor, every Federal employee to bend to the will of  the President and take this injection, that is a very different thing.   There are over 39 million Americans right now, that we know of, that  have already had COVID-19, have survived it, and have natural immunity.  The President's demand for a vaccine ignored those almost 40 million  Americans that already have natural immunity. His demand was: I know  you have natural immunity. I want you to get this vaccine as well.   It ignores cancer survivors who are very, very careful about what  goes into their system. It ignores people with religious objections,  and there are millions who have religious objections. It ignores  individuals who just don't want to do it because they are an American  and they don't have to and they do not like to have a Federal  Government instructing them what they are going to actually put in  their body.   Now, ironically, this was a random selection of companies that have  100 employees and up, so I assume that if you have 99 employees, you  are all fine, but if you have 100 employees, it is totally different.  There seems to be no accounting for where your employees work. Are your  employees all tightly packed, all 100 in one small room, or are your  employees all working outside? Do you have 100 employees, but they are  in 19 different locations?   There seems to be no accommodation for any of those. It is just the  President saying: I have lost patience. You need to go get the vaccine  immediately.   So, by Thanksgiving, he is planning on laying this vaccine mandate  down on the country. There are multiple problems there, as I have  already outlined: the 40 million people who have already survived COVID  and don't want to do the vaccine, the individuals in different medical  treatments, the individuals with different other religious issues that  they have.   But it is also an issue of trying to have a mandate come down from  the Federal Government with an Executive order. That is not how our  system works. The President of the United States does not have the  ability to be able to just demand behavior from the American people.  That is not their role.   It has been interesting to me. I have had several people who have  reached out to me and said: I found out that the President's order  exempts Congress. So how come you get an exemption and I don't?   I quickly responded back to them: Because we are a coequal branch of  government, and the President is trying to find everybody under his  purview to be able to do this. But the judicial branch and the  legislative branch aren't under his purview. Neither should be the  American people because the American people do not work for the  President of the United States. And companies of 100 people or more,  their chief executive, their leadership does not work for the President  of the United States.   So now what? There are lawsuits that are pending, but those lawsuits  can't move forward until the actual paperwork comes out from the White  House. When the actual paperwork comes out in the next couple of weeks,  we assume--we have not been told--then they will have what is called  standing in the courts, and litigation from across the country will be  able to speak into and Federal judges across the country will be able  to move on an injunction on this out-of-control mandate and to be able  to say they cannot just compel people to be able to go take a shot  because the President wants them to get it.   So that will be the first big step. There will be legislative  challenges that will come through this body. They are slower, so the  Federal courts are the fastest response to this. But there will be  multiple other groups that will push back on this, myself included.   Listen, why would we not respect those individuals who have already  had COVID-19? According to an article that is in the Wall Street  Journal just today, there was a study out of Israel that shows that the  immunity from natural immunity is 27 times more effective than the  shot--27 times, according to the study that has just recently come out.   To ignore that and to say that is not enough is absurd--or to compel  Americans, whether they have had COVID or not, to be able to have a  behavior just because the President has ``lost patience'' is not who we  are as Americans. It is not constitutional. It will not stand in the  courts and should not stand. We should push back on this.                            ____________________     Mr. President, you are very aware because in the  committee that we both sit on, we have worked through a process of  trying to form an answer to a problem that is coming at us again in 2  weeks.   Two weeks from now, we will hit the end of the fiscal year. At the  end of the fiscal year, according to the Budget Act of 1974, we should  have already passed 12 appropriations bills out of this body, 12  appropriations bills out of the House, have conferenced those two  bills, sent it to the White House for a signature. That is the  instructions that should be done by the end of the fiscal year.   The problem with that is the Senate has not passed a single one of  those appropriations bills even out of committee--not one. So our  government is not funded 2 weeks from now, which means the countdown  clock will begin again toward when we are headed to another government  shutdown, and the conversation will be: Are we going to have another  government shutdown? Are we going to be open? What is going to happen  to Federal workers?   Agencies across Washington, DC, and across the country will shortly  get instructions for here is what to do in case of a shutdown in your  Agency. Here is who, of employees, would be nonessential, what needs to  happen to them; essential, what needs to happen to them.   And the chaos will begin in all these Agencies because 2 weeks from  now we are headed toward the end of the fiscal year and not a single  appropriations bill, of the 12, has been taken up in committee. Not one  of them is even scheduled even to be debated on the floor of the  Senate. We will not have appropriations bills done 2 weeks from now. It  is not going to happen.   So here are the alternatives: There will be what is called a short- term continuing resolution of some length or we will have a shutdown 2  weeks from now.   For the past 3 years, Senator Maggie Hassan and I have proposed a  very straightforward solution to end the threat of government  shutdowns. Our straightforward proposal to stop government shutdowns is  a simple way to be able to solve this issue. If we get to the end of  the fiscal year, September 30, midnight, and we have not finished the  work that needs to be done on those 12 appropriations bills,  automatically a continuing resolution will kick in to prevent a  government shutdown. But starting the very next day, October 1, the  Senate and the House have mandatory quorum calls every single day until  we finish the 12 appropriations bills. We stay here to be able to  finish our work. But the work has to be done.   Why is that important? Because Federal Agencies shouldn't constantly  be worried about another government shutdown, and the American people  should be able to interact with their own government. Now, all of us  know the government actually doesn't shut down, but it moves into  shutdown mode. Some people have to show up for work; some people do  not. But everyone is paid. Some people can get access to a permit when  they contact their  [[Page S6508]]  Federal Agency; some people cannot. Some people can get licensing; some  people cannot. Some people can work through the process with the Corps  of Engineers; some people cannot.   And this chaos for the American people and for people who work for  the Federal workforce happens all over the country simply because  Congress did not get its job done.   Well, the solution is simple. Hold the American people and the  Federal workers harmless and push Members of Congress to actually  finish the work. This is not a partisan solution. It is just a  solution. That is why Republicans and Democrats alike have agreed to  the simple solution that Maggie Hassan and I have come to, to be able  to end government shutdowns and to say let's continue the conversation  that needs to be done, but let's not have yet another shutdown.   This body knows, in the past 40 years, we have had 21 government  shutdowns--21. The last one needs to be our last, but I don't know if  it will be because 2 weeks from now we are headed to the end of the  year, and there is no solution on the table for how to avoid a  government shutdown again.   Senator Hassan and I and multiple others again filed our bill today  and said: We know how to stop government shutdowns. Keep us at work.  Hold the American people harmless, and let's get the task done.   Honestly, I have had people say: That is such a creative solution,  and it is such a simple process to get done. I have smiled at them and  said: Actually, it is not all that creative. It is the same thing that  my mom did when my brother and I were growing up at the house. When my  brother and I were in an argument, she would put the two of us in our  room and would say: You guys work it out. When you work it out, then  you can come out of the room.   It is really no different than that to say Members of Congress should  stay at the task until we solve the budget work and we should not leave  with the budget work undone and leave the American people experiencing  another government shutdown.   Let's not have shutdown 22. Let's end government shutdowns, and let's  get our actual budget work done, on time, as is expected by the  American people.   With that, I yield the floor.                            ____________________
