 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2  minutes.    Mr. President, I rise in support of Shalanda Young's  nomination to be Director of the Office of Management and Budget.   Ms. Young has done an exemplary job serving as OMB's Acting Director  for the past year. She is a dedicated public servant and a proven  leader.   She has played a key role in the administration's efforts to help the  Nation recover from the pandemic. She has worked closely with Congress  to pass the historic bipartisan infrastructure package, and she is  truly committed to making the Federal Government work better for the  American people.   I have absolutely no doubt that Ms. Young is the right choice to lead  the OMB going forward. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to  confirm Shalanda Young to be the Director of OMB.  [[Page S1171]]         Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
