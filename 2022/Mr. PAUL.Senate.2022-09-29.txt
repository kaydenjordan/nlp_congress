 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a bill that would  lift a mandate in the law dating back to the Great Depression. This  mandate is that drugs have to be tested on animals before clinical  trials in humans.   This law was created back in the thirties--but I think makes no sense  today--when the only methods we had back then were animal trials or  human trials. But as the cofounder of a leading bioconvergence startup  wrote in ``Forbes'' last December:         [T]his legislation was passed 20 years before the first       modern blood tests, 40 years before [the] modern computers       and 60 years before the human genome was mapped. Now, we have       all these tools and so many more to evaluate and ensure the       safety of cosmetics and drug candidates before they reach       human trials.    The problem is, the law never caught up to the science. The law  perversely requires drug developers to test on animals, which often  means killing them after the test is over, even when nonanimal methods  would work better. Passing this bill will put a stop to the needless  suffering and death of millions of animals in labs across the country.   An emeritus neurology professor at Mayo Clinic, David Wiebers, wrote  earlier this month in the Kansas City Star that the--         [D]ifferences in genetics and physiology among species can       change the way a drug is metabolized in the body. As a       result, the predictive value of using animals for toxicity       testing is far from optimal. The intent of the 1938       requirement for animal models was to keep toxic drugs from       harming patients.    A noble quest.         Yet, statistics show that these animal tests are flawed and       misclassify many toxic compounds as safe.    This partly explains why over 90 percent of drugs found to be safe in  animal testing end up failing in human clinical trials. But animal  tests can be more than twice as expensive--sometimes up to 30 times  more expensive--as nonanimal alternatives. This is despite the fact  that it takes over a decade to bring a new drug to market and costs  about a billion dollars.   You would think that if you are making that kind of investment, you  would be getting something for your money. But not when the government  gets in the way of progress.   It is often said that the definition of insanity is doing the same  thing over and over again and expecting a different result. We have  mandated animal testing for the last 84 years, and it meant slower  approval for promising drugs and cures.   The time has come for the law to finally catch up with the science. I  am glad the Senate has acted, and I hope the House of Representatives  will now move quickly to pass this measure into law.   This law will allow the option of not doing animal testing. It is not  that it will forbid and prevent any animal testing; it simply will  allow the option of bringing drugs to market without sacrificing  animals if we don't need to.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the  immediate consideration of S. 5002, which is at the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read a  third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize Todd  Case Trucking of Louisa, KY, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.   Todd Case, owner of Todd Case Trucking, is the classic definition of  a self-made man. Though he now owns a fleet of around 30 trucks, in  addition to other business ventures, his trucking business bares his  own name in reflection of how the company began: a time when Todd Case  served as his own boss and was the company's sole employee. He got his  start in the trucking business earlier than most when he bought his  first truck at 17. That was back in the early 1980s when, like many men  in the region, Mr. Case was working for the owner of a coal mine. Mr.  Case had already saved up several hundred dollars from his work cutting  weeds when he overheard the owner of the mine talk about his plans to  sell the truck he had been using to haul coal. When Mr. Case first  approached his employer about buying the truck, the owner of the mine  said no, insisting that Mr. Case instead attend college. With great  ingenuity Mr. Case replied that buying the truck would allow him to  attend college, as it would give him a means to not only pay for his  tuition but give him some income to subside on while in school. Won  over by his entrepreneurial argument, the owner agreed to sell his  truck to Mr. Case and accepted his down payment of $1,800.   Shortly thereafter, Mr. Case found himself attending the University  of Kentucky, driving the rig on Tuesday and Thursday nights while he  pursued his degree in accounting and finance. Throughout his college  career, Mr. Case was no spendthrift, saving what money he could from  his trucking work while putting himself through college. By his  sophomore year, Mr. Case had saved enough money to convince a local  bank to lend him the funds he needed to buy a second truck. This  acquisition which took place during his sophomore year proved to be the  first step on a long and industrious path of growth in his business.   Today, Mr. Case's fleet of trucks services Kentucky, West Virginia,  and Virginia, bringing much-needed goods to the tri-State area.  Moreover, Todd Case Trucking plays a vital role in the local economy as  Kentucky, once famous for its burgeoning coal industry, now looks  towards other economic opportunities to employ the citizens of the  Commonwealth. Mr. Case, originally hailing from Pikeville, understands  the need to provide Kentuckians with more diverse work opportunities,  and that is why his Louisa-based business employs all its drivers  exclusively from the Bluegrass State.   Though Mr. Case has since expanded his business portfolio by owning  several other businesses in addition to his venture in the trucking  industry, he maintains a watchful eye over Todd Case Trucking. Always  keeping his community in mind, Todd Case Trucking partners with the  local chapter of Masons to host an annual event called ``Fishing For  Kids.'' This fishing competition welcomes children of all ages and  provides close to 300 toys to all participants, many of those toys  being bicycles and fishing rods. As an active member of the local  chapter of the Masons, Mr. Case also lends a generous hand to all the  local high school football and baseball teams when they are in need of  additional funding. Moreover, Mr. Case currently sits on the board of  trustees of University of Kentucky, and he works to ensure all students  have the same bountiful opportunities that his alma mater provided him.   Todd Case Trucking bares a similar history to many other businesses  in Kentucky and the Appalachia region; when the bounty provided by coal  came and went, this business grew out of the remains and blossomed into  a successful venture and fountain of opportunity for the local  community. Mr. Case has long had a determined nature and knack for  ingenuity, which is why he first became an entrepreneur as a high  school student. In the decades since, Mr. Case has grown into a  successful businessman and a great steward of his community.  Congratulations to Todd Case and the entire team at Todd Case Trucking.  I look forward to seeing your continued growth and success in  Kentucky.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following  interns in my office be granted floor privileges until December 16,  2022: Austin Gatesman, E.J.
