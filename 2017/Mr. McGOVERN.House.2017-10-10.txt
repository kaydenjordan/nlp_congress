 Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues tonight in calling  the attention of Congress to the horrific ethnic cleansing against the  Rohingya people that is underway in Burma.   On August 25th of this year, an illegal armed militant group known as  the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army attacked police outposts in Rakhine  state, Burma, killing twelve people. I condemn this attack in the  strongest possible terms.   Forty-five years ago, Pope Paul VI said ``If you want peace, work for  justice.'' Especially in today's world, I do not believe that armed  insurgency is the best path to justice, nor to peace.   But let me be clear: the Burmese government's response to the August  25th attack over the last several weeks has been so disproportionate  that one is at a loss to describe it.   The military has carried out a massive scorched earth campaign in  which hundreds of Rohingya villages and tens of thousands of homes have  been burned and destroyed. There are many highly credible reports of  people, including children, being shot in the back as they ran, and of  rapes, torture and ill-treatment.   As many as half a million Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh and at  least another 27,000 are displaced within Burma.   That is on top of the tens of thousands of Rohingya who fled after a  previous armed militant attack a year ago. Most of the Rohingya  population of Rakhine has now been forced out of the state. 120,000 of  those who remain live in IDP camps.   Stunningly disproportionate? Unimaginably, brutally, barbarically  disproportionate? Flagrantly, in-your-face, try-to-stop-me  disproportionate? I am left without words.   Do I regret the killing of 12 policemen on August 25th? Absolutely.  Do more than half a million people deserve to be punished for it?  Absolutely not.   And please do not talk to me about a ``growing terrorist threat'' in  Burma.   The Rohingya in Burma are stateless and subject to the most profound  discrimination. They are poverty-stricken, denied access to education  and work, and their movements within the country are restricted--and  all of this was true before the militant attacks.   The Burmese government has allowed the conditions for radicalization  and extremism to  [[Page H7916]]  fester within their country. The current military campaign is only  making things worse.   What should we be doing?   First, all available leverage should be brought to bear on the  Burmese military to end its violent campaign against the Rohingya  people. Its actions to date are entirely removed from any concept of  rule of law and make a mockery of the government's obligation to  protect its people.   Second, the government must ensure full and unfettered humanitarian  access to Rakhine state. Given the dimensions of the crisis, this means  letting in experienced aid organizations in addition to the Red Cross.   It also means ending the threats, allegations and misinformation  against humanitarian staff that have sparked fear among humanitarian  workers, especially national staff, and contributed to an environment  in which targeted attacks against humanitarian staff have taken place.  Enough already.   Third, the Burmese government must grant access to the fact-finding  mission authorized by the UN Human Rights Council last March, after  last ``clearance operation'' the military conducted from October 2016  to February of this year. Now more than ever, we need an objective  international presence on the ground.   Fourth, a roadmap to ending this crisis already exists. It's found in  the Final Report of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State led by  former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan.   International actors, including this Congress, must do all we can to  make sure that the Burmese government implements the recommendations  included in that report--especially the ones that have to do with  ending statelessness and poverty. Otherwise, we should not be surprised  if the situation in Burma just gets worse and worse.   Finally, we need to be clear-eyed about the nature of the Burmese  government.   I have been among those in Congress who have welcomed the political  transition in Burma that began with the 2015 elections. But the events  of the last few weeks raise very serious questions about the extent to  which that transition is real.   As events have unfolded in Burma in recent weeks, a lot of criticism  has been focused on Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel Laureate and de facto  leader of the civilian government. Her defenders have responded that  the military still has a lot of power, and that she has to walk a very  fine line.   But if that is true, what kind of ``democratic'' government are we  talking about?   If the military is still in charge--if the civilian government is  powerless to stop ethnic cleansing--then we need to recognize that.   If not, then let's be clear about the requirements of moral  leadership. Standing by in silence--even worse, downplaying the  seriousness of what is happening to the Rohingya people because of  political convenience--is not the leadership we expect from Aung San  Suu Kyi.   Those who want to claim the mantle of human rights leader must defend  the human rights of all people.                            ____________________
