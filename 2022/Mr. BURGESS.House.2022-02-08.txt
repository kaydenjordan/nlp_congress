 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, as you have already heard, today's rule provides for  consideration of yet another continuing resolution 5 months into the  fiscal year and not a single appropriations bill has been signed into  law.   This time, the Rules Committee had less than 2 hours' notice before  considering the continuing resolution rule in the Rules Committee  yesterday leaving no time for Members who might want to offer an  amendment or might want to come to the committee to speak on this CR.                                time  1245    This is no secret. This has not been an easy year for the American  people; crisis after crisis, and this Democratic leadership in this  Congress has not really led on those issues. We are still facing a  crisis on our southern border. Mr. Speaker, 2 million migrants have  crossed without documentation since President Biden took the oath of  office. And in response, what did he do? Well, he halted construction  on the border wall, and he tried to eliminate the remain in Mexico  program except the courts wouldn't let him do that, so now they are  slow-walking the enforcement.   At the same time, Ukraine is facing down 130,000 Russian troops that  look poised to invade, and President Biden just recently used his  waiver authority to ease the sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a  direct link between Russia and Europe for oil and gas. If we had been  given time to consider this CR, we could have revoked this waiver  authority and reinstated sanctions on the Nord Stream 2.   Another problem exacerbated by this administration is their continued  push for vaccine mandates. We see it literally every day on the news.  Mandates do nothing but drive unnecessary opposition, and we need to  let people make an informed choice for themselves with their doctor.  Taxpayer dollars should not be spent on enforcing mandates.   Finally, it has been nearly impossible to get a response back from  the executive branch agency and the reason is, we have delegated our  spending authority. We have delegated our appropriations authority  basically to the Speaker's Office, and as a consequence, no Cabinet  Secretary feels obligated to answer a phone call from a Member of  Congress from either party.
