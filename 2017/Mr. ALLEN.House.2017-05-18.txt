 Mr. Speaker, this week is National Police Week. I rise  today to honor the brave men and women in blue who sacrifice their  safety every day to keep our families and communities safe.   Each day these Americans go to work willing to put their lives on the  line for the security of their fellow Americans.   We often hear the remarkable stories of our law enforcement officers.  These men and women work long hours and late shifts, often being called  into work and called away from their families. These are the people who  risk their lives to protect our very neighborhoods, schools,  communities, while asking nothing in return.   These professionals exhibit the greatest love of all, and that is to  offer their lives to protect another.   I pray for those who have lost their lives, like Sergeant Greg  Meagher, a 33-year veteran of the Richmond County Sheriff's Office who  lost his life earlier this year in the line of duty. We will never  forget his ultimate sacrifice.   Our safety depends on these amazing people, and I am proud to honor  them here today.                            ____________________
