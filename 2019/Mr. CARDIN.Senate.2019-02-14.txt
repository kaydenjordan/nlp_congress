 Mr. President, I would like to bring the Senate's  attention to the bipartisan Preserving Teacher Loan Forgiveness for  Military Spouses Act of 2018, which I am introducing today with  Senators Cornyn and Jones. This legislation eliminates a barrier for  teachers in military families to earn federal student loan forgiveness  for their years of public service.   The Department of Education's Teacher Loan Forgiveness program  rightfully incentivizes teachers to commit to students in our lowest  income school districts in exchange for up to $17,500 in Federal  student loan forgiveness. Teachers qualify for the Federal student loan  forgiveness once they have taught full-time for at least five  consecutive years at a low income school or educational service agency.  Teachers who are forced to move in the middle of the school year to  follow their spouse's relocation or reassignment to another  installation in the United States or abroad lose their accrued  eligibility for the program and must restart their five years of  service under current law.   Last Congress, a Maryland constituent brought to my attention the  barriers her daughter faced when seeking Federal student loan  forgiveness despite her commitment to public service. Her daughter, a  teacher married to a member of the military, was in the middle of her  fifth consecutive year teaching at one of Maryland's lower income  schools. As any military spouse knows, relocation or reassignment  orders can come at any time, upending the lives of the service member  and their family. Rather than being able to complete a fifth year of  teaching in a Maryland school, this family had to relocate with three  months left in the school year. Despite this family's double commitment  to service for our military and our schoolchildren, this military  spouse missed the opportunity to have a portion of her Federal student  loans forgiven. No military spouse  [[Page S1387]]  should be punished for following his or her spouse's relocation or  reassignment.   The legislation that Senators Cornyn, Jones and I have introduced is  a common sense proposal to allow military spouses to earn the benefits  that they have dutifully worked towards and continue to incentivize  individuals to teach our hardest to educate children. Our legislation  provides a waiver from the Department of Education's Teacher Loan  Forgiveness program's five consecutive years of service requirement for  qualified military spouses if their spouse is relocated during the  school year pursuant to military orders from the Armed Forces. This  waiver will allow individuals to remain eligible for the Teacher Loan  Forgiveness program should they resume teaching full-time at a  qualifying low-income school district within one year of their  relocation. In addition, this legislation requires the Department of  Education to provide a report to Congress every two years on the number  of military spouses who remained eligible for Teacher Loan Forgiveness  due to this legislation. In addition, it would allow military spouses  that follow their service member overseas to accrue periods of service  towards the Teacher Loan Forgiveness program if they teach in one of  the Department of Defense Education Activities operated schools.   I urge my colleagues to join in this effort to help families who are  wholly committed to public service by supporting the Preserving Teacher  Loan Forgiveness for Military Spouses Act. No family committed to  service of our country should lose out on earned benefits due to a  technicality.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to bring the Senate's  attention to the bipartisan Preserving Teacher Loan Forgiveness for  Military Spouses Act of 2018, which I am introducing today with  Senators Cornyn and Jones.
