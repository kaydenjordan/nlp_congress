 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and concur  in the Senate amendment to the bill (H.R. 1365) to make technical  corrections to the Guam World War II Loyalty Recognition Act.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the Senate amendment is as follows:   Senate amendment:         Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the       following:       SECTION 1. TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS TO GUAM WORLD WAR II LOYALTY                     RECOGNITION ACT.         Title XVII of division A of Public Law 114-328 is amended--        (1) in section 1703(e)--        (A) by striking ``equal to'' and inserting ``not to       exceed''; and        (B) by striking ``covered into the Treasury as       miscellaneous receipts'' and inserting ``used to reimburse       the applicable appropriations'';        (2) in section 1704(a) by striking ``, subject to the       availability of appropriations,'' and inserting ``from the       Claims Fund''; and        (3) by striking section 1707(a).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the measure under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, at the risk of sounding melodramatic, today is a very  historic day, particularly in the relationship between the United  States and the people of Guam; more specifically, the Chamorro people  of Guam, a generation, in particular, that endured the sufferings of  World War II.   Mr. Speaker, I was here about 8 months ago when I first brought H.R.  1365 to the floor of this House after securing unanimous consent in the  Committee on Natural Resources. And after bringing this measure to this  floor 8 months ago and also securing unanimous consent, H.R. 1365 made  its way to the Senate. And in going through the Senate, it was able to  also receive the necessary unanimous support and receive a very minor  change that brings us to the floor today.   H.R. 1365 technically is making what would appear to be a minor  change to language that was already enacted in the 2010 NDAA.                                time  1615    In my short time as a freshman Member of this House, I have learned  that there is no such thing as a simple technicality. I have learned  that the mere addition of a few words, or the subtraction of a few  words, can make all the difference between the gravity of the  [[Page H1543]]  hurdles that you need to overcome in order to be able to enact  legislation.   I have learned that the language contained in H.R. 1365, while  technical in nature, is incredibly significant with respect to what it  means for the Members of this House to consider.   In our process, Mr. Speaker, legislation that has certain language  triggers certain events. H.R. 1365 is intended to allow for money that  has been set aside to actually be paid out to the Chamorros, who  suffered under the brutality of Imperial Japan during World War II.   This was a process that was initiated over many decades and has  finally come to a place where we now just await the ability to cut the  checks. But it is in the ability to cut those checks that language  actually gets very, very complicated, and it causes certain things to  be reconsidered.   The language in H.R. 1365 would, in effect, create what we know as a  scoring here in this Congress, meaning that there may be an expenditure  that the body would need to consider. The actual funding source of H.R.  1365 was a set-aside of moneys that was already due to Guam and has  been set aside over the past several years, with the money accumulating  and being ready to be paid out to these war survivors.   The reason why the United States is assuming this obligation, Mr.  Speaker, is because, at the end of World War II, the United States  absolved Japan of their obligations in order to be able to move the  entire world forward after the conclusion of the war. In so doing, they  also just so happened to absolve them of their obligation to make whole  the war crimes that were endured by the Chamorro people who suffered  because they were inhabiting the United States territory of Guam at the  time. The people suffered beheadings, forced marches, rapes, and the  loss of their infants in their arms.   It has taken us now going on 76 years to finally come to this point.  I say that this is historic, Mr. Speaker, because it, in a large  respect, represents almost an original sin, in terms of the inability  for us to reconcile our territorial relationships in a manner that  really makes for plain and simple justice.   I am deeply moved, Mr. Speaker, to be able to handle these  proceedings today and to be able to see H.R. 1356 come before this  House once more because, as we all know, in this current political  environment, almost any hurdle that legislation faces is a hurdle too  much.   As we have gone through this process and have gotten to this point,  there were many times when I was deeply concerned about whether or not  something technical was going to actually be dead on arrival. But by  the grace of God, Mr. Speaker, the small territory of Guam has been  able to garner the unanimous support of this House, the unanimous  support of the Senate. We are here again today addressing a matter that  really triggers certain concerns but has gotten us to a point where we  are able to see that there are some things that are bigger than the  nuances of language, the semantics of procedure.   So it is with a deep sense of pride that I stand here, as a Member of  this House, nonvoting Delegate that I am, because I can stand here in  witness to the fact that, at some point in time, justice really does  find its way in the United States of America.   I urge my colleagues to please support this measure. We are this  close; we are just a hairline away. And in passing this House, this  measure will then go before the President for signature, and we can  finally make whole a generation that suffered because they were loyal  to America.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
