 Mr. President, seven centuries ago, a Chinese novelist  wrote:         The Empire long divided must unite; long united, must       divide. Thus, it has ever been.    These are the opening words from the Chinese classic novel ``Romance  of the Three Kingdoms.'' Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, and Xi Jinping have  drawn inspirations and quoted passages from this classic because the  enduring prominence in the Chinese imagination can be traced back for  centuries. They describe the long rhythm of Chinese history--a period  of civil war and chaos followed by a period of stability. Now, after a  century of perceived humiliation, the Chinese Communist Party believes  it is destined to be whole and powerful again.   That is what makes China's current ambition to ``unify,'' as they put  it,  [[Page S283]]  even more troubling. Just as Vladimir Putin seeks to use violence to  reconstitute what he considers the old Soviet empire, the Chinese  Communist Party has made it its mission to ``reunite'' all those it  considers Chinese, including those who have gained freedom and liberty,  like the people of Taiwan. The Taiwanese people want no part of  Beijing's communist vision, and they fully reject the idea that Beijing  should impose its will on its neighbors.   Some may think Beijing has been hiding and biding its time, but, in  fact, it has for decades been active and aggressive in expanding its  claims of sovereignty and territory. In the last 60 years, China almost  risked a nuclear conflict with the Soviet Union, fought a war with  Vietnam, and engaged in multiple bloody skirmishes with India as  recently as last month to assert their territorial claim. Today, it  continues to make egregious territorial claims in the South and East  China Sea, all in the name of expanding the reach of the Chinese  Communist Party.   Americans saw firsthand President Xi's disregard for our own  sovereignty over the past week, as a Chinese spy balloon violated U.S.  airspace uncontested for several days--just the latest in Beijing's  string of provocative actions.   To see his plans for Taiwan, look no further than Xi Jinping's brutal  repression of the people of Hong Kong. He continues to trample the  freedoms they long enjoyed and indeed were promised by the Chinese  Communist Party. We should have known that the idea of ``one country,  two systems'' was always incompatible with the rule of the Chinese  Communist Party.   Taiwan is the missing piece in President Xi's puzzle. Without Taiwan,  Xi Jinping, who wants to be remembered as one of the great emperors of  Chinese history, will have failed. And make no mistake, he cannot  accept a free Taiwan because Taiwan, situated 90 miles off the Chinese  coast, is living proof that freedom and democracy can thrive in a  Chinese-speaking nation. Taiwan is a powerful advertisement for liberty  to the 1.4 billion people who suffer under the communist police state.  For this reason more than any other, Xi Jinping wants what he views as  the ``Taiwan problem'' resolved on his terms.   He and his comrades have spent the last several decades pursuing the  fastest military buildup in history, achieving the world's largest navy  by sheer number of vessels and by far the largest fleet of advanced  ballistic missiles. The Chinese Air Force now flies fifth-generation  aircraft armed with air-to-air missiles that outrange our own. The  entire People's Liberation Army conducts advanced and realistic  training. Our own top cyber officer, GEN Paul Nakasone, says the  improvement in Chinese cyber capabilities is ``unlike anything [he has]  ever seen.''   All of the PLA's capabilities are aimed across the Taiwan Strait.  Just last week, someone leaked a private memo from Gen. Mike Minihan,  our air mobility chief, in which he urged troops to be ready for war in  2025. This is 2023; he urged that they be ready for war in 2025.   Despite all the hand-wringing, this is just the latest example of  senior civilian and military officials who are increasingly worried  about Chinese aggression over the next 4 years, during Xi Jinping's  third term. Even Secretary of State Blinken last year said Beijing  remains determined ``to pursue unification on a much faster timeline''  than previously expected.   There should be no doubt that the potential for Chinese invasion of  Taiwan is higher today than it has ever been. This raises the fair  question of whether protecting Taiwan is feasible. Can the small island  nation of 23 million souls really stand a chance against a nation of  1.4 billion? The answer is that Taiwan not only can stand a chance, it  must be able to defend itself successfully because what is at stake in  Taiwan is not just its own freedom and sovereignty but the stability of  the region, the stability of the world economy and our own American  economy and national security.   Standing tall against a powerful aggressor is no small task. We have  seen this in Ukraine. Over the past year, we have seen the sacrifices  of courageous Ukrainians who have taken the fight directly to the  Russians and continually won despite many dismissing that possibility,  including our own intelligence community. That very same heroic kind of  resistance and the very same help from friends and allies will be  required for Taiwan to preserve its freedom and democracy.   The conflict in Ukraine is closely related to what will happen in  Taiwan. Indeed, China openly supports the brutal Russian invasion. This  reflects Xi Jinping's own ambition to launch a similar assault on  Taiwan. He knows full well that if Putin can outlast the free world and  get away with it, with murder and war crimes in Ukraine, his own  chances of success against Taiwan will be stronger. U.S. support for a  win in Ukraine enhances our ability to deter Beijing in Taiwan.    Congress has led the Biden administration to help Ukraine in its  fight against Russia. Now, Congress should lead once again to help  Taiwan defend itself against communist China. In fact, for decades,  Congress has led the effort to preserve a free and democratic Taiwan.  But to do this work on the timeline and scale required, we need first  to understand the extraordinary ways in which Taiwan contributes to  American interests.   I recently stood here and made the case for why Americans should care  about supporting Ukraine. Today, I will pose a similar question: Why  should Americans care about Taiwan?   Well, they should. We should.   First, failure to defend Taiwan would forever damage our position in  the Indo-Pacific, calling into question our credibility and capability  to defend other allies and partners, such as Australia, Japan, the  Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand.   Since the end of World War II, our allies have relied on the United  States of America, underpinning more than seven decades of peace and  prosperity in the Indo-Pacific. America has also benefited greatly from  this peace and prosperity. Today, Japan is our fifth largest trading  partner, and South Korea is our sixth largest trading partner. A  failure to defend Taiwan would upend that stability, and our allies and  partners could abandon America if that happens.   Simply put, peace in the Pacific means jobs for Americans. War in the  Pacific, on the other hand, would put American economic freedom at  risk.   In addition, what happens in Taiwan will have consequences for  whether our allies decide to pursue new capabilities they have thus far  forsaken. With open access to the Pacific Ocean, Beijing would almost  certainly push Tokyo, Seoul, and others to seek to acquire nuclear  weapons or perhaps even to rebalance from the United States to China.  What this development would mean for the U.S. alliance network and  stability in the Indo-Pacific is unthinkable.   Our allies and partners also play a pivotal role in providing key  military basing in the Western Pacific. With U.S. bases in Japan, South  Korea, and now the Philippines, our national defense in the Pacific is  strong. Without those, our national defense would start on the shores  of Guam or Hawaii, rendering America much harder to defend, rendering  our homeland much harder to defend.   These allies want us in their countries. We are there because they  have allowed us and asked us to be in their countries, and they have  each spent billions of their own dollars to build military facilities  for our forces. America's web of alliances and partnerships is critical  to our success in competing with China in the long run.   With 60 percent of the world's population, the Indo-Pacific is  projected to be the largest contributor to global economic growth over  the next 30 years. If we lose these critical partners, we would also  cede a critical advantage in our effort to compete economically with  China, a nation with five times our population and an economy nearly  our size.   So that is the first reason.   The second reason: Taiwan is a linchpin of the global economy. A war  over Taiwan, launched by China, would immediately send the global  economy into a depression the likes of which we have not seen in a  century. Americans would lose access to key semiconductors that are in  our laptops, phones, cars, and countless electronic products that have  become the backbone of daily life.  [[Page S284]]    As our colleague Senator Dan Sullivan of Alaska said in a strong  December speech on Taiwan, the semiconductor shortage in 2021 already  cost Americans $240 billion and nearly 8 million cars--8 million cars  that we don't have because of this shortage. Taiwan also exports a  significant amount of advanced machine tools that underpin  manufacturing jobs here in America.   Chinese aggression against Taiwan would send shock waves through the  economy and upend daily life here in America. It would dwarf the  economic effects of Russia's war in Ukraine, and we need to do whatever  we can to prevent this aggression.   Thirdly, Chinese control of Taiwan's semiconductor industry would  leave American supply chains extremely vulnerable to the influence of  the Chinese Communist Party. Beijing wants to seize that lucrative  industry in order to gain a clear upper hand in the world economy. This  could cause massive economic pain for the United States. If Beijing  gains control of Taiwan's semiconductor industry, it could rewrite the  rules of the global economy. Beijing wants to dictate the terms of any  negotiations with the United States, costing Americans tens of millions  of jobs and stalling our economic growth.   To sum this all up, protecting Taiwan as a free and prosperous  democratic nation is absolutely vital to the prosperity and security of  our children and grandchildren. Taiwan should matter to every American.   Now, how do we ensure that a war over Taiwan never occurs--because  that should be our goal--given what we know about Beijing's intentions  and capabilities?   We should be vigilant about applying the lessons we have learned in  Ukraine. That requires recognizing the differences between Ukraine and  Taiwan.   The U.S. military began training Ukraine 8 years ago, following the  Russian invasion of Crimea and eastern Ukraine in 2014, but we have  done comparatively little to train the Taiwanese. With Taiwan, we are  playing catchup. We arm Ukraine through multiple land routes by rail  and vehicles. In wartime, quickly arming Taiwan by air and sea would  prove extremely challenging. Also, the People's Liberation Army in  China is not the Russian military. They are much more focused and  serious.   So there is simply no time to waste, Mr. President. We need to get  high-quality weapons into Taiwanese hands now, before the conflict  breaks out. As Senator Phil Gramm and I wrote last year in the Wall  Street Journal, we need to turn Taiwan into a porcupine so that Xi  Jinping wakes up every day and concludes that an invasion is not worth  the cost.   Well, why do you say a porcupine? Any wolf has the ability to kill a  gentle porcupine. Yet such an attack rarely occurs in nature. The  defense of the porcupine's quills, which can rip through the predator's  mouth and throat, is the deterrent that protects it from attack by the  wolves. That should be our approach for Taiwan's defense.   Last year, to begin work on this issue, Congress passed the Taiwan  Enhanced Resilience Act. Congress provided the Biden administration  with the ability to send $1 billion worth of U.S. weapons stocks to  Taiwan. We also authorized up to $10 billion in foreign military  financing with matching contribution by Taiwan. This brought to  fruition years of work by our colleagues Senator Menendez and Senator  Risch.   We authorized the creation of a joint stockpile, accelerated foreign  military sales reform, expanded U.S. military training, and established  the first-ever comprehensive oversight regime on U.S. national security  work with Taiwan.   Lest we forget, our friends the Taiwanese are accelerating their own  defense for the sixth straight year, with a 14-percent increase in  2022. Their weapons purchases increasingly align with how our military  experts envision a correct defense of the island, including with  Harpoon anti-ship cruise missiles, Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, and  secure communications systems. We should encourage this change in  Taiwan's focus.   As Gen. James Mattis once said, we need a willing partner in the  Biden administration to move at ``the speed of relevance''--``at the  speed of relevance.'' Last September, the Armed Services and Foreign  Relations Committees asked the administration some very basic  questions: Which weapons are most important in the Pacific? What  training does Taiwan need? What weapons is Taiwan ready to buy?   The Biden administration has yet to respond to these questions, even  though we know the State Department and Defense Department have  completed the analysis. In this case, silence will only make the  situation worse. We need answers.   I reiterate: Congress needs this information to perform our  constitutional duties effectively. So I am calling on the Biden  administration today to work with us to accelerate the transfer,  financing, and sale of a key set of military capabilities to Taiwan.  The President needs to use the authority that Congress provided to  transfer $1 billion in weapons to accelerate the expansion of our  training programs in Taiwan. Make no mistake, the President's actions  will have direct consequences for Taiwan's ability to defend itself and  for our ability to prevent a war in the Pacific.   Without these tools, China will continue to gain the upper hand in  the Taiwan Strait. We need to offset and deter the Chinese military  from taking actions in the first place. An influx of American weapons  will go a long way toward assuring that we stand with them against  Chinese aggression and encourage other nations to join us.   As Ronald Reagan said, ``peace does not exist of its own will. It  depends on us, on our courage to build it and guard it and pass it on  to future generations''--end of quote from Ronald Reagan, one of the  great advocates of peace through strength. That is how we will help  Taiwan preserve its freedom and democracy and how we can avoid war in  the Pacific.   At the same time, the Armed Services Committee will intensify its  focus on our own work, ensuring our military has every tool it needs to  deter and, if necessary, defeat the People's Liberation Army. We must  fix our munitions production problem and focus on the high-end weapons  that our troops need. We need to modernize and expand the Air Force and  the Navy while honing the Army and Marine Corps for their missions in  the Western Pacific.   We also have to explore new ideas for nuclear modernization to  respond to the unprecedented Chinese nuclear buildup, given that our  commanders now tell us the Chinese have more ground-based launchers for  nuclear weapons than we do. And we must continue our work to improve  the quality of life for all of our servicemembers and their families so  they can focus on the tasks at hand.   In conclusion, Mr. President, Congress has prioritized financial and  material support for Ukraine to help turn the tide in that war. The  security of Taiwan is no less important than the security of Ukraine.  The threat to global and economic security from communist China has the  potential to jeopardize the prosperity and safety of Americans here in  the United States. It is time for our actions to reflect the  significance of that threat.   I yield the floor.
