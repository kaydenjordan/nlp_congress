 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize October  as American Pharmacists Month.   As a pharmacist myself, I recognize pharmacists' contributions to our  healthcare system and our communities.   Pharmacists play a crucial role in our communities. Over 90 percent  of the U.S. population can access a pharmacy within a 5-mile radius of  their homes. For many, they are their main access to healthcare. Ninety  percent of COVID-19 vaccinations, 60 to 70 percent of flu vaccines, and  over 80 percent of overall vaccines in the United States are  administered in pharmacies.   It is no wonder that pharmacists are the most trusted and accessible  healthcare professionals in the Nation. I could talk for days about the  importance of pharmacists in the American  [[Page H5155]]  healthcare system, and I am proud of my own time as a pharmacist.   During this month of October, make sure to thank a pharmacist, as  they truly are the backbone of our healthcare system.                            ____________________
