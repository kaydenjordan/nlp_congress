 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 255, the Federal Disaster  Assistance Coordination Act, introduced by Representatives Gonzalez- Colon, Peters, and Plaskett.   This legislation amends the Disaster Recovery Reform Act to help  Federal agencies streamline and consolidate information collection and  Preliminary Damage Assessments following disasters.   After a major disaster, there is no time to wait for bureaucracy.  However, Federal recovery assistance following disasters is currently  hampered by inefficient information collection and assessments  conducted by multiple agencies.   This bill will remove information collection barriers that currently  impede disaster aid. It creates a working group to identify duplicative  assessments and propose their elimination.   Further, it would streamline Federal disaster recovery efforts by  concluding that a single agency is sufficient to conduct damage  assessments to account for the needs of disaster victims. The Federal  Government can and should be doing this work smarter.   Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the  same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for  time, and I am prepared to close. I inquire of my colleague if there  are any remaining speakers on his side.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, this bipartisan  bill passed the House on suspension in the 116th and 117th Congresses.  It will help disaster survivors by taking a step toward streamlining  the Federal Government's fragmented approach to disaster assistance.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 259. This bill, introduced by  Resident Commissioner Gonzalez-Colon and Delegate Plaskett would create  a new online system for tracking Federal disaster projects and  assistance.   People should know how and where their disaster funds are being spent  without wading through reams of governmental paperwork. This  legislation simplifies the data collection process for Federal disaster  recovery projects.   To increase transparency, the bill also creates a page on  USASpending.gov where everyone can track agency disaster recovery  activities and the amount of assistance expended by an agency on a  quarterly basis.   Federal agencies need to be accountable to the victims of disasters  and allow them peace of mind when they are at their most vulnerable.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides to join with me and  support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for  time, and I am prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, the House passed this bipartisan bill on suspension as  well in the past two Congresses. I look forward to passing this  commonsense transparency measure again today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support it, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 388, the Securities and  Exchange Commission Real Estate Leasing Authority Revocation Act.   This legislation, introduced by Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton of the  District of Columbia revokes the independent real estate leasing  authority of the SEC and directs the Government Accountability Office  to update its 2016 report on Federal entities with independent real  estate leasing authority.   While some Federal agencies have independent real estate leasing  authority and have used it responsibly, the SEC has a history of  egregious real estate practices.   Congress granted the SEC independent leasing authority in 1990, which  means the SEC does not need to use the General Services Administration  for its real estate needs like most other government agencies do.   In 2010, anticipating the agency would expand in response to the  Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the SEC  leased 900,000 square feet of space in the Constitution Center building  in Washington, D.C.   Then, a year later, in 2011, the SEC's Office of Inspector General  issued a report which found that the SEC Office of Administrative  Services conducted a flawed analysis to justify the need for this  leased space and potentially committed Anti-Deficiency Act violations.   SEC's Office of Inspector General found that OAS grossly  overestimated the amount of space needed at SEC headquarters for the  SEC's projected expansion and prepared a faulty Justification and  Approval to support eliminating competition.   Thankfully, Delegate Norton introduced identical legislation to  repeal this authority during the 117th Congress, and that bill, H.R.  1468, passed both the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure  and the House of Representatives with bipartisan support.  Unfortunately, H.R. 1468 was not considered by the Senate. Today, we  are trying one more time to approve this commonsense legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.                                time  1245     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2  minutes to the gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, it is time for Congress to  return the SEC's leasing authority to the GSA, the Federal Government's  civilian real estate arm. This legislation would do just that.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.  [[Page H300]]    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 346, the NOTAM Improvement Act  of 2023, as amended. This bill was introduced by the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Stauber) and the gentleman from California (Mr.  DeSaulnier).   On the morning of January 11, the U.S. airspace came to a standstill  when the FAA grounded all airline domestic departures for the first  time since September 11, 2001, due to an agency contractor mistakenly  causing an outage of the FAA's NOTAM system.   NOTAMs are a critical part of our aviation infrastructure as they  provide essential, real-time flight safety information--such as  potential hazards--to pilots, flight dispatchers, and other airspace  users.   Although the FAA worked to quickly solve the problem and lift the  subsequent domestic flight ground stop, the cascading effects of mass  delays and cancellations were seen for hours.   I fully support the FAA's actions to ensure the NOTAM outage would  not affect the safety of the national airspace system; however, our  constituents deserve better. They deserve to have both a safe and  reliable national airspace system.   The FAA has moved to put several operational and systematic  mitigations in place to try to prevent future NOTAM outages from  occurring. However, the recent NOTAM system outage shows a clear need  to reexamine and modernize the safety-critical systems and legacy  infrastructure that flight crews and airline passengers depend upon.   To help strengthen the integrity of the system, this bipartisan bill  directs the FAA to create a task force on NOTAM improvement to review  existing methods for the content and presentation of NOTAMs to pilots;  determine best practices to prioritize and disseminate critical flight  information to pilots in a way that optimizes review and retention; and  develop recommendations to ensure stability, resiliency, and  cybersecurity of the NOTAM system.   This task force will be comprised of key aviation stakeholders,  including airline pilots, air traffic controllers, air carriers, and  aviation safety and computer system experts, among others.   This bill is an important step in a series of efforts Congress and  the FAA will undergo to modernize the NOTAM system. Later this week,  the chair and I and other Members of this body will be briefed by the  FAA Acting Administrator on the status of the preliminary investigation  into the NOTAM outage, how the FAA is responding to the incident, and  issues that Congress should be considering to further strengthen the  NOTAM system.    Fortunately, we are due for an FAA reauthorization bill this year,  giving us an opportunity to build upon the 2018 law and further  implement any necessary improvements to safeguard the NAS from similar  system outages.   The task force created under this bill will play an important role in  the FAA's ongoing NOTAM modernization initiative to ensure pilots,  flight crews, and other airspace users receive NOTAMs that are timely,  relevant, and accurate.   There can be no compromises when it comes to safety in the national  airspace.   As demand for air travel begins to meet and even exceed prepandemic  levels, this bill will help the FAA and the U.S. aviation industry  implement best practices to improve the safety of the traveling public  and the U.S. aviation workforce.   Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to  do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. DeSaulnier).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Torres).    Mr. Speaker, as the ranking member of the  House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I believe we have to  do everything we can to ensure the U.S. remains the gold standard in  aviation safety. That is why I support H.R. 346, as amended, and I urge  my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
