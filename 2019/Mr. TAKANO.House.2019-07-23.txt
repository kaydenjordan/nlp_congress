 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2943) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to make  all fact sheets of the Department of Veterans Affairs in English and  Spanish, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2943         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Providing Benefits       Information in Spanish and Tagalog for Veterans and Families       Act''.       SEC. 2. FACT SHEETS.         (a) Languages.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall       make versions of all fact sheets of the Department of       Veterans Affairs in English, Spanish, and Tagalog.        (b) Website.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall       establish and maintain a publicly available website of the       Department of Veterans Affairs that contains links to all       fact sheets of the Veterans Benefits Administration, Veterans       Health Administration, and of the National Cemetery       Administration. The website shall be accessible by a clearly       labelled hyperlink on the homepage of the Department.        (c) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs       shall submit a report to Congress regarding fact sheets       described in subsection (a) and details of the Language       Access Plan of the Department of Veteran Affairs. The report       shall include the following:        (1) What the Secretary determines constitutes a fact sheet       of the Department for purposes of this Act.        (2) How such fact sheets are utilized and distributed other       than on and through the website of the Department.        (3) How such Language Access Plan is communicated to       veterans, family members of veterans, and caregivers.        (4) The roles and responsibilities of patient advocates in       the coordination of care for veterans with limited English       proficiency, family members of such veterans, and caregivers.  [[Page H7205]]         (5) Other demographic information that the Secretary       determines appropriate regarding veterans with limited       English proficiency.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 2943, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Mr. Cisneros' bill, H.R.  2943, as amended, which would direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs  to provide all VA fact sheets in English, Spanish, and Tagalog.   One of my chief priorities as chair of the Committee on Veterans'  Affairs is to remove barriers that stand between veterans and their  benefits. A language barrier should not prevent veterans from accessing  the benefits they earned, and the burden should not be placed on  veterans to request and wait for the VA to provide a translator.   Mandating that fact sheets be provided in Spanish and Tagalog will  break down a significant barrier that stands in between Latinx and  Filipino veterans and their VA benefits.   Mr. Cisneros' bill, H.R. 2943, as amended, mandates that all fact  sheets be available in English, Spanish, and Tagalog. Our veterans  answered the call to serve from places around the world, including the  Philippines and Puerto Rico, where English is not the predominant  language. There are communities across the U.S., including in my  district, where Spanish is commonly spoken and understood. This fix is  easy; it does not come at an increased cost; and it is the right thing  to do.   The Department of Veterans Affairs produces fact sheets that explain  many VA programs and benefits. The VA fact sheets provide key facts,  such as eligibility criteria, documents needed to help support claims,  and links to appropriate application forms. These fact sheets explain  the process for getting a VA-guaranteed home loan, applying for  disability compensation, using GI Bill benefits, and obtaining burial  benefits for veterans and their surviving family members.   Brochures and fact sheets explain VA healthcare benefits to veterans  and caregivers. These fact sheets also advise veterans on the  supporting documentation they need to help them apply for benefits so  they are correctly identified as eligible or their claims are  successfully adjudicated.   During the codel I led to Puerto Rico this past weekend, I met with  veterans who told me they are not receiving information on VA programs,  and when they do receive information, it is in English, not Spanish.  The one veteran who received a brochure on the MISSION Act in Spanish  said it was incomplete compared to the English materials.   This disparity should not exist. Veterans, regardless of the language  they speak or where they live, should be able to understand how to  access their benefits easily.   I ask my colleagues to help our veterans who have done so much to  serve our country and join me in supporting H.R. 2943, as amended.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Cisneros), my good friend and a member of the Veterans'  Affairs Committee who is also a veteran himself, the author of this  legislation.    Madam Speaker, I am also prepared to close, and I yield  myself the balance of my time to render my final comments.  [[Page H7206]]    Our veterans and their survivors deserve the best care possible. The  VA benefits application process can be confusing. Congress has taken  action to reduce confusion and ease the application process.   I remember when, only a few years ago, initial claims were taking  more than a year. Today, initial disability claims are being completed  in less than 160 days. This is, in part, due to streamlining the  application process and providing more information to veterans.   As I learned during the codel to Puerto Rico, in emergencies like  Hurricane Maria, veterans need to know how the VA can help them prepare  for the next storm. They need to know that they can get additional  supplies of medication. Veterans need to know where to go in an  emergency when communications are disrupted. They also need to know how  to apply for assistance and emergency benefits after a disaster like  Hurricane Maria because these disasters will happen again.   The VA fact sheet on natural disasters, which tells veterans and  their families which website to go to and where to call when their  benefits are interrupted due to natural disasters, is only available in  English. Yet, both the Philippines and Puerto Rico experience natural  disasters like hurricanes, typhoons, and earthquakes.   Mandating that VA fact sheets are made available in more than one  language is yet another example of ways we can eliminate barriers for  our veterans, streamline the application process, and help them get to  the right resources when there is an emergency. Providing fact sheets  in Tagalog and Spanish could even save lives.   Madam Speaker, I wholeheartedly support H.R. 2943, as amended, and,  again, I ask my colleagues to join me in support of this bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2942) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to carry  out the Women's Health Transition Training pilot program through at  least fiscal year 2020, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2942         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Helping Expand and Launch       Transitional Health for Women Veterans Act'' or ``HEALTH       Act''.       SEC. 2. ENCOURAGEMENT OF PARTICIPATION IN WOMEN'S HEALTH                     TRANSITION TRAINING PILOT PROGRAM.         (a) Duration.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall       carry out the Women's Health Transition Training pilot       program (in this section referred to as the ``pilot       program'') until at least September 30, 2020.        (b) Report.--Not later than September 30, 2020, the       Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs       shall jointly submit to the appropriate congressional       committees a report on the pilot program that includes the       following:        (1) For the period since the commencement of the pilot       program--        (A) the number of women members by military department       (with respect to Department of the Navy, separately for the       Navy and Marine Corps) who participated in the pilot program;        (B) the number of courses held under the pilot program; and        (C) the locations at which such courses were held, and the       number of seats available and the number of participants at       each such location.        (2) With respect to the number of members who participated       in the pilot program as specified under paragraph (1)--        (A) the number who enrolled in the health care system       established under section 1705(a) of title 38, United States       Code; and        (B) the number who attended at least one health care       appointment at a medical facility of the Department of       Veterans Affairs.        (3) Data relating to--        (A) satisfaction with courses held under the pilot program;        (B) improved awareness of health care services administered       by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs; and        (C) any other available statistics regarding the pilot       program.        (4) A discussion of regulatory, legal, or resource barriers       to--        (A) making the pilot program permanent to enable access by       a greater number of women members at locations throughout the       United States;        (B) offering the pilot program online for women members who       are unable to attend courses held under the pilot program in       person; and        (C) the feasibility of automatically enrolling pilot       program participants in the health care system established       under section 1705(a) of title 38, United States Code.        (c) Appropriate Congressional Committees Defined.--In this       section, the term ``appropriate congressional committees''       means the Committees on Veterans' Affairs and the Committees       on Armed Services of the House of Representatives and the       Senate.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material on H.R. 2942, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, women veterans are the fastest growing demographic  within the veteran population yet underutilize VA healthcare resources.  This is primarily due to misperceptions about eligibility and available  resources.   Many women leaving the military may not realize that they are  eligible to use VA services, nor that VA offers extensive gender- specific care, such as mammography; prenatal, maternity, and  infertility care; and mental healthcare that addresses complex trauma,  including military sexual trauma, otherwise known as MST, and combat- related post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.   The VA and U.S. Air Force Women's Health Transition Training pilot  program works to address issues commonly experienced by women veterans  when accessing VA care. This successful improvement to the Transition  Assistance Program, or the TAP, is jointly run by the USAF and VA.  Transitioning women servicemembers can attend an additional day of TAP  to learn about women's healthcare, counseling, and social services  available at the VA to ensure that they receive a warm handoff between  the Department of Defense and the Veterans Administration.   Mr. Cisneros' bill would expand the Women's Health Transition  Training pilot program to more locations and authorizes the program  through the end of fiscal year 2020.   This great legislation has my full support.   Madam Speaker, although women are the fastest growing cohort of  veterans, women veterans are less likely to seek care and services at  VA. This bill aims to address that and make the VA more accessible and  responsive to women veterans.   Madam Speaker, this pilot program educates transitioning servicewomen  about VA's healthcare services. The data collected from this pilot  program can be applied to the Transition Assistance Program to better  meet the needs of all transitioning servicemembers.   Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Cisneros for his hard work on this  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Cisneros), a veteran himself, the author of this  legislation, and a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee.    Madam Speaker, I am also prepared to close.   I will say in my final remarks that I urge all of my colleagues to  support our women veterans by joining me in passing this very important  legislation, H.R. 2942, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3504) to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for  improvements to the specially adapted housing program and educational  assistance programs of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3504         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

AUTHORITY OF SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS TO ASSIST                     BLIND VETERANS WHO HAVE NOT LOST USE OF A LEG                     IN ACQUIRING SPECIALLY ADAPTED HOUSING.         Section 2101 of title 38, United States Code, is amended--        (1) in subsection (a)(2)(B)(ii)--        (A) in the matter preceding subclause (I), by striking       ``due to--'' and inserting ``due to blindness in both eyes,       having central visual acuity of 20/200 or less in the better       eye with the use of a standard correcting lens. For the       purposes of this clause, an eye with a limitation in the       fields of vision such that the widest diameter of the visual       field subtends an angle no greater than 20 degrees shall be       considered as having a central visual acuity of 20/200 or       less.''; and        (B) by striking subclauses (I) and (II); and        (2) in subsection (b)(2)--        (A) by striking subparagraph (A); and        (B) by redesignating subparagraphs (B) and (C) as       subparagraphs (A) and (B), respectively.       SEC. 10. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 3504, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, the Veterans' Affairs Committee is proud to bring to  the floor H.R. 3504, as amended, the Ryan Kules Specially Adaptive  Housing Improvement Act of 2019, which is named after Army veteran Ryan  Kules.   Madam Speaker, we are honored to have Ryan with us today.   Ryan's vehicle was struck by an explosive device in 2005, which took  the lives of Sergeant Jerry Mills and Sergeant Donald Hasse, and took  Ryan's right arm and left leg.   He was able to use the VA's Specially Adapted Housing program to  modify his house to suit his needs and the needs of his wife and  children. However, the program simply didn't provide enough assistance,  leaving Ryan and his family owing more than $90,000 out of pocket for  improvements.   The VA's Specially Adapted Housing program offers grants to  servicemembers and veterans with certain severe service-connected  disabilities. The grants assist with building, remodeling, or  purchasing an adapted home. However, portions of the program don't  reflect the needs of today's veterans, which is why I am proud of our  work on the House Veterans' Affairs Committee to make the SAH program  work for today's veterans.   H.R. 3504, as amended, does this by prioritizing grants for seriously  ill veterans, doubling the cap on the total number of grants issued to  a veteran, increasing the total applications authorized, and increasing  the maximum  [[Page H7210]]  benefit for up to 50 percent of the cost of a specially adapted home.   In addition, this legislation doesn't stop there. H.R. 3504, as  amended, includes legislation from Representative Luria regarding  expanding the SAH program to cover blind veterans.   I was shocked to learn that the existing SAH program only covers  blind veterans who also have lost a limb. H.R. 3504, as amended,  includes Representative Luria's Housing Access for Blind Veterans Act.   I heard from a blind veteran in Ponce, Puerto Rico, last weekend  about some of the challenges that he faces. As Puerto Rico continues to  rebuild after Hurricane Maria, allowing disabled veterans, including  veterans with visual impairments, to apply for Specially Adapted  Housing grants can help repair and improve their homes and lives.   I thank the gentlewoman for her work and Ranking Member Roe's  support.   Also, H.R. 3504, as amended, includes Representative Sablan's GI Bill  Access to Career Credentials Act. This legislation expands the GI Bill  to cover preparatory courses for professional tests, allowing veterans  to more easily obtain career credentials.   Finally, H.R. 3504, as amended, includes a modernization of the VA's  work-study program, streamlining the payment process to make work-study  programs easier for veterans to participate in.   I thank Ranking Member Bilirakis and Chairman Levin for bringing this  legislation to the committee, fully paid for.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3504, as amended,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I want to just add that I hear an equal number of  names mentioned from both sides of the aisle who have contributed to  the content of this bill. This is what bipartisanship looks like. I am  very proud that we have brought this bill out of committee on a  unanimous basis and that I have heard each side mention multiple names  of Members who have contributed language to this bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I am very proud of this moment that we have chosen as  Members of the House to move forward legislation that addresses  adaptive housing for veterans who have truly been heroic. I can't think  of a single American who would stand in the way or would criticize  Members of our body for addressing such an urgent need.   I want to congratulate all the Members who have done an even greater  honor to the person for whom this bill is named by addressing issues  related to the workstudy program, by increasing the availability of  benefits to our veterans in their educational process.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in passing H.R.  3504, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.
