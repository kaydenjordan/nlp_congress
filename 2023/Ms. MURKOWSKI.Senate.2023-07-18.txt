 Mr. President, this past weekend, on July 15,  2023, Alaskans marked a milestone as we recognized a century of  operations for the Alaska Railroad Corporation.   The Railroad, as we call it, along with all of its builders,  operators, and leaders, has been a critical catalyst for our still- young State's growth and development. For 100 years now, the Railroad  has transported passengers between Alaska's largest cities, bolstered  tourism and commerce across hundreds of miles of terrain, helped build  some of our State's most critical infrastructure, and supported our  Nation's wartime efforts.   It took decades for the Alaska Railroad Corporation to become the  entity we recognize today. The Alaska Central Railway, later renamed  the Alaska Railroad, laid its first track in Alaska in 1903. It started  in Seward and extended 50 miles north. The Alaska Central Railway  reorganized in 1910 as the Alaska Northern Railway Co., later extending  the railroad to Kern Creek, 71 miles from Seward.   In 1914, the U.S. Congress, understanding the intrinsic value in the  Railroad's expansion, funded the construction and operation of a  railroad from Seward to Fairbanks. On July 15, 1923, President Warren  G. Harding drove a golden spike to unite the track at Nenana, marking  the completion of the Alaska Railroad as we know it today. From 1940 to  1943, the Railroad was integral to our Nation's efforts in World War  II, hauling military and civilian supplies across the State.   In 1962, the Railroad established its first car-barge service in  Whittier, followed by train-ship service in June 1964, which  revolutionized the State by enabling rail cars from the lower 48 to be  shipped to any point along its route. In the early to mid-1970s, the  Railroad supported construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System by  shipping and storing pipe and construction materials between Valdez,  Seward, and Fairbanks, where it was then trucked to the North Slope. In  1981, the Alaska Railroad entered into agreements with Fairbanks and  Anchorage school district career centers to create a tour-guide program  to train high school students to serve as hosts onboard summer  passenger trains. In 1983, President Ronald Reagan signed into law the  authorization of the transfer of the Alaska Railroad to the State of  Alaska. In 1985, the railroad became the property of the State of  Alaska, and the Alaska  [[Page S2982]]  Railroad Corporation, or ARRC, was born.   Today, the Alaska Railroad Corporation operates regularly scheduled  public transportation service that connects roughly half a million  Alaskans and visitors to communities from Seward to Fairbanks each  year. Passengers can access remote regions of our State, including  areas off the road system. Some of the most popular Alaskan treasures  that local residents and tourists alike can visit include the Chugach  National Forest, Kenai Fjords National Park, and Denali National Park  and Preserve.   The Railroad is also a vital part of our supply chains, linking the  Alaskan interior to Seward, Whittier, and the Port of Alaska in  Anchorage. The Railroad hauled 3.7 million tons of freight last year,  including natural resources, industrial goods, and more.   As we reach this 100th anniversary, I join Alaskans in recognizing  that our Railroad is a lot more than locomotives and rails. Many  talented men and women have dedicated their lives to its safe operation  and to carrying passengers and freight across wide expanses, rivers,  and mountains, showcasing our State and contributing to our economy.   I join the rest of the Alaska delegation in congratulating the Alaska  Railroad Corporation on 100 years of operation and look forward to a  new century of investment, expansion, and service ahead to meet the  continued needs of our State and Nation.                            ____________________
