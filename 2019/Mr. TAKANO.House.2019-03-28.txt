 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee  on Veterans' Affairs be discharged from further consideration of the  bill (S. 863) to amend title 38, United States Code, to clarify the  grade and pay of podiatrists of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and  ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.
