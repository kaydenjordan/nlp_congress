 Mr. President, today I wish to reaffirm my partnership  on the Lifespan Respite Care Reauthorization Act of 2019 with my good  friend, Senator Tammy Baldwin, who I would like the record to reflect  is an original lead cosponsor of S. 995. As the longstanding coauthors  of this legislation, Senator Baldwin and I have been working together  to provide the necessary resources to State respite agencies to ensure  that caregivers have access to the respite services they need.  Following the introduction of the legislation earlier this week, we  heard testimony in the Senate Special Committee on Aging that  reaffirmed the importance of respite care for the millions of  caregivers who are caring for loved ones with Alzheimer's and other  dementias. I look forward to continuing to work with Senator Baldwin to  advance S. 995.                            ____________________
