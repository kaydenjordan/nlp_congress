 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my 10 minutes  be extended to 15 minutes.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, we are introducing today a CRA that is  kind of interesting. This is something that has only been successful  one time.   I think everyone knows that during the past 8 years, under the Obama  administration, we have seen thousands, literally thousands of  regulations that have come through that have been anti-business, many  of them anti-certain businesses, such as the oil and gas industries. It  is no secret, the fact that we have had a President, in President  Obama, who has had a war on fossil fuels.   It is interesting to me that when I go back to my State of Oklahoma-- one reason I go back all the time is because I want to be around real,  rational people. Sometimes I get the feeling there really aren't any  around here. They ask questions. They will say: Tell me. Explain this  to me. In the United States of America, in order to generate power, 89  percent of the power we are generating is either fossil fuels, coal,  oil, gas, or nuclear. If we do away with 89 percent of our generation  capability, then how do we run the machine called America?   The answer is that we can't. But we don't get those types of  questions here. I am sure most of us who go back find that kind of  concern, and it is not confined to Oklahoma.   I chaired the Environment and Public Works Committee during the 8  years--during the time President Obama was in office, and most of the  regulations were actually associated with that committee. Many  committees have regulations associated with their committees but not  nearly as many as Environment and Public Works. An example is the WOTUS  regulation. Ask anyone with the American Farm Bureau or anyone who  deals with farmers and ranchers, and the No. 1 problem they have, they  will tell you, is nothing that is found on the AgNu Committee; it is  the overregulation of the EPA. That is one example. The Environment and  Public Works Committee is the committee that has the jurisdiction over  the EPA--at least we are supposed to.   During the time when WOTUS came through--the water regulation--it has  historically always been the States' jurisdiction to handle water  issues, not the Federal Government, with the exception of navigable  water. I think we all understand that. In fact, there were several  liberal Members in the House and Senate who tried to take the word  ``navigable'' out of the regulations, and we defeated them every time.  The last two who tried to do that were, in fact, defeated in the polls.   We know that in the State of Oklahoma--I should say our farmers know  that if you put the Federal Government in charge of water regulations  in the western part of Oklahoma, which is an arid part of the State, it  would end up being designated as a wetland. Anyway, that is a major  concern they had.   Another example of regulation is President Obama's Clean Power Plan.  We all know how that came about. Way back in 1972, I was one of the bad  guys who told the truth about what they were referring to as global  warming, saying the world was coming to an end. Even though a lot of  the Members of this body didn't join in and agree with me, every time,  without exception, they came up with a bill that would do something-- such as a cap-and-trade bill, for example--we defeated the bill, and it  was continually defeated by an even larger margin as time went by.   President Obama came in, and when he couldn't get the legislation he  wanted passed, he tried to do it through regulation. That is what he  did with the Clean Power Plan--another rule that was rejected.  [[Page S493]]    I only bring up those examples because they are typical regulations  that put people out of business that actually came through my  committee.   I am here to introduce S.J. Res. 9. This did not come through my  committee; it came through a provision that is in the Dodd-Frank bill.  Anyone going back to their States and talking to bankers or anyone in  the financial industry, when talking about the Dodd-Frank bill, it is  an example of the same type of overregulation that takes place on many  of the issues that come before my committee.   Section 1504 of the Dodd-Frank bill requires the Securities and  Exchange Commission to develop a rule that requires companies to report  payments made to a foreign government or the U.S. Federal Government  relating to the commercial development of oil, natural gas, and  minerals. That is a requirement which is not found in our committee,  but it is found in the committee that handled the Dodd-Frank bill.   While that may not sound all that significant, it strikes at the  heart of American competitiveness. It makes public the information of  our very best companies on how to win oil and gas deals. It requires  companies to disclose and make public highly confidential and  commercially sensitive information, and this is information that  foreign competitors don't have to provide. Under this regulation, we  would be required to provide it. That means that American companies  would have to disclose all of the background and sensitive information  that companies develop in competing for contracts of some kind having  to do with oil and gasoline. It could be with another country, like  Iran. It could be with individuals over there who are not friendly to  the United States. Countries that don't wish to disclose the details of  their commercial deals would now have a strong incentive to go with  companies in countries that don't have that burdensome requirement.  That is only natural.   To make matters worse, the SEC's rule lacks an exemption for  circumstances in which disclosure under 1504 would violate the laws of  a country where a U.S. company is operating. So it leaves U.S.  companies with a choice of complying with U.S. laws or the laws of  foreign countries. That is an impossible position to be in and could  put U.S. employees at risk of criminal prosecution abroad for  facilitating the release of this information.   If that weren't enough, the cost of complying with this regulation is  enormous. American companies would have to comply, and it could cost  millions of dollars. The SEC's estimate of the total compliance cost  initially would be up to $700 million. The ongoing compliance costs  would be as much as $581 million annually. Those costs would be borne  by U.S. companies, and our competition would not have to do that.   The courts already struck down this rule when it was first developed  in August 2012. The DC Federal district court struck down the rule in  2013 because of two substantial errors. Specifically, the Commission  had ``misread section 1504 to mandate public disclosure of the  reports'' and had arbitrarily declined to provide an exemption for  countries that prohibit disclosure.   The new rule, finalized in June of 2016, doesn't look any different.  It is the same rule. Even though the SEC was told by the courts that  the rule did not reflect congressional intent, they continued to put  out a new rule that had the exact same problems as the one the court  had vacated. It is the same rule. It is as if the Obama administration  was rushing this rule out in hopes that there wouldn't be time or an  opportunity for a court or Congress to overturn it. But here we are in  the process of overturning it.   Last week President Trump issued an Executive order to reduce the  regulatory impact on American businesses. With this CRA, we have an  opportunity to effectively participate in that. Our focus should always  be America first. As the Congress looks at the competitiveness of  American companies, we should not be subjecting our own citizens to  lawsuits, and that is exactly what this regulation would do.   By the way, I think we are going to get a lot of CRAs going forward,  and I think it is important for people to understand what the CRA is.  The CRA is the Congressional Review Act.   There are a lot of liberal people who like to have power concentrated  in Washington--like with the WOTUS rule. They would rather have the  jurisdiction of the waters of the United States with the Federal  Government instead of with State governments. That is human nature.  That is not something up for debate. Everybody knows that.   When individuals who are trying to centralize power in Washington go  home and hear complaints from people in their States about regulations  and overregulation in our society, their response is, well, that is not  us, that is some unelected bureaucrat. A CRA forces Members of the  Senate and House of Representatives to be held accountable to the  people by having to take a position so that they can't go home and say:  No, the regulators are doing this. It is interesting because it puts  them in a position where, if we pass a CRA--and we are going to pass  S.J. Res. 9--this will come before this body and we will have to say  yes or no. Should we do away with this rule that everyone back home is  opposed to? It forces them to be honest.   I think this is one CRA that many Democrats should be sponsoring and  voting for, and I wouldn't be surprised if we are able to get some  cosponsors.   Let me add one last point to outline what this is about. Within the  Dodd-Frank bill, section 1504 is a requirement on U.S. companies  competing for oil and gas deals throughout the world to disclose to  their competition what goes into their bid and how they are putting it  together, even when the other side doesn't have to do that.   I look forward to having the opportunity to bring this to the floor  as soon as we get our initial 30 signatures on here. Senators will see  and have an opportunity to support this first CRA that I am very  excited about.                                  ______                                         By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself, Mrs. Capito, Mr. Manchin, Ms.          Heitkamp, Mr. Hoeven, Mr. Paul, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Inhofe, Ms.          Murkowski, Mr. Blunt, Mr. Sullivan, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Tillis, Mr.          Johnson, Mr. Toomey, Mr. Wicker, Mr. Risch, Mr. Flake, Mr.          Boozman, Mr. Daines, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Moran, Mr. Lankford, Mr.          Young, Mr. Cotton, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Enzi, Mrs. Ernst, and Mr.          Cornyn):   S.J.
