 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman  for yielding to me. I also want to commend her for her outstanding  leadership of her committee. I also want to take a moment to commend my  colleague who has been championing D.C. statehood before I even came to  Congress.   You know, I have listened intently to all of the arguments, and it  always gets back to one: How are the people in D.C. more likely to  vote? Are they are going to vote more likely Democratic? Are they going  to vote for Democrats?   Well, let me tell you, I have got people in my district who vote  Republican. Can you imagine that? They vote Republican. But we don't  deny them the right to vote, and we don't deny them the right to  representation.   All that we are seeking and all that we are asking for is simply the  principle of no taxation without representation. I think we learned  that in grammar school when we took U.S. history, when we first learned  how great this country is and how great it can be.   I look forward to the people of Washington, D.C., having all rights  of citizenship as a member of a State, voting in the greatest State in  the country when it becomes one, Washington, D.C.
