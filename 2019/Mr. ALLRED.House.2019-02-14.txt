 Mr. Speaker, as I am back home in Dallas, Texas, on  paternity leave with my family, I submit the following vote  explanation. Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall  No. 85, ``yea'' on rollcall No. 86, and ``yea'' on rollcall No. 87.                            ____________________
