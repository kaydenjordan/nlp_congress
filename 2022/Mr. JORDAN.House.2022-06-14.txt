 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, why did it take so long? Why did it take so long to  bring this legislation to the floor? It has been over a month since the  leak of the draft opinion, over a month of threats on Supreme Court  Justices and their families, over a month of protests at their homes.  Why did it take so long? I mean, the protests at their homes are a  direct violation of the law, 18 U.S.C. section 1507. Over a month.   It has been over a week, or actually a week, since an assassination  attempt on a Supreme Court Justice, on Justice  [[Page H5496]]  Kavanaugh. Think about that for a second. An assassination attempt on a  sitting United States Supreme Court Justice.   And what did the Speaker of the House say last week? No one is in  danger. No rush on this legislation. No concern here.   The Senate passed this bill a month ago. Why hasn't the House? Why  did it take so long? I think the answer is obvious. Because they have  always wanted to intimidate the Court. That has been their goal since  the get-go. Their goal was to intimidate the Court. That has been their  objective all along.   Think about the history first. We had the Kavanaugh confirmation mess  where the left has made up things about Justice Kavanaugh and his  family. Then we had the leader of the Senate, the Democrat leader of  the Senate on the Supreme Court steps say to two Justices, Mr.  Kavanaugh and Mr. Gorsuch: You have released the whirlwind, and you  will pay the price.   Last April, the Democrat chair of the Judiciary Committee introduced  legislation to do what? To pack the Court, to add four Associate  Justices to the United States Supreme Court. Why four? Why not one? Why  not two? Why not three? Why four? Because four would give them a  majority on the Court.   Then there was the sustained attack on Justice Thomas and his wife  over the last several weeks. The Democrats on the Judiciary Committee  even had hearings about Justice Thomas.   Then, of course, there was the leak of the draft opinion itself,  something that has never happened. And then there were the protests at  Supreme Court Justices' homes, again in direct violation of the  statute.   And then, finally, there was the hearing the Democrats had in the  Judiciary Committee about the abortion issue while the Dobbs decision  is pending in front of the Court. You remember that hearing. That was  the one where the Democrat witness said men could get pregnant. That is  the history here.   And then, of course, last week, we had an assassination attempt on  Justice Kavanaugh. Intimidation is their goal. It is the same reason  the Department of Homeland Security stood up the Disinformation  Governance Board. It is the same reason the Department of Justice is  targeting parents who have the nerve to show up at a school board  meeting and speak up for their kids. It is all about intimidation. That  is how the left operates, and we have seen it play out now against the  Supreme Court.   But the good news is, finally, this bill is going to pass and give  the Justices of the highest Court in our land the protection they and  their families deserve. I say better late than never. We support this  legislation. It should have passed a darn long time ago.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, that is why Republicans have condemned  violence every single time it happened. We condemned it when it  happened on January 6. But guess what? We also condemned it when it  happened in the summer of 2020.   It hasn't been a few weeks since the leak of the draft opinion. It  has been 6 weeks. The Senate passed this legislation unanimously, and  they wouldn't bring it up. They wouldn't bring it up. In fact, the  Speaker of the House, as I said before, the Speaker of the House said  last week there was no need to bring it up, but now we are going to.  Thank goodness for that.   Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Issa), my friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Hice).  [[Page H5497]]         Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me say this. Reading from a headline here, this group, Ruth Sent  Us, ``. . . hinted at targeting Supreme Court Justice Barrett's  children, church.'' Let me read the headline here. ``Group gave details  on Barrett's routine, her children's school, and family's spiritual  life.''   In plain English, this group was saying where Justice Coney Barrett  goes each day, where her kids go to school, and where her family goes  to church. They gave those details.   Last week, the Democrats said no one is in danger. After an  assassination attempt on Justice Barrett's colleague, Justice  Kavanaugh, they said not to worry. Everything is fine. We don't need to  pass this legislation after the Senate had done it unanimously. That is  the position of the Democrats in this body.   That is why we are saying: Why did it take so long? Six weeks ago was  when the draft leak happened, and the protests started at Justices'  homes almost immediately after the leak of that draft, that  unprecedented leak of that draft opinion. They have been doing it now  for weeks and weeks and weeks.   Here is the email from this organization, this Ruth Sent Us  organization. Here is one of the messages: ``If you are in the D.C.  metro area, join us. Our protests at Barrett's home moved the needle to  this coverage. Falls Church is a People of Praise stronghold. She sends  her seven kids to a People of Praise school that she sat on the board  of directors for. She attends church daily,'' as if that is bad to go  to church daily. I think that is a good thing. But this is what they  are saying, this group, giving the details of where her kids go to  school, where they go to church, and her daily routine.   And the Democrats said: Nothing to worry about.   That is our concern. So thank goodness this bill is here.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   We condemned what took place on January 6. It would have been nice if  Democrats would have done the same thing in the summer of 2020 or  passed this legislation 6 weeks ago or a month ago when the Senate  passed it.   Let me just recite a few things here that have been said by our  colleagues on the other side.   Former Attorney General Eric Holder said in 2018, at a campaign event  in Georgia, to kick Republicans. ``No. No. When they go low, we kick  them.'' That is what this new Democratic Party is about.   It sure is. It is all about intimidation: intimidating the court,  intimidating parents who have the nerve to show up at school board  meetings, setting up a Disinformation Governance Board to intimidate  free speech rights of all Americans. That is what the new Democratic  Party is about.   We have seen it time and time again. In the summer of 2018, we saw  one of our colleagues from California, a Democrat Member, say: Let's  make sure we show up wherever we have to show up. And if you see  anybody from the Trump Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store,  at a gasoline station, out in a crowd, you create a crowd and push back  on them, and you tell them--think about this. This is a Member of  Congress saying this to a Cabinet member--you tell them they are  [[Page H5498]]  not welcome anymore, anywhere. A Cabinet member of the administration  not welcome in their own darn country? That is what a Member of  Congress said on the Democrat side.    We had another Member of Congress on the Democrat side say this:  There needs to be ``unrest on the streets,'' calling for unrest on the  streets while there was unrest on the streets in the summer of 2020.   That is why this legislation is so darn important and why we cannot  figure out--the gentleman just said something that wasn't accurate. The  Speaker of the House last week said no one is in danger. I just read  you what they are posting about Justice Coney Barrett and her family  and where they go to church and where her seven kids go to school. Of  course, this is in the context of everything they have done to  intimidate the Court and an assassination attempt on another Justice,  Justice Kavanaugh.   Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from North Carolina (Mr. Bishop).                                time  1245     Madam Speaker, the employees of the Supreme Court are  already protected. This is about protecting the Justices' families, and  we know that is needed based on the headline I read and the email that  Mr. Bishop just talked about.   The gentleman said that Democrats condemn violence. No, they don't.  No, they don't. They called rioters and looters the entire summer of  2020, they called them ``peaceful protestors.'' And that same summer,  then-Senator now-Vice President Harris raised money to bail those  rioters and looters and people who went after the police out of jail.  So you have got to stick with the facts here, and that is just not  accurate what was stated earlier.   For all the reasons we have highlighted, Madam Speaker, we are glad  this bill is finally going to pass. We just wish it would have happened  when it should have, weeks and weeks ago when this threat was first  present for Supreme Court Justices.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, a talking point? The left is telling  people where Justice Barrett's kids go to school. That is not a talking  point, that is a fact. That is one of the craziest things I have heard  said on this floor.   A talking point? Every single Senator voted for this package. That  includes Democrats. Every single one.   A talking point? You have got to be kidding me.  [[Page H5499]]    They are reporting where a Supreme Court Justice's kids go to school,  where her family goes to church, her daily routine, and the left calls  it a talking point?   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
