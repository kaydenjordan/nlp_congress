 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to praise a great speller in my  district, Kavya Jakasania. The seventh grade student at Frank R.  Conwell, Middle School 4, in Jersey City won the 2023 Hudson County  Spelling Bee recently.   Kavya bested a field of 62 of my district's top spellers to take the  crown. It was a tough battle to the end, but after 12 rounds, Kavya  spelled the word ``internecine'' correctly to win the spelling bee.   For my edification and for my colleagues who are curious about  ``internecine,'' it means deadly or marked by great slaughter.   With her victory, Kavya advances to the Scripps National Spelling Bee  on May 30 through June 1. I know she will do a great job.   She has already made me, her school, and her family very proud of her  success.                            ____________________
