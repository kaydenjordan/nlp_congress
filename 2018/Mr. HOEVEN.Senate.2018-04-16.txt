 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I understand there is 4 minutes left, and  I might go a few minutes over. I ask unanimous consent to complete my  remarks.    Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 140, as amended,  the bill sponsored by the outstanding Senator from the great State of  Kansas, Mr. Moran. This bill affirms Tribal sovereignty and upholds the  unique government-to-government relationship the United States shares  with the Indian nations.   As chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, I have long said there  is far more common ground than division on Indian issues. Our committee  has a strong tradition of working in a bipartisan manner to improve the  lives of Indian people and to build stronger Native American  communities.   With the support of Indian Country, we have successfully advanced  important initiatives to support Tribal economic development,  healthcare, public safety, and housing. Additionally, we have worked to  support our many Native veterans. Native Americans proudly serve and  defend our great country at some of the highest rates per capita of any  ethnic group.   Of the 29 bills we have cleared through the Indian Affairs Committee  this Congress, 18 have passed the Senate by unanimous consent and 4  have already been signed into law.   Jefferson Keel, lieutenant governor of the Chickasaw Nation and  president of the National Congress of American Indians, recently stated  in an op-ed piece to The Hill: ``Both political parties have seen the  wisdom of supporting strong tribal governments and tribal sovereignty  and have to realize that as the most local of governments, tribes know  best how to solve local challenges.''   Tribal sovereignty is the inherent right of Indian Tribes to govern  themselves on their own lands, and it is the cornerstone of our  government-to-government, nation-to-nation relationship. Today marks a  real opportunity for the Senate to affirm and celebrate Tribal  sovereignty and self-determination.   The Senate will be considering S. 140, as amended, ``An Act to amend  the White Mountain Apache Tribe Water Rights Quantification Act of  2010.'' This bill combines both Republican and Democratic bills into  three sections of S. 140. Each of these bills--S. 140, S. 249, and S.  63--all passed out of the Indian Affairs Committee with bipartisan  support.   The first section of S. 140 would allow for a technical amendment so  the White Mountain Apache Tribe can use all or a portion of already  appropriated funds from a water rights settlement to complete their  drinking water system in Arizona. This section was originally sponsored  by Senators Flake and McCain as S. 140. The bill was voice-voted out of  the Indian Affairs Committee and passed the Senate by unanimous  consent.    Section 2 of S. 140 would amend the Indian Long-Term Leasing Act so  that the Pueblos of Santa Clara and Ohkay Owingeh are authorized to  lease their respective Indian trust and restricted lands for up to 99  years. This is identical language to S. 249, a bill that was introduced  by Senators Udall and Heinrich of New Mexico. That bill was passed by  the committee on February 8, 2017.   Section 3 of S. 140 would amend and clarify the National Labor  Relations Act so that Indian Tribes, Tribal governments, and tribally  owned and operated institutions and enterprises that are located on  Indian lands would be provided parity under the law with respect to  other governments. This would reverse the 2004 National Labor Relations  Board decision that found Tribal governments to be private  organizations. That NLRB decision overturned years of precedent.   Let's listen to Tribal leaders. In his prepared statement to the  Committee on Indian Affairs regarding the Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act  of 2015, then-Governor Paul Torres of the Pueblo of Isleta stated:         This bill is essential to restore the dignity and equality       of Indian tribes as sovereigns, which the National Labor       Relations Board is seeking to deny us. The Board treats every       sovereign, all the way down to local governments and       political subdivisions of the state, as exempt from the       National Labor Relations Act except for one--Indian tribes.       It does so even though Congress made clear, when the NLRA was       enacted, that the Act does not apply to sovereign entities.       The NLRA does not mention Indian tribes and for a long time       the Board recognized that the Act does not apply to Tribes.       Since 2004, it wants that power--but it did not ask Congress       for it. Nor did it ask the Tribes for their views.   [[Page S2137]]     So this clearly goes beyond what should be allowed under the law. We  have accomplished a lot in our committee, and it is because we have  listened to Tribal leaders and their communities. This bill, S. 140,  has the support of every Tribal leader across the country, the National  Congress of American Indians, the National Indian Gaming Association,  the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and many other organizations.   With that, Mr. President, I urge a ``yes'' vote on cloture and on  passage of this bill.   With that, I yield the floor.                                Cloture Motion
