 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Johnson, my always  friend, for yielding.   Madam Speaker, our country is experiencing an unbelievable crisis at  our southern border. In August alone, the United States Customs and  Border Protection encountered over 200,000 migrants at the U.S.-Mexico  border which was a 317 percent increase from August of last year. Let  me repeat that one more time: a 317 percent increase from just one  single year ago.   President Biden has prioritized reversing effective Trump-era border  policies such as the Remain in Mexico Policy and most notably, the  border wall. They were working. We literally have tons of building  materials, all of which have been bought and paid for by the  hardworking men and women American taxpayers, sitting in the desert  collecting dust because President Biden cares more about trying to be  politically stylish than he does implementing policies to protect and  strengthen our America which we love so much.   Is President Biden requiring these migrants to show proof of  vaccination? The answer is no. Are they being tested for COVID-19? The  answer is no. Are they being tested for other deadly viruses? The  answer is no.   Americans are still unable to return to their normal ways of life but  hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants are allowed to breach and  break through the border and infect our Nation. How does that make  sense? How can any one individual American make any sense or understand  that?                                time  1700    Drug cartels are recruiting and using children as drug mules, they  are sexually abusing women, and they are responsible for bringing  enough fentanyl into America to kill every man, woman, and child, at  least 10 times over, and we read it in the headlines. This is unlike  anything we have ever seen before in our America, yet this  administration continues to leave this  [[Page H5711]]  border wide open. Again, how does it make sense? How can we understand  it? How can we believe it?   The Border Patrol is on track to encounter more migrants this year  than it has in any year prior. In fiscal year 2021, roughly 10,000  migrants with criminal records were detained at the southern border.  This is no joke. This is a real tragedy for America. The former Border  Patrol chief has also stated that our Border Patrol is encountering  known and suspected terrorists at ``a level that we have never seen  before.'' This is no joke. This is the real world which we live in now  in America.   There are serious shortages among Border Patrol agents, and somehow  congressional Democrats and the administration are making zero efforts  to address them. They fail to recognize the severity of the issue or  even admit that there is an issue to begin with.   Again, it is no joke. These men and women are putting their lives in  danger. Half the time they don't even have the backup that they should.  I remember when I went to the border and saw them encountering all  types of dangerous situations. Not a single backup sometimes. How can  we do that to our American men and women in law enforcement?   Make no mistake about it. I don't want anyone to think otherwise.  Make no mistake--this is the worst border crisis that we have ever  experienced in America. President Biden is actively destroying our  country and our way of life by not taking this crisis seriously at all.  But he should. I will say it again. This is no joke. It is the real  thing.   Madam Speaker, God help us all. We must save our country.
