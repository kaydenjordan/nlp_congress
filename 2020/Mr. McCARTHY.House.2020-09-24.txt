 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to say thank you and pay  tribute to our friend and this Chamber's Parliamentarian, Tom Wickham.   Since the creation of the position in 1927, Tom is just the sixth  Parliamentarian in the history of this body.   While Representatives come and go, and majorities change from session  to session, one constant is the Parliamentarian's office and their  commitment to uphold the rules and traditions of this very Chamber.   The Parliamentarian advises not only the Speaker, but serves with an  open door to all Members, majority and minority, so our voices and our  constituents' voices can be heard in this legislative process.   I speak for all Republicans when I commend Tom for his  professionalism, sound judgment, and steady demeanor in carrying out  his duties.   You see, Mr. Speaker, America was founded on an idea. Our Founders  determined that a deliberative body governed of, by, and for the people  would best serve the interest of this Nation.   Our Congress, a literal coming together of people and ideas from  every corner of the Nation, is tasked with debating the issues of the  day. And it is up to Tom and his staff to make sure that we do so in a  way that is consistent with the enduring rules and precedents of this  institution.   Looking out for the institution is not exactly a glamorous job. Most  of the Parliamentarian's work goes on behind the scenes and without  public recognition. But it is essential to our democracy and it  embodies the very best of civil service.   Tom has served this body and this country for 25 years. Some of my  staffers refer to Tom as Dumbledore from Harry Potter--he knows all the  answers, you just have to ask the right questions.   I know Members will continue to seek out Tom for advice, and I  encourage all of them to extend the same courtesy to his successor,  Jason Smith.   Now, let's not be confused, it is not Representative Jason Smith from  Missouri, it is a different Jason Smith.   I want to especially thank Tom's wife, Heather, and his children,  Brady and Elizabeth, for sharing Tom with us for all those years and  all those late nights, through too many late-night voting sessions and  last-minute negotiations to count.   Tom, you have served well. We wish you the best in retirement, and  hope you get to watch lots of Iowa football now that the Big Ten has  resumed play.   But on behalf of a very grateful Nation, I want to say thank you. I  know times get heated. I know people are passionate about their ideas.  I know your decisions cannot be made based upon who is in the majority  or who is in the minority.   I have watched you make some of the most difficult decisions, but  they are always the right one. This country could only imagine being a  Parliamentarian when a decision is being made whether a Speaker has  broken the rules or not. It would be easy to fold to the pressure of  the majority, and I am proud to say Tom always held with the people of  this Nation. That is what we look for in a Parliamentarian. That is  what we ask for, and that is exactly what you gave us.   Thank you for your service, and we appreciate all that you have done  for this Nation.                            ____________________
