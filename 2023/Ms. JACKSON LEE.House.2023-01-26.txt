 Mr. Chair, I rise to speak in support of the Jackson  Lee Amendments to H.R. 21, the Strategic Production Response Act, which  will improve the bill.   As a senior member of the House Committee on Homeland Security and a  member representing the 18th Congressional District in Houston, Texas,  I am well aware of the critical importance of the Strategic Petroleum  Reserve to our nation's security.   The Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the world's largest supply of  emergency crude oil, was established primarily to reduce the impact of  disruptions in supplies of petroleum products and to carry out  obligations of the United States under the international energy  program.   Following the oil shocks of the late 1970s, the nation prepared to  secure its energy future by developing the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.   On August 4, 1980, President Jimmy Carter issued Executive Order  12231--Strategic Petroleum Reserve. In this action, he transferred the  functions vested in the President by Section 7430(k) of Title 10 of the  United States Code to the Secretary of Energy.   The nation owes a debt of gratitude to President Carter for his  foresight and willingness to pursue such a bold effort to ensure the  nation's energy security.   The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is a federally-owned oil stockpile of  crude oil stored in huge underground salt caverns at four sites along  the coastline of the Gulf of Mexico.   Two Strategic Petroleum Reserve containment facilities are near  Houston, Texas: the Bryan Mound in Brazoria County and Big Hill in  Jefferson County.   Over my tenure in the House of Representatives I have seen the value  and necessity of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.   For the past 27 years, I have been Co-Chair of the Energy Braintrusts  of the Congressional Black Caucus.   Energy is the Live Blood of the Economy.   The electricity that powers our cities, heats our homes, fuels  innovation in businesses, and supports the work of local, state, and  federal governments to serve the public all depend on low-cost,  accessible, and available energy.   Too often, we take for granted how fortunate we are to live in a  nation and what a rich store of energy in the form of fossil fuels,  wind, solar, and hydropower.   I believe in the importance of an innovative and forward-thinking  energy posture for this nation.   My work includes hosting Energy Braintrusts designed to bring all  relevant players ranging from environmentalists to producers of energy  from various sectors, including coal, electric, natural gas, nuclear,  oil, and alternative energy sources, as well as producers from Africa.   The oil and gas industry provides many jobs for many of my  constituents and opportunities for small businesses in the 18th  Congressional District of Texas.   In past Congresses, I have offered bills to promote deficit reduction  and job creation that could increase leasing of the outer continental  shelf oil and gas resources under the control of the federal  government.   Times change as does the needs of the nation--today our major threat  is climate change.   For these reasons, throughout my time in Congress, I have advanced my  interests in a balance among the sources of home-grown energy sources  comprised of fossil fuels, natural gas, wind, and solar energy.   The Jackson Lee Amendments offered for consideration under H.R. 21  would create avenues for providing access to routine operational  functions for maintenance of the Petroleum Reserve that is essential to  operations.   Mr. Chair, I ask that you consider that the location of the reserves  and the location of the refineries that produce gasoline, fuel oil, and  heating oil are highly concentrated along the Upper Texas and Louisiana  Gulf Coast.   The strategic importance is not just when gasoline prices might go up  but when the nation's national interests are threatened.   Instances of the reserve's oil being used include:   2011 IEA Coordinated Release   2005 Hurricane Katrina Sale   1991 Operation Desert Storm Sale   1990 Desert Shield Test Sale   2017 Hurricane Harvey Exchange   2012 Hurricane Isaac Exchange   2008 Hurricanes Gustav and Ike Exchanges   2006 Ship Channel Closure Exchange   2006 Barge Accident Exchange   2005 Hurricane Katrina Exchange   2004 Hurricane Ivan Exchange   2002 Hurricane Lili Exchange   2000 Heating Oil Exchange   2000 Ship Channel Closure Exchange   1999 Maya Exchange   1996 Pipeline Blockage Exchange   If the reserve had not been tapped in each of these instances, the  consequences to the American public would have been higher fuel prices.   Shocks to the economy are difficult to weather by those on set  incomes like retired persons or low-income families.   Economic harms caused by higher fuel costs are a threat to American  families and should be considered when considering the national  interest in using the reserves, which are paid for by the working  people of this nation.                         Jackson Lee Amendment No. 35    This Jackson Lee amendment would continue to allow the Secretary of  Energy to permit drawdowns of crude from the Strategic Petroleum  Reserve to supply refineries should natural or manmade disasters  disrupt port facilities or transportation systems that disrupt  deliveries of crude to refineries for the production of gasoline, fuel  oil, or heating oil.   An important benefit to having the world's largest crude oil reserve  occurs following a major hurricane hitting the upper Texas or Southern  Louisiana Coast when ports and docking facilities may have sustained  damage that prevents the off-loading of crude to refineries.   Drawdowns from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in response to  disasters does aid the national interest in keeping supplies of  gasoline, fuel oils, and heating oil flowing to consumers.   Any disruption in the production of these energy products would  immediately trigger higher prices that would hit the pocketbooks of  American families.   The benefits of providing exchanges of oil from the preserve to  refiners and having the crude delivered later to replenish what was  used with additional amounts added to the reserve a few months after  the drawdown is beneficial to the nation and the oil industry as a  whole.   This Jackson Lee Amendment would preserve exchanges that occur and  protect the nation from gasoline shortages and likely much higher fuel  prices following natural disasters that impact the Texas and Louisiana  Gulf Coasts.                         Jackson Lee Amendment No. 36    This Jackson Lee amendment would allow the necessary and routine test  drawdowns that occur as part of the work to maintain the efficiency of  the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to ensure that it functions as intended  during an emergency use permissible by law or regulation.   Tests are essential to the core mission of the preserve and often  involve 5,000,000 barrels or less being drawn down.   This Jackson Lee Amendment would provide that Strategic Petroleum  Reserve tests would not trigger the provisions of this bill.   The Jackson Lee amendment would ensure that tests can continue  without delay or suspension out of concern regarding the requirements  of this bill.   I ask my colleagues to support both of these Jackson Lee Amendments.   I understand that the bill's authors have a specific policy objective  in mind and believe that the legislation will accomplish a minor policy  change.   I would offer that sometimes a little change can have severe  consequences and that we might be far better if bipartisan efforts were  pursued when it comes to a successful policy accomplishment that is the  envy of the world and a vital national resource.    Mr. Speaker, I ask to present amendment No. 35.    Mr. Chairman, I see that I have my good friend, Mr.  Pallone, over on this side, and I thought I would have my good friend  from South Carolina, but now I have my good friend from Texas who is  here.   I am sure they understand that everyone who comes to the floor is  sincere. The gentlewoman from New York and others who have offered  their amendments are sincere and factual. They have knowledge. I just  want to put that in the Record so that no one's integrity is  challenged.   I am sincere, and I believe that we need to have a little history  lesson as to what the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is all about.   It exists first and foremost as an emergency response tool that the  President can use should the United States be confronted with an  economically threatened disruption in oil supply. It is also where oil  can be released from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve under exchange  arrangements similar to loans to private companies. Exchange contracts  provide for a loan of crude oil to be repaid in kind within a certain  timeframe and with additional petroleum barrels.   However, as we move toward an increasing respect for climate change,  I think amendments have to be in place that strategically allow for the  utilization of this reserve to decrease emissions, to provide relief in  emergencies, and to understand that we must have a 21st century  Strategic Petroleum Reserve.   Let me cite for you, Mr. Chairman, when this reserve has been used:  2005, Hurricane Katrina sale; 1991, Operation Desert Storm; 1990,  Desert Storm--Shield tests; 2006, ship channel closure exchange; 2006,  barge accident exchange; 2005, Hurricane Katrina exchange; 2000,  heating oil exchange.   Again, it is doing what it is supposed to do. At the same time, I  believe it is important to modernize the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.   I have a very simple amendment. My amendment would preserve exchanges  that occur and protect the Nation from gasoline shortages and likely  much higher fuel prices following natural disasters. We have had many,  and I cannot, for the life of me, understand the opposition to what  President Biden did where we have heard complete silence about high  gasoline prices.   So it is important in amendment No. 35 that we have the ability to  help those desperately suffering from natural disasters that certainly  occur in the Gulf. They also occur in the Atlantic, and they occur in  the Pacific, and we need to be able to help the American people.   I ask my colleagues to support Jackson Lee amendment No. 35 that  would preserve exchanges that occur to protect the Nation from gasoline  shortages in the likely face of the terrible natural disasters that  have hit our American citizens or our country in various regions.   Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to support amendment No. 35 to help  the American people and to ensure that when disasters come, America  stands with the American people.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk, No.  36.    My good friend from Texas apparently did not  understand the prior amendment in terms of its utilization in the time  of disasters that his district faces as mine does all the time and many  other Americans.   So let me indicate as I move to No. 36, this is, again, an effort to  help Americans and to address the question of the efficiency of the  Strategic Petroleum Reserve.   My amendment would allow the necessary and routine test drawdowns  that occur as part of the work to make sure the reserve can fulfill its  function of providing access to the resources on a moment's notice in  time of emergencies. Those of us in various parts of the Nation  understand emergencies.  [[Page H408]]    In keeping with our commitment to addressing the core mission of many  of us to reduce emissions, we may need a number of tests. Tests are  basic to the core mission of the reserve and often involve numbers of  barrels or less being drawn down.   The Jackson Lee amendment would provide the provisions of this bill  should not be triggered by Strategic Petroleum Reserve tests. The  Jackson Lee amendment would ensure that tests can continue without  delay or suspension out of concern regarding the requirements of the  bill so that this Strategic Petroleum Reserve can stand ready to be  able to efficiently address what is needed.   I am concerned about the direct attack because the CEO--the President  of the United States--in the executive article utilizes his powers to  help Americans in the midst of a disaster.   I hope that this amendment can be accepted by my friends which says  that we have to do due diligence on testing. I understand the authors  of the bill have a specific policy objective in mind and believe that  the bill will accomplish a narrow policy change. However, I would hope  that they believe in efficiency, and the utilization of this Strategic  Petroleum Reserve in an efficient manner requires tests and drawdowns  if we are going to be ready for emergencies to save lives in a crisis  that is either heating or otherwise.   Again, let me remind my colleagues that we did not hear a word--a  Republican word or a Democratic word--when gasoline prices came down.   So the executive branch should have the right, if you will, to make  those emergency decisions. But to have the ability to test is a  reasonable response to ensuring that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve  works well every single day that we need to use it.   I ask my colleagues to support Jackson Lee amendment No. 36. I will  also finish by saying: Please understand what we are saying. Please  know that we understand both the legislation and the need for  improvement of the legislation.   Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to support amendment No. 36 Jackson  Lee, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
