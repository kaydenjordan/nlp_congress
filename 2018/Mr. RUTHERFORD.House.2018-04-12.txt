 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Master  Sergeant William R. ``Bill'' Posch, who died on March 15, 2018, while  serving his country in Iraq.   His dedication to this Nation and its freedom will never be  forgotten. Master Sergeant Posch spent his life helping others. As a  teenager, he worked as a lifeguard for Jacksonville Beach Ocean Rescue,  where he developed his passion for search-and-rescue missions. At the  age of 15, he saved the life of a surfer who was drowning after having  a seizure in the water. After this experience, he knew he wanted to  join the military after he graduated from Fletcher High School.   When he was just 17, he told the local newspaper that after  graduation he was going to enlist with the intent of becoming a rescue  swimmer. And he did just that. Master Sergeant Posch was an Air Force  Reserve pararescueman assigned to the 308th Rescue Squadron, known as  the Guardian Angel Airmen, at Patrick Air Force Base. This squadron is  one of the most deployed in the Air Force Reserve, and this was  reflected in the important missions that Master Sergeant Posch carried  out.   In his time with the Air Force, Master Sergeant Posch completed 143  combat missions, led a crisis evacuation of more than 126 Americans  from the U.S. Embassy in South Sudan, and assisted with the rescue  mission in Texas in the wake of Hurricane Harvey. The Air Force awarded  him many medals, including the Air Medal with silver oak leaf cluster,  the Aerial Achievement Medal, the Air Force Commendation Medal of  Valor, and he was also named one of the Air Force's 12 outstanding  airmen of 2014.   He courageously served our Nation for 18 years, and we in northeast  Florida will always be proud to call him one of our own. I salute  Master Sergeant William R. Posch on his years of service and sacrifice  to our country. He will forever be remembered as an American hero. May  God bless him and our Nation.    Recognizing Malia Domingo for Her Selection as a Florida Outstanding                              School Volunteer     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Malia Domingo of  Yulee, Florida. Malia was recently named one of Florida's outstanding  school volunteers for 2017 and 2018 by the Florida Department of  Education.   She began her volunteer work in the sixth grade, earning 350  volunteer hours over the course of that school year. Malia first  started volunteering at Yulee Primary School, working in four different  kindergarten classrooms, aiding students with the accelerated reader  program.   In addition to this, Malia has worked with students who have special  needs, spending hours with many students one-on-one to increase their  learning. Malia also dedicated her time in the summer to the students  with special needs by volunteering in an extended school year program.   Malia is now in the 11th grade at Yulee High School, and in addition  to being named one of the State's outstanding school volunteers, she  was recently honored by Nassau County as the youth volunteer of the  year.   I want to congratulate Malia Domingo for her 6 years of community  service and her dedication to improving the lives of all those she  helps. Malia is a great role model for her fellow students, and she has  made the Fourth District of Florida very proud.                            ____________________
