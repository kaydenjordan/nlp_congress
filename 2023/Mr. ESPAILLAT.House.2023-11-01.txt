 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume. Today I rise in opposition to H.R. 4364, the Legislative  Branch Appropriations Act of 2024.   First, let me thank Mr. Amodei for his efforts and, of course, my  Democratic staffers, Faye Cobb, Monica Garay, and Raquel Spencer, as  well as our Republican staffers, Michelle Reinshuttle and Jacquelynn  Ripke for their tireless contributions to this subcommittee.   As the chairman indicated, the bill before us today includes $5.3  billion in discretionary appropriations to fund the offices of the  House of Representatives and joint legislative branch items. It also  has a decrease of 4.7 percent from the fiscal year 2023 enacted House  level and a 2.4 percent decrease in total allocation including Senate  items. This bill merely keeps the lights on, but it could and should  have done so much better.   Unfortunately, extreme MAGA culture war provisions have haunted all  12 of the House appropriations bills and, of course, legislative branch  was not spared. This bill, too, contains provisions that harm  diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and the LGBTQ+ community.   Moreover, this bill does not allow legislative branch agencies to  employ individuals under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals  program, the DACA program. These are young kids who are capable and  have contributed to this Nation. All they are missing is a piece of  paper, but they are Americans in every sense of the word you can  imagine.   This bill eliminates funding for diversity, equity, and inclusion  training or program implementation, including our very own House Office  of Diversity and Inclusion, which Republicans have benefited from. All  of us have benefited from the efforts of diversity and inclusion. We  have more women in our staff. We have greater diversity, greater life  experiences. I think that makes this House stronger. Yet, this bill  eliminates funding for that.   This House and the many agencies that make up the entire legislative  branch of government should make every effort possible to be reflective  and considerate of all the people that exist in our great Nation and  the many districts that our Members represent.   This bill does nothing to facilitate the use of funds for collective  bargaining rights to congressional staffers. Our staffers should be  able to do that.   This bill removes a provision to eliminate or reduce plastic waste  across the legislative branch of government, further contributing to  the impacts of climate change. We are here at the center of government,  and we should be fighting climate change, but we are not reducing the  use of plastic.   Mr. Speaker, after the attack on January 6, the attack on two  congressional staffers in their Virginia district office, and numerous  threats to our cybersecurity, I feel strongly that our staff deserves  to have a safe place to work, and our visitors deserve to have an even  safer place to visit and receive services.    However, in my opinion, this bill misses opportunities to further  invest in and enhance our physical and cybersecurity posture.   Our men and women who work hard every day to secure this campus  deserve to have the best equipment, tools, and state-of-the-art  technology resources readily available to them. Securing this campus  both physically and virtually has always been a priority of this  subcommittee. Various requests from the Capitol Police and the  legislative branch cybersecurity offices have not been met. We must  work to protect the campus that supports the governance of our  democracy.   The legislative branch bill should never be a place for divisive  politics. This bill should be used to ensure that Congress has all the  tools it needs to legislate and support the constituents we serve. It  should be used to ensure we have a successful democracy through  effective and responsible governance.   Folks on the other side of the aisle are obsessed with cutting  Federal funding and eliminating programs that help to grow and  diversify our country as well as welcome everybody to the table, a big  tent approach to government.   Mr. Speaker, when I took the role as the ranking member of this  subcommittee, I was looking forward to working with my colleagues on  creating a bipartisan bill. However, this bill does not represent a  collaboration between two parties. Instead, it includes provisions that  have no place within the legislative branch appropriations bill and are  hurtful to many Americans, including many of the staff who support this  great institution.   Extreme rightwing politics that were so focused on silencing the  voices of many in this country turned around and silenced themselves.  They created  [[Page H5211]]  a situation where no one had a voice, rendering at times this body  inoperable for many weeks.   Mr. Speaker, I don't agree with these divisive ideas and tactics. For  these reasons, I cannot support this bill, and I reserve the balance of  my time.                                time  1630     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Morelle), the distinguished ranking member of the  Committee on House Administration and a member of the Appropriations  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I think it is undeniable that during  these uncertain times, particularly when we witnessed the regrettable  incident in Virginia, where staffers in one of our colleague's district  offices were hurt, and given the tension in the world, in our  communities, in our cities, and in our district offices, it requires  greater investment in security for our constituents that visit on a  regular basis our offices, for our staff who are on the front lines in  what we do, and for ourselves. I think that, in many ways, we are wide  open, and we require the kind of investment that we have not seen in  this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Connecticut  (Ms. DeLauro), the distinguished ranking member of the Appropriations  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Mrs. Beatty), the Buckeye State of Ohio.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Ohio.  [[Page H5213]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise again to oppose this bill. This bill doesn't do  enough. It just doesn't do enough to support critical investment for  the future of the legislative branch of government, including critical  enhancement to strengthen our physical and cybersecurity posture or  provide dedicated funding for the House Office of Diversity and  Inclusion.   In addition, I was shocked not to see bipartisan language that has  been supported by both sides of the House for years to allow the  legislative branch agencies to employ individuals under the Deferred  Action for Childhood Arrivals, DACA, Program. Every Member's staffer  should feel safe as they serve the American people. Every office and  committee in Congress should be able to benefit from the bipartisan  work carried out by the House Office of Diversity and Inclusion.   Importantly, every Member from every district across the Nation  should have access to every resource that will allow them to serve the  constituency with the services that they need. This includes the  ability to hire a staffer who represents the makeup of their district.  That is fundamental in a democracy.   This committee has a long tradition of protecting individual Members'  ability to operate their offices how they see fit and employing  individuals under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program  should be no exception.   For this reason, Mr. Speaker, at the appropriate time, I will offer a  motion to recommit this bill back to the committee. If the House rules  permitted, I would have offered the motion with an important amendment  to this bill.    My amendment includes language that would permit funds in the Act to  be used to employ individuals with an employment authorization document  under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, DACA, Program.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of this  amendment into the Record immediately prior to the vote on the motion  to recommit.    Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me in  voting for the motion to recommit.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, let me repeat that the legislative branch  should never be a place for divisive politics. The legislative branch  bill should be used to ensure Congress has the tools it needs to  legislate and support the constituents we serve. It should be used to  ensure we have a successful democracy through effective and responsible  governance.   The Republicans, again, are obsessed with cutting and cutting Federal  funds and eliminating programs that help to grow and diversify our  country. Passing these partisan bills will not help keep the government  open. It just will not make that happen. We should be really focused on  keeping our government open and preventing a pending shutdown.   The former Speaker met with the President and had a handshake. Let's  honor that handshake. Let's not cut to the bone and hurt the American  people. I don't agree also with these divisive ideas and partisan  tactics. I believe we can and should do much better.   For these reasons, I cannot support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
