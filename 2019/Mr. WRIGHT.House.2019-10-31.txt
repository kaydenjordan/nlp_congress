 Madam Speaker, 15 years ago a future gridiron star named  Owen Allen was born. He was born with a gift, and that gift was  superior athletic ability.   At 15 he is already a standout running back for the Southlake Carroll  varsity football team. In last week's game alone, he rushed more than  200 yards and scored four touchdowns.   Madam Speaker, Texans love competition, we love champions, and we  love winners. We find the best of all these things in high school  football. If you want to know why Texans are crazy about those Friday  night lights, look no further than Owen Allen. His performance on the  field excites and inspires.   Running back Allen was just named the Dallas-Fort Worth High School  Offensive Player of the Week. But athleticism is only one of young Mr.  Allen's qualities. He is also a young man of great character,  integrity, and decency.   As a Member of Congress, I congratulate Mr. Allen and wish him many  years of success as an athlete and as a human being. I have prayed  God's blessings on him and his family.                            ____________________
