 Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the Hartzler  Amendment.   Transgender individuals are part of the fabric of America and have  always been part of our military, whether we have historically  acknowledged them or not. Selectively denying healthcare to trans  servicemembers, which is available to other members of the military,  only serves to alienate, undermine, disrespect and ultimately harm  those serving our country.   This amendment is a shameful and targeted attempt to enact a  conservative agenda that singles out transgender individuals. It  circumvents, our military's doctors and uses the denial of healthcare  to force currently serving, and future transgender members of our armed  services from their posts entirely.   Transition related care is considered medically necessary by nearly  every major medical association. It should not need to be said that  when a military physician determines that hormones, surgery or other  transition related care is necessary, we must treat it as we would any  other medical care. Anything less is an abdication of our duty to  provide healthcare to those who have chosen to serve our country.   Using finances to tie the hands of our military's medical  professionals to target transgender individuals demonstrates an  appalling lack of respect for our servicemembers, their doctors and the  democratic ideals of equality our country was founded on. I urge my  colleagues to support our servicemembers by opposing this amendment.
