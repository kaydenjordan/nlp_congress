 Madam President, first of all, I want to thank my good  friend and colleague from Virginia, Senator Kaine, for appropriately  saying to the balance of the Senate yesterday that this is not business  as usual and for objecting to our going into recess as 800,000  Americans--many of them who are working as we heard earlier this  morning, many of them working overtime--are getting paychecks that have  zero on them.   Senator Kaine has probably already outlined where he just came from.  I want to give the same comments, and I want to also thank the Chair  because I know she has come to the floor as well and raised concerns.   We have a lot of debates in the Senate. There are legitimate policy  differences we have, and part of our job is to resolve those. Part of  our job should never be to shut down the enterprise of the greatest  government in the world, the United States of America.   I think about Mr. Trump, who has spent a bunch of time going on TV  and running to the border. My goodness, I just wish that Donald Trump  or someone from his White House could have sat in the room that Senator  Kaine and I just sat in with 16 Federal employees and just heard their  stories.   What we heard, virtually from all of them--and I am sure Senator  Kaine has already acknowledged this--is the fact that they viewed  public service and serving the government as a noble calling. I heard  many of them who had been in the Air Force, Army, or Navy and who had  served in our Nation's defense but felt they were continuing to serve  when they joined public service.   We heard another person who works in one part of the government that  I am a little familiar with--frankly, not that much--that does  investigations into chemical spills. It is a small, tiny agency of 40  professionals. There was a chemical spill in Houston 1 week ago, and no  one has done any investigation about what the effects of that spill  might be on that community. She was there saying that somehow she  doesn't feel like her job is nonessential.   We heard from a young man who had moved to Virginia just a few years  ago and bought a House. He thought he could get through one more  mortgage payment. He helps to approve food stamps and the grocery  stores that apply to take in food stamps. I think he said there are  2,700 grocery stores in this period that are in the process of trying  to get approval to take food stamps and haven't gotten approval. To say  to him that, somehow, making sure folks in this country get food is a  nonessential job was both insulting and, frankly, a little bit  demoralizing.   To hear, as well, from--I can't recall which organization he works  for--someone who was saying he understood that as a Federal employee,  when he came and joined the Federal workforce, he gave up his right in  many ways to organize and to strike, but he felt like he gave up those  rights but the deal was that the government was going to pay him for  his job. In many ways, what is happening right now, kind of in labor  terms, is that, effectively, the government is locking out our  workforce.   I don't want to steal Senator Kaine's thunder. He may have mentioned  this comment, but I thought it was telling. We had a number of air  traffic controllers there, and these folks are not only working without  pay, but many of them are working overtime without pay. With our air  traffic controllers, about 35, 40 percent of them are at the eligible  age of retirement today. They could throw it in, cash it in, and say:  We are done.   One of the things about the shutdown, as well, is that we have been  working for some time with Paul Rinaldi, the head of the National Air  Traffic Controllers Association. I would advise any Members who would  to talk with him because he can scare the dickens out of you about the  safety of our air system. We have had a challenge for the last decade  of making sure we replace those air traffic controllers. Well, the next  class of air traffic controllers is shut down.   Senator Kaine made mention, and I think Mr. Rinaldi made the point:  Do you really want an air traffic controller who is working an 80-hour  week with overtime to not be spending 100 percent of his or her focus  on keeping the skies safe but probably spending 20 percent of his time  thinking about paying the mortgage and another 15 percent of the time  thinking about whether he can pay his kid's tuition? Is that really  what we want from folks who are tasked with such an important job?   Now, due to the good work of Senator Kaine and others and the  Presiding Officer, we passed--I think, 2 days ago--an act so that all  of our Federal employees are going to get reimbursed. I think the House  has passed it now, as well, and the President has signed it. Let's not  presume, by any chance, that this is going to make everybody whole.   We heard from a lady this morning who had not saved very much but had  done what we all urge and had put some money in an IRA. She is taking  her money out of the IRA and paying the tax penalty of getting that  money out so she can get by. She gets a back paycheck but that doesn't  replace the tax penalties she pays on her statements.   We have another person who took an advance on his credit card. We  know credit cards have value, but those rates are not cheap. If you  take an advance against future pay from your credit card, and if you  get your back pay, that is not going to make up for those penalties.   Again, Senator Kaine may have mentioned this already, we in  Virginia--and I know Alaska has the same issue--have tens of thousands,  if not hundreds of thousands, of workers who are contractors who, even  when we reopen the government, have absolutely no guarantee that they  will be reimbursed. As a matter of fact--again, Senator Kaine may have  mentioned this already--there was a veteran-owned small business  contractor that had about nine employees that this week is probably  going to shut down because he can't pay his workers. He maintained as  long as he could, but he couldn't continue to pay his workers.   What about the folks who are never going to get the hours back who  work providing food services or cleaning up our buildings and who are  the lowest paid employees--oftentimes contractors who are never going  to get those hours back--who are going to be stuck with Christmas  presents but never get the income from that time?   The list goes on and on, and it is not just Federal employees and  contractors. Alaska and Virginia are both blessed with great heritage  sites, great national parks. There is the Shenandoah Valley, and around  where Senator Kaine lives, there are a lot of battlefields around  Richmond. I am sure it is the same in Alaska. There are a lot of  private businesses that are the restaurants, campsites, and other  facilities that may not be on national park grounds, but they get all  their business from tourists who come, oftentimes, during the holiday  period. Those folks get, even when we reopen the government, goose  eggs.   So I thank the Presiding Officer. I thank my friend from Virginia as  well.   I believe we will find a way to get this government reopened. My hope  is that our colleagues, when they are home this weekend, will be  refreshed by hearing from workers who are doing their jobs without pay,  and we will find a way to get this government reopened. But we should  be very clear about the damage that has been done--the damage that has  been done in terms of how Americans view all of us, regardless of where  we are on this policy--and how Americans view our Federal Government  and how the rest of the world views us now that we have this shutdown  that I believe by tomorrow becomes the longest Federal Government  shutdown in American history. I hope and pray that we all--maybe in the  [[Page S162]]  aftermath--step back and find a way to make sure that people who pay  undue financial penalties because, through no fault of their own, the  government shut down are compensated; and that we can sort through the  complicated issues around contractors and those private businesses that  are around Federal facilities; that we try to come to some kind of  joint agreement, that never again will we use an unconnected policy  issue to hold hostage 800,000 folks who work for us and hundreds of  thousands of others--and, frankly, millions--who depend upon these  services going forward.   I may be being overly optimistic that somehow or other we will get  this resolved. If we do, we ought to find--those of us who are part of  the groups that find common accord--to put some marker down to never  ever do this again.   I have stories from a variety of Virginians here. I know the  Presiding Officer wants to get out of the Chair at 1 p.m. I ask  unanimous consent that these statements be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Rebecca in Chesapeake writes: ``. . . I just want my       husband to be able to go back to the work he loves and to       have stability for my family returned . . . The stress of not       knowing how long this will last is eating at both my husband       and me.''        Here's what Chad, furloughed NASA engineer from Suffolk,       told me: ``I'm disappointed to once again find myself barred       from doing the job that I love. I find the recent executive       order to freeze civil servant pay at 2018 levels, while on       furlough no less, to be shockingly disrespectful and wrong.''        Rosemarie in Falls Church shared this: ``My husband was       diagnosed last week with advanced lung cancer and now on top       of that stress, I have to worry about not getting a paycheck       . . .''        Lisa in Arlington writes: ``I am forced to look for       multiple part-time jobs to make ends meet and my savings will       soon run out. Creditors and landlords have only so much       patience with us.''        Here's how Joanna from Woodbridge put it: ``I love my job,       but being a pawn for those who have no compassion for me or       those I work beside is going to drive me and many, many       others out of public service.''     As somebody who has been in the private sector longer  than the public sector, like my friend the Senator from Virginia, we  both had the honor of being Governors of Virginia. We have both been in  executive positions. We have both been in positions where we had  workforces. As a business guy, you could tell how well the business  would do by how you treated your workforce. That is the most important  asset you have, your human capital.   If we think back on the past decade, we found ways, appropriately so,  for our military to get funded. We found ways, I think irresponsibly,  to dramatically cut our taxes, particularly for folks at the top. Every  time we had to try to make cutbacks. Where we made cutbacks has been in  what we call domestic discretionary, which in English are things like  the TSA, like air traffic controllers, like the Agriculture Department,  like the Coast Guard, and each year, whenever we find short cuts, we  cut those programs.   As a matter of fact, domestic discretionary spending is at the lowest  percentage it has been since the 1960s. So we asked all these folks who  were furloughed or being asked to work without pay, we asked them to do  more with less, which isn't great for the workforce morale.   Now we have a White House--and, my gosh, I wish somebody from the  White House could have sat there today. I would have loved for them to  try to explain how they ought to go back and negotiate with their  landlords about the rent due, or how they ought to make do with a side  job, or how they ought to do, as some folks were doing, as I was going  to report--some Virginians are selling their personal possessions on  eBay to pay the bills. The fact that this White House is willing to go  to the border for a political photo op--the President's words, not  mine--or get on television and blast his political opponents but not be  willing to send anyone from this administration to sit down and listen  to the concerns of our Federal workforce is disgraceful.   I again thank my colleague from Virginia for his great work on this.  I think it is appropriate that we are in session today raising these  issues. Think of the level of angst that is going to take place over  the next 48 hours as more and more people get those paychecks with zero  on it. We haven't seen anything yet. The kind of angst we felt in  Virginia, in Maryland, and the District, people will feel all over the  country.   We need to bring this government shutdown to an end. We need to put  our workforce back to work, and we need to make sure the services they  provide are being applied in a way to make our country safer and find a  way to make sure that never ever again will we use these folks' lives  as what they are being used right now--their words, not ours--political  pawns. They are more important, their jobs are more important, their  lives are more important than the way they have been treated over these  last 21 days.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
