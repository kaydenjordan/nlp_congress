 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I am so  proud of him and his leadership as the ranking member on the Budget  Committee.   I am so sorry that the Speaker left the floor because I have some  very good news for him. Clearly, he does not understand what the  Affordable Care Act has brought to our country in terms of expanding  benefits, lowering costs, and expanding the access of many more people  to the promise of our founders, of life, liberty, and the pursuit of  happiness, a healthier life, and the freedom to pursue their happiness.   I understand why the Speaker may want to concentrate on some  mythology that he presented about the Affordable Care Act, because he  is not going to focus on what this bill on the floor does today, and  the Republican budget. It does not create more good-paying jobs, or  raise wages. It does not invest in infrastructure to rebuild  our Nation.    The Republican plan does not invest in the education of our children  or the lifetime learning of working people. It does not help Americans  find balance between work and family. It does not reduce the deficit.  In fact, it increases the deficit. And it does not seek to drain the  swamp of secret money from our elections.   Instead, the Republicans are feeding their ideological obsession with  repealing the ACA and dismantling the health and economic security of  hardworking families.   We all know that a budget should be a statement of our values. What  is important to us as a nation should be reflected in our budget  proposals. I always say: Show me your values, show me your budget.   Well, you heard me say some of what this budget does not do. As we  get further into the next stage of the budget, we will see that what  their budget does is just broaden, widen the disparity in income in our  country, give tax breaks to the high end. And part of their tax breaks  for the high end is to repeal the Affordable Care Act so they can  eliminate the tax on those who are helping to fund the Affordable Care  Act.   So let me just talk about the Affordable Care Act for a while,  because one of the things that the public should know is that the ACA,  Medicare, and Medicaid, are now wed. If you mess with the ACA, it  directly impacts these other important initiatives, Medicare and  Medicaid.   The Republicans have never supported Medicare. They opposed it at its  origin and, over time, continued to oppose it.                                time  1230    In the nineties, their Speaker, Newt Gingrich, said Medicare should  wither on the vine. Their Speaker, Paul Ryan, has in his budget  removing the guarantee of Medicare for our seniors. Remove the  guarantee. That means you get a voucher and you go shop for Medicare in  this nonexistent health plan that they put forth.   Republicans talk about how they are going to repeal and replace. It  is interesting illustratively, but not realistic in terms of the fact  that, for 6 years, they have had a chance to propose an alternative. We  have seen nothing.   What we have seen is cut and run. They want to cut benefits and run.  They want to cut savings and run. They want to cut access and run. They  want to cut Medicare and run. They want to cut Medicaid and run. The  list goes on and on. They want to cut jobs. We will lose 3 million jobs  if they have their way with their nonexistent cut-and-run plan on the  Affordable Care Act.   Let's talk about the relationship between ACA and Medicare and  Medicaid. Hospitals will be devastated under the ACA repeal because  they will be left with uncompensated care.   One of the challenges to hospitals was that they must care for people  who come in and don't have the ability to pay. With the Affordable Care  Act, we now take care of that. That alleviates the cost to corporate  America or those who are providing health benefits to their workers,  adding between $1,000 and $3,000 a year per policy because they are  carrying the uncompensated care cost. The Affordable Care Act  alleviates that.   The reality is, as Mr. Neal, our new ranking member on the Ways and  Means Committee, has said, Medicaid is now a health program that  crosses the economic spectrum. It is not just for the poor. People  think of Medicaid as a poor people initiative--no. It enables mothers  to work their way out of poverty by providing affordable coverage for  their children--yes.   It enables people with disabilities to get the care needed to live  and work in the community, and it provides critical nursing home care  for middle class elderly who have spent down their savings and have no  other alternatives. As Mr. Neal says, Grandma is going to be living in  the guest room or in the attic or in the basement if you cannot have  nursing home care.   This is very important to families because we want a budget that  enables people to have good-paying jobs, increase their paycheck so  that they can afford their home, address the aspirations of their  children, and have a dignified retirement. If they have to care for  their aging parents, they do less for  [[Page H502]]  their children. This assault on Medicaid is an assault on the financial  stability of families across the board, whatever their age.   Furthermore, Medicaid is one of best tools to fight addiction. We  made a big deal about our opioid legislation. Americans who previously  did not have access to health care and, therefore, self-medicated with  opioids and other painkillers are able to access diagnosis, treatment,  and pain management. Medicaid provides real care for the addiction and  underlying condition to turn for the better for individuals and their  families and the community. The list goes on and on.   The jobs issue. In most of your communities, healthcare providers,  hospitals, et cetera, are the biggest employers. They won't be anymore.  Millions of jobs will be lost.   Mr. Pallone, our ranking member on Energy and Commerce, another  committee of jurisdiction, keeps making that point. Why are you being,  he says, ideological about this when the practical effect is about the  economic security of our families? I thank Mr. Pallone for that.   Mr. Bobby Scott, the ranking member on the Education and the  Workforce Committee shows what happens to States if you overturn the  Affordable Care Act. In his own State of Virginia, he can give  testimony to the increased cost to the State or lack of meeting the  healthcare needs of constituents.   The ACA guards and strengthens the health care and economic security  of every American, no matter where he or she gets health insurance. It  delivers transformational progress in terms of coverage, quality, and  cost.   Much has been said about the fact that more than 20 million people  now have access to affordable health care. This is a wonderful and  remarkable thing, but that is only part of the story.   Every American who has access to health care benefits from this. Most  Americans receive their health benefits in the workplace. If you do,  you now cannot be discriminated against because of a preexisting  medical condition.   You cannot be discriminated against if you are a woman. No longer is  being a woman a preexisting medical condition, which means you paid  more if you are a woman.   No longer can the insurance companies levy lifetime limits for a  preexisting condition that you may have or even for the care that you  are getting on a new basis. The list goes on and on.   Do you know how many people have a preexisting medical condition?  There are 100 million families affected by preexisting conditions, such  as if your child is born prematurely.   I, myself, have five children. Long ago, insurance companies said to  me: You are a poor risk because you have had five children. I said: I  thought that was a sign of my strength. I didn't know that you were  measuring it as a weakness.   Any excuse would have done, but not with the Affordable Care Act. It  stands there as a pillar of economic and health security. It stands  there as a pillar of economic security like Social Security, Medicare,  and Medicaid, which, again, the Republicans and Newt Gingrich opposed  in the 1990s and said would wither on the vine. In his budget, Paul  Ryan takes away the guarantee. But it is a pillar of economic and  health security.   So the proposal today increases the deficit, does not create jobs,  undermines the health security of the American people, and does not do  much in any regard to address the challenges I posed in the beginning.  It is no wonder they want to talk about the Affordable Care Act. They  have nothing to recommend in their budget resolution.    The GOP's repeal plan will raise premiums. Mr. Chairman, the rate of  growth of healthcare costs in our country has been greatly diminished  by the Affordable Care Act. In the more than 50 years that they have  been measuring the rate of growth, it has never been slower than now.   Repeal will create chaos that will echo in the health coverage and  costs of every American. Chaos is the order of the day for them.   The American people will not be dragged back to the days when an  illness or injury meant financial ruin, that you might not get a job  because someone in your family was ill and was going to raise the cost  of health care in a company that might hire you, that you could lose  your home. Most bankruptcies spring because of not being able to pay  medical bills.   In short, we will not allow the Republicans to make America sick  again. I urge a ``no'' vote on this unfortunate resolution.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I thank Whip Hoyer for yielding and for  calling attention to the serious loss the House will suffer with Mary  Frances leaving.   The first thing that I am inclined to say is: Mary Frances, say it  isn't so. We so depend on your wisdom, your knowledge, your judgment,  your advice, and guidance on all of the issues that the distinguished  whip has mentioned.   The appreciation for Mary Frances goes well beyond the whip's office,  throughout the leadership, and our caucus and, I think, across the  aisle, certainly across the Capitol.   I was hoping in the last couple of days that the decision might be  reversed, but Mary Frances, we wish her well. We are not sending her,  Mr. Hoyer, to the Senate. She is going to the Senate. But it is  wonderful to know that the Senate will be blessed with her great  leadership, knowledge, wisdom, judgment, and beautiful temperament.   Mary Frances, thank you. Don't be a stranger to us. We look forward  to continuing our work together to preserve our planet, to create jobs  in our country, to do so many things that are a part of your values and  our values.
