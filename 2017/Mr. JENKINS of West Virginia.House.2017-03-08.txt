 Mr. Speaker, I want to say thank you to  [[Page H1940]]  Mr. Frelinghuysen for the outstanding work and effort that he has put  into this critically important piece of legislation, and I thank  Chairwoman Granger for her strong support in advancing this much-needed  legislation.   The people before me have talked so eloquently about our  responsibility as Members of Congress to defend and protect our Nation.  We have talked about national security. We have talked about troops. We  have talked about battling terrorism. And that is what this bill does.   I want to take a slightly different approach and say something about  what this bill does in all of our communities, not just distant lands  around the world, but in our home communities. I want to highlight one  area that will make a real difference in all of our communities, and  that is the National Guard's Counterdrug Program.   This program is essential in detecting, disrupting, and curtailing  drug trafficking. It provides resources to almost every State and  territory to help train personnel and run counterdrug missions. The  National Guard supports almost 60,000 requests a year for assistance  from local law enforcement agencies.    In fiscal year 2014, National Guard counterdrug programs took almost  $12 billion in illegal drugs off the street. This minor investment is  paying major dividends. During NDAA consideration, I helped secure an  amendment to increase funding for this account by $30 million because  this program works.   This legislation under consideration today also increases funding for  this vital program by $135 million more than the amount requested by  then-President Obama. This is a critical moment in combating the drug  crisis, and we must fully fund every program that will help us solve  it.
