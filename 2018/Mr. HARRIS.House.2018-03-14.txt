 Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on the topic of my  Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, next Tuesday, March 20, the Supreme Court  will hear oral arguments for the case NIFLA v. Becerra. At issue is a  California law that requires medically licensed pro-life pregnancy  centers to advertise for and to promote the abortion industry by  posting notices alerting clients that the State of California provides  free or low-cost abortions.  [[Page H1589]]    This law blatantly violates the Free Speech Clause of the First  Amendment. The government may never compel anyone, including pregnancy  centers, to make statements with which they disagree. This is clearly  and blatantly unconstitutional, and courts across the Nation agree.   When abortionists sought to compel the speech of pregnancy centers in  other jurisdictions, their laws were not allowed to stand. In fact, in  2009, in my home State of Maryland, a Baltimore city ordinance required  pregnancy centers to post signs in their waiting rooms stating that  they do not refer for abortions. This January, the Fourth Circuit Court  of Appeals ruled unanimously that this law is unconstitutional. Judge  Wilkinson said that the ordinance compels ``a politically and  religiously motivated group to convey a message fundamentally at odds  with its core belief and its mission.''   Similar laws have been tried in Austin, Texas; Montgomery County,  Maryland; and New York City. These laws, too, have been partially or  fully invalidated. Even the California law in question has already been  found to violate freedom of speech.   While the Federal case was advancing to the Supreme Court, a parallel  track was being pursued at the State level. In October of last year,  Judge Gloria Trask found that the law violated article I, section 2 of  the California Constitution. In fact, she granted an injunction that  prevents California from enforcing the law. She said the ``speech  required by the FACT Act is unquestionably compelled and content  based.'' It forces the clinic to point the way to the abortion clinic  and can leave patients with the belief that they were referred to an  abortion clinic provider by that pro-life pregnancy center.                                time  1815    Now, instead of seeking to silence pro-life pregnancy centers, people  in every community should celebrate and support their work. They  provide vital free or low-cost care to vulnerable women and children.  So today we are here to talk about how pro-life pregnancy centers help  mothers in our communities, giving them real choice.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa),  who organized this Special Order with me, for comments he might make.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for  his comments.   Mr. Speaker, we need to remind people that these pro-life pregnancy  centers are private entities. They run on private donations. They  provide services at no charge to these mothers. In some pregnancy  centers--a lot of them, for instance--they will have a room that is  just full of supplies, supplies to help a mother, to help a mother in a  crisis pregnancy get through the pregnancy, take care of that child,  and to give that child the very precious gift of life.   Mr. Speaker, I would next yield to the gentleman from Michigan for  comments he might make on the importance of pregnancy centers. While he  is getting to the microphone, let me just tell you a story that one of  the pregnancy crisis centers told me. Again, these are centers that  frequently now provide ultrasound exams.   And they tell me the story of a woman who called the helpline seeking  an abortion, actually. She called the pregnancy center helpline. She  knew very little about the emotional, physical, or spiritual  repercussions of the choice she was considering. She felt alone, told  by her boyfriend to ``get rid of it'' or he was gone.   But the pregnancy center gave her a choice. They scheduled an  appointment. She came for the appointment. And after seeing her 9-week- old baby's heartbeat and it move about playfully in her womb, she  decided to give this child the gift of life.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Michigan for his  comments. He brings up a good point. These pregnancy centers don't only  help mothers and give them choices; they actually help the fathers as  well. A lot of times these fathers just don't know what fatherhood will  be like, and they mentor these fathers and, again, begin to give that  couple the ability to create a loving household for that child.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman)  to also speak on this topic.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arkansas for  those words in support of these pro-life pregnancy centers. Tonight we  are going to hear, during this hour, from some of the real leaders of  the pro-life movement; but, in this case, we should really call this  the pro-choice movement because that is what these pregnancy centers  actually do: they give women a real choice.   A lot of women who come to these pregnancy centers, of course, are  pressured or expect that they can't bring these pregnancies to  fulfillment, to the birth of a new life. And these pregnancy centers  give them the choice to do that. They provide the resources, the  support, the mentoring, the prayers that these difficult pregnancies  need.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King), a pro- life leader, to speak about these crisis pregnancy centers.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Iowa for those  touching comments. Again, this is about giving mothers choices.   You know, one has to ask the question: Why in the world don't  abortion clinics show ultrasounds? What are they afraid of? Are they  afraid of giving a woman a real choice, of actually seeing that baby,  of denying the fact that it is not a blob of tissue, it is actually a  baby with a heartbeat?   It is a baby that moves. It is your child. But they don't get that  choice in an abortion clinic. They get it at a crisis pregnancy center.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Arrington) for  his remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for those  comments. He is absolutely right. No matter where you stand on the  issue of abortion, you should stand with the First Amendment on the  right of an individual not to have their speech compelled by the  government; and that is what at stake in this court case.   I want to just thank God that we have a President who understands the  importance of these constitutional bases, and one who, I believe, will  nominate Justices to the Supreme Court who will continue to uphold the  First Amendment and the other amendments to the Constitution.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs.  Hartzler), a pro-life leader in the House of Representatives.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs.  Hartzler) for her comments.  [[Page H1592]]    Just to remind people, you know, there are things you find in a  crisis pregnancy center you just don't find in your local Planned  Parenthood. Almost all of them will have a room where donated  clothing--clothing that, you know, most of it used. Yeah, that is the  way it is. People who have had children, their children are grown. They  will donate their clothing to a pregnancy center to help those mothers  who need help, mothers who perhaps feel they can't financially afford  to have a child because they have to buy clothing for a child, they  have to buy diapers. These pregnancy centers give them a real choice.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms.  Foxx), another pro-life leader in the House of Representatives.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from North Carolina  for comments.   Again, just reminding, as the gentlewoman said, these are centers  that provide true resources to women at a time when they are very, very  vulnerable. I can't imagine why a city council or a State legislature,  or any jurisdiction, or any legislature would want to--what amounts  to--close these centers down, because these are people who believe  abortion is wrong.                                time  1845    They are not going to refer people for abortions. That is the bottom  line. They will close their doors before they will send someone to  something that they think is morally reprehensible, and the last thing  the State should do is compel them to ever do that. Why we would want  to close these centers down that are so vital to our communities is a  puzzle to me.   Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Washington (Mr. Newhouse) for his comments.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from  Washington for those comments. He points out that each of our districts  have numerous pregnancy centers, usually. In fact, crisis pregnancy  centers outnumber abortion clinics three to one. These are valuable  resources in anyone's district, in any town, any county.   What is at issue here is, if you had a nonprofit running a recreation  center in your neighborhood and it provided resources to troubled  teenagers after school, this would be like the State telling that  recreation center, ``Do you know what? You have got to promote a  certain religion in your recreation center,'' or, ``Do you know what?  You have got to put out certain political pamphlets of one political  party on your desk when people come in the door.'' We would be incensed  with that. This is exactly what California is attempting to do with  this law to these pro-life crisis pregnancy centers.   With that, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Williams) for his comments.  [[Page H1593]]         Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas and, again,  remind everyone that these are such valuable resources in their towns  and their neighborhoods.   I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Johnson).   One thing about Congress is we have people with all different areas  of expertise, but on this particular issue, the gentleman from  Louisiana brings particular expertise because of his background as a  lawyer and one who has defended religious liberty in courtrooms here in  the United States, protecting that very important right given to us in  the First Amendment that is at issue, at issue in this California case.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana not  only for those excellent remarks, but for bringing this kind of  expertise to the House of Representatives.   Now I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Smith).   Mr. Smith is a leader in protecting human rights around the world,  from the U.S. House of Representatives, a leader in protecting life  and, in this case, giving his remarks about how important pro-life  pregnancy centers are to our Nation and our communities and how  damaging this law would be.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from New  Jersey very much for his comments.   It is a shame that here in the United States, with the freedoms that  we have guaranteed in our Constitution, that this even has to come  before a court. It is so clear that it is unconstitutional to compel  speech against someone's beliefs--political, religious beliefs. These  are what our Nation is founded on, and to compel these clinics to do  this is something that shouldn't even enter the thoughts of anyone.   Again, we would never compel any other nonprofit existing on  donations and the neighborhood providing things to people in those  neighborhoods and communities. We wouldn't think of compelling, again,  political speech. We wouldn't think of compelling religious activity.   Yet, here, California attempts to compel these volunteers, these  clinics, who work on providing such a valuable choice to the women in  their community, to essentially refer for an abortion that is against  all the deeply held beliefs of these individuals.   Mr. Speaker, I want to read the stories of some of the women who go  to these clinics, because this really is about choice. This is about  institutions in a community that offer true choice. Now, these are  stories from the pregnancy centers in my community.   So let me first tell you about Miranda. Mr. Speaker, 19-year-old  Miranda came to this pregnancy center with her boyfriend and learned  she was 9 weeks pregnant. Miranda worked 9 hours a day as a cashier at  a Home Depot. She, honestly, was not happy with the positive results of  her test. She didn't think she could raise a baby, and nobody had any  faith in her.   You see, a year earlier, Miranda had had an abortion. She still cries  at the recollection and feels the pain of what she had done. She didn't  want to make that choice again, but her circumstances hadn't changed,  and she felt that that is what she had to do.   Now, the volunteer counselor praised Miranda for working full time  and getting her GED. The volunteer counselor explained how Miranda  could obtain healthcare, and how that clinic's Earn While You Learn  Program would educate her on prenatal care and parenting, as well as  provide her with much-needed baby supplies once the baby was born.   Then Miranda saw the fetal models depicting a 9-week-old fetus. She  couldn't believe what she was seeing. She asked so many questions,  like: When does the heart start beating? Would it be possible for her  to hear the beating heart? When does the baby start kicking?   You see, Miranda explained that the abortion clinic she had been to a  year before never told her about the development of the baby. She had  been 15 weeks pregnant at the time she aborted.   It was so surprising for her to see the truth in those baby models.  Nobody ever told her that her baby had been so fully developed. Miranda  said that the best part about coming to the pregnancy center was that  they ``told her she could do it.'' You see, she had never heard that  before. Nobody had ever told her that. She had a real choice now.   Here is a story about Laura. When Laura came to the center 2 years  ago, she was feeling nauseated and miserable. The timing of her  pregnancy couldn't be worse. She had recently discovered that her  mother had been diagnosed with late stage liver disease.   Laura, too, was post-abortive. Her previous abortion was a terrible  experience that left her emotionally scarred, of course, as it leaves  many women.   She didn't want to have another abortion, but felt she had no choice.  She wanted to be there for her mom during her mother's time of need.    Now, the volunteer advocate in the clinic spent lots of time just  listening to Laura. It became clear that Laura  [[Page H1595]]  really wanted to keep her baby but was lost in trying to figure out  how.   Mr. Speaker, this is a recurring story in these pregnancy centers.  There is a reason why they used to be called crisis pregnancy centers.  These are women frequently in crisis who want to have that choice but  don't see the way out of their circumstances.   Well, this counselor helped Laura navigate through the muddy waters  of her life and envision a future with her child.   Soon, Laura's fear began to subside. A sonogram revealed a 7-week-old  baby. In a tearful voice, Laura said: ``That is my baby.''   Since then, Laura has returned to the center weekly, participating in  their prenatal education classes. She actually moved in with her mother  so she could help her through her illness. Laura's hope is that her mom  will be strong enough to hold the baby and spend her last days on Earth  with her grandchild.   Mr. Speaker, that is the kind of hope that pregnancy centers give  women and their families. And, often, two lives are saved in these  pregnancy centers: the child's and the mother's.   An unplanned pregnancy can provide an opportunity and inspiration for  a woman to get her life back on track; in these two cases, to actually  start the family. A pregnancy can give a woman a reason to live, to  take care of that child; a reason to go back to school to finish her  education, as we heard about Miranda; a reason to reconcile with her  family.   As a father of five, and everyone who has been a parent knows this:  we know how parenthood truly fundamentally transforms a person well  before the child is born.   From the time you know that you are going to have a new baby in the  family, as well as every moment afterward, life is precious, life is  priceless. Pregnancy centers support women during every step of that  journey of providing a new life, a gift from God.   Mr. Speaker, next week, the Court will hear a case that perhaps  threatens the very existence of crisis pregnancy centers and pro-life  pregnancy centers in the United States. I hope that those nine Justices  have the wisdom to see that, in America, that a jurisdiction--whether  it is California or Baltimore, Montgomery County, or Austin, Texas, or  any jurisdiction--that has tried to compel speech in these pregnancy  centers is violating our constitutional rights and, worse than that, is  really affecting valuable resources in our community, the most valuable  resource a woman with a crisis pregnancy can have.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
