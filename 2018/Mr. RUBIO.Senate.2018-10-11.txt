 Mr. President, due to Hurricane Michael's direct  hit on Florida's panhandle, I am traveling to northwest Florida to  survey the devastation that has occurred in my home State. Yesterday,  Hurricane Michael made landfall as a devastating, high-end Category 4  hurricane, near Mexico Beach. Initial reports indicate more than  400,000 utility customers in Florida are without power and areas within  the storm's path have been decimated.   Therefore, given these circumstances and the fact that my vote would  not have been determinative of the outcome of the measures before the  Senate, I will survey the damage firsthand and help coordinate efforts  between Federal, State, and local officials.                            ____________________
