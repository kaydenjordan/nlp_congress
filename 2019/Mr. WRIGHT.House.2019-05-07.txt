 Mr. Speaker, so now that the Trump economy is soaring and  setting job growth records following the one-two punch of regulatory  reform and tax cuts, some of my Democrat colleagues want to give Barack  Obama the credit.   Well, this is laughable. This was the President who refused to accept  responsibility for anything that went wrong for 8 years, instead  blaming it on President George W. Bush. Remember?   Not anemic job growth, government overreach, doubling the national  debt, Benghazi, and incompetent foreign policy. Now they want to take  credit for the great things happening in this country 28 months into  the Trump Presidency.   Sorry, you don't get to do that.   This is an outrage. It is wrong; it is demonstrably false; and it  won't work. The American people are not stupid.                            ____________________
