 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this  legislation, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act.   I know that some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will  be arguing, and have been arguing, that there is no reason for this  bill, that we already have a law on the books to protect children who  are born alive.   I was here back in 2002 when the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of  2002 was enacted. However, that law did not criminalize the actions of  abortionists who deny care to babies who survive abortions. Not only do  abortion providers not provide care to children who are born alive,  some are known to actively prevent their lives from proceeding.   This legislation not only requires appropriate care to be given to  any child who survives an attempted abortion, but it also establishes  strong criminal penalties for violating such a requirement.   I believe it is important to note that the mother of a child is in no  way being prosecuted under this legislation, and women are not being  targeted.   On this 45th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, I ask my colleagues to  support this legislation.
