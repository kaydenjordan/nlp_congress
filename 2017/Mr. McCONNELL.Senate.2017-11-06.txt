 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  of November 2, which notwithstands rule XXII, be modified to have all  executive session cloture motions ripen following the disposition of  the Gibson nomination; further, that if cloture is invoked on the Engel  nomination, the time postcloture be counted as if invoked at 5:30 p.m.  on Monday.    Mr. President, for most Americans, a church is a place  of worship and love, a place where the faithful go to feel mercy and  compassion, which is why what happened in Texas yesterday is so  difficult for many to comprehend. Why would an individual do this?  Families lost so much. Our hearts go out to them in this time of untold  grief. Our gratitude goes out to the civilians and first responders who  answer the call when others are in need.   As we continue to learn the details of yesterday's tragic events, I,  along with all Members of the Senate, will keep the victims of this  tragedy and their families in my prayers.   Mr. President, on a completely different matter, last Monday I said  the Senate would confirm four excellent judicial nominees by the end of  the week. That is just what we did--Amy Barrett, confirmed; Joan  Larsen, confirmed; Allison Eid, confirmed; Stephanos Bibas, confirmed.   After 8 years of a President who selected judges based upon an  ideological litmus test designed to find nominees who favor certain  groups or individuals over others, we now have a President who is  sending over nominees who will ensure that the judiciary is actually  living up to the role we expect in our democracy: treating everyone  equally, giving every litigant a fair shake, applying the law as it is  actually written, not as the judge wishes it might be. The four circuit  court nominees the Senate confirmed last week will do just that.   Democrats have put up a lot of procedural roadblocks to prevent the  Senate from moving forward all year. We have moved ahead anyway. As a  result, despite all the obstacles from the other side, we are making  significant progress.   Of course, none of this would be possible without the hard work and  notable leadership of Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, and  I want to thank him again for everything he has done.   We are not finished yet. We are going to keep pressing forward on  judicial nominees. We are going to keep confirming the other nominees  before us as well.   This week the Senate will consider some of President Trump's other  qualified nominees for various positions throughout the Federal  Government. Each of these individuals will help lead their agencies to  fulfill their particular mission in running the government.   First, we will advance the nomination of Steven Engel to serve as  Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel. Mr. Engel  previously worked in the OLC, having done so under President Bush. He  also served as Deputy Assistant Attorney General  [[Page S7006]]  and counsel to the Assistant Attorney General. He obviously has a lot  of experience advising senior policymakers on a wide variety of legal  issues facing the executive branch. That is good because the role he  has been nominated to has the responsibility for providing legal advice  to the executive branch on all constitutional questions and reviewing  pending legislation for constitutionality.   I look forward to advancing Mr. Engel's nomination tomorrow so that  he can begin putting his experience to work for our country as soon as  possible, and then we will turn to the various other nominees before us  so they can begin doing the same. Confirming the President's nominees  is an important part of the Senate's business, and I urge all of our  colleagues to work together so we can get this done.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate a dear  friend whom I have known for more than 30 years, Dr. John Logan III, of  Henderson, KY. John was recently honored by his community for a  lifetime of servant leadership. The city dedicated a plaque on the  Henderson Riverwalk, which is one of the many landmarks that John had  an indispensable hand in building and one I was proud to work with him  to help secure. In a surprise ceremony--John thought he was simply  going to lunch with a friend--they honored him for decades of  philanthropy and service to his community.   The plaque includes a quote from author Margaret Mead, which reads,  ``Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can  change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.'' These  words perfectly encapsulate the impact of my friend John.   John serves as the chief medical officer of the Methodist Hospital in  Henderson, where he started working in 1962 specializing in family  medicine. A number of years ago, John embarked on a mission to  highlight the extraordinary history of the hospital. Because of his  tireless work, the successes of this Henderson institution will  continue to be remembered for years to come. In addition to his work  caring for patients and leading the administration of the hospital,  John gives of himself to other aspects of the community.   In 1971, John joined the Family YMCA's capital campaign, working to  help the group move from its old home downtown to a much larger  facility on 5 acres of land. He has continued to work with the YMCA,  making sure that young people in Henderson have a well-equipped  facility to enjoy and grow. John also helped establish other community  initiatives, including Henderson's Depot Welcome Center and the  Methodist Hospital's Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.   In 2012, the Henderson Community College board of directors presented  John with an award recognizing his substantial service to the school.  Through the years, John has taken a keen interest in the students. He  worked with State legislators and community leaders to raise $1 million  to support scholarships to the college and to build a fine arts center.  His impact will be felt by students for years to come.   John has spent his life giving to others--his community, the  Methodist Hospital, and his friends. So many of the projects in  Henderson would not have been possible without John's dedicated  leadership, and I am immensely proud to call him my friend. His decades  of service have truly made Henderson and Kentucky a better place.   I ask all of my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to the  selfless work of Dr. John Logan, a remarkable Kentuckian and a  wonderful friend.   Mr. President, The Gleaner in Henderson recently published an article  on John's career of service. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the  article be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     [From the Gleaner, Oct. 26, 2017]       Dr. John Logan Honored for Lifetime of Community Volunteerism                             (By Douglas White)         It's hard to name a community institution in Henderson that       Dr. John Logan hasn't helped or been part of creating.        So when it came time to honor his decades of organizing,       cheerleading and fundraising for the Henderson community as a       whole, city officials picked perhaps the most scenic spot       he's had a hand in bringing to reality.        ``Every day he wakes up and works to make this community       better,'' said Dr. Lee Newberry, one of Logan's colleagues at       Methodist Hospital, as a plaque was dedicated Tuesday       afternoon at the Seventh Street overlook on the Henderson       Riverwalk.        ``He's a true example of a servant leader.''        Newberry and other speakers at the event offered a long       list of community projects, programs and buildings that Logan       has helped make happen.        A few examples include the modern YMCA facilities, the fine       arts center on the campus of Henderson Community College, the       downtown Depot building, St. Anthony's Hospice, Colonels to       College, the Sandefur Center, and currently in the works, the       new 1-69 bridge over the Ohio River.        Attorney David Thomason noted, ``Many of those things       wouldn't have happened if it hadn't been for John.''        Thomason recalled how Logan pushed for, and got, money       inserted into the state budget for Henderson's fine arts       center. It came literally at the midnight hour, but with a       catch: Henderson would have to find a way to contribute       $200,000 to make the bonding a reality.        When asked, in the middle of the night, if Logan could make       it happen, he replied quickly: ``You're damned right!''        ``He never met a challenge he didn't embrace,'' said       Thomason. ``Once he's on board, the ship doesn't sink. In my       opinion, he has done more than any other volunteer in the       past 50 years.''                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 3031, which was received  from the House.
