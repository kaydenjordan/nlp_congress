 Mr. Speaker, I am intrigued listening to my  colleagues waxing eloquent about the divine creation of the District of  Columbia. Give me a break. It was old-fashioned horse trading between  Hamilton, Madison, and Jefferson like the declaration of enslaved  people being three-fifths of a person without being able to vote for  themselves, just simply power for White people.   It is time to recognize the reality of what I think was a corrupt  bargain and give the District of Columbia the statehood it deserves.
