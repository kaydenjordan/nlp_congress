 Mr. President, I come to the floor today, the day  before we will be voting on a piece of legislation to deal with relief  for people, for a country, dealing with coronavirus. I come to the  floor today as Americans are looking to us, the U.S. Senate, to provide  relief in this ongoing battle against this disease.   Republicans, as you well know, are offering a path forward. That is  what the American people want. They want a path forward. So tomorrow,  the Senate Republicans will move a targeted bill, a bill to help people  get back to work, to help kids get back to school, and to deal with and  put the disease in the rearview mirror.  [[Page S5503]]    It is interesting, in watching all of the things that unfold in the  U.S. Senate and in the Chamber, that Democrats continue to be playing  political games. The Democratic leaders in the House, as well as the  Senate, have held up this round of coronavirus relief just as they held  up the last round of coronavirus relief.   You say: Where is the roadblock? Well, I will tell you. Senator  Schumer and Speaker Pelosi have been the roadblocks to relief for the  American public. The Speaker has demanded a multi-trillion-dollar blank  check to pursue her liberal agenda. It is a liberal wish list, no  strings attached. You can go through all of the things that she has  asked for. Even the New York Times said it was a liberal wish list, and  that is the New York Times realizing that it wasn't a serious piece of  legislation.   Yet, just last week, when Speaker Pelosi was asked about it and all  of the things that are in it, she said: ``We're not budging.'' Her  statement: ``We're not budging.''   At the same time, as you look at what is happening in the country,  Presidential nominee Joe Biden seems to be, ever so slowly, coming out  of his hiding place in the basement. His answer to coronavirus, when  the press asked him about this a week or so ago when he just edged out  of the basement just a little bit, he said he would shut down the  entire country again.   That is not what they want in Wyoming. That is not what they want in  your State, Mr. Presiding Officer. That would be a recipe for disaster.  But that is what the former Vice President, the nominee of the Democrat  Party, has said he would do: shut down the country again. We have seen,  time and time again, Democrat leaders shrink in the face of adversity.  Republicans are facing challenges head-on.   It was interesting that, a couple of weeks ago during the Democrat  convention, Joe Biden didn't even mention the violence that was  plaguing Democrat-run cities all across the country. Not a single one  of the Democrat speakers at their convention mentioned the destruction  and the looting and the rioting and the violence. Democrat mayors,  Democrat Governors, through their words and their actions, are  encouraging these riots that are destroying our cities. They have  surrendered to the leftwing mob, and, as a result, violent anarchists  rule the streets in a number of the cities run by liberal mayors   In Portland, OR, police officers have been viciously attacked for 100  days. Innocent people have been murdered in cold blood. We have seen  small businesses looted, torched--a lifetime of work up in flames.   Democrat mayors are tying the hands of law enforcement, it appears to  me, and liberal city officials are defunding the police, calling to  defund the police, voting to defund the police. Clearly, they have  refused to allow the police to do their job. It is an incredibly  dangerous situation, and it is a complete lack of leadership by  Democrats.   Republicans would defend, not defund, the police. The burning, the  looting, the rioting--this must stop. People are fleeing the liberal  cities, and they want to move to States like ours. Even some Democrat  mayors are fleeing their own homes. Portland's mayor is moving out of  his condo building to escape the riots. St. Louis's mayor has  temporarily relocated from her home, and the mayor of Chicago,  interestingly enough, has banned protests on her block while doing  nothing to protect the rest of the city, where the number of fatalities  and where violence and murder are breaking records at an alltime high.   People expect their elected leaders to keep them safe, but, really,  the Democrats need to get their priorities right. They don't have them  right. Americans need safety and security so they can get back to a  normal routine in their lives.   There really is some good news to report, and that is both with  regard to coronavirus and with regard to the economy. Last week, the  Wall Street Journal reported that coronavirus is starting to retreat,  that positivity rates fell 40 percent from July, that hospitalizations  were down 60 percent, and the good news is that researchers are  reporting that they are on track to produce a safe, effective vaccine  in record time.   As a doctor, I will tell you this truly is record time when I think  of how long it took--years and years--for vaccines to be developed.  Now, we are not out of the woods yet, but we are making significant  progress and moving ahead at warp speed.   That is one of the things that is going to be on the floor tomorrow  with this vote, as we work to get people back to work and kids back to  school and the virus behind us, is more money and effort for testing  and for treatment and for vaccine development and distribution.   The economic news is good. Joe Biden says he would shut down the  country again, and this country is opening up and doing remarkably  well. The economy added nearly 1.4 million jobs in August alone, 10  million new jobs in the last 4 months. The unemployment rate fell to  below 9 percent--8.4 percent. That is down from a pandemic high of  close to 15 percent.   It is interesting. The experts had it all wrong. The experts said  that, heading into the fall, we would have an unemployment rate at over  16 percent. It is now down to 8.4. I compare this to the economic  recovery that took so long when President Obama and Vice President  Biden were running the economy. We had an unemployment rate of over 9  percent for 30 months in a row--over 9 percent for over 30 months. This  time, with the unemployment rate, we are already below 9 percent at  8.4.   So the economy is rebounding, the virus is receding, but still there  is hardship around the country, and that is why we will tomorrow vote  on the floor of the U.S. Senate to deal with the needs of the American  people; yet Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats in Congress remain focused  on a different agenda, and I believe their misguided priorities will  hurt, not help, Americans.   It is interesting, when I listen to the Speaker of the House, even  over 100 Democrats wrote her and openly commented that they should be  able to be allowed to vote on a targeted piece of legislation. She  refused to listen to them.   But we were home for the last period, listening to folks all around  my State and your State, and what did we hear them say? They said: We  still need help with paycheck protection for our small businesses so  they can continue to make payroll. Nancy Pelosi says no. Chuck Schumer  says no.   They said: We want to get our kids back to school so we can go back  to work and our kids will not fall so far behind. Nancy Pelosi has said  no. My concern is that, tomorrow, Chuck Schumer will say no as well.   People at home said: We need a vaccine. We need more testing. We need  treatments. It sounds like, tomorrow, the Democrats may say no to that  as well.   I look at the list of the things that the Democrats are proposing:  more money for sanctuary cities, direct payment checks to illegal  immigrants, issues relating to immigration and customs enforcement.  That is just the tip of the iceberg. At the same time, with their  misplaced priorities, they are blocking justice reform. They did that  to the Tim Scott justice reform bill that every one of the Republicans  cosponsored. They blocked it and refused to even allow it to come to  the floor for discussion. They are ignoring crime.   Clearly, the leftwing of the Democratic Party has taken the wheel and  has taken a sharp left turn and is headed right off a cliff.   The Democrats' misguided priorities lie in stark contrast with  Republicans' forward-looking plan. We have targeted coronavirus relief.  It is a bill that will help our students, will help our workers, will  help our families, will help people with the disease.   The Senate legislation sensibly extends small business paycheck  protection support to help keep people on the payroll. It ensures that  we beat the disease with the money that we have talked about. It gives  the schools the tools they need and continue to need to reopen smartly  and safely so our kids will not be left behind.   I come to the floor to say the contrast is clear. What we are hearing  from the opposite side of the aisle are empty Democrat promises, and  Republicans are delivering on ours. Senate Republicans are going to  stay focused on governing. We are going to do the  [[Page S5504]]  job the American people elected us to do.   The choice could not be clearer: Republicans on a path forward or  Democrats with their ongoing partisan obstruction.   I appreciate your time and your attention in this critical time as we  move forward with the bill that the American public is asking us to  pass, that we have Republicans supporting, that fills the needs and  responds directly to the needs of the American people. At the same time  tomorrow, we will see if the Democrats continue to obstruct or work  with us on the solution and a path forward for our Nation.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today to remember one of  Wyoming's most accomplished and beloved journalists. On Wednesday,  August 12, 2020, Kathleen ``Kathy'' Suzanne Brown passed away at the  age of 64. In her nearly 40 years as a reporter at the Gillette News  Record, Kathy had a profound impact on communities across northeast  Wyoming.   Kathy spent more than 20 years of her time at the News Record as a  sports reporter. She was notably the only female sports reporter in the  State for most of that time. Kathy was known for being an extremely  thorough reporter. She went above and beyond to profile a majority of  Campbell County's student athletes, whether or not they were the star  player.   When Kathy transitioned to being an education reporter in 2012, I  often had the privilege of speaking with her on my regular visits to  classrooms around Gillette. Kathy was a true professional, and it was  abundantly clear how much she cared for the students she wrote about.   Her dedication to journalistic excellence was recognized statewide on  multiple occasions. One of the biggest highlights of her career came in  2016, when the Wyoming Press Association named her its Veteran  Journalist of the Year. Kathy was also recognized by the Campbell  County School District, the Energy Classic Committee, the Wyoming  Education Association, and the Wyoming Historical Society for her  excellent work.   While her passing leaves a huge void in the Wyoming journalism  community, her legacy lives on through her more than four decades long  record of compelling and insightful stories.   Bobbi and I send our deepest condolences to Kathy's mother, Shirley  [[Page S5508]]  Brown; brothers, Tim, Ben, and John, as well as her newspaper family at  the Gillette News Record.   On August 14, 2020, Gillette News Record publisher and editor Ann  Turner published a moving tribute to Kathy on behalf of the entire News  Record staff who knew Kathy best. Ann's sentiments are shared by so  many in Gillette and Wyoming's journalism community. I ask unanimous  consent that this article be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:              [From the Gillette News Record, August 14, 2020]                   Longtime NR Reporter Kathy Brown Dies                              (By Ann Turner)         Few people in a community have the privilege of       intersecting with so many lives as a reporter.        No one in Gillette has done it recently as long and as well       as Kathy Brown, who was a reporter for the News Record for 37       years.        ``KB,'' as we called her, died Wednesday night in Casper at       the Central Wyoming Hospice and Transitions of complications       from cancer, a disease she had valiantly fought for the past       13 months. She was 64.        She had retired from the News Record in March after working       as a journalist for 41 years.        In a perfect world, there would have been a proper send-      off, a party or an open house to properly acknowledge the       decades that she devoted to this community. Instead, we faced       a national shutdown aimed at protecting everyone from the       COVID-19 pandemic, but particularly those like KB whose       health was compromised by cancer and the chemotherapy she       undertook to try to beat it.        She restarted the chemo after a much-too-short remission       and was bound and determined to beat it.        In a perfect world, she would have beat it. In a perfect       world, there would have been more stories that she could have       written about all of you, her favorite people. In a perfect       world, she would have enjoyed her retirement.        But the world is not perfect.        Today, we honor her with a front-page obituary, not because       she would have wanted it--indeed she would have been appalled       at the attention.        We do so because she deserves it.        In Gillette, she spent more than 20 years as a sports       reporter, and in those years covered thousands of young       athletes in the school system as well as younger and older       ones in different athletic pursuits.        Kathy was the sole sports reporter at the News Record--and       the only female sports reporter in the state--for most of       that time. No one worked longer and harder than she did       because she was committed not just to her job, but to the       kids.        She made an effort to talk to every single athlete on a       team--not just the stars, but every single one. She tried to       make sure that they appeared in a story over the course of a       season because she believed that each one of them deserved       attention as part of the team. Each athlete, competing alone       or on a team, had a story that deserved to be told.        A criticism that haunted her most would be those that came       from some disgruntled parent who thought she was giving one       player too much attention. In sports coverage, it's hard to       ignore the stars. But her admiration often was focused on       those whose efforts were just as noteworthy, if not as       splashy.        ``Always talk to those involved in events, not just a coach       or teacher,'' she wrote in notes she handed out to younger       journalists who wanted to listen to her advice. ``You can use       the coach or teacher's comments to build on what you're       writing, but the athletes or the students are the ones who       are involved in it. They have a lot to say, too, and       shouldn't be ignored.''        In 2012, she moved from the sports beat to education and       the community section. The move was made for health reasons,       but she ended up working just as hard covering those beats as       she did sports.        She was a prolific writer and still holds the byline record       at the News Record. There was never a topic too small, but       there were some that she could write reams about, usually       involving her love of history, particularly local or Western       history.        She once decided to write about the Pumpkin Buttes, a story       that originally was supposed to anchor the front page.        She wrote so much that it ended up being a special section.        That was true of the Recreation Center when it opened 10       years ago. The story was supposed to be a comprehensive look       at what the new facility was like.        It ended up being a 28-page special section with multiple       stories, all written in a very short amount of time by KB.        In both of those cases, just like with most stories she       wrote, she approached them with an enthusiasm that is rare.        ``I'm sucking the life out of this interview in three       different ways,'' she once said about an interview with one       of the National High School Finals Rodeo contestants.        She loved journalism because no two days are alike. ``Every       day is a new adventure,'' she said in 2017.        She also loved it because it put her smack-dab in the       middle of people and their stories, which is where she liked       to be.        ``I really feel it's a privilege to cover the stories of       the people in Campbell County and to be able to tell about       their lives,'' she said.        She has been honored many times for her reporting and her       leadership. Three years ago, she was chosen as Veteran       Journalist of the Year by the Wyoming Press Association, an       occasion that made her reflect on her career, as well as to       find humor in the ``veteran'' part of the name.        ``Heck,'' she said. ``It's just one for old farts.''        ``I want to tell the stories we all want to read--the       important ones that teach us about life, ourselves and our       community at the same time,'' she said at the time. ``No one       else can tell the story of a community as well as a       newspaper, so it's a service to a community and a calling to       those of us on the job.''        It was her humility that made her sum up the award by       saying, ``I guess it means I'm doing OK at the job.''        That prompted a reply from frequent letter writer Brad       Schofield.        ``In my opinion, the ability to `write and relate' is not       only a gift she has shared and worked so hard to achieve, it       is a dedication to a life of serving a people and a community       she obviously loves and respects,'' he wrote.        A newspaper contest judge once called KB ``a consummate       pro.'' And she was. People in Gillette were lucky to have her       on their side for 37 years.        We were even luckier to be able to call her a colleague.       Even more so a friend.                            ____________________
