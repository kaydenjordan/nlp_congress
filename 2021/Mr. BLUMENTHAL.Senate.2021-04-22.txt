 Mr. President, I am honored to follow our  distinguished Judiciary Committee chairman and whip, Senator Durbin,  who has fought so hard for the principles and values that are embodied  in the Jabara-Heyer NO HATE Act, which is part of the legislation. It  is, indeed, bipartisan, and, hopefully, we will pass it today.   The fact is that this August marks two excruciatingly sad  anniversaries. It will be 4 years since Heather Heyer was killed when a  White nationalist drove his car into a crowd of peaceful protesters,  and it will be 5 years since Khalid Jabara was shot and killed on his  own front porch by his neighbor, an avowed and virulent racist.   The temptation is to get lost in the numbers and statistics about  hate crimes. Make no mistake, these statistics are horrifying,  especially the surge in hate crimes directed against Asian Americans  and Pacific Islanders.   The FBI reported just over 7,300 hate crimes in 2019. The Department  of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics estimates that there was an  average of 198,000 hate crime victimizations in 2017. Hate crimes are  vastly underreported. One of the objectives of the Jabara-Heyer NO HATE  Act is to spur greater reporting so we know the horrifying dimensions  and magnitude of this problem and we can better fashion solutions to  fight them.   But what is most important to remember about each of these 198,000  incidents is that they involve real people, real communities, lives  torn apart, communities torn asunder. In the most heartbreaking cases,  they involve real lives that are lost forever, real families who will  never see their loved ones again.   The NO HATE Act that the Senate is considering today is named for two  of those people: Heather Heyer and Khalid Jabara. For just a few  moments, I would like to spend this time on the Senate floor honoring  them and their families. We are here because of them.   Heather Heyer was counterprotesting the Unite the Right rally in  Charlottesville, VA, on August 12, 2019, when she was murdered by a  White supremacist who purposefully ran his car into a crowd of  protesters, also injuring 19 other people.   Heather is remembered as a young woman with a big heart. She devoted  her life to the fight for justice and equality. The foundation named in  her honor notes that ``Heather was a young woman deeply involved in  taking a stand against injustice when she didn't have to do so,'' who  ``spoke passionately'' about what she believed in. She was just 32  years old when she was murdered.   Khalid Jabara was shot on the steps of his own home, his family's  home in Tulsa, OK, by a neighbor who had been harassing the Jabara  family for months. That family had come to America to flee civil war  and religious persecution in Lebanon, only to be terrorized here by  their racist, murderous next door neighbor.   Khalid is remembered for his sense of humor and unfailing devotion to  his family.   [[Page S2142]]              He cared for our entire family, our friends, and people he       didn't even know. He created every Jabara family joke and       filled their lives with love and laughter.    Jabara was 37 years old when he was murdered.   Today's vote honors the memory of those two individuals and the  thousands of other individuals who have been victims of similar hate  crimes--un-American, abhorrent, unacceptable. Today, we make a  statement that we will not accept those kinds of hate crimes in  America.   I am grateful to the entire Jabara family and to Susan Bro, Heather's  mother, for their unfailing devotion to ending hate and their  courageous advocacy in support of the NO HATE Act. I also want to thank  my partner in this legislation, Senator Moran of Kansas. We would not  be here today without his support and bipartisan cooperation on this  bill.   There will always be hateful people who want to lash out violently at  the world. They will lash out at Muslims, at Jews, at African  Americans, at Asian Americans, at Pacific Islanders. But America is  above it. America is better than they are. And we owe Heather Heyer,  Khalid Jabara, and every other victim of hate crimes--from the Orlando  nightclub massacre to the shooting in El Paso--the kind of action we  are taking today.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues to  oppose this amendment because it essentially shreds the bill. It  removes core provisions.   It would prevent the Department of Justice from tracking hate crime  incidents that don't rise to the level of criminal conduct. That  provision is contrary to policy of the International Association of  Chiefs of Police. It would eliminate a provision from the NO HATE Act  that I have advocated that funds creation of State-run hotlines so we  know more about these hate crimes.   It would eliminate a judge's ability to order that a person convicted  of hate crimes undertake educational classes and provide that kind of  remedy as a condition for supervised release.   In short, it eliminates some of the most important provisions of this  bill.   I strongly urge opposition to this amendment.
