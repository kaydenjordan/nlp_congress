 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4468, the  Choice in Automobile Retail Sales Act.   The out-of-touch government dictated EV mandates pushed by this  administration are an attack on our way of life in northern Minnesota  and across this country.   Many of my constituents not only can't afford an EV, they don't want  to purchase an EV because they are not compatible with our daily lives.  How are we supposed to reliably drive an EV when its battery has the  potential to lose 50 percent of its range in Minnesota's subzero  temperatures?    Let's not forget that the critical minerals used to make these EVs  are sourced from Chinese Communist Party-controlled mines in places  like the Congo and Indonesia--mines that have zero environmental  standards, mines that have zero labor standards, and mines that use  child slave labor.   Thanks to this administration's refusal to support responsible,  domestic mining, their EV mandate will only increase our reliance on  the Chinese Communist Party for critical minerals.   Mr. Speaker, I will remind you and my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle that the biggest copper nickel find is in northern Minnesota,  the Duluth Complex--95 percent of our nickel reserve, over 88 percent  of our cobalt, and a third of our copper and other platinum group  metals that help make electric vehicles--and this administration just  pulled the leases.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of H.R. 4468.
