 Mr. President, today I honor an exceptional member of  the U.S. Navy, LT Jonathan Kokot. I am proud to enter this tribute into  the Record as I have had the pleasure of traveling overseas with Jon on  multiple occasions, allowing me to see his professionalism, leadership,  and dedication to duty firsthand.    Lieutenant Kokot has distinguished himself through his professional  character and dedication to serving this Nation in uniform. He has  continued to excel in peerless service to our country while assigned to  the Navy Senate Liaison Office. A native of Houston, TX, Jon is a 2013  graduate of Vanderbilt University and was commissioned through the  Naval ROTC program. He completed primary flight school at VT-27 in  Corpus Christi, TX, followed by advanced flight training at HT-28 in  Milton, FL.    Lieutenant Kokot joined the Battlecats of Helicopter Maritime Strike  Squadron Seven Three (HSM) 73 in April, 2016. He deployed to the  Western Pacific onboard USS Sampson (DDG 102), an Arleigh Burke class  guided-missile destroyer, in September 2016 in support of the Oceania  Maritime Security Initiative (OMSI) and received a Humanitarian Service  Medal for his part in disaster relief following an earthquake in New  Zealand. On Jon's second deployment, his helicopter squadron was  embarked on USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN 71), and later USS Halsey (DDG  97), for a deployment to the CENTCOM and INDOPACOM areas of  responsibility.    Lieutenant Kokot has also been published in ``Rotor Review''  magazine. His article, ``Deployment: A Junior Officer's Perspective,''  was recognized as the article of the year in 2018. That article  discussed the ``beauty'' of flight deck operations on a modern aircraft  carrier, writing: ``one only has to watch the flight deck during launch  and recovery of jets to realize there's a half-century worth of  training involved in each evolution. The movement of six different  types of aircraft, including fixed-wing and helicopters, transformed  from parked and folded to engines full blast within minutes, is mind- boggling. Five-thousand people aboard this floating fortress work  around-the-clock to make this dance happen, and each member plays his  or her role in a system of cogs which drives the most powerful peace  machine on the planet.''    Lieutenant Kokot also models a commitment to volunteering. During  his time in the Senate, he served additionally as a White House social  aide, supporting more than 30 high-visibility events. He also served as  a mentor and role model for disadvantaged youth who need a helping  hand. While in flight training in Corpus Christi, Jon cofounded a  mentorship program at Flour Bluff High School and personally provided  10 hours of mentoring per week to students in need. He continued this  worthy effort with his involvement in the Big Brothers Big Sisters  program, beginning with his first fleet assignment in San Diego and  again these last 2 years here in Washington, DC. He regularly spent a  dozen hours each month with his young mentee. Jon's interest and  empathy for underprivileged youth reflects the influence of his mother,  who mentored middle and high school youth for over a dozen years in  Houston.    As a legislative liaison in the Navy Senate Liaison Office from  February 2019 to February 2022, Lieutenant Kokot performed his duties  with distinction, supporting the 116th and 117th U.S. Congresses. Jon's  direct assistance provided critical information necessary for the  passage of three National Defense Authorization Acts in the U.S.  Senate, as well as peace of mind for members concerned about the  welfare of our constituents. His efforts also helped ensure the  confirmation of the 77th and 78th Navy Secretaries and the 32nd Chief  of Naval Operations.    Lieutenant Kokot led 28 congressional delegations across the United  States and the globe. He has escorted many Members of this Chamber on  travel, as well the personal and professional staff who work in this  Chamber. I have had the pleasure of traveling with Jon on a number of  these trips. He has gone above and beyond the call of duty to  facilitate and successfully execute each trip, despite any weather,  aircraft, or diplomatic complications. He consistently performs his  duties selflessly, and with a smile.  [[Page S412]]     After 3 years of serving in this vital role, during which he became  a very popular fixture on Capitol Hill, Lieutenant Kokot will return to  sea duty in USS Tripoli (LPH 10), the Navy's newest America class  amphibious assault ship homeported in San Diego, CA. Tripoli was built  in Pascagoula, MS, and is the third ship to bear the name of the first  U.S. battle fought on foreign soil. This Chamber will keenly feel  Lieutenant Kokot's absence. A substantial debt is owed to Jon's  parents, Ronald and Pamela Kokot, for the parenting and love that  produced this outstanding young leader. Regrettably, Jon's mother  passed away when he was 22, but I know that she watches over her son  with the same pride that is felt by many Members of Congress. I am  grateful for LT Jonathan Kokot's service and his work with my office  and the Senate, and I salute him. May he always have ``fair winds and  following seas.''                            ____________________
