Mr. President, I want to tell you about two young women  from Chicago and a discovery they made together that has helped to  transform the lives of hundreds of other young women.   Domitira Nahishakiye moved with her family from the African nation of  Burundi to Chicago in 2007. Three years later, she found herself  overwhelmed. At 18, she was attending high school, trying to prepare  for college, and caring for her three younger siblings.   The refugee resettlement efforts worked mostly with boys and young  men. It didn't offer many programs to help Domi balance the pressures  of caring for her siblings and preparing for college. Getting ready for  college is tough for almost everyone. Imagine how much harder it is if  you have grown up in another culture and you are helping to care for  three siblings.   Fortunately, Domi met another young woman named Blair Brettschneider.   Blair grew up in Detroit. After graduating from the University of  Miami in Florida, she had hoped to become a journalist, but the Great  Recession caused Blair to rethink her career path. She moved to Chicago  to work for AmeriCorps VISTA, sometimes called the domestic Peace  Corps. Blair was a ``gofer'' for the refugee resettlement agency.   Not content with coffee runs and other ``busy work,'' Blair started  talking to the families her agency was helping. That is how she met  Domi.   Blair started to tutor Domi and help her with her homework at the  afterschool center, but Domi's home responsibilities made it difficult  for her to attend the sessions regularly.   Rather than give up, Blair started tutoring Domi at her home. She  helped her master her studies and apply for college. She also helped  Domi adapt to life in her new homeland.   Blair realized that Domi was not alone. Many immigrant girls and  young women Blair spoke with shared the same needs, and many refugee  agencies just weren't set up to help them.   That realization led Blair to establish a foundation in 2011 to  provide other young women refugees in Chicagoland with the same types  of support that Blair offered Domi. It is called GirlForward. It has  since expanded its reach to help young women in Austin, TX, as well.  Since 2011, GirlForward has helped nearly 300 refugee women in the  Chicago area and in Austin find mentors, friends, support, and  encouragement in America.   Amina Imran, a refugee from Pakistan, is one of those fortunate young  women. She used to joke that the only way she could attend college is  if she robbed a bank, but after finishing the Chicago GirlForward  program in 2017, she now attends North Park University in Chicago, on a  scholarship.   GirlForward is routinely cited as one of the best charities in  Chicago. Reader's Digest declared GirlForward the Best of America.   My visits to GirlForward in Chicago were some of the happiest moments  on my schedule. Young women from every comer of the world found  friendship and encouragement with their peers. The processes of  assimilating language and culture were lifted as these amazing young  women came together and shared their struggles and joys.   In helping young women refugees to thrive in their new home, Blair  Brettschneider is following in the footsteps of another great  Chicagoan. In 1889, Jane Addams founded Hull House on the Near West  Side of Chicago. It was one of America's first settlement houses, where  new citizens could acquire domestic and job skills and learn about  American Government and customs. For her work with Hull House and other  social justice causes, Jane Aaclams became the first American woman  ever to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.   GirlForward is a new version of Hull House.   In July, Blair will be leaving GirlForward. Fortunately, she leaves  the GirlForward programs in Chicagoland and in Austin in strong shape.   On behalf of the hundreds of young women whose lives GirlForward has  helped enrich and transform and the hundreds of young women who will  follow them, I want to thank Blair Brettschneider for her remarkable  work and wish her all the best in her new efforts.                            ____________________
