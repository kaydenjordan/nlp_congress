 Mr. Speaker, had I been present, I would  have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 22.                             personal explanation     Mr. Speaker, the men and women from sea to  shining sea that wear a badge have sworn an oath to the Constitution.  That oath is not to a sheriff or a marshal or a chief, it is to the  people of their community and deeper, the principles that have built  our country.   We put on our badges and uniforms, and we say good-bye to our wives  not knowing if we will return.   For many, many years on my way to night shift I would tell my wife I  loved her, and she would hand me my little lunch. She would say: ``Come  home safe.'' I would say: ``Don't worry about me, worry about the other  guy.'' That was our little ritual, but the truth was we never knew if I  was coming home.   Right now men and women across the country are having similar  conversations and wearing a badge. Just know we love you and respect  you. This body supports you.
