 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, on May 7, we learned of a cyber attack  on the Colonial Pipeline. This resulted in gas shortages and lines  across the east coast. You see it on television every day.   During a news conference, Energy Secretary Granholm said: ``Pipelines  are the best way to transport fuel.'' This is certainly a fact.  Pipelines are much safer than transporting oil by rail or truck. Iowa  has over 40,000 miles of pipeline which go largely unnoticed but play a  large role in providing our Nation's transportation fuel.    It is not lost on millions of Americans that this statement from the  Energy Secretary comes from the same administration that, on day one,  January 20, shut down the Keystone Pipeline. On day one, January 20,  this administration cut 10,000 jobs. Remember, they ran on a platform  of creating jobs. This has already resulted in rising gas prices like  we are seeing across the country. In fact, gas prices will soon be more  expensive than at any time since the Obama administration.   This cyber attack on Colonial showed America just how critical  pipeline infrastructure is for transportation and how that affects  national security. For an administration that is stressing  infrastructure, maybe they should take a second look at the decision on  January 20 to shut down the Keystone XL Pipeline. I shudder to think  that if the Colonial Pipeline were attempting to get a permit today,  this administration might not even allow the construction.   The United States should be encouraging private infrastructure  investment, not getting in the way of progress that investment would  bring. As long as our country is still relying on oil to fill our gas  tanks, we need to have the infrastructure and security in place so that  what happened last week never happens again.   When there is a shortage of oil, then biofuels can be an easy  substitute that can be subbed in, but again, government redtape is  getting in the way. The Environmental Protection Agency should quickly  finalize a rule to broaden the availability of existing infrastructure  for use with E15 ethanol and related labeling requirements. This would  allow more gas stations to use their current tanks for E15.   We need a balanced approach, and biofuels such as ethanol and  biodiesel can help achieve greenhouse gas reductions and strengthen our  national security, keeping gas prices in check and helping agriculture  of America at the same time.                              Presidential Power    Mr. President, on another matter, I have heard from a large number of  Iowans convinced that our Republic is effectively lost with the  election of President Biden. This seems to be like the Flight 93  election theory in the 2016 election, where some conservatives felt  that, if Clinton won, the country would  [[Page S2558]]  be lost for good. So, like the Flight 93 passengers who rushed the  cockpit in a last-ditch attempt to avert a catastrophic outcome that  probably would have hit this Capitol Building, they argued that any  alternative to Clinton was justified.   The left, then, felt the same way after Trump won. When President  Trump was elected, I received an outpouring of messages expressing a  truly startling degree of fear and anguish. It is as if we had just  elected an evil King or dictator.   Understanding human nature, the Framers of our Constitution set up a  system of separation of powers, knowing it was not safe to just trust  the character of individual public officials. The President is supposed  to, as the Constitution said, ``see that the laws be faithfully  executed,'' not to be some all-powerful, elected King.   The American Presidency shouldn't be and was never supposed to be so  important or so powerful that Americans ought to feel that their entire  future is at stake every 4 years. Yet many Americans do feel that way,  and it isn't all just a misunderstanding.   Presidential power has grown beyond its proper bounds intended by the  Constitution. Why is that? That ``Why is it?'' lies right here with the  Congress of the United States because, over time, Congress has  delegated too much authority piece by piece, in countless bills, and  failed to this very day to do much to take back that authority.   During the Trump administration, I worked to reclaim some delegated  powers over tariffs, emergency declarations, and regulations but lacked  sufficient bipartisan support to get the job done. I have no illusions  that a Democratic Congress will limit President Biden's powers, but  perhaps we could agree to reclaim powers for Congress with some future  effective date.   So much focus on one person, whether it is a Republican or a  Democrat, and one election every 4 years, like we worried about 2016 or  people are still worrying about 2020--that is not a healthy environment  for a democracy. Restoring the proper balance between the Presidency  and the Congress can help restore some balance to our fiscal discourse.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I will not be voting to discharge the  nominee Kristen Clarke to run the Civil Rights Division of the  Department of Justice, so I come to the floor to explain to my  colleagues why I feel this way.   While Ms. Clarke may be a very good attorney--in fact, I don't think  there is any doubt that she is--she continues the trend of politicized  nominees to the Justice Department under this President. While I  disagree with her strongly on some of her views, especially when it  comes to defunding the police, my issues with Ms. Clarke go beyond  that.   The Justice Department and especially the Civil Rights Division need  to be committed to impartial and equal justice. In the wrong hands, the  Civil Rights Division can be used to target and harass the President's  political opponents. It can threaten law enforcement, school choice  advocates, religious schools, red States, and pro-lifers.   This isn't a hypothetical. Under Ms. Gupta, the Civil Rights Division  defended an effort to take over Louisiana's school choice program. Now,  can you imagine that? Luckily, a group of African-American mothers  stopped them in the Fifth Circuit. Just think--African Americans  stopped an obvious injustice by the Justice Department.   The fact is that our civil rights laws are broad, and the mere threat  of their enforcement can chill legitimate political opposition. Because  of that, I think that the head of the Civil Rights Division needs to be  above reproach when it comes to partisanship.   Unfortunately, Ms. Clarke is a liberal partisan. She has opposed the  enforcement of the law against Ike Brown, a Mississippi voter  suppressor, either because of the color of his skin or because he was a  Democrat. Neither answer is acceptable. She has disparaged religious  freedom groups like the Alliance Defending Freedom. She has opposed  important Supreme Court decisions protecting religious liberty,  individual Supreme Court Justices, and even some of my colleagues. She  has held Republican nominees to a standard she didn't want to apply to  herself.   Ms. Clarke has run away from her record. I asked her at the hearing  whether Mumia Abu-Jamal, the country's most notorious cop killer, was a  political prisoner, like someone said at a conference that she helped  organize. She wouldn't answer, telling me she was unfamiliar with the  case. Given her youthful activism, I find that very hard to believe.  Last summer, she wrote an article in Newsweek advocating for defunding  the police, but she insists the words on the page aren't what she  meant. I am sorry, but if it is not what she meant, then she shouldn't  have said it.   I don't think she is the right person for this job at this time. A  nominee to lead the Civil Rights Division should be nonpartisan, should  be independent, and should be upfront about her beliefs. Unfortunately,  I think Ms. Clarke misses all three marks.   As I have said, I don't want to return to the Eric Holder days, so I  will vote no.   I yield the floor.
