 Mr. President, it is with great appreciation and a touch  of sadness that I note the upcoming retirement of Sarah Carpenter. Her  retirement culminates 20 years of dedicated service as the executive  director of the Vermont Housing Finance Agency, VHFA. Through her  enduring commitment to affordable housing, Sarah has helped tens of  thousands of Vermonters into homes and helped to establish and shape  our State's affordable housing infrastructure.   Sarah's career spanned four decades during which time she was a  consistent leader in the affordable housing community. As executive  director of Cathedral Square Corporation between 1983 and 1998, Sarah  worked to develop and manage housing that met the needs of differently  abled and aging Vermonters. She oversaw the operation of 430 units of  supportive housing and provided housing development and management  assistance to 20 projects across the State.   As executive director of the Vermont Housing Finance Agency, Sarah  advanced the agency's mission to finance and promote affordable, safe,  and decent housing opportunities for low- and moderate-income  Vermonters. Sarah oversaw $2.2 billion in lending in Vermont, and in  her time with VHFA, the agency closed over 10,000 home loans, making a  significant contribution to homeownership in the State of Vermont. She  has been an effective leader whose work has expanded the amount of  permanent supportive housing dedicated to people experiencing  homelessness. Not only was Sarah an inspiring leader, she was also a  strong and compassionate manager. Since 2015, the Vermont Chamber of  Commerce and Vermont Business Magazine have included VHFA on their list  of Vermont's Best Places to Work.   Sarah's contribution to the affordable housing community extends into  her community service. She is a founding member of the Housing Vermont  board and a founding member of the Burlington Community Land Trust. She  has been a member of dozens of boards and special committees dedicated  to various aspects of housing finance and the promotion of safe,  affordable, and decent housing for Vermonters of all means. Her service  has been recognized by numerous awards, including the Senator Patrick  Leahy Leadership Award from the Committee on Temporary Shelter in 2007.   Sarah is a lifelong Vermonter who has dedicated her career to  ensuring those in her home State can afford a home. She was a key  architect of the system that today creates and finances the production  and preservation of affordable rental housing across the State. She has  worked closely with my office to improve the Low Income Housing Tax  Credit program, including ensuring priority is given to projects that  propose to target 25 percent of their units to Vermonters who have  experienced homelessness. Sarah's informed advocacy has strengthened  this and other Federal housing programs so they can work for Vermont  and Vermonters. I commend her service to the State and thank her on  behalf of the countless Vermont families that she has helped into  homes.                            ____________________
