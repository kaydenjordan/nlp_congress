 Mr. Speaker, more than a bill, this is a lie wrapped in  lies, a sneak attack on America ramming through here at warp speed  before the truth catches up with the lies. A very thin sugarcoating of  tax changes for some in the middle class conceals massive special  interest giveaways.   But I am convinced that the reckoning will come. Americans will  demand accountability for a scheme that showers its benefits  overwhelmingly on corporations and those at the top of the economic  ladder, including the Trump family personally benefiting.   The reckoning will come when students and the sick find out they are  paying not less taxes, but more taxes, under this bill.   The reckoning will come as Republicans use the huge debt burden that  they are deliberately creating by this bill as an excuse to cut  Medicare, educational opportunities, and other vital investments.    This sham of a bill provides rewards to corporate tax  dodgers and creates a giant new loophole for outsourcing American jobs  abroad.   The only coming together here is the coming together between the  master of distraction, the big tweet down the street, who is joined  here by the masters of deceit in Congress. They ignore any wrong he  commits. He can embrace child molesters; he can attack our law  enforcement officers; he can challenge the very basis of the free press  in our country, using any means necessary, whatever deception, to try  to foist off this sham of a bill on America.   It should be rejected.
