 Mr. Speaker, the question every Member of Congress  should be asking themselves today is: Who in the world is better off  because of today's bill?   It is not the 24 million people the CBO says will lose their health  coverage if this bill becomes law.   It is not the seniors who will be priced out of the market by an age  tax or the millions of families who will see their health care gutted  by the more than $800 billion in cuts to Medicaid.   It is not the 881,000 non-elderly adults in Kentucky with preexisting  conditions who would, once again, face  [[Page H4117]]  staggering health costs with reduced care.   So who is better off? Well, certainly corporations and millionaires  who will see nearly $1 trillion in tax cuts from this bill.   And at least, in their minds, a few Republican Members are so  desperate for some type of political victory they are willing to risk  the health and well-being of their constituents to ram through a bill  without hearings, analysis, or, most alarmingly, any sense of morality.  That is the cruel tradeoff my Republican colleagues have decided to  make.   Our families deserve far better. I urge my colleagues to exercise  better judgment and vote ``no'' on this bill.
