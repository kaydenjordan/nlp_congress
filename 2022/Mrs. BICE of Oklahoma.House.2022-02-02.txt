 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  of one of my constituents, Raymond Washburn, who passed away on January  16.   On the horrific day in 1995 when a truck bomb blew up the Alfred P.  Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, killing 168 people and  injuring hundreds more, Mr. Washburn was operating the snack bar he  owned on the fourth floor. He not only set himself free from the rubble  but was able to navigate and rescue five people from the disaster. What  is notable: Mr. Washburn was blind.   Mr. Washburn is a true American hero and will be remembered for the  incredible selflessness, integrity, and bravery he displayed by saving  lives on that terrible day and for his remarkable contributions to the  visually impaired community in Oklahoma.   Though this brave man will be deeply missed, there is no doubt his  legacy will live on. Mr. Washburn's story and the way he lived his life  should stand as an inspiration to Oklahomans and Americans across the  country.   I am thinking of and praying for Mr. Washburn's family and loved  ones, that they may find comfort in their loss.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Florida  for yielding. I rise today in strong opposition to the so-called  America COMPETES Act.   This legislation is climate funding disguised as foreign policy, and  it will funnel millions of taxpayer dollars to the Chinese economy.   While I support the CHIPS Act funding in this bill, the overall  package is a disaster.   As a member of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, we have  advanced bipartisan legislation that increases STEM opportunities and  clean energy research. Instead of passing these bills that strengthen  American competitiveness against China, Democrats have poisoned  bipartisan efforts by including billions in wasteful spending.   Later today, the House will consider my amendment to block the $8  billion for the U.N.'s green climate slush fund until we have insight  into how emission reduction targets are set and their impacts on our  economy.   This type of scientific transparency shouldn't be a partisan issue.  This far-left legislation weakens our stance against China and  threatens our economy and national security.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this misguided and wasteful bill.
