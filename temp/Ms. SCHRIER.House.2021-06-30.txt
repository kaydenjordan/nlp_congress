 Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Lamb for yielding.   I am incredibly excited to have three local projects included in the  INVEST in America Act. I worked with mayors, county commissioners, and  community members across my district to identify priorities and  advocate for Federal investment. These projects will improve the safety  and resiliency of infrastructure in our communities, create jobs, and  boost local economies.   Now, I would like to ask my colleagues to support my amendment to  codify the Forest Service's Legacy Roads and Trails Program. This  program leverages public and private funding to address our national  backlog of deteriorating infrastructure, and does so while protecting  American rivers and streams, endangered fish, and community water  systems with targeted projects, like restoring fish passage and access  to upstream habitat for salmon and steelhead, maintaining and storm- proofing forest roads, and improving trails so people can safely  recreate in our public lands.   Chronic underfunding has left a long backlog of projects, and I am  proud to present this solution. As we face the increasing threat of  climate change and the need to improve our Nation's crumbling  infrastructure, we must ensure pragmatic programs like legacy roads are  also protected.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
