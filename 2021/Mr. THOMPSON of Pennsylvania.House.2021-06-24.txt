 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember  the incredible life of Louise Dunlap.   A native of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Louise was a dedicated advocate  for coal communities, our environment, and especially the reclamation  of our historic abandoned mine lands.   Louise's career began with the grassroots, advocating for more  support for the environment and Pennsylvania's mine lands. In 1972,  Louise cofounded the Environmental Policy Institute and the  Environmental Policy Center. There, she spent years working to pass  legislation to support mine reclamation in Pennsylvania and was an  important advocate for the passage of the Surface Mining Control and  Reclamation Act of 1977.   This law created the first Federal standards on the reclamation of  new and subsequent surface mining. Importantly, it also established the  Abandoned Mine Land Trust, which was created to provide consistent  funding for the reclamation of coal mines that were abandoned prior to  the law's enactment in 1977.   For over 40 years, this trust has been the central funding source for  the reclamation of abandoned mine lands in 20 States, generating over  $11.6 billion since its creation by Congress.   Beginning in 2004, she joined the Foundation for Pennsylvania  Watersheds, where she continued her life's work. In 2006, she again  played a key advocacy role when Congress authorized the AML for an  additional 15 years.   This September, the Abandoned Mine Land Fund is set to expire. The  trust must be reauthorized in order to continue opportunities in  funding to clean up these un-reclaimed lands, not only in Pennsylvania  but around the country. Congress has the opportunity to do right by our  coal communities by reauthorizing this fund and also expediting the  release of the existing balance.   Reauthorizing the AML was a project close to Louise's heart. She  fought for coal communities up until her final days. She spent the last  few weeks continuing to secure support for the reauthorization of the  Abandoned Mine Land Fund.                                time  1045    In Pennsylvania, there are over 5,500 miles of streams polluted due  to legacy mining, and over 280,000 acres remain toxic. Nationwide, the  unfunded liabilities exceed $12 billion, with $5 billion in  Pennsylvania alone. Louise made it her mission to work toward restoring  these areas.   My district alone has the most abandoned mine land in the country. I  understand the urgency in reauthorizing the AML fund, which is why I am  an original cosponsor of the RECLAIM Act and the Surface Mining Control  and Reclamation Act Amendments of 2021 with fellow Pennsylvanian,  Representative Matt Cartwright. We both worked closely with Louise on  this act.   Louise Dunlap was an inspiring force as she spent her life advocating  to reclaim and revitalize former mining communities. She was a friend  and marshaled key legislation victories over the span of a 50-year  career.   In honor of her legacy, it is important that we continue her life's  work and continue to support our historic coal communities.   My heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of Louise Dunlap.  She was so fiercely passionate, and she will be greatly missed.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today during  National Pollinators Week to recognize the important work of our  natural pollinators.  [[Page H3093]]    Each year, Pollinator Week focuses on promoting the health of  pollinators, critical to food and ecosystems, through conservation,  education, and research.   It is time we protect natural pollinator species, such as honeybees,  native bees, birds, bats, and butterflies, as essential partners of  farmers and ranchers in producing food.   These pollinators are vital to keeping items like fruits, nuts, and  vegetables in our diets. And healthy pollinator populations are crucial  to the continued economic well-being of rural America and the U.S.  economy.   Pollinators provide pollination services to over 180,000 different  plant species and more than 1,200 crops. This equates to one out of  every three bites of food eaten being there because of pollinators.   In addition, pollinators added $217 billion to the global economy,  and honeybees alone are responsible for between $1.2 and $5.4 billion  in agricultural productivity in the United States.   Madam Speaker, as someone who has a beehive in his backyard, I fully  support efforts to raise awareness and keep our pollinators buzzing for  generations to come.                            ____________________
