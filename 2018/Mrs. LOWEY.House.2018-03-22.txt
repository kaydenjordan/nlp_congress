 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Consolidated Appropriations Act repudiates the  abysmal Trump budget, investing robustly in critical priorities like  childcare, transportation infrastructure, national security, election  protection, medical research, opioid abuse prevention and treatment,  veterans' health services, and much more. These investments are key to  strong families and communities, job creation, and economic growth.   This bill rejects scores of divisive poison pill riders targeting  women's health, clean air and water, worker rights, consumer financial  protections, health insurance, and other critical priorities.   In addition, I am pleased the omnibus includes language clarifying  that the CDC has the authority to conduct research on the causes of gun  violence.   Within the State and Foreign Operations division, this omnibus  invests in stronger and more stable communities around the world,  alleviating poverty and disease and strengthening democratic political  systems. These investments in diplomacy and development are critical to  our national security.   I am pleased this final product rejects onerous policy riders like  the global gag rule.   These responsible investments and policies signal to the world that,  despite an erratic President, the United States remains a world leader.   To be clear, this omnibus is not a perfect product. I strongly object  to the majority's fixation on walling off our southern border and  building capacity to arrest and detain immigrants. While the bill  rejects the administration demands for a border wall, a large  deportation force, and more detention beds, the amount provided is  nonetheless a waste of money and contrary to our national character.   Before I conclude, I would like to thank Chairman Frelinghuysen for  his partnership and all the members of the committee for their  contributions.   I would also like to thank the minority, majority, and personal  office staffs who worked so very hard, particularly Shalanda Young and  Chris Bigelow and Richard Meltzer.   I also want to thank the committee's minority outstanding  communications director, Matt Dennis, who is departing the House next  month. He has served this institution for nearly 15 years at the  Appropriations Committee in my personal office and in former  Congressman Rush Holt's office. We will really miss his dedicated  service.   I want to make sure I thank the majority staff, Nancy Fox and her  team, because there was real cooperation between the majority and the  minority.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), the ranking member of the Energy and Water  Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Ohio.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), who is the ranking member of the Labor-HHS  Subcommittee.  [[Page H2019]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. McCollum), who is the ranking member of the Interior,  Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee), who is a senior member of the Appropriations  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Cuellar).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the distinguished Democratic whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Maryland an  additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the Democratic leader.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to revise and extend  her remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), the ranking member of the  Subcommittee on Energy and Water.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, this isn't the bill I would have written, but I am very  proud that it provides $117 billion more than President Trump requested  in nondefense investments to grow the economy, create jobs, and help  American families.   Again, I would like to thank our distinguished chair, Chairman  Frelinghuysen, and the entire committee for its tireless work forging  this bipartisan package.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
