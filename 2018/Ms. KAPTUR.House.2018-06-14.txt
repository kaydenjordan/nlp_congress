 Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight, and have chosen not to  attend the Congressional Baseball Game, because I think I have an  important message that needs to be heard.   I rise to elevate an economic and humanitarian issue that is  manifesting itself across Ohio, our Nation, and our continent. Millions  upon millions of workers, many landless workers essential to getting  America's work done in agriculture and other sectors, live and toil in  an eerie, shadow existence.   These workers often are exploited due to our broken immigration and  legal systems, which afford them and their work no respect.   Our beloved father, Steven, would say: ``They are caught between the  Devil and the deep blue sea.''   Let's take a peek inside who some of these workers really are.   These workers dare to climb skyscrapers and install the steel beams  and pour concrete across our country, one slip away from death.   They embrace harsh work circumstances, going into the brutally hot  Sun in the south and west, picking your vegetables and fruits for 12 to  16 hours a day at high season.   In our vast tobacco fields, they work from sunup to sundown, picking  off flowers from tobacco plants in the blistering 110-degree heat as  their fingers and hands numb from the nicotine and their sweaty  sunburned bodies turn ripe for melanoma skin cancer, and they have no  health insurance.                                time  1800    They work in hot steam chambers cleaning our laundry in the big  cities and in the very, very difficult environments of slaughterhouses  using electrified cutting equipment, and they are covered in blood in  those slaughterhouses for the meat that we eat.   They trudge through manure in dairy farms; and they harvest mushrooms  sold in every store, in the grocery stores around this country; in  cold, damp, dark, underground caves, walking through horse dung.   They catch, by hand, thousands of chickens every night in the dark,  hot coops that generally have 25,000 or more chickens each, where the  stench and the dust are life-threatening.   They clean bathrooms in amusement parks, along State turnpikes, and  in airports.   And why do they do this work? To survive, while holding out hope for  a better life for them and their loved ones.   Without these workers, our tables would be bereft of the food we  depend upon. America could not feed itself.   Without these workers, companies would have to pay higher wages and  offer health insurance to do the work.   Indeed, many, many, many millions of these workers are uprooted,  actually, continental labor refugees, spit out of vicious and violent  economic and political systems across the Americas. Yet continental  trade compacts like NAFTA and CAFTA were designed purposefully to  create this landless class of laborers to purposely undervalue them and  their work.   NAFTA caused millions of these workers to be upended and lose their  small farmsteads in Mexico, precipitating the largest human exodus from  the land in modern history. And, reciprocally, in our country, millions  of Americans lost their jobs in factories and farms across the Nation  as our jobs were shipped south.   Trade agreements have failed workers on this continent in their  homelands; and many of those south of our border fled--fled--to find  ways to make a living, drawn by worker shortages in many countries,  including our own, finding work in the most unappealing jobs, jobs our  citizens won't take.   Now, for those who came here to work, they face even more cruelty by  the Trump administration and many Members of this body, too, as their  children and families are being ripped apart. And I am going to tell  you a story about that in a second.   News reports are beginning to reveal the edges of this ugly system of  de facto human bondage. Our Nation,  [[Page H5196]]  founded in slavery, fought a bloody Civil War over whether the economic  system of the South would be extended west, and we have not completely  healed from that war even till today.   Sadly, American history has not been immune from subjugating and  indenturing workers. This situation of penniless workers in bondage is  the modern-day version of a continuing continental exploitation of  labor. It is an old story, repeating itself in a new chapter.   Last Tuesday, in a very well-known greenhouse operation in my  district in Erie County, Ohio, near Sandusky, the home of the roller  coaster at Cedar Fair, this well-regarded greenhouse operation was  raided at the height of this spring season by dozens and dozens and  dozens of Federal Immigration, Border Patrol, and IRS officials.   At least 114 male and female workers were detained, removed to jails,  and are being questioned somewhere. But where? Those who are parents  have been cruelly separated from their children, with no provision made  for the children.   This is a photo.   I will say something about that in a second, of what was going on  last week in Ohio.   The reverberations of this raid in Ohio will be felt across a  greenhouse and nursery industry at high season when these companies  must have workers. They are highly dependent on thousands of seasonal  laborers to perform the necessary work, and I am talking just in Ohio,  tens of thousands of workers. The same is true in our border State of  Michigan.   I worry about these workers, and I worry about whether these firms  will find the workers to perform the work at such a key time of the  year. There simply aren't enough hands left to do the work.   Men and women workers, some of whom had worked for this firm for  nearly two decades, were surrounded by ICE officers who came out of  another State, Detroit, Michigan, heavily armed with rifles. They even  tied the hands of citizens of our country behind their backs before  questioning them.   Border Patrol helicopters whirred overhead as workers were handcuffed  and made to lie down on their bellies before being taken by bus to  detention centers hundreds of miles from Erie County, where this raid  occurred.   As far as I have been able to determine, the women workers, most of  whom are mothers, have been placed in the Calhoun County Jail near  Battle Creek, Michigan, and the men, in a facility, the Northeast Ohio  Correctional Center in Youngstown, Ohio.   I took particular note that Immigration and Customs Enforcement must  have notified the Associated Press that took this picture of the  impending raid, as the reporter traveled all the way from Michigan to  take this particular photo and report on the raid. But the same  notification was not extended to the local press nor, for that matter,  to local Ohio law enforcement officials who knew nothing about this  raid.   It certainly looks like the Trump administration seems intent on  staging a big show on immigration, but where is its interest in real  solutions?   Was this raid really about security? or is it more about  intimidation? or is it trying to divide Americans along economic and  racial lines?   I was told the greenhouse workers put up no resistance. They were  peaceful.   When I asked ICE if I could visit the workers in one of the detention  centers this past weekend, I was told arrangements could not be made,  even though these workers work in the district I represent. This is  simply unacceptable.    ICE, which reports to the superlords in the Trump administration  responsible for this, have been over a day late and a dollar short in  their answers back to us in their communications. Yet people's lives  and their children's well-being are at stake. Stonewalling is simply  not an option.   So I intend to head to Michigan in a few days to try to find the  detention center and, hopefully, speak to some of the women. I  understand if I do so, we have to do it over a videophone or something.  And I will say to the Department of Homeland Security I expect a full  report on the status of each of these workers, as well as evidence they  are being treated with dignity and respect in the county jail.   I hope to share more publicly about what I learn with my colleagues  here in the House, as well as the people of Ohio's Ninth District. I  want a full effort and report on what is at issue with each of the  persons apprehended. I want to know where each is located, as well as  what can be done to minimize the trauma for their children being  separated from their parents.   So how did America get to a point where people who work hard with  their hands for a living are rounded up like cattle and their children  taken from them to places they know not where?   Some of these children may be Dreamers, Americans who have grown up  in the United States whose immigration status needs to be addressed. So  let's do it.   Today, we learned that next week this House, apparently, will vote on  two competing measures that relate to immigration. One is from Mr. Bob  Goodlatte of Virginia, H.R. 4760, called Securing America's Future Act  of 2018. That bill only gives temporary status to young people who have  grown up in this country. It makes deep cuts to legal immigration. It  prevents legal immigrants from sponsoring their family members to enter  the United States, and, of course, it boosts enforcement. It is a  punitive bill, certainly not a very hopeful bill. And even if it could  pass this House, it is not going to pass the Senate.   Then there is this mysterious new bill that Speaker Ryan calls a  compromise bill, and the compromise bill we may vote on next week still  isn't written. It follows the framework, we are told, set forward by  the White House, legal status for Dreamers, increased border security,  including funding for a wasteful, ineffective border wall, an end to  the diversity visa lottery, and curbing family-based legal immigration.   Wow, there are so many people who have come to our office who want to  marry someone who is waiting in another country. How many decades are  they going to have to wait?   Just an hour ago, a summary provided said this:         This second measure would authorize funding for       construction of a border wall sought by President Trump and       give a path for so-called DACA populations to apply for a 6-      year, indefinitely renewable, nonimmigrant legal status,       after which they can apply for newly allocated green cards.    We will see. Count me as a skeptic.   To date, the Trump administration has failed to help young Dreamers  who have been here their whole lives. To date, the Republican  congressional majority has failed to provide a pathway for these  Dreamers. The majority has failed to act on comprehensive immigration  reform, which we really need.   Years of inaction by House Republicans who hold the majority have  brought us to this point. And we had a measure down here on the floor  that had garnered 216 signatures to bring a set of votes to the floor  that could really have addressed this problem, and the majority jerked  it off the ledger the other day.   Rather than blaming workers and harming U.S. companies, let's put the  blame where it belongs: on the trade agreements that the United States  has been passing since the 1990s that set us on a treacherous and  greedy path of bad trade deals like NAFTA and CAFTA that threw millions  of workers out of work in our country, and millions of workers and  small businesses in countries like Mexico lost their work, treated like  chattel on this continent.   We need a renegotiated NAFTA. These bad deals have never resulted in  a positive trade balance for our country. Instead, they displaced  millions of workers in North America. U.S. plants shut down here, and  trade deals like NAFTA thrust cheap labor into the market, forcing  wages down across the continent, including in Mexico.   Border crossings doubled into our country after NAFTA's passage,  including illegal entries of desperate people under desperate  circumstances.   Those trade deals disrupted the markets that small farmers in Mexico  and Central America relied on to support themselves.   Who would not flee desperation? You would, too, if your livelihood  disappeared. Think about it.   The best estimate suggests 11 million undocumented immigrants have  assumed some of the hardest, low-paying  [[Page H5197]]  jobs inside our economy since NAFTA's passage and, 10 years after that,  CAFTA's passage. Employers and employees are transfixed by a rigged  global economy that pits businesses and workers across this continent  against one another.   Who benefited from that? Ask yourself that question. Answer the  question.   Many workers have endured long journeys by foot, train, and boat as  labor traffickers indebted them to make it across our border. Others  who work here simply stayed beyond the expiration of their temporary  visitor permits.   The situation is more complicated than many people realize. The  reality is about 60 percent of the unauthorized population of workers  here has been here for at least a decade. A third of undocumented  immigrants 15 years of age and older live with at least one child who  is a U.S. citizen by birth.   So do we close our eyes to all of this and what has happened on this  continent or do we fix it?                                time  1815    The renegotiation of NAFTA presents a precious moment, and I am with  the President on renegotiating NAFTA, but with what provisions? The  chance to create a just economic model for all of North America that  respects and recognizes both employer needs and labor rights should be  in a trade agreement.   Renegotiation could have a monumental impact on not only economic  opportunity for millions, but also correct distorted, migratory  patterns in labor markets made so much worse by NAFTA. Instead of  lifting up workers and improving their plight, achieving good jobs with  living wages, the current NAFTA-CAFTA system forces workers in a harsh  system that equates to a modern-day versions, yes, of slavery.   Workers understand that standing up and complaining about abusive  conditions will mean termination because an employer can report them to  immigration authorities. So the guillotine always hangs over their  head. A renegotiated NAFTA can bring workers out from under the  shadows. It will benefit business. It will benefit workers, and it will  benefit our communities and our continent.   When workers are asked why they endure all this, almost all have the  same reason: survival and a hope for the American Dream. For those that  have come here from other places and work here, they are performing the  jobs the rest of America chooses not to do. Rather than end this  miserable underground system of indentured servitude, Republicans have  chosen inaction time and time again.   NAFTA and CAFTA need to be renegotiated to institute a legal system  that gives workers standing in the law, not exploitation, whatever side  of the border they live on.   Now, Republican lawmakers fail to acknowledge the vast role American  foreign policy has played in creating the conditions in North America  that push and pull workers on their perilous trek, destabilizing their  way of life. You cannot solve this problem without solving the NAFTA  and CAFTA problem.   Recall, President Reagan worked with Congress to pass the last  comprehensive immigration reform bill in the 1980s, and at the same  time, unfortunately, the United States Government negotiated with  international development institutions to develop new policies that  favored large multinational corporations but undercut workers,  including the smaller farms and businesses that created economic  opportunity for communities in our country and south of our border.   In 1994, the North American Free Trade Agreement--boy is that a  misnomer--was sold to Congress as a way to keep Mexicans home and to  make sure that American workers were cared for. Well, guess what? NAFTA  actually threw millions of Americans out of work and also millions of  Mexican farmers and small businesses were displaced.   These upended workers sought opportunity wherever they could find it.  Indeed, immigration to the United States from Mexico doubled post-NAFTA  as millions of U.S. citizens saw their jobs shipped south of the  border. And those south of the border, who couldn't even afford food at  that point--a desperate exodus began and people were willing to work  for penny wages.   A decade later, Congress passed CAFTA, the Central American Free  Trade Agreement, further undercutting agricultural workers and small  entrepreneurs throughout the rest of the southern tip of North America.  So these policies trapped Latin America workers between a foreign  policy that drove them from home and a U.S. domestic policy that kept  them in the shadows, while driving good jobs out of the United States  to low-wage environments.   Ask yourself: Who would benefit in that kind of system? Look at the  profits of some of the companies and the CEOs of those companies that  did that. We also know, far too many employers take on undocumented  workers and exploit them for their willingness to work long hours for  no pay.   President Trump, please know, walls will not solve these passive  economic inequities our trade policies created. Only fixing NAFTA and  CAFTA will.   Our Nation needs comprehensive, continental immigration reform that  should include an E-Verify employee system to take the onus off the  employers to verify a worker's status, and to give workers standing on  this continent.   No border wall can succeed against the enormous pull of our vast  economy's needs, including for labor, as employers complain every day  to me they cannot find the workers they need.   Let me conclude in my remaining minutes with a few stories that came  out of this horrendous raid that occurred in northern Ohio.   Maria Sandra worked at this greenhouse and was present the day of the  raid. She recalls clocking in at 7 a.m. These workers work hard. She  walked to her van to get her sunscreen and gloves when she heard  vehicles slamming on the brakes in the gravel.   The officers got down with large weapons so she figured they were  looking for a dangerous criminal. Then she says:         I realized it was immigration. Two men came up behind me       screaming at me to walk. I told them I have my ID and my       Social Security card. They screamed louder: Walk. I picked up       my phone and they told me to put it away, that I couldn't use       it. I was so scared seeing how they pushed people and put us       together like animals on their way to a slaughterhouse. The       officers tied everybody up.        I kept saying, I have my documents. I will show them to       you. But they ignored me. They began separating us into two       lines. Everybody that was White was let go. I was there so       long that I had to use the bathroom. They refused to let me       go until many others had to go.        We were taken, tied, to the restroom, accompanied by an       officer with a big gun. I kept asking: Why are you doing       this? I have all of my documentation in my van. They asked       me: Are you a citizen? And I said: Yes. They laughed at me.        I had never felt so humiliated. I can still hear everybody  crying. When they finally ran my social, they escorted me to my van,  still tied. They told me to leave and I said: How can I drive with my  hands tied? Another officer came with scissors to untie me and actually  cut my wrist. I pulled away in pain and he got angry and said: Why did  you move?         I said: Because you cut me. I stormed out of there in fear.       I have never experienced anything like this in my whole life.       I was treated like a criminal with no voice or rights.    Gloria Reyes works at Corso's and was there the day of the raid.  Gloria's coworker, who was arrested, asked Gloria to drop off her lunch  bag at home and check on her children. Gloria's coworker, whose name  she would prefer not to give out because of fear of the children being  taken, has three children: a little boy, a little girl, and a baby.   Gloria went to that house and when she knocked, she said she could  hear them behind the door shushing each other. Gloria says:         I knocked for a while and just kept saying, son, open up. I       won't hurt you. I just came to drop off your mom's lunch. The       eldest finally opened the door but wouldn't let me in. He       broke down crying and asking questions I couldn't answer       because I didn't know where any of them were.        I tried to calm him down and said everything would be okay.       I went back to take the children food, but nobody answered       the door. I don't know if they are okay. Those children only       have their mother.        I have been here in this community 42 years, and I have       never seen anything like  [[Page H5198]]       this. Families are being broken without caring of what would       be of the children. Working is not a sin, and all of those       people just wanted to better themselves.        We work hard, sometimes taking shifts from 7 a.m. until       midnight. What the government is doing is wrong. People are       suffering. The American children are suffering.    Another woman who worked at Corso's writes that she escaped the raid  and she wants to remain anonymous because she fears that she might be  hunted down. She said:         I never expected anything like this to happen. When I saw       them coming, I ran, and I ran, and ran until I hid under a       bed of flowers. I buried myself under the dirt and cried in       silence. All I could think about is my kids. I have three. A       lot of us have small children who need us. My skin itched of       the mud stuck to my body drying.    Is this America? Is this America?         I prayed to God for strength. I hid there for 8 hours in       fear of being taken or that maybe ICE would still be around.       I still feel like I am there suffocating. When I came out, I       asked someone who also works at Corso's for a ride. The       entire complex was silent. Lunch boxes were left everywhere.       There was a void in the room.        As I got home, I was scared to get out of the car. I looked       around the neighborhood to make sure there were no officers       around. Walking through the door and hugging my son was a       relief. However, I hurt when he asks me: What is going to       happen now? I don't know what to say.        All I know is, I have to provide for them. I am alone and I       don't have a dime to my name. If I had a voice, I would tell       the government that we don't hurt anyone. We are humble       people who are just working to better our lives. I would tell       them to put their hands on their hearts and realize they are       hurting people. Children are suffering. Please stop.    A young girl, age 13, who resides in a place named Willard, her  mother was taken in the raid. She said:         I was still in bed when I could hear someone banging on my       door. Right after, there was banging on my bedroom window, so       I got up to see what was going on. As I opened the door, my       neighbor in panic and tears asked where mom was. I said: She       is working. Why?        She asked, had I spoken to her? I began to say no when she       interrupted me by saying she had been arrested at her job       along with many others from our town. My neighbor said: Call       your dad. I was so confused and even dumb because I didn't       know what to do. I couldn't even remember my dad's phone       number. My dad didn't answer, so I panicked. I cried on the       floor hugging a picture of my mom. All I could do was cry and       hope it wasn't true. Not her.        My father eventually walked through the door and just       hugged me tight and we cried. I have little sisters and they       kept asking: Mommy, mommy. I would just say: She is at work.       It was even harder to tell my little brother. I played a       song, ``I Am Not Alone,'' and I prayed and prayed.        That night my sisters wouldn't go to bed, insisting to wait       for my mom. I went to sleep at 4 a.m. just thinking every       time my mom gave me advice and how I wish I had listened       every time.        My dad didn't go to work the next day. I think everybody is       scared. Everyone says: Be strong. It is going to be okay. But       all I can think about is, when will I see my mom again? When       will I hug her again? Now I have to take care of my sisters.       But looking at mom's empty chair at the table, just doesn't       seem fair.    I hope the American people who are listening tonight think about  these human beings that honestly don't deserve to be caught between our  government, the Mexican Government, and the governments of the southern  tip of North America. NAFTA and CAFTA have to be renegotiated and  workers of this continent have to be respected.   We have to treat people like human beings and there must be a legal  system that protects them all. ``God Bless America'' and God bless this  continent.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 6 o'clock and 28 minutes  p.m.), the House adjourned until tomorrow, Friday, June 15, 2018, at 9  a.m.                            ____________________
