 Madam Speaker, constituents, Democrats, Republicans, and  Independents alike, have told me that they feel that our political  system is rigged against working, middle-class, and low-income  Americans. And in many ways, they are right.   It is rigged by politicians who make it harder to vote, and it is  rigged by massive corporations that fund candidates who will give them  tax breaks and access to Washington.   H.R. 1 will move our country forward. It will ensure every American  can cast a ballot, end partisan gerrymandering, and reduce the  influence of the ultrawealthy, corporations, and special interests. And  it will allow us to finally get to work on the issues that matter most  to my constituents: creating an economy that works for all, providing  healthcare to all, and combating climate change.   As part of this effort, I am proud to introduce a bill that will help  working Americans make it to the voting booth. By requiring every State  to hold at least 15 days of early voting, this measure will raise  turnout and make our elections fairer and more representative of our  people.   Let's return government to the people. Let's pass H.R. 1 right away.                            ____________________
