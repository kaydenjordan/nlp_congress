 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 580 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 580         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to take from the Speaker's table the concurrent       resolution (H. Con. Res. 71) establishing the congressional       budget for the United States Government for fiscal year 2018       and setting forth the appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal       years 2019 through 2027, with the Senate amendment thereto,       and to consider in the House, without intervention of any       point of order, a motion offered by the chair of the       Committee on the Budget or her designee that the House concur       in the Senate amendment. The Senate amendment and the motion       shall be considered as read. The motion shall be debatable       for one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on the Budget. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       motion to adoption without intervening motion.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, it is budget day. I don't know if you were  as excited about that when you got out of bed this morning as I was,  but, to be fair, I sit on the Budget Committee.   I have the great honor of serving on the Rules Committee, and that is  why I have the great honor of bringing this rule to the floor today.  But I serve on the Rules Committee by night. By day, I serve on the  Budget Committee with my friend Mr. Pascrell and others, and we have  been working since January to produce a budget for the United States of  America.   I have got to tell you, Mr. Speaker, we produced a whale of a budget  coming out of the House Rules Committee. You remember that budget, you  supported that budget. We did a fantastic collaborative job bringing  that budget to the floor, and then it went to the United States Senate.   Now, you know how this happens, Mr. Speaker. We all grew up watching,  ``I am just a bill sitting here on Capitol Hill. Well, it is a long,  long journey to the capital city, it is a long, long wait while I am  sitting in committee.'' We all know the song from our childhood.   It is a long process to move a bill through, and nine times out of  ten, it comes back differently from the United States Senate than the  way we sent it over there.   Well, Mr. Speaker, we have an opportunity today by concurring with  the Senate amendment, and if we pass this rule, that is what we will  have an opportunity to do. If we pass this rule, we will have an  opportunity to have the debate, concur in the Senate amendment, and  bring a unified budget to the floor.   Now, what does that mean, Mr. Speaker?   We have already been working on appropriations bills this cycle, and  for the uninitiated, that is the bulk of the Federal spending that goes  on. All of the mandatory spending that you and I both know about, Mr.  Speaker, Medicare, Social Security, those important income support  programs on which so many Americans depend, that money is already going  out the door.   So today what we have an opportunity to do in passing this budget is  to create what they call reconciliation instructions, because contained  inside this unified budget of which the House and the Senate agree are  reconciliation instructions that allow us to bring what I believe will  be the most comprehensive, fundamental reform of our Tax Code since Tip  O'Neill and Ronald Reagan did it in 1986.   Since 1986, 4 decades ago, Mr. Speaker, we have an opportunity today  to do something that no other Congress has been able to do since I have  been an adult, and I am excited about that opportunity.   Now, to be fair, we are going to have a lot of disagreement about how  to get that done. That is not the debate we are having today. For any  of my colleagues or anybody back home, Mr. Speaker, who is worried that  right here in this debate on a Wednesday, we are going to sort out our  entire Tax Code, fear not, fear not. That is not the debate we are  having today.   The debate we are having today, Mr. Speaker, is will we or will we  not take on the challenge of reforming our Tax Code. I believe that we  will.   The debate that we are going to have today is will we or will we not  confront the fact that America has one of the least competitive tax  codes in the world, but Americans deserve one of the most competitive  tax codes in the world.   The debate we are going to have today, Mr. Speaker, is not about the  details of tax reform, but about the premise of can we do better for  the American people or can we not.   I have the great benefit, Mr. Speaker, of not having to learn what I  know about this Chamber from watching it on TV or reading it in the  headlines. I consider myself very blessed to have the opportunity to  serve among these men and women. If I just had to read about them in  the headlines, I would have a very low opinion of them. I confess, I  would have a low opinion. But because I get to work with these men and  women, Mr. Speaker, I get to see the real commitment to their  constituencies, the real commitment to their home States, the real  desire to deliver on behalf of their constituencies and on behalf of  the United States of America.   We may have a divisive debate today. We sometimes do. But my  prediction here in hour one, Mr. Speaker, is that by the time we leave  this floor, we are going to have an agreement to take on one of the  challenges that no party has been able to take on since Democrats and  Republicans came together in 1986 to get it done.   It is my great hope that we will use that model, that we will repeat  that model, that we will improve upon that model, and that we will  produce something that all of our constituency can be proud of. I know  that America is hungry for tax reform, and I believe we can deliver it  for them.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this rule,  support the underlying concurrence in the Senate amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I had an opportunity to mention at the beginning that we  might be debating the details of the tax reform plan that does not  exist today. I see that we are, in fact, going to do that.   There are a lot of studies out there on this tax reform plan that  does not yet exist, but let me tell you that we can all agree that we  have the single least-competitive Tax Code on the planet today. We can  all agree that with the click of a mouse, a company can transfer its  assets overseas and grow jobs there instead of growing jobs here.    Let us have the debate that we want to have about who should bear the  burden of American taxation. That is a legitimate debate and we should  have it. But let us not have the debate about whether foreign workers  should benefit or American workers should benefit from American  capital, because that answer should be clear in the hearts and minds of  every single Member of this Chamber.   We have an opportunity, Mr. Speaker, to go from worst to first. Now,  I confess that I don't actually expect to get all the way to first. I  will settle for getting up in the top five and getting out of the  bottom five when it comes to being able to lead in this country. But I  want to mention, Mr. Speaker, what I think is a source of frustration  of constituencies on both sides of the aisle, and that is the us- against-them conversation that goes on day in and day out.   I looked at the chart my friend from Massachusetts brought down to  the House floor. It happened to be in university colors of Georgia's  red and black, but I can see that as a representative of all the  hardworking families in my district, that chart didn't do anything to  inspire me about the impact of tax reform going forward.   My friend quoted the Tax Policy Center. Now, The Wall Street Journal  called the Tax Policy Center a shill for those groups that don't want  to see any tax reform of any kind, but that is currently. The Tax  Policy Center has been doing research for a long time. The research my  friend from Massachusetts quoted was a study of a bill that does not  yet exist. The research I am going to quote is of historical tax rates  in this country.   What my friends at the Tax Policy Center said is that about 30  percent of Americans--one-third of Americans--pay no income taxes  today; that the Tax Code, as it exists today, protects them from any  tax liability at all.   Now, what we are proposing when we get into fundamental tax reform,  Mr. Speaker, is to double the standard deduction. For those families  that are already claiming the standard deduction, we are talking about  doubling it. Now, the brackets are still in question, the details are  still in question, but we are talking about doubling the number of  folks who don't have to deal with the IRS at all.   Today, about 30 percent of American families don't pay any income  taxes,  [[Page H8159]]  and that same 30 percent gets a refundable tax credit that rebates to  them their entire Social Security and Medicare contribution that they  make and the entire Social Security and welfare contribution that their  employer makes on their behalf.   Now, these are not my numbers; these are the Tax Policy Center's  numbers, that a full third of Americans aren't paying one penny in  Federal income tax or Federal payroll tax of any kind.                                time  1245    Now, I am not here to debate the wisdom of that, Mr. Speaker. I am  here to tell you that I don't know how much lower I can cut taxes in  that group. I don't know how in the world I can lower the tax burden on  folks who are not only paying no income taxes, but are having all of  their payroll taxes rebated to them also.   Is this a group we should talk about, Mr. Speaker? Should we talk  about folks who are grabbing onto the bottom rung of the economic  ladder and struggling to climb to the top?   We should, and we do.   Should we talk about how it is that the entitlement system, the  benefit system in this country, is trapping people at the bottom of the  ladder and not allowing them to climb to the top?   We should.   I would say to you, Mr. Speaker, that it would be misleading to the  American public to suggest that this tax bill is focusing its attention  in one direction instead of another direction. The fact simply is that  I can't lower taxes any more at the bottom of the spectrum.   We are talking about lowering taxes on corporations. That doesn't  inspire many people. I have that conversation regularly: Rob, what in  the world are you doing lowering taxes on corporations?   I support the FairTax, and in the spirit of folks who are not  particularly enthusiastic about tax reform, I am not in that camp. I am  enthusiastic about tax reform. I just thought there was a better way. I  couldn't get the votes to have my better way done.   My better way is the FairTax, and what I would say to you is  corporations don't pay taxes. Corporations do not pay taxes. They  collect taxes from their consumers in the form of higher prices, from  their employees in the form of lower wages, or from their shareholders  in the form of lower capital--lower capital returns.   Now, lest you think: Rob, you are just a conservative Republican from  the Deep South. What do you know about this?   I will again quote the Tax Policy Center, which says that a full 20  percent of the corporate income tax burden falls on workers. Fair  enough. If we want to argue about where the tax rates are going to end  up and how the cuts are going to look and what the policies are going  to be, let's have that debate.   Let us not mislead the American people into believing there is a free  lunch anywhere in this Tax Code. We have an opportunity to move from  worst to first, and every single American, regardless of their region,  regardless of their politics, is going to benefit from that change.  They benefited from it when Democrats and Republicans came together to  do it in 1986, and they will benefit from it when we come together and  get it done today, as I believe that we will. We must.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, if you have wondered what kind of passion we have on the  Budget Committee, I will just once again recognize how much I enjoy  serving with my friend from New Jersey on  [[Page H8161]]  the Budget Committee. Everything you just heard from him was from the  heart. I get to hear it in committee day in and day out, and I will  tell you, we end up with a better product as a result of that. It is a  legitimate debate to have about the State and local tax deduction. It  is perfectly legitimate.   There are those from low-tax jurisdictions that ask: Why would the  Federal Government and the Federal taxpayer want to subsidize those  States that are higher-tax jurisdictions? There are those jurisdictions  that are low-tax jurisdictions.   Because the gentleman's constituency in New Jersey makes so much  money, they pay so much more in Federal income taxes. And States like  mine in Georgia, States like Alabama, States like Mississippi are the  beneficiary of those dollars as the Federal Government distributes  them. Undeniably, there is a case to be made on both sides of this  issue.    The falsehood, Mr. Speaker, is to suggest that we are deciding that  issue today. We are not. We are not.   I don't blame any of my colleagues for fighting for their  constituency at the height of their ability, at the highest vocal point  of their capability, because issues are, at their core, local and  personal to each and every one of us.   We are going to have to have this conversation and we are going to  have to sort it out, and I believe it is not going to be a partisan  conversation. In fact, I know it is not going to be a partisan  conversation.   I know Republicans who share my friend from New Jersey's opinion, and  I know Democrats who share Shelley Moore Capito's opinion on the Senate  side. We know this to be true. We are going to sort this issue out, Mr.  Speaker.   What I fear, though, is that emotions are going to run so high that  we are going to miss an opportunity to figure these things out. For  example, to conflate personal deductions with business deductions is to  create confusion where there needn't be any.   Every business in America can deduct the meals that they serve  throughout their day as a business expense. I will share with the  gentleman that my family cannot deduct our meals from our income taxes.   Every business out there that has rented an apartment somewhere in  order to conduct business, they can deduct that rent from their income  taxes as a business expense. I will share with my friend, in the great  State of Georgia, I am unable to deduct my rent as a business expense  from my income tax.   There is just a fundamental difference between families and  businesses, and that fundamental difference goes back to what I said at  the very beginning, and that is there is only one taxpayer in this  country. It is not Walmart, it is not Apple, it is not Microsoft. It is  the American consumer. We are the only ones. At the end of the day, the  buck stops with each and every American family.   The debate over how to structure a corporate income Tax Code, Mr.  Speaker, is perfectly legitimate. To suggest that the fact that the  personal code and the business code look different and that is somehow  nefarious is to deny what is just now over 100 years of income tax  policy in this country.                                time  1300     I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey.    Reclaiming my time from my friend, Mr. Speaker, what you  hear is absolutely right. I want to make that clear. Everybody is  entitled to their own opinion; they are not entitled to their own  facts. The words my friend is reading are absolutely accurate. What  they are not are absolutely binding. That is what they are not.   What this is is such a personal and important issue to folks on both  sides of it that it got its own personal line out of the United States  Senate.   I can't even get nominations out of the United States Senate, Mr.  Speaker. I am sitting here trying to staff out region four down in the  great State of Georgia. Folks are delaying debate. Folks won't let me  get my people in place.   This is so important to the United States Senate that it came with  its own line.   Mr. Speaker, I don't want to diminish the importance of this issue on  either side. What I do want to insist upon, though, is that it will not  be decided during this hour today; and I want to insist, Mr. Speaker,  that it will not be decided on partisan lines.   I would just ask of you, Mr. Speaker, and of my friends here on the  floor, we have two things we can do with our voices: we can either sow  consensus, or we can sow discontent.   I know that we are passionate about these things in which we believe,  but to suggest, Mr. Speaker, that we are not going to come together and  sort it out and do the very best we can for Americans is to sell this  institution short and is to further the misunderstanding, the  misimpression, the misinformation that the media sends out about us  every day. I know we are better than that, and I am proud to be a voice  saying that here on the floor today, Mr. Speaker.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   We have heard a lot about the distributional analysis of tax reform,  and, as I have suggested, it is hard to do. Folks who make a whole lot  of money, like my friend from New Jersey's constituency, they pay a  whole lot more in taxes. I hope that one day my constituency makes as  much money as my friend from New Jersey's constituency, and if we can  stimulate the economy the way that I believe that this tax proposal  will, we are going to have a shot at getting that done.   But we have to have these conversations about limiting tax deductions  for the wealthiest Americans if we are going to solve the issues that  my friends have raised. And reading right out of that Senate budget  report, the whole purpose of considering the State and local tax  deduction and considering modifying it, capping it, eliminating it,  whatever you want to insert there, Mr. Speaker, is designed around  limiting those tax deductions that only benefit the wealthiest among  us--that only benefit the wealthiest among us. That is the conversation  that folks are trying to have.   Again, Mr. Speaker, there is so much more that we agree on than that  we disagree on in this Chamber. But it appears, time and time again, we  come to the House floor and focus, in the most shrill voices, on the 20  percent of those things that divide us instead of the 80 percent of  those things that we could come together and deliver on for our  constituency.   Tax reform doesn't have to pass with 51 votes in the Senate. We move  reconciliation bills through the Senate with 60 votes. We have moved  them through the Senate with 70 votes. We have moved them through the  Senate with 80 votes.   Growing the American economy, Mr. Speaker, is a commonsense goal that  is shared in every single region and in every single political quarter.  Let's not make this about us here. Let's make this about our bosses  back home. We can, and we should, and I believe that we will.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  to agree with some of what my friend had to say.   There will be absolutely no family that goes untouched. If you would  like to go to the Council of Economic Advisers web page, Mr. Speaker,  you can see their most recent report, which suggests, on average,  $4,000 in additional wages for every wage earner in this country, every  family in this country, making a difference for economic growth.   We all know that economic growth matters. More jobs mean more  pressure on labor. More pressure on labor means higher wages. Higher  wages mean more income for the Federal Government in taxes and more  income for families to put into their pocket.   We are hearing about zombies and surprises and tricks. You can tell  that Halloween is right around the corner, and scaring folks is kind of  the tagline of Halloween, Mr. Speaker; and, sadly, that is what we see  going on here today.   I promise you, you have not heard a single bipartisan word about this  tax plan from my friends on the other side, so I am going to provide  those words for my friends. I will read from yesterday's Wall Street  Journal, Mr. Speaker: ``In 2012, President Obama and his advisers  proposed lowering the corporate tax rate because it `creates good jobs  and good wages for the middle class folks who work at those  businesses.' ''                                time  1315    We can argue about what the tax reform ought to look like. What we  can't argue about is the benefit for American families of tax reform.   In 2013, Lawrence Summers, President Clinton's Treasury Secretary and  [[Page H8163]]  Chairman of President Obama's Economic Council, argued that the tax on  corporate profit creates a burden without commensurate revenues for the  government, and that changing it is as close to a free lunch for the  American taxpayer as reformers will ever get. That was President  Obama's Treasury Secretary.   Again, we can argue about what it looks like. What we can't argue  about is what it is intended to do and what leading experts believe it  will do. In 2015, Democrat Chuck Schumer and Republican Rob Portman  cosponsored a Senate bill to reduce the top corporate tax rate, which  is the highest of the 35 countries in the OECD today.   As Chuck Schumer says: ``Our international tax system creates  incentives to send jobs and stash profits overseas, rather than  creating jobs and economic growth here in the United States.'' We can  fix that together, and we will fix that together.   Bill Clinton, in 2016, said he regretted raising the corporate tax  rate to its current level for exactly those reasons.   Who is advantaged by trying to persuade the American people that  something nefarious is going on here? Who is advantaged by that? I  don't know about my friend's constituencies, Mr. Speaker, but my  constituency wants to believe we are making things work together. My  constituency wants to believe in rolling up our sleeves and sorting  things out together. My constituency wants to believe that we are  united in making a difference for them together.   We have this opportunity. If we pass this rule and we concur in the  underlying Senate amendment, we will move forward on tax reform that  will leave no American family behind.   The best government program we have in this country is the program  that allows jobs to develop so folks can have one. The best program we  have in this country, Mr. Speaker, is one that allows wages to rise so  that folks can earn more. My constituency is not looking for anything  from the other side of the aisle except cooperation on freeing up the  marketplace so that my constituency can go to work, so that folks can  go and make their own pathway and future forward. We can do it in ways  we haven't done together since 1986, Mr. Speaker.   Who is advantaged by convincing folks that cooperation, consensus,  making a different together is dead? I don't believe anyone. In fact, I  would tell you that not just the debate but the body politic is damaged  by those concerns, Mr. Speaker.   Mr. Speaker, I hope we will join together and refute those. I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I actually want to associate myself to my friend from Wisconsin's  comments. I can't disagree with a word he said right up until it got to  the end where he said to vote against the budget. Right up until there,  we were on the same page.   There is so much that we could do together. My friend spoke out on  behalf of small businesses and family farmers. As the Tax Code exists  today, when you see my friends put up charts about tax benefits going  to the top 1 percent, they are talking about those small business and  family farmers. They are talking about that small business in my  district that has plowed every single penny back into the business-- back into the business for new technology to make their employees more  productive, back into the business to open up a new facility, back into  the business to add more distribution, because they have got 350  families who depend on them to make that business successful so that  those 350 families can put food on their table.   But when the Tax Code is analyzed, Mr. Speaker, when the IRS sends  back the statistics, that small business in my district that sends  every single penny back into the business, they look rich. They look  like they are the wealthiest, and they are not. They are those small  family farmers. They are those small family businesses that are trying  to make a difference.   I want to say, because my friend from Wisconsin had a very  significant concern about blowing holes in deficits, Mr. Speaker, as  you know from your experience, one cannot pass tax reform that is  permanent through reconciliation if it adds to deficits in the out  years. That is what is so wonderful about this process, Mr. Speaker. I  support what my friend from Wisconsin said about keeping an eye on  deficits. I  [[Page H8164]]  support what my friend said about making sure Medicare and Social  Security are growing, which they do when people go back to work and  when folks earn more money.   I don't want to be in the business of lecturing my colleagues, Mr.  Speaker. I want to be in the business of working with my colleagues.  But folks have a choice when they show up to work every day. Are we  going to make this a day about arguing with one another? Are we going  to tear something down today? Are we going to build something up today?  I stand for building something today, Mr. Speaker. Unabashedly, let's  build something together today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds to say I don't  want to sneak anything past anybody. I want to claim full and total  credit for what we are about to do together. I don't want anybody to be  confused about whose fault it is. It is my fault.   When we get tax reform and get this economy growing again, blame me.  When we can see wages rising in this country again, blame me. When we  have an opportunity to go from worst to first in the international  business community, blame me.   I don't want anybody to believe there is anybody hiding here, Mr.  Speaker.   I share with my friend from Massachusetts that I do not have any  speakers remaining, and I am prepared to close when he is. Truth needs  no defense, I would say to my friend.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, sometimes I wish I could bring school groups down here  onto the House floor just to help the next generation understand why we  face some of the challenges that we face. We are down here today  confronted with a tax bill that folks are certain is going to give away  everything to everybody whom they don't want it to go to, and we are  down here confronted with the fact that there is  [[Page H8165]]  no tax bill whatsoever to look at and it is going to get sprung on  folks with absolutely no notice and no ability to read it.   Now, either one of those things could be true. It happens to be that  neither of those things is true. But how in the world do folks  listening to this debate think that we are advancing the cause of  reform?   Deficits do matter, to my friend's point. They do matter, and the  stranglehold that the Obama regulatory economy created here in America  on economic growth reduced economic GDP growth by a full one-third--by  a full one-third.   For every 0.1 percent of GDP growth, we talk about 200 billion  additional dollars coming in to the Treasury over the 10-year window.  So a full percentage point that we have lost is $2 trillion coming in  to the Treasury.   Mr. Speaker, if we had Bush-era growth instead of Obama-era growth  over these last 5 years, the budget would be balanced today. But we are  where we are, and the question is: Can we do better tomorrow? We can.   Now, before I talk about that, Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize some  of the folks who helped to get us here. My friend from Massachusetts  and I come down here and carry the debate, but the work goes on behind  every single one of these doors and in every single one of these  committee rooms.   I serve on the Budget Committee, Mr. Speaker, and our staff director  over there, Rick May, has done an amazing job shepherding this process,  standing up for the House's work product.   Jenna Spealman, Andy Morton, Tim Flynn, Robert Cogan, Patrick Louis  Knudsen, Jim Bates, Mary Popadiuk, Jonathan Romito, and Elise Anderson  are all working day and night--and weekends, many times--to get this  product to the floor.   Steve Gonzalez, Eric Davis, Robert Yeakel, Ellen Johnson, Emily Goff,  Brad Watson, Brittany Madni, and Steve Waskiewicz are folks, Mr.  Speaker, who don't come here because they have political passion; they  come here because they have policy passion. They want to do those  things that matter. They could go anywhere they want to in town and  make more money, but they stay here working for the American people  because they believe they can make a difference, and they are right.   Mr. Speaker, they are right. They can make a difference. We can make  a difference. This rule--this rule--if we pass it today, Mr. Speaker,  will allow us to concur in the Senate amendment. Concurring in the  Senate amendment does not bind us to the Senate process, but it enables  us to move a bill that direction that they can process.   We have seen the holdups in the Senate, Mr. Speaker. I am not happy  about that. That is just the way Senate process is. We can do better.  Reconciliation allows us to do better, and passing this rule enables us  to do better.   Vote ``yes,'' Mr. Speaker. Vote ``yes'' on this rule, and vote  ``yes'' on the underlying budget and open yourself up to doing together  what has not been done together in 31 years. I don't just believe we  can, I believe that we will. I am excited about it, I am proud of it,  and I am ready to get to it, Mr. Speaker.   Vote ``yes.''    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
