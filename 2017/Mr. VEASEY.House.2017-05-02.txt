 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Reverend  Dr. N.L. Robinson, the longtime pastor of Mount Olive Baptist Church  who passed away last Friday.   Reverend Robinson proudly served our Nation in the Army during World  War II and was honorably discharged on November 25, 1945. It was during  his time of service that he found spiritual enlightenment in Jesus  Christ and his passion to serve the community.   After leaving the Army, Reverend Robinson worked for the Dallas  Housing Authority from 1946 until he retired in 1976.   A graduate of the Southern Bible Institute of Dallas, Dr. Robinson  began his ministry at St. John Missionary Baptist Church in Grand  Prairie in 1962, and he was also the pastor very briefly at the Lucille  Baptist Church in Palmer, Texas, before jointing Mount Olive in 1966.   Under his guidance, Mount Olive grew to become a 12,000-member  church. I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, that everybody, from the workers  that built the cars at the General Motors plant in Arlington to one of  the past mayors of Arlington, has been a member at that church  throughout time.   I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the life of Reverend N.L.  Robinson, whose spiritual leadership touched so many lives in the  Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington community.                            ____________________
