 Mr. President, I ask to speak as in morning business  for 1 minute.    Mr. President, Gov. Kim Reynolds of my State of Iowa  has unveiled what she calls the ``This is Iowa'' campaign. That  campaign has encouraged people to choose Iowa to live and work.   Iowa has the second lowest unemployment rate in the Nation. As I  travel Iowa with my county meetings, I hear from employers across Iowa  that have high-paying skilled jobs they cannot fill. That is why Iowa  was ranked the No. 1 State to find a job in 2019.   The cost of living is low and the quality of life is second to none.  Check out thisisiowa.com to learn more. In the words of Meredith  Wilson, of ``76 Trombones'' fame, from Mason City, IA: ``You really  ought to give Iowa a try.''   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
