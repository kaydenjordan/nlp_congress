 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2255, a package of  three commonsense solutions, each passed unanimously by the House  Financial Services Committee. I thank Congressman Trott of Michigan for  his leadership in moving this package forward.   One of these solutions is H.R. 3758, the Senior Safe Act, legislation  we introduced to protect seniors from financial fraud and abuse.   Mr. Speaker, one in five American seniors will be a target of  financial abuse, and seniors lose an estimated $2.9 billion to  exploitation. The financial institutions that serve America's seniors  are in a unique position to detect and identify the suspicious patterns  of activity that often accompany financial abuse.   Unfortunately, these institutions do not have the legal flexibility  to report suspicious behavior to law enforcement. Because of this,  financial abuse of our seniors may go unreported and unpunished. That  is why we introduced the Senior Safe Act.   Our bill helps individuals and financial institutions safely  communicate instances of financial fraud involving seniors to the  appropriate law enforcement authority. It creates incentives for firms  to train their employees to identify and stop financial fraud of  seniors. It shields advisers and firms that responsibly disclose  instances of fraud from legal liability. Importantly, it accomplishes  all of this while providing reasonable legal safeguards to ensure  consumers and their data are protected.   Mr. Speaker, it may seem like years, but it was just 4 months ago  that the then-CEO of Equifax came before Congress to testify about the  data breach that exposed the personal information of over 145 million  Americans.                                time  1815    Those who mishandle our private data and breach the public trust must  be held accountable. We must also ensure that we do all we can to  minimize the damage caused by cyber attacks and financial fraud.   As a result of the Equifax data breach, millions of American seniors  are now more vulnerable to financial abuse. It is all but certain that  we will see increased attempts of financial fraud and identity theft.  The Senior Safe Act is an important and responsible step to protecting  those at risk by ensuring that financial institutions can identify  fraud, report it, and stop abuse of the elderly.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Hensarling, Ranking Member Waters, and  Congressman Poliquin from Maine for working with me on this bipartisan  solution to protect seniors from financial fraud and abuse. We are  proud to work across the aisle to get things done, and we will continue  working to protect seniors and get results for Arizona.
