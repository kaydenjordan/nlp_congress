 Mr. President, on Thursday, July 27, due to the sudden  hospitalization of my mother, it was necessary for me to leave  Washington before the Senate concluded voting on the National Defense  Authorization Act. My Congressional Record statement explaining my  absence that afternoon is included below.   While I was present for the vast majority of votes on the National  Defense Authorization Act, I was forced to miss four due to my  unexpected and sudden departure. The outcomes of these votes were  unaffected by my absence, but I wish for the Record to reflect how I  would have voted had I not left to be with my mother in Pennsylvania:  yea on Schatz amendment 1078, vote No. 209; yea on Rubio amendment 523,  vote No. 210; yea on Reed amendment 1087, vote No. 211; and yea on  passage of the bill, the National Defense Authorization Act, vote No.  212.   My mother, Ellen Harding Casey, died peacefully at Regional Hospital,  Scranton on August 11. I was grateful to have the chance to be with her  during her final illness.                                                      July 27, 2023.                 MISSED VOTES FOR FAMILY MEDICAL EMERGENCY          Due to my mother's sudden hospitalization for a       serious illness, I need to leave Washington unexpectedly and       immediately. As a result, I will miss the vote on final       passage of the National Defense Authorization Act, as well as       any remaining amendment votes. I would like the Congressional       Record to reflect that I support final passage of this       legislation. When I return to Washington following the August       work period, I will submit another statement to the Record       detailing how I would have cast my vote on each of the       amendment votes I was forced to miss.                            ____________________
