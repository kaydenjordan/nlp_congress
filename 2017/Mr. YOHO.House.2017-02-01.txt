 Mr. Speaker, I stand here today in support of the  livelihood of an entire region of our country and industry that was  unfairly targeted by the Obama administration in pursuit of an  ideological agenda to do away with our Nation's abundant coal  resources.   The previous administration targeted the coal industry and, by  extension, the hardworking Americans employed by the industry under the  guise of protecting the environment. We all want clear air and water  for our Nation's prosperity, but this rule is so strict, it makes it  impossible for companies to continue to operate. It results in layoffs,  closed businesses, and ultimately an entire region unemployed.   Our Nation is blessed with an abundance of natural resources and we  should utilize them all: oil, hydropower, wind, solar, and yes, clean  coal, too. We must be prudent about how we regulate our energy  industries because when one sector is pushed out, it is the moms and  dads at the end of the month paying their electric bill that feel the  impact the most. All Americans will be affected, but it will be felt  more by the ones who can least afford it.   That is why I am opposed to the rule, and I urge my colleagues to  support the CRA.
