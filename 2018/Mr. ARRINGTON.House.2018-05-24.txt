 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a very special  group who will celebrate their 75th anniversary this Saturday in  Sweetwater, Texas: the Women Airforce Service Pilots.   When the forces of fascism and totalitarianism were upending the  entire global order, it took every ounce of our Nation's measure and  every man and woman to win World War II.   Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, 28 female pilots volunteered to  form America's first female squadron. From 1942 to 1944, over 1,000  women trained to fly ``the Army way'' at Avenger Airfield in west  Texas.   As the first women to fly American military aircraft, they logged  more than 60 million flight hours, flying every plane in the military's  arsenal. They ferried equipment, towed gunnery targets, and flight- tested aircraft, serving at over 120 bases across America so we could  win the war abroad.   These brave ladies were vital to the war effort and, ultimately, to  our victory. Seventy-five years later, their legacy continues to  inspire us all.   God bless these female freedom fighters who served with less  recognition than their male counterparts at the time, but with no less  honor and distinction.   God bless America, and go west Texas.                            ____________________
