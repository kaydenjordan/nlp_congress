 Madam Speaker, as a woman, as a feminist, as  someone who lettered in basketball and truly believes in women's  sports, this is the Equality Act. Any misrepresentation by some  speakers today is just totally unfounded.   While we have made much progress in recent years, the reality is that  many still face discrimination simply because of who they are and who  they love. That means that LGBTQ Americans can be fired, refused  housing, or denied services simply because of who they are.   I am a proud original cosponsor, and I am also a woman of faith. I  know that this Equality Act would help greatly to extend civil rights  and civil liberties for the LGBTQ community, to live out the true  meaning of our Nation's creed, free from the fear of harassment or  discrimination.   Updating Federal law will provide protections across key areas of  life, including employment, housing, and access to public spaces and  services. This bill has nothing to do with abortion, nothing to do with  some of the things my colleagues across the aisle have said.   And in my home State of Texas, we will finally have protections for  the LGBTQ Texans.   MR. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The Democrats just said that this bill doesn't harm Title IX. They  have said it will not hinder women's ability to participate in sports.  That is just not true.   They say it is not going to make it harder for women to participate  in sports. It may not make it harder, but it is sure going to make it  more difficult to win. We know that. That is the problem. And if that  doesn't undermine the spirit of Title IX, I don't know what does.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Roy).
