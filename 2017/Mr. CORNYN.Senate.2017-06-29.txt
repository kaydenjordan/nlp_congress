 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I want to come to the floor to talk about  healthcare, a subject I know the Presiding Officer feels passionate  about as a medical doctor. But before I delve into the healthcare  debate, I want to discuss briefly two important bipartisan pieces of  legislation that I have been working on with my colleagues across the  aisle and that are moving forward today.   I know the strange thing about this place--by ``this place'' I mean  Washington, DC--is that the bipartisan work we are able to do rarely  gets much attention. What gets attention in the news is when we fight  over controversial topics, but bipartisan legislation that actually  helps people and that gets done here is rarely heralded or even  noticed. So I think it is worth highlighting a couple of examples  today.   Today, in the Senate Judiciary Committee, we passed the Abolish Human  Trafficking Act, which I introduced with Senator Klobuchar. As the  father of two daughters, I am always reminded of the profile of a  victim of human trafficking in this country, a girl between the ages of  12 and 14 years old, who perhaps has run away from home. Who knows what  the circumstances are at home? But they are looking for a better life,  only to find themselves in too many instances exploited and the victims  of human trafficking.   This bill reauthorizes several critical trafficking victims  protection act programs that help fight the scourge of trafficking so  that survivors can get the help they need and our law enforcement  officers can go after the perpetrators of this terrible crime.   A vital provision of this bill is an extension of the Domestic  Trafficking Victims Fund, which provides critical resources that  victims need to recover from this crime. Part of the fund is financed  through fines collected on convicted traffickers, and last year it  provided almost $5 million in services for victims. Let me dwell on  that for just a minute.   When I was privileged to be attorney general of the State of Texas,  part of the job was to administer the Crime Victims' Compensation Fund.  This was a fund into which fines and penalties of people convicted of  criminal acts went into the Crime Victims' Compensation Fund, so we  could then use grants for the victims of crime to help them recover.  That is exactly the kind of model we created with the Domestic  Trafficking Victims Fund. My hope is that over time it will produce  more money that will be available to help the victims of human  trafficking to a greater extent. That is the idea, and these are not  tax dollars, so that is an additional benefit. It is actually the fines  and penalties of the perpetrators that go into this fund that then help  the victims to heal.   This bill also makes the Human Trafficking Advisory Council permanent  so that the group of survivors who advise people like us on what  additional tools are needed to combat trafficking can continue to do  so.   On the preventive end, this legislation lends a hand to our Nation's  law enforcement so they can track down perpetrators of the crime and  bring them to justice. It implements screening protocols for the  Department of  [[Page S3845]]  Homeland Security so that law enforcement officials at every level know  how to spot trafficking victims and how to respond. This is actually a  really important element of fighting human trafficking.   A few years ago, when we had the Super Bowl in Dallas, TX, I was  shocked to learn that the Super Bowl is one of the largest human  trafficking events during the year. That is pretty sobering and,  frankly, disgusting. Training people, including law enforcement, to be  able to identify victims of human trafficking, some of whom may not  consider themselves a victim until it is too late, only to find  themselves a victim of modern day human slavery--but being able to  identify victims of trafficking so that we can get law enforcement  involved and get them rescued is a big, important part of fighting this  crime.   In the long run, this legislation requires the Department of Justice  to implement a national strategy to reduce the demand of human  trafficking by essentially putting the johns--the people who buy sex  from trafficking victims--out of service. This is a cause that clearly  crosses partisan lines, and it is literally a nonpartisan issue.   I am glad we are making progress on this. I am thankful for the  bipartisan support of my colleague from Minnesota, Senator Klobuchar,  as well as the Judiciary Committee members like the chairman, Senator  Grassley, and the ranking member, Senator Feinstein, and many other  Members on both sides who are cosponsors.
