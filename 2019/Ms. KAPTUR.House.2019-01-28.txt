 Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to join my remarks along  with those of Congressman   Steve Cohen of Tennessee to reach our  beloved colleague, Walter Jones of the Third District of North  Carolina, and his family as they walk through these difficult days. I  wish to say thank you to the people of North Carolina for sending such  an honorable and dignified gentleman to this House to serve for over  two decades, 12 terms.   I can remember how hard Walter worked when Hurricane Florence hit-- his district includes the Outer Banks of North Carolina--and spending  his time with the citizens of his district.   I can't count the number of times he talked about Marine Corps Base  Camp Lejeune, and I can't think of anyone who fought harder for  veterans or those in our military than Walter Jones. He is such a man  of conscience and such a moral man. I know that the weight of this  country's concerns fell on him very heavily.   Walter, if you are listening to our words this evening, know that we  walk with you in spirit. We know you are a man of deep faith, and we  know that that faith will carry you through all of the most difficult  shoals of life.   We miss you very much on this floor, but we can see your presence and  feel your presence. It lingers and lasts among us. Know that we walk  with you.   We hope you can hear our words, and we ask God to bless you, to bless  your family, and to give you His everlasting strength.  [[Page H1236]]                                ____________________
