 Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman, who is doing a great  job as chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, for yielding.   Madam Chair, what should be crystal clear by now is that our friends  across the aisle do not have solutions to the energy crisis. For the  last 4 years, Democrats have controlled both Chambers of Congress, but  in that time, not one single piece of serious legislation was ever  introduced which would have lowered the cost of energy. After seeing  costs rise for years on end, voters decided that they had had enough  and elected Republicans to solve this crisis.    In 2019, a gallon of gas cost just over $2. Today, it costs almost  $4. The price of groceries has gone up, as the price of energy to ship  and keep them cool has gone up as well. Some items have seen as high as  a 55 percent increase.   What has been done to help ease energy costs?   What solutions do my friends across the aisle have?   As a result of President Biden's Infrastructure Investment and Jobs  Act, the United States pumped $75.8 billion of taxpayer money into  unreliable green tech. Besides that, Americans have pumped trillions of  both public and private dollars into these industries for decades, but  solar and wind combined still only make up 10 percent of American  electricity generation.   Instead of making existing technology more affordable, this  administration and its allies in Congress dumped billions of dollars  into technologies that cannot provide reliable and dispatchable energy  to even a fraction of the country. This so-called solution has done  nothing to lower costs for the average American. We have higher costs.  There is more potential for rolling brownouts. This is the best that my  friends across the aisle can do.   An intelligent person would think, why not continue to invest in  affordable and proven technology while we are waiting for these  alternatives to become viable?   They might be in the future at some point. That is great. But right  now it is only 10 percent of our national electrical production.   The PJM Interconnection, for example, which is a grid that services  over 65 million people, has announced that they will be short 26  percent of their total energy obligations because radical  environmentalists are retiring energy sources while providing no  reliable backups.                                time  1500    EPA also recently finalized what they are calling the ``Good  Neighbor'' rule by denying 26 different State plans to conform to EPA  ozone regulations.   This denial means that 26 States, including my State of Colorado,  will have sources of energy generation completely shut down while  having no viable backup whatsoever.   This decision guarantees that costs and shortages will continue to  increase for the American people with no end in sight.   Maintaining affordable energy is crucial to our way of life. It is  what keeps water treatment plants open. It is what keeps hospitals  open. It is what keeps traffic lights, libraries, schools, trucks,  ships, and airplanes operating.   When the cost of powering these essential processes go up, costs go  up. If the grid shuts down, everything relying upon it goes down. This  will have catastrophic consequences.   Those of us around the country have seen what happens in places like  California with its unrealistic energy policies and want nothing to do  with it. High prices and shortages come with overregulation.   Let's face the facts: Current green tech cannot come anywhere close  to powering our Nation right now or in the foreseeable future.   The Energy Information Administration expects fossil fuel demand to  continue rising, not decreasing, beyond the year 2050.   Ironically, as an aside, fossil fuel industries have always made a  higher profit when there is a Democratic President because of the  increased per barrel price of oil, but that is just an aside.   Republicans also aren't neglecting permitting realities by ignoring  unused drilling permits. We simply recognize that those permits on  their own are insufficient to generate investment and production,  especially when this administration is doing everything it can to  discourage the producers of conventional energy.   What should be clear in this debate is that Republicans are the ones  who know how energy works, and we are passing legislation.   H.R. 1 is serious legislation that will lower costs. I urge my  colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill.
