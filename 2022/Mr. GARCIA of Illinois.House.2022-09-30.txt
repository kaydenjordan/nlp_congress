 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to honor  Lieutenant Colonel William Luna. He passed away on August 8 of this  year and played a significant role in Chicago's Mexican Independence  Day Parade for several years.   Born Guillermo Luna, he was raised in East Chicago, Indiana, by his  aunt after his parents passed away.   William was a patriot, an educator, and an active member of the  community. He was a Green Beret and jumpmaster who served our country  in the U.S. Army's 2nd Airborne 505 Infantry and later joined the Army  Reserves.   His passion for boxing earned him the U.S. Golden Gloves boxing  championship in 1958.   Bill was a fierce advocate for the recognition of the contributions  of Latinos, particularly Mexican Americans, in the military.   A lover of history and education, Bill earned a master's degree in  English and later became an adjunct professor of Mexican history and  minority studies at the Indiana University Northwest.   His knowledge of Mexican-American history led Chicago's Channel 7 to  invite Bill to be a cohost of the Mexican Independence Day Parade  broadcast for 7 years.   We will always remember him. Rest in peace, Lieutenant Colonel  William ``Bill'' Luna.                            ____________________
