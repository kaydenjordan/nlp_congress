 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  Chambersburg High School on winning the PIAA boys' track and field  championship this past week at Shippensburg University.   Under the leadership of Coach Bob Walker, Chambersburg outdistanced  their competition on the way to scoring 48 points and claiming the  team's first-ever State championship.   Coach Walker has consistently worked with student athletes to  demonstrate that there are no shortcuts to success. Practice, hard  work, and determination are the hallmarks of what has made this an  incredible team.   Chambersburg's commitment to academic excellence is an example of how  student athletes can be supported both on and off the track.   On behalf of the people of Pennsylvania's 13th Congressional  District, I congratulate the Chambersburg High School Trojans and wish  them every continued success.                            ____________________
