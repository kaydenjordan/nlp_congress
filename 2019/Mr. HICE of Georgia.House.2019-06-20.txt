 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today because of my deep concerns over our  national debt.   At a time when our Federal debt exceeds $22 trillion, I believe it is  time that we make every effort possible to rein in spending so that we  are not shackling future generations with this burden.   Division C of H.R. 3055 funds the EPA, Department of the Interior,  and other land management agencies at $37.4 billion and increases  spending by $1.6 billion over fiscal year 2019 levels.   The spending level in this division is 23.6 percent over the  President's budget request. That is almost $7 billion over the request,  Mr. Chairman. We are not even close.   Without question, there are areas within these Federal agencies that  need improvement. For example, we need desperately to fix the National  Park Service maintenance backlog, and I commend Ranking Member Bishop  for his diligent work on that effort, and would urge passage, and at  least bring to the floor his thoughtful and cost-effective bill to  address that issue. But at the end of the day, the bottom line is our  constituents back home are required week after week, month after month  to make tough choices when it comes to planning their own household  budgets, and we need to do the same right here in Congress.   My proposed amendment will reduce spending levels to the President's  original budget request so that, just like our constituents back home,  we go back to the table, we go back to the drawing board, and we make  those same tough decisions.   Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of my amendment to rein in spending,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
