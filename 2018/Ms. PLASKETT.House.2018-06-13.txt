 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5294, the Treating Barriers to  Prosperity Act of 2018, introduced by subcommittee Chairman Barletta  and subcommittee Ranking Member Titus.   The Appalachian Regional Commission, or ARC, as it is known, has made  significant progress in addressing the persistent poverty and economic  despair in Appalachia. However, the current opioid epidemic sweeping  the Nation threatens ARC's progress.   The high rates of substance abuse and mortality in Appalachia  compared to the rest of the United States is a serious impediment to  sustained economic growth.   Employers are seeking a healthy workforce when making decisions about  where they will locate their businesses. High rates of substance abuse  and mortality make it difficult for employers to find and hire  qualified candidates.                                time  1400    Appalachia continues to face significant disparities in its journey  to catch up to the rest of the Nation with respect to educational  attainment, employment, income, and health outcomes. Sadly, the scourge  of opioid abuse in Appalachia makes the road only that much longer.   The opioid mortality and overdose rates in Appalachia are shocking,  with rates in West Virginia reaching three times the national rate.  Moreover, drug abuse jeopardizes the region's ability to retain and  attract economic development with a high-performing workforce that is  healthy and drug-free. The cycle of despair only continues.   Unfortunately, this tragic backdrop highlights the failed campaign  promises of President Trump. President Trump campaigned about the  scourge of opioids and how he would designate the opioid crisis as a  national emergency and combat the problem.   However, the President did not declare this epidemic an emergency  under the Stafford Act and provided little to no new funding to combat  this epidemic. Instead, the administration named White House adviser  Kellyanne Conway, a former pollster with no public health background,  as the administration's point person on the opioid crisis.   The opioid epidemic is a full-blown crisis that demands Congress'  attention. Because President Trump refuses to take substantive action,  Congress must take the lead on this issue.   The ARC, in its mission to promote economic development in the  region, has always understood the grave threat of opioid addiction to  the economic viability of the region.   I am grateful and thankful that this bill provides funding  specifically focused on impediments to job creation and economic  development; ensures the States in Appalachia can effectively share  best practices; and ties in clearer authority to attract health-based  businesses, workers, and technology to the region.   While the ARC's existing authority has provided ARC the ability to  support certain efforts to combat the  [[Page H5117]]  opioid crisis, clarifying and strengthening that role is critical to  economic development in the region.   We are grateful that the Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure has been able to step in in this area of economic  development and job creation, but we must do more throughout the  country, not just with opioids but with other drug issues and the  related scourge in this country.   I applaud Ranking Member Titus for taking the issue seriously and  being an original cosponsor of this bill. This bill will address some  of the impacts of drug abuse on economic development in the Appalachian  region. I support this bill, and urge my colleagues to support this  measure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
