 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Binghamton  Rumble Ponies, the Double-A affiliate of the New York Mets, who  recently invited me to throw out the first pitch at their Fourth of  July celebration.   Previously known as the Binghamton Mets, this is the first season  that the Rumble Ponies have galloped onto the field at NYSEG Stadium  with their new name.   Binghamton, New York, has the unique distinction of being the  carousel capital of the world. While there are fewer than 170 antique  carousels in the United States and Canada, 6 of them are in Binghamton  and the surrounding region. It is this proud local distinction to which  the Rumble Ponies owe their name.   I also had the pleasure of watching the game with Jeff Wilpon, the  owner of the New York Mets. I know I speak for everyone in the Southern  Tier when I say that it is time to ``Saddle up for Funn.''  [[Page H5969]]                                ____________________
