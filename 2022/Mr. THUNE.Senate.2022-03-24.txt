 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, the Biden border crisis continues.   In February, U.S. Customs and Border Protection encountered 164,973  individuals attempting to cross our southern border illegally--a 63- percent increase from a year ago and the highest February number in  more than 20 years. Border encounters in February over the past decade  or so have generally been low, with numbers far under 100,000--but not  since President Biden was inaugurated. Almost from the day the  President took office, our Nation has been experiencing an  unprecedented border surge.   In fiscal year 2021, the Border Patrol encountered more than 1.7  million individuals attempting to cross our southern border--the  highest number ever recorded. We have had 12 straight months of border  encounters in excess  [[Page S1760]]  of 150,000. And these numbers only reflect individuals the Border  Patrol has succeeded in apprehending. There is no question that many  other illegal immigrants have crossed the border in the past year  without being apprehended and have disappeared into the United States.   The situation at our southern border is out of control--it is a  security crisis, it is a humanitarian crisis, and it is an enforcement  crisis. Our Border Patrol officers have done heroic work this past  year, but they are stretched incredibly thin and are having to spend  too much time caring for migrants and not enough time patrolling the  border.   This sharply increases the risk that dangerous individuals--from  terrorists to drug smugglers to human traffickers--will slip across our  southern border and into the country unnoticed.   And apart from the serious security concerns that go along with not  knowing who is entering our country, allowing this border crisis to  continue also presents serious humanitarian concerns. There is nothing  compassionate about encouraging individuals to undertake the dangerous  journey to our southern border, to run the risk of exploitation and  disease and exposure. Unfortunately, neither humanitarian nor security  concerns have moved President Biden to meaningfully address this border  crisis.   Every month, we see massive numbers of individuals attempting to  cross our southern border, and every month, the White House just  doesn't seem to care. The President travels regularly, including  regular weekends away from the White House, but he can't seem to bring  himself to visit the border and see the situation firsthand.   It is a disturbing abdication of responsibility from the man charged  with defending our Nation's security. And let's remember, the President  isn't just ignoring this border crisis; he is partly, if not largely,  responsible for it. Immediately upon taking office, the President took  steps that weakened our Nation's border security.   On his first day in office--very first day in office--President Biden  rescinded the declaration of a national emergency at our southern  border. He halted construction of the border wall. And he revoked a  Trump administration order that called for the government to faithfully  execute our immigration laws--all on the first day.   And the President's Department of Homeland Security also issued  guidelines that same day pausing deportations except under certain  conditions.   The effect of all this was to declare to the world that the United  States borders were effectively open. And Border Patrol numbers ticked  up accordingly, not surprisingly.    And the President's anti-border security efforts didn't end there.  The President has significantly limited the ability of Immigration and  Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection to enforce  immigration laws. Deportations dropped precipitously during fiscal year  2021, as did arrests in the interior of the country. And earlier this  week, the administration rescinded a 2019 rule expanding expedited  removal for individuals here illegally.   The administration is also, reportedly, expected to end its title 42  COVID-19 restrictions, which have provided for the immediate  deportation of those who have crossed the border illegally. The result  is almost guaranteed to be an even larger surge at our southern border,  taking the situation from disaster to utter catastrophe.   One media outlet reports that ``Department of Homeland Security  intelligence estimates that perhaps 25,000 migrants already are waiting  in Mexican shelters just south of the border for Title 42 to end.''   And there is no sign--no sign--that the administration has any  substantive plan for how to deal with the resulting surge or how to  deal with the enhanced criminal activity from drug smuggling to human  trafficking that would likely accompany this influx.   I get that President Biden would prefer to pretend that this crisis  at our southern border does not exist, but it does exist, and as  President, he has the responsibility to address it. He needs to get  serious about fulfilling that duty for the sake of our Nation's  security and for the sake of all those who are being encouraged by his  lax immigration policies to undertake the dangerous journey to our  southern border.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Louisiana (Mr. Cassidy).
