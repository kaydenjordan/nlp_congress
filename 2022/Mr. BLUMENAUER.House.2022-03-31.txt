 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding  and allowing me to speak on this.   I think it is worth the wait to bring these important provisions  together to the floor to work on a path forward and maybe a little hint  of restoring regular order.   It is important that we invest in innovation for our future. And I  would note not just the cutting edge, high-tech future developments  that are so important in my State and in many others that are going to  help keep us on the front lines, but it is also important to invest in  legacy technology, legacy chips.   We had the manufacturing supply chain all over America halt for lack  of chips that cost only a few pennies because it wasn't profitable for  some to create the legacy chips moving forward. And I hope some of  these billions will be invested in opportunities to ramp up that  production. It happened very fast, and it will make a difference from  automobiles to microwaves and washing machines.   I am proud of the work we have done in the Ways and Means Committee  under the leadership of Richie Neal to develop pro-worker responsive  efforts and deal with the Chinese challenge.   Now, because the benefits of trade are broadly understood and spread  but the problems are localized, the impacts often hit individual  communities. That is why our provision has a strong Trade Adjustment  Assistance program. Sadly, it expired a year ago, setting us back,  leaving people desperately in need of this help out of luck.   We have a very strong, carefully crafted provision that will help  workers and communities alike with an updated, modernized Trade  Adjustment Assistance program.   We hear a lot of concerns about China, and I share those concerns.  Our provisions are tough on China.   For instance, we closed the de minimis loophole that allows 2 million  packages a day to be imported into the United States directly to our  consumers, uninspected in the main and evading tariffs. It is time for  us to close that de minimis loophole.   I note that the Chinese give Americans $7 of an exemption, and ours  is $800. The least we ought to do is close that de minimis loophole.   The trade title is strongly supported by American business and  organized labor. We are dealing with a TSP and MTB that will improve  global standards and strengthen American manufacturing.   The title is supported by AFL-CIO, American Alliance of  Manufacturers, the autoworkers, machinists, electricians. People who  want to build products in America are advantaged under this.   It meets workers' needs, bolsters America's ability to compete, and  is attuned to what Americans want.   Madam Speaker, I look forward to the work with the committee moving  this forward, and ultimately, its passage.                                time  1615
