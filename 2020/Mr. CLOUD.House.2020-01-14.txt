 Madam Speaker, as I sat in the basement of this Capitol  listening to deposition after deposition, it was very clear that this  impeachment shenanigan was never about a real search for truth.   House leadership wanted us to believe, the American people to  believe, that this impeachment process began as a result of a July  phone call when, in reality, Speaker Pelosi said that this began 2\1/2\  years ago. They wanted us to believe that the evidence was irrefutable,  when the truth is they polled to figure out, to see what to charge the  President with.   The way this is supposed to work in an investigation is that there is  a crime that produces evidence that leads to a verdict. When this  started with the verdict, it was a search for evidence that was never  found, and yet we are sending impeachment articles to the Senate.   This is crazy.   And, of course, it has taken over 4 weeks to get what was urgent--the  Speaker said this was urgent. She said this is urgent, so we will be  bringing the articles. It has been 4 weeks to get  [[Page H233]]  the articles from here across to the Senate.   This is a straight line. You go straight through this door, walk  about 90 seconds and you will be in the Senate; yet, it has taken 4  weeks.   This is crazy and should not happen.   Senator Feinstein said the longer it goes on, the less urgent it  becomes. So, if it is serious and urgent, send them over; if it isn't,  don't send them over.   I will be voting appropriately on this and the fact that it is not  urgent and we haven't sent them over.   Let's get back to the work we were elected to do: keeping this  Republic and ensuring the blessings of liberty for future generations.
