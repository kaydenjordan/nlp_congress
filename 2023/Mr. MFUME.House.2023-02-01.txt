 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member of the Committee  on Oversight and Reform, Mr. Raskin, for yielding this time.   A couple quick things. H.R. 139 is an overly broad proposal that  stretches across the entirety of the Federal Government workplace to  say that each and every telework policy, practice, and procedure  implemented in response to the global health crisis must end  immediately in 30 days because a majority of the House of  Representatives says so.   Well, let's remember that in the word ``telework,'' the last four  letters are w-o-r-k. People who telework are working. They are working  day in and day out. And they have been working through the crisis,  working to get us back to where we need to be.   The bill says that the rest of America must then take time to study  the majority of our edict today to see if it made sense in the first  place.   Now, if that is not a classic case of putting the cart before the  horse or the tail wagging the dog, I don't know. I do know that this is  not how a deliberative body, particularly this Chamber, should operate.  We should at least have a hearing on this, bring in the proper  agencies, review this in a real sort of way, and then figure out what  we do. To act this way creates a real problem. The solution, I think,  is looking for a problem, and this is not the place it ought to be.   We have not talked with OPM. We have not talked with Federal  agencies. We have really not talked with the IRS. We just condemn them.  You have to remember, the 5,000 IRS agents we were trying to put in  place on this side of the aisle were to augment what they were doing.  The IRS has been slow in terms of responding. This was an effort to  speed that up.   Mr. Speaker, the distinguished gentleman from Kentucky's First  District, Mr. Comer, and I, I think, want to get to one thing, and that  is the idea of greater productivity, but I would ask that we think  about another way to try to do this.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a Department of Defense  Inspector General report dated March 30, 2021.

[[Page H603]]                                   [March 30, 2021]      Results in Brief--Evaluation of Access to Department of Defense     Information Technology and Communications During the Coronavirus                           Disease-2019 Pandemic                                  Objective         The objective of this evaluation was to determine the       extent to which DoD Components provided access to DoD       information technology and communications during the       coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic.                                  Background         In May 2006, the President issued the National Strategy for       Pandemic Influenza Implementation Plan that requires Federal       agencies to develop plans to maintain information technology       and communications systems to continue operations during a       pandemic. In response, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for       Homeland Defense and Global Security (ASD[HD&GS]) issued the       DoD Implementation Plan for Pandemic Influenza (DoD       Implementation Plan) in August 2006 to ensure the continuity       of essential functions in the event of a pandemic. The DoD       Implementation Plan states that during a pandemic, special       consideration must be given to social distancing in the       workplace through teleworking. DoD Components' pandemic plans       should include the use of laptops, high-speed       telecommunications links, and other systems that enable       personnel to perform essential functions while teleworking.       The plans should also include the requirement to test       telework procedures, the impact of Government-wide mandated       telework on internal networks, and backup plans for       communications infrastructure.        Apart from DoD pandemic planning, the DoD Telework Policy       states that telework will be actively promoted and       implemented throughout the DoD in support of emergency       preparedness. The policy recognizes that during a pandemic,       essential and non-essential personnel and Service members may       be asked to telework; therefore, periodic telework exercises       are required to ensure its effectiveness in continuing       operations and an efficient transition to telework in the       event of a pandemic.        In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, DoD Components began       transitioning to maximum telework in mid-March 2020. On March       18, 2020, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense issued a       memorandum stating that DoD Components could execute their       pandemic plans, or portions of their plans, at any time to       ensure the ability to perform their essential functions.        To determine the extent to which DoD Components provided       access to DoD information technology and communications       during maximum telework in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,       we administered a 43-question survey to a sample of DoD       military and civilian personnel. In August 2020, we invited       269,282 DoD military and civilian personnel to respond to our       survey to share their teleworking experiences from March 15       through August 26, 2020. We received a total of 56,057       responses, comprising 7,323 military and 48,734 civilian       personnel, for a 20.8 percent overall response rate. We also       conducted interviews with officials from the DoD Office of       the Chief Information Officer, the DoD COVID-19 Telework       Readiness Task Force, and the Offices of the Chief       Information Officer for 10 DoD Components to obtain their       perspectives on the infrastructure established to support the       increased number of teleworking personnel.                                   Finding         According to the 54,665 respondents who reported their       telework status, the DoD transitioned 88.2 percent of       respondents to full- or part-time telework from March 15,       2020 through August 26, 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic.       Of the 11.8 percent of respondents who continued to work on       site, the most common reasons provided by survey respondents       for not teleworking were that their work could not be       performed while teleworking, or they were not eligible to       telework. Of those who teleworked, survey       respondents reported problems accessing DoD Component       networks, voice and video teleconference applications, and       identified shortfalls in Government-furnished equipment       available to DoD personnel when their Components first       transitioned to maximum telework in mid-March 2020.       However, the problems cited in survey responses lessened       over time as the DoD increased its network availability       and capacity, added voice and video conferencing       applications, and purchased and distributed computer and       communications equipment.        Based on the results of the survey and interviews with DoD       officials, the DoD's initial challenges occurred because some       DoD Components had not fully tested whether their information       systems could support Government-wide mandated telework and       had not conducted telework exercises with their personnel       before March 2020 as required by the DoD Implementation Plan       and the DoD Telework Policy. Therefore, some DoD Components       were unprepared for the network and communications       limitations, as well as equipment and application shortfalls,       uncovered by the transition to maximum telework. While the       Marine Corps, Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA), Defense       Information Systems Agency (DISA), and the Defense Logistics       Agency (DLA) were able to immediately transition to maximum       telework, the Army, Navy, Air Force, Defense Contract       Management Agency (DCMA), Defense Finance Accounting Service       (DFAS), and Defense Health Agency (DHA) faced challenges       during the transition.        The ability of DoD personnel to perform essential and non-      essential tasks while on maximum telework depends on DoD       Components' ability to provide enough network capacity,       communication tools, and equipment to enable the DoD's       essential and non-essential personnel to stay mission-ready       and productive while in a telework status. Some teleworking       personnel reported that they found their own alternative       solutions including the use of unauthorized video       conferencing applications and personal laptops, printers, and       cell phones to complete their work because some DoD       Components were unprepared for maximum telework. However,       using unauthorized applications or sharing DoD information       over improperly secured devices, even temporarily, increases       the risk of exposing sensitive departmental information that       could impact national security and DoD missions.        Overall, DoD Components and the majority of survey       respondents expressed positive maximum telework experiences.       Specifically, 88.1 percent of survey respondents stated that       their productivity level remained the same or increased       during maximum telework, regardless of their Component's       initial telework challenges. Many survey respondents reported       a desire to telework regularly in the future (37,146       responses) and expressed appreciation for commuting less       often (27,711 responses), better work-life balance (25,508       responses), and more flexible work hours (22,461 responses).                               recommendations         We recommend that the ASD(HD&GS) revise the DoD       Implementation Plan for Pandemic Influenza to update planning       assumptions with the use of telework for essential and non-      essential personnel, align the DoD Implementation Plan with       the DoD Telework Policy, and require DoD Components to update       their plans to include revised assumptions regarding telework       for personnel and the resources required to support the       teleworking workforce.        We recommend that the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy       (USD[P]), in coordination with the Under Secretary of Defense       for Personnel and Readiness, establish management oversight       procedures to verify that DoD Components have performed the       testing, training, and exercise requirements of the DoD       Implementation Plan and the DoD Telework Policy. The       oversight procedures should assess the ability of DoD       Components to support Government-wide mandated telework,       including the results of tests of network and       communications systems and telework exercises with       personnel.                     management comments and our response         The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy (DUSD[P]),       responding for the USD(P) and the ASD(HD&GS) did not respond       to the recommendation to require DoD Components to update       their Pandemic Plans to include revised assumptions regarding       telework for personnel and the resources required to support       the teleworking workforce. Therefore, the recommendation is       unresolved. We request that the ASD(HD&GS) provide comments       on the final report.        The DUSD(P) did not agree or disagree with the other two       recommendations in the report. However, the DUSD(P) stated       that the ASD(HD&GS) would work with the Joint Staff and the       U.S. Northern Command to include the use of telework for       essential and non-essential personnel in the Functional       Campaign Plan--Pandemics and Infectious Diseases, which will       replace the DoD Implementation Plan for Pandemic Influenza,       and align the plan with the DoD Telework Policy. In addition,       the DUSD(P) stated that the ASD(HD&GS) would also work with       the Joint Staff to include the use of telework for essential       and non-essential personnel in the Global Integration       Framework--Pandemics and Infectious Diseases.        Furthermore, the DUSD(P) stated that her office would       support and advocate for oversight procedures to verify that       DoD Components performed the testing, training, and exercise       requirements of the Global Integration Framework--Pandemics       and Infectious Diseases, the Functional Campaign Plan--      Pandemics and Infectious Diseases, the DoD Telework Policy,       and the Pandemic Plans. Therefore, the recommendations are       resolved, but will remain open until the ASD(HD&GS) updates       the Functional Campaign Plan--Pandemics and Infectious       Diseases and the Global Integration Framework--Pandemics and       Infectious Diseases to include the use of telework for       essential and non-essential personnel and USD(P) provides       oversight procedures for verifying that DoD Components       performed the required testing, training, and exercises.     Mr. Speaker, based on 56,000 respondents to its survey, 88  percent of the Department of Defense respondents found telework  accommodations increased their overall productivity. This is not my  imagination. This is how thousands and thousands of them responded in  the survey.   A similar 2021 survey conducted by the American Federation of  Government Employees, which represents 700,000 Federal employees all  across the country, found that 62 percent of them surveyed thought  significantly that their productivity had been increased while  teleworking based on what their previous levels were.  [[Page H604]]    So Federal workers are performing for the American people and have  been under the most difficult circumstances even before we got to  COVID. I know that because I, like many of you, had a chance to speak  to so many of them.   As the chair of the Subcommittee on Government Operations, this  particular issue is welcomed before the subcommittee. I will convene  hearings next week so that we can figure out where we are in a  bipartisan way and move forward.   Mr. Speaker, I would make one point. Federal workers are not here in  Washington, D.C., alone. That is the misnomer. Federal workers are in  everybody's district in this entire Congress. They are looking to us to  try to find a way to help them, not to punish them in 30 days. We are  not going to save money on gas. We are not going to save money on  energy. We are just going to go back to where we are.   Mr. Speaker, I would strongly urge that this measure be defeated.
