 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 504, legislation to  permanently authorize the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Business  Travel Card Program.   Mr. Speaker, this is a common-sense measure to make permanent a  program that has been successful since its inception in 2011.   More than 30,000 Americans currently hold fast-track cards that  expedite business travel to Pacific Rim countries. The world economy is  fast-paced and constantly evolving, and it's important to reduce  bureaucratic obstacles for America to remain competitive.   The APEC Business Travel Card helps Americans travel faster and more  efficiently throughout the Asia-Pacific region, allowing them to spend  more time on business, and less time in airport lines. We must ensure  that our business leaders have the resources they need to compete in an  increasingly globalized economy, which is why I'm proud to support the  permanent extension of this program.
