 Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the amendment.   I have serious concerns about the existing congestion and limited  resources at DCA at this time.   An additional 14 flights--7 slots, but 14 flights--certainly stretch  resources even further. Over the last 16 months, DCA has had the fifth  most ground delay and stop counts in the country. The runway at DCA is  also the busiest runway in the entire country.   I understand wanting additional flights to DCA, but I am concerned  that the amount of space and time in the day is limited. I have serious  concerns about how it will negatively affect my constituents.   Finally, I also am disappointed that there is no requirement that,  before any additional flights, the Secretary must certify that they  wouldn't reduce services to small and medium hub airports, strain the  current landside and airside capacity at Reagan National Airport, and,  as a result, increase travel time.   Mr. Chair, I stand in opposition.
