 Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the United States- Mexico-Canada Agreement going into effect today and to recognize the  important role this critical trade agreement play for my district in  central Washington.   In 2019, Washington State exports to Canada and Mexico totaled $11.1  billion. Now, due to the challenges of the pandemic on our economy, the  USMCA is more vital than ever to provide freer markets, fairer trade,  and more economic opportunity in Washington.   This modernized trade agreement will promote the potential for small  businesses to aid in the growth and recovery of our State's economy,  and it will provide for expansion of equitable trade opportunities for  many of central Washington's farmers and ranchers.   The implementation of the USMCA comes at a crucial time for the  American economy.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have supported this trade agreement on  behalf of people in central Washington, particularly knowing that my  constituents will benefit at a time when they need it most.                            ____________________
