 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute in morning business.    Madam President, quite often in our newspapers, you can  read about a lot of city and State pension funds that are in trouble.  There is one at the national level we have to deal with, so today I  speak about the multiemployer pension system problems and the need for  reform.   According to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation's annual  projections--and those reports were released last week--there is a very  big need for reform. That is as important as ever and getting more  important every day.   The report estimates that the Multiemployer Insurance Program will  become insolvent in 2026. That is a year later than predicted last  year, so people might feel a little more comfort, but that is only  because we gave relief last year to the mineworkers' plan. What is  worse is that insolvency will come at the same time that the Central  States Pension Fund will become insolvent, then creating an even bigger  strain on the PBGC's insurance fund.   Reaching a bipartisan reform agreement continues to be critically  important. I am very encouraged by recent indications from my  Democratic colleagues that they are interested in working with us to  find a solution--a solution that will strengthen this important part of  our retirement system while ensuring that taxpayers aren't left holding  the bag again in the future.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
