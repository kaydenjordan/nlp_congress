 Mr. President.    Reserving the right to object, I believe that we may  have this worked out so there may not be an objection, but I just want  to say a few words before I proceed with this unanimous consent  request.   As the gentleman from Missouri said, he was on the floor of the  Senate last week proposing a Senate resolution condemning the actions  of China with respect to Hong Kong. I said then and I say again now, I  fully agree with his assessment.   What the Government of China is doing in Hong Kong is unacceptable.  They are taking away the rights of the people in Hong Kong. They are  snuffing out the freedoms that exist there right now. Since we were on  the floor last week, the Standing Committee of the National People's  Congress reportedly reviewed an initial draft of the national security  law, which has not been released. So even in this last week, they are  moving forward in their process to take away the liberties of the  people of Hong Kong.   Time is of the essence. What I said on the floor last week and what I  will say again today is that passage of a Senate resolution is not  going to deter the actions of the Government of China. It is a  statement. It is an important statement by the Senate. But to believe  that the Government of China will be deterred one wit in moving forward  on the path that it is on to take away the freedoms of the people of  Hong Kong is to not be even paying attention to what is happening in  Beijing.   I heard the Senator from Missouri say: ``Actions have consequences.''  I agree they should. From the perspective of the Government of China  passing a Senate resolution as a consequence to their action is hardly  going to be taken seriously in Beijing. That is why it is important to  actually do something that shows that the Government of China will pay  a price if it continues down this path to extinguish those freedoms of  the people of Hong Kong.   That is exactly why, right after the Government of China headed down  this path, Senator Toomey, who is here with us on the floor, and I  introduced a piece of legislation that would have consequences, that  would actually punish the government of China if it continues down this  path. It establishes a set of mandatory sanctions. It requires the  administration to identify all those individuals who are culpable and  complicit in taking away the rights of the people in Hong Kong. And  more than that, it would sanction those banks that allow those  individuals to do business.   That is an action that does have consequences. That is an action  where at least there is a chance that the Government of China will  listen because they understand it is not just a statement by the U.S.  Senate. They understand that it is a statement with penalties.   Now, let me make clear that in order for this legislation to be  effective, eventually, the administration is going  [[Page S3285]]  to have to follow the law, and it is going to have to impose the  sanctions on those individuals who are responsible.   I would be remiss or negligent if I didn't point out that the  administration currently has authority to impose sanctions against  China for its actions in Hong Kong based on legislation that this body  passed last year to uphold the rights--the human rights and the  democratic rights--of the people of Hong Kong.   So, despite some statements from the Secretary of State, this  administration has still taken no action.   Now, this legislation that Senator Toomey and I have proposed--and I  really want to thank the Senator and salute him for his leadership on  this. We have worked together in the past on sanctions that have been  adopted into law with respect to North Korea, and I think it is  important that we work on a bipartisan basis to take action that is  meaningful here in the Senate.   The administration should act now on their existing authority. The  Senate and the House should pass this legislation, the Hong Kong  Autonomy Act, as amended, here today and send it to the White House.  The President, we hope, would sign it, and then we hope the President  would impose the expanded sanctions that are provided for in the Hong  Kong Autonomy Act. That is doing something that demonstrates to the  Government of China that consequences have action, and that is why it  was discouraging last week when we proposed this and we had a Senator  come to the floor and block it.   I agree with the Senator from Missouri--it would have been great to  pass this last week--but a Senator came to the floor to block it even  though that Senator was a cosponsor of this legislation. When asked why  he did it, he said he blocked it at the behest of the White House. That  is what he said. I am hoping that is not the case today. I am hoping  that today we don't, at the last minute, have a Senator, at the behest  of the White House, coming forward.   Before I make my unanimous consent request, I would like to yield the  floor briefly to the Senator from Pennsylvania, who has been a partner  in this effort.    Madam President, in continuing to reserve the right  to object, would the Senator from Missouri modify his request to also  discharge S. 3798 and consider S. Res. 596 and S. 3798 en bloc; and the  substitute to the bill at the desk be agreed to; and the bill, as  amended, be read the third time; and that if the resolution is agreed  to and if the bill, as amended, is passed by the Senate, that the  preamble then be agreed to and all motions to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table?    Madam President, I want to thank the Senator from  Missouri for bringing us to the floor last week, for bringing us to the  floor this week, and for working with us to make sure that we could  make important changes to an important resolution that he brought  before us today.   I agree it is a good day for the Senate. Again, I thank the Senator  from Pennsylvania, Mr. Toomey, for his bipartisan work on this.  Hopefully we get it to the President's desk as soon as possible and  send a strong message to the Government of China and send a message to  the people of Hong Kong that we stand with them.                            ____________________
