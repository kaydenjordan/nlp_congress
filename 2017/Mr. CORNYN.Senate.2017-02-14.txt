 Mr. President, for the last several weeks, we have been  doing all we can to take up and consider the President's nominations  for his Cabinet, even though we have had little or no cooperation from  the other side of the aisle.   Last night, we confirmed the President's top economic adviser-- something you would think people would think was pretty important--the  Secretary of the Treasury, and we did confirm the President's Secretary  of Veterans Affairs. Ironically, the vote for the Secretary of Veterans  Affairs was 100 to 0. So maybe somebody can explain to me what was the  necessity of delaying the confirmation of the Secretary of Veterans  Affairs for 3 weeks, leaving that important agency without a designated  and Senate-confirmed head?   Earlier today, we considered the nomination of Linda McMahon to serve  as the next head of the Small Business Administration, to help our  country's job creators reach their potential. Again, we had an  overwhelming vote for Linda McMahon for the SBA. So, again, my question  is, What purpose is served by delaying, by foot-dragging, and by  obstructing the President's choice of his Cabinet members?   We are glad we finally confirmed them, but to be honest, it is not  much to celebrate. By carrying out this unprecedented obstruction of  qualified nominees, our friends across the aisle are simply precluding  the Senate from considering other acts of legislation that would  actually be helpful to the American people. From my vantage point, it  is pretty clear. While they are headed down this self-destructive path,  our friends continue to listen and, sadly, cater to radical elements of  their own party that simply haven't gotten over the election and have  decided to obstruct the President and his agenda at all cost.   But we know for a fact, from our private conversations, that our  Democrat friends are not--well, they are fractured. Some of them  remembered what happened in 2014, when, under the leadership of then- Majority Leader Reid, essentially everybody was frozen out of offering  legislation or amendments to legislation on the floor, including  Members of the majority party--then, Democrats, at the time. That  strategy really backfired, resulting in a huge Republican class of  outstanding Senators in 2014.   People don't like that across the country. They think we are sent  here to solve problems, and we work together and make progress on  behalf of the American people. This sort of mindless obstruction or  foot-dragging for foot-dragging's sake doesn't make any sense to them,  and it doesn't make any sense to me either.   Now, I realize the minority leader--the Democratic leader--probably  has the toughest job in Washington, DC--to try to keep the far left  fringes of his party happy, while trying to do the work of the American  people who sent us here to legislate. I do know that there are Members  of the Democratic caucus who are very interested in trying to  demonstrate their effectiveness by working on bipartisan legislation.  Some of them happen to be running for election in 2018 in States  carried by President Trump. You would think they would be incentivized  to tell the leadership of their own party--or the far left of their  party, which wants to do nothing but resist the Trump agenda and our  bipartisan agenda in the Senate--to stand down or that they are not  going to participate in that sort of mindless obstruction, because I  think their enlightened self-interest tells them that not only is this  what the American people sent us to do--to be productive on a  bipartisan basis--but it is also in their electoral self-interest, as  well.   As long as the Democratic leader caters to the fringe of his own  party and resists any sort of cooperation, I think they can expect the  same sort of results after Senator Reid led his party down that path in  2014. We are now headed into the fourth week of the new administration,  and we have only confirmed a handful of this President's Cabinet picks.  That is bad news not just for us but for the American people, as well.   Surely, after the election of November 8, when President Obama said  he wanted to make sure he participated in a peaceful transition of  power to the next administration, he was appealing to the better angels  of all of those who perhaps were disappointed by the outcome of the  election. But that is what  [[Page S1150]]  we do as Americans. We pull together in the best interest of the entire  country. We get together and we fight, perhaps, and we take opposing  parties in elections. But once the election is over, after the ballots  are counted, we work together in the best interest of the American  people.   But that is not happening, and that is really not just bad for the  Senate. That is bad for the country. Our job in the Senate is to  consider these nominees and to move on them so that the President of  the United States can be surrounded by the people he has chosen to help  him lead the country. I will tell you that I have been incredibly  impressed by the quality of people he has selected. So as we begin to  consider the remaining nominees put forward by President Trump, I hope  our friends on the other side will start to realize the ramifications  of their quest to stop the Senate or to drag out these deliberations  and preclude us from doing other constructive work.   One thing I can promise you is that, thanks to the efforts of Senator  Reid in the last Congress, all of these nominees will be confirmed. Our  colleagues face the same choice they have had all along. They can  either work with us to help get these advisers vetted and then  confirmed, or they can make it painful for all of us for no good reason  and reveal to the country just how ineffective they truly are when it  comes to trying to obstruct this confirmation process.   My hope is that they will decide to course-correct and determine for  the good of the entire country that the right thing to do is to move  forward on these nominees. We were able to take up the VA Secretary and  the Administrator of the SBA, basically by consent, by agreement,  without having to grind through this lengthy process that we are having  to do on the Mulvaney and the Pruitt nominations, just to get those  done before Saturday. It is not necessary, and it is not going to  change the outcome.   Mr. President, we are also going to take up an important  congressional resolution of disapproval. The rule in question allows  the Social Security Administration to report folks who may need help  managing their money to the National Instant Criminal Background Check  System, also known as NICS.   This is just another chapter in the same story that we heard last  year when we successfully pushed back on the Veterans' Administration  for trying to do the same thing--bureaucrats unilaterally taking away  people's constitutional rights without even notifying them of the  reason, much less without giving them an opportunity for a due process  hearing. Well, this isn't a small matter. We have to make sure that the  bureaucracies can't continue to infringe on fundamental rights  guaranteed to all Americans. Now we have a chance to repeal this  unconstitutional rule and to protect those just trying to receive the  Social Security benefits they have earned.   I look forward to doing away with this particularly noxious rule  soon, this week.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I agree with my friend and colleague from  Pennsylvania. If the Social Security Administration were to amend the  rule to include the front-end due process and a finding of dangerous  mental illness, that would be a fundamentally different rule that is  not substantially similar.   Under the current rule, merely filing for a disability benefit on the  grounds of a condition, for example, like anxiety can trigger a  permanent deprivation of constitutional rights without any physician or  adjudicative body finding the person is dangerously mentally ill.   I certainly agree with the concerns raised by my friend and our  colleague from Pennsylvania that the rule he is describing would not be  substantially similar to the rule currently in effect and that would be  no bar to the Social Security Administration writing a substitute rule  in accordance with the views he has expressed.   There may still be a few differences between us in terms of what  exactly the rule would be, but there is no distance between us in terms  of the conclusion that a replacement rule that provides for due process  would not be substantially similar and would not be barred under the  Congressional Review Act.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 375         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
