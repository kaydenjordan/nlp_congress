 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the extension of the  Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards program.   The CFATS program, first authorized in 2006, is a continuation of  congressional efforts since September 11 to protect the homeland. The  program surgically and directly addresses gaps in Federal law regarding  the security of high-risk facilities that use or possess chemicals of  concern at levels of concern.   The program is unique in that, to avoid overlapping with other  Federal programs, CFATS was designed to foster collaboration between  the government and regulated parties.   CFATS is a security program. Regrettably, over the years, some have  tried to make CFATS a safety program, but safety and security are two  very different things. Security is about protecting your ability to  operate, and safety is about controlling how you operate. We should  continue to preserve the program's focus on security.   Finally, it is imperative that, going forward, we find a way to  extend the life of the program for a longer period of time, at least 5  years, in order to give the program, its personnel, and the  participants the consistency they all need to be successful in their  mission.                            ____________________
