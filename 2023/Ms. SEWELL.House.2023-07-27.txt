 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 75th  anniversary of Executive Order No. 9981, which desegregated the U.S.  Armed Forces.   It was in my home State of Alabama--I should say, ``our home State of  Alabama''--in 1941 that 1,000 brave Black men trained at the great  Tuskegee University to become the first Black pilots in U.S. history.  They challenged the status quo by showing White pilots and U.S.  military leadership that they were more than qualified to defend the  United States in a combat role.   Segregation in the military finally ended on July 26, 1948, with  President Truman's Executive Order No. 9981, but progress has been  slow, Mr. Speaker. It took another 40 years before Colin Powell made  history and became the first Black Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of  Staff. Furthermore, it was just 2 years ago when Lloyd Austin was  confirmed as the very first Black Secretary of Defense in our Nation's  history.   The battle to end discrimination in the military is one that we are  still fighting today. Just this month, House Republicans voted to strip  diversity, equity, and inclusion programs from the Armed Forces,  undermining decades of strides toward racial equality.    That is why, yesterday, I joined Congresswoman Marilyn Strickland in  introducing a bill to finally codify nondiscrimination in the military.  As our servicemembers risk their lives daily to protect our country,  the least we can do is to protect them from discrimination.   I am immensely proud to honor the enormous contributions of the  Tuskegee Airmen today. We must never forget the precious gift of  freedom that is preserved because of their dedication and courage.                            ____________________
