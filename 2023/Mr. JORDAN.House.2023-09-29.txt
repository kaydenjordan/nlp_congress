 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, the fiscal year ends in 36 hours. This bill funds the  government. We have a $2 trillion deficit, $33 trillion debt. This bill  cuts spending.   We have a border that is wide open. This bill secures the border.   Those are three simple commonsense things, but the most important of  those three is the one that Mr. Diaz-Balart was just talking about, the  border situation.   Mr. Speaker, 2021 was the highest number on record for illegal  migrants entering the country, the highest year on record until 2022,  and that was the highest year on record until this year. That is how  bad this is.   Here is the important point: It is not just conservatives, it is not  just Republicans talking about securing the border, the mayor of New  York said the migrant crisis will ``destroy New York City.''   Everyone in the country knows what needs to be done. This bill does  it and does it in a commonsense way. Reasonable cuts in spending to  deal with the huge deficit we have, but most importantly it addresses  the most pressing issue we have.   The most pressing issue in the country today is the border situation.  Everyone in the country knows it, it seems, except Democrats in the  United States Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote.
