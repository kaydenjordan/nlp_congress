 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the  Chamber for 5 minutes and to talk about what political scientists are  calling a polycrisis.   A polycrisis is multiple events that have happened globally that have  an enormous impact not only on the world but here. I am going to focus  on just three of them right now: the pandemic that we are currently  going through, Mr. Speaker, which has been extraordinary, as well as  the supply chain issues that have happened; a global pandemic creating  global supply chain issues, which led to ensuing global inflation; and  in the midst of that, the Ukraine war, which has become a global war,  again, impacting supply chain and other issues.   Who in the United States of America has this impacted the most? In  our country, this pandemic has impacted the elderly. Of the 1.2 million  people who have passed away, over 850,000 were over the age of 65. With  regard to inflation, the group that is hurt most by inflation are  people on fixed incomes, and that would be close to 70 million Social  Security recipients here in this Nation.   We have a crisis in this country: a pension crisis and a crisis that  Congress has neglected for more than 52 years.   1971 was the last time that Congress did anything to enhance Social  Security benefits. A gallon of milk was 72 cents at that time. A lot  has changed since 1971, but what hasn't changed is Congress'  recalcitrance to address the needs of our seniors.   Social Security is the number one antipoverty program for seniors and  the number one antipoverty program for children, yet there are 5  million Americans currently who get below-poverty-level checks from the  Federal Government after having paid all of their lives into the  system.   The only reason that is so is because Congress hasn't acted. It is  long overdue for Congress to act. We have legislation that we will be  introducing in the Ways and Means Committee that will enhance Social  Security with across-the-board increases for everyone to lift people  out of poverty and provide every single district with economic  recovery.   Why? It is because, on average, there are 145,000 people per  congressional district who are on Social Security, and that money is  spent right back in that congressional district. People are not buying  back stock options with their Social Security checks. They are spending  it at the grocery store. They are spending it on rent. They are  spending it on prescription drugs. That is what is needed.   It is long overdue for Congress to act. It is not simply a question  of protecting or saving Social Security. It is doing something to end  this crisis in the midst of the worst pandemic, in the midst of  inflation, and in the midst of a supply chain issue to make sure that  our elderly and our people are being protected.                            ____________________
