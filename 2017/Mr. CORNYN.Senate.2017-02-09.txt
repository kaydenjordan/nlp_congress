 Mr. President, I appreciate, as always, the courtesy of  our colleagues.   Earlier this week, we confirmed Mrs. Betsy DeVos as the next  Education Secretary, and last night--finally, at long last--we  confirmed Senator Jeff Sessions to be the Attorney General of the  United States. That represents the eighth nominee to the President's  Cabinet who has been confirmed. At this point in the Obama  administration, there were 24 Cabinet members confirmed. So, obviously,  we are way behind in terms of giving the President the team he needs in  place in order to start his administration and advance the country's  policies.   We will move after today to the Department of Health and Human  Services Secretary, Dr. Tom Price, and then to the Treasury Secretary,  Mr. Mnuchin. The handwriting of course is on the wall. We all know each  of these nominees will be confirmed. How do we know that? Because,  thanks to the former Democratic leader, who invoked the nuclear option  changing the Senate rules, only 51 votes are necessary to confirm a  nominee since there is no filibuster, strictly speaking, no 60-vote  requirement for nominees. So my question is this: What purpose is to be  served by dragging all of this out?   Unfortunately, what this does is it uses floor time, which is a  valuable and limited resource here in the Senate. It prevents us from  turning to bipartisan legislation that would actually help the American  people. That is a real shame. Of course, beyond our political parties,  beyond our differences in philosophy and opinions on various policy  matters, we are here to work for the American people. That is the job  we were sent here to do. In fact, I think, more than anything, the  election on November 8 was a mandate for change.   I think the American people had become pretty--well, I think we had  used up all their patience in both political parties in our inability  to actually get things done. So just slowing down the confirmation  process for the purpose of delay I think ignores the mandate we  received on November 8 from the American people when they voted for  change.   Looking back through recent history, we will see that bipartisanship  has characterized a peaceful transition of power from one  administration to the next. President Obama, to his credit, did believe  in a peaceful transition of power and worked with the incoming Trump  administration to make that possible. But it takes more than one  President working with the next President. It takes Congress working  together on a cooperative basis to make sure that, yes, questions have  to be answered and, yes, nominees have to be vetted. But after all the  questions have been asked and all the vetting has taken place, I think  just delay for delay's sake serves no useful purpose and undermines the  tradition that we have had in this country--that once the election is  over, we then move, not to an election mode, but to a governing mode.  Then, of course, we gear up for the next election in 2018. But now is  the time for governing, not a time for electioneering. The American  people need to accept the results of the election, and I think the  American people by and large have. Now, activists clearly have not. But  I don't think dragging this out in order to increase the level of  separation and polarization in the country by not coming together and  providing the President's Cabinet serves the public interest. Maybe it  serves the interests of some narrow part of a political base, but  certainly not the American people.   Many have pointed out that since President Carter, who had eight of  his nominees confirmed on his first day in office, the nominations  process has been fairly uneventful. President Reagan, for example, had  a dozen confirmed in his first 2 days of office. President Clinton had  13 within 24 hours. President Obama had seven confirmed on day 1, and  so did George W. Bush, when he was President.   The obstruction and slow-walking of the President's Cabinet choices  is unprecedented. In fact, this is the longest  [[Page S985]]  it has taken to confirm a majority of a new President's Cabinet since  George Washington in 1789. This goes back to the origins of the  country. That is pretty shocking.   For our colleagues to keep the President from his advisers is not  only a rejection of the verdict of the American people on November 8  but to this institution and to the stability of the government and that  peaceful transition of power that President Obama said he believed in  and I think demonstrated by his actions.   We need adults to stand up and say we are not going to cater to the  extremes in either political party, but we are going to seek common  ground for the common good of our country. That is a position many of  our Democratic colleagues have agreed with until today.   The day before the election last November, the Democratic leader  indicated a willingness to work with his Republican counterparts to  reach across the aisle in order to do so for what was right for the  American people. Senator Schumer, our colleague from New York, said on  November 16:         We have a moral obligation, even beyond the economy and       politics, to avoid gridlock and get the country to work       again. . . . We have to get things done.    I bet at the time Senator Schumer said that, he expected Hillary  Clinton to be President. But now President Trump has won the election,  and I think the same obligation applies to a Trump Presidency that he  felt should apply to a Clinton presidency.   Now, the Democratic leader is singing a different tune, and we know  what the results are. I actually don't envy our friend from New York,  the Democratic leader. He has perhaps one of the toughest jobs in  Washington, DC. He has allowed a narrow political base full of people  who want him to block, stall, and obstruct this President at every  turn. But I have worked with the Senator from New York before. He and I  see the world through a different lens, but we have found ways to come  together and work in practical ways that benefit our constituents and  the country.    But I can tell he is being pulled in directions that he is not  particularly comfortable with. But what he is doing is allowing that  loud narrow base of his political party to lead his conference and his  party. I think he knows what is good for the country and for the people  we all work for, and that would be to resist the urge to feed the  radical elements and to work together for the interests of the American  people.   Just last week, President Trump announced the nomination of an  incredibly well-qualified judge for the next Supreme Court Justice. As  of today, several Senate Democrats have indicated they want an up-or- down vote on that nomination. I think that is positive. I hope those  are representative of the cooler heads that will prevail on the other  side of the aisle when it comes to taking up the nomination of this  incredibly qualified judge for the U.S. Supreme Court.   People on the right and on the left alike have acknowledged that  Judge Gorsuch is an incredibly qualified nominee, a mainstream  candidate, and widely recognized as such by liberals and conservatives  alike. Some of our friends on the other side are grasping at straws,  searching for ways to call his background or qualifications into  question, basically using the nomination as a way to continue to  contest and deny our new President the mandate he received from his  election on November 8.   The Democratic leader even suggested that because Judge Gorsuch would  not answer all of his questions in a private meeting, he was somehow  hiding something. Well, our friend across the aisle knows--he is a  smart Senator. He is a good lawyer, and he understands. Judges are not  supposed to answer before they get on the bench how they would decide  cases once they are on the bench.   Judges are not politicians, wearing black robes, unelected, life-time  tenured super legislators. So it would be completely inappropriate for  any nominee for the Court to come, either in a private meeting or in a  public setting, and say: Well, if I am elected, I will decide this case  or this issue in this way. That is completely contrary to the  responsibility of a judge, and I think mistakes the important  distinction between how judges and legislators ought to act.   Judges are not politicians. We don't want them as politicians. We  want them as an independent judiciary that can interpret the  Constitution and laws as written. This is an important difference  between some of our friends on the left and those of us who believe in  a traditional judiciary. I believe that because judges are life-tenured  and they are unelected, they are ill-suited to become policymakers for  our country.   Indeed, as to Justice Scalia, I thought this was one of his life's  work. He said:         A judge's job is to interpret the written word, either the       Constitution or the statutes written by the elected       representatives of the people. It is not to pursue a separate       and independent policy agenda or personal agenda just because       you have the power to do so as a lifetime tenured judge.    So the fact that Judge Gorsuch does not answer questions about how he  would decide cases once confirmed, I think, means he is being true to  his responsibilities as a judge. If someone were willing to make those  sort of campaign promises before they were confirmed, I think they  would be disqualified from serving. Take the example of Justice Ruth  Bader Ginsburg during her confirmation hearings in 1993. She said she  did not want to give any hints or previews about how she might vote on  an issue before her. So she politely declined to answer those  questions.   Nominees have since followed her example so much that it has now  become known as the Ginsburg rule. So I hope our friends across the  aisle don't now take the position that Judge Gorsuch would be  disqualified because he invokes the Ginsburg rule, which all  responsible judges or nominees to the Supreme Court should invoke. It  has been a consistent theme throughout.   So let's drop the excuses, and let's get to work. I hope that at some  point the fever will break and our friends across the aisle will decide  to quit the foot dragging, quit the slow walking for delay's sake  alone. I don't know who benefits from that--certainly, not the American  people.   When it comes to nominees like Judge Gorsuch, I hope our colleagues  will apply the same standard that was applied when a Democratic  President nominated somebody for the Supreme Court like Justice  Ginsburg. I hope they will not have a double standard but will agree  that the standard should be the Ginsburg rule and give this good judge,  an outstanding nominee for the U.S. Supreme Court, the up-or-down vote  he deserves.   I yield the floor.
