 Mr. Speaker, we just experienced our government's  longest shutdown. For 35 days in California, nearly 40,000 Federal  workers were furloughed and denied paychecks because of the shutdown,  and that number included Federal employees at the NOAA weather service  station in my district on the central coast of California.   Now, recently, I met with those workers to hear how the shutdown  impacted them, and I can tell you that, although they were affected by  the loss of pay, they definitely did not lose their sense of service.   For over 1 month, right in the middle of rainy season, with the  potential for serious flooding, these public servants didn't get a  paycheck. They didn't miss one day of work, not one shift; and that is  why, in large part, in our region, we were safe.   I can tell you, from what I saw when I met these employees, these are  employees who are not just doing their job for the paycheck. They do it  for the weather; they do it for the science; they do it for the job  security; but most importantly, they do it for the service to our  Nation.   As negotiations in Washington continue, we must learn from, we must  be inspired by, and we must be motivated by not just my NOAA employees,  but every Federal worker across this country who has that sense of  service.   We do that here in Congress. That is how we not only avoid government  shutdowns, that is how we should govern.                            ____________________
