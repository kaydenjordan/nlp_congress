 Mr. President, this week, I have the distinct  honor of recognizing Mrs. Belle Wendelburg for her continued work in  serving her community all the way to the age of 95. Belle retired from  Dahl Memorial Nursing Home in Ekalaka, MT, in July of 2016 after  working there for more than 20 years. She loved the residents and  enjoyed the opportunity to work and serve others.   Belle was born on May 3, 1921, on a family homestead near Westmore,  MT. She was the youngest of three children. Growing up around Westmore,  Belle attended Spring Hill Grade School where she had to ride a horse 7  miles to get to school.   Belle enrolled in the ``Green Thumb'' program, a government work  program, and then began working in activities for Dahl Memorial Nursing  Home. While her primary job was to work in activities, Belle wasn't  afraid to work wherever she was needed. She helped make meals, set up  for meals, wash dishes, read to residents, and work with Alzheimer's  patients. She continued to work at the nursing home even after she was  diagnosed with cancer. Her family reports that she is still as fit as  ever and can probably outrun most people much younger than she.   Belle also worked every Christmas at the home, ensuring the residents  got the presents they were supposed to get and helping them write thank  you letters for the gifts. She was involved with the spiritual health  of the residents by reading devotionals to them. Belle worked at the  home every Sunday when extra staff were needed to help residents attend  chapel services. Through her giving spirit, she provides residents  encouragement and inspiration every day. To her coworkers, she is also  an inspiration. The nursing home CEO, Nadene Elmore says, ``Whenever I  see Belle, I tell her I want to be just like her when I grow up.''  Belle entertains staff at lunches with stories and endless knowledge of  the community's history.   Throughout the past 20 years, Belle has remained faithful in her love  for her home and the eastern Montana prairie. I want to express my deep  gratitude to Mrs. Belle Wendelburg for her dedication and service to  her community, Montana, and our country.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as a fifth-generation Montanan and product  of Montana public schools from kindergarten through college, husband to  an elementary school teacher, and father of four children, I understand  how important a first rate education is to our kids' future. That is  why I am reintroducing the Academic Partnerships Lead Us to Success, or  A-PLUS, Act this Congress. This measure will help expand local control  of our schools and return Federal education dollars where they belong:  closer to the classrooms. By shifting control back to the States,  individual and effective solutions can be created to address the  multitude of unique challenges facing schools across the country.  Through these ``laboratories of democracy,'' Americans can watch and  learn how students can benefit when innovative reforms are implemented  on the local level. This bill would give states greater flexibility in  allocating federal education funding and ensuring academic achievement  in their schools. With A-PLUS, States would be freed from Washington- knows-best performance metrics and failed testing requirements. Should  this legislation be adopted, states would need to adhere to all civil  rights laws and work towards advancing educational opportunities for  disadvantaged children as well. States would be held accountable by  parents and teachers because a bright light would shine directly on the  decisions made by State capitals and local school districts. With  freedom from Federal mandates comes more responsibility, transparency,  and accountability on States. It would also reduce the administrative  and compliance burdens on state and local education agencies, and  ensure greater public transparency in student academic achievement and  the use of federal education funds. Increasing educational opportunity  in Montana and across the country isn't going happen through federal  mandates or one-size-fits-none regulations. We need to empower our  States, our local school boards, our teachers, and parents to work  together to develop solutions that best fit our kids' unique needs.  That is precisely what my A-PLUS Act does. Washington is the problem-- and we have the solutions in Montana and in states across the country.  The A-PLUS Act goes a long ways towards returning the responsibility  for our kids' education closer to home and reduces the influence of the  Federal Government over our classrooms. I want to thank Senators Cruz,  Perdue, Johnson, Lee, and Rubio for helping reintroduce the A-PLUS Act  this Congress. I ask my other Senate colleagues to join us in  empowering our schools to serve their students, not DC bureaucrats, and  support this important piece of legislation.                                  ______                                         By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. Isakson, Mr.          Casey, Mr. Tillis, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Wicker, Mrs. Shaheen,          Mrs. Capito, Mr. Tester, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Donnelly, Mr.          Heller, Mr. King, and Mr. Kaine):   S. 223. A bill to provide immunity from suit for certain individuals  who disclose potential examples of financial exploitation of senior  citizens, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing,  and Urban Affairs.    Mr. President, small businesses are the backbone of  America. They generate more than half of the country's private GDP and  support millions of families. In Montana, small businesses are  innovating, offering new products and services, and creating jobs.   The business community relies on the Internet to access the global  marketplace. In rural states like Montana where it is costly to provide  internet access, consumers and businesses depend on small businesses to  provide connectivity. Without small broadband providers, many Montanans  would not have the internet access that most of us take for granted.   Burdensome regulations like the FCC's net neutrality rules are  strangling our small businesses and preventing growth and investment.  The enhanced transparency requirements in particular require small  businesses to disclose an excess amount of information including  network packet loss, network performance by geographic area, network  performance during peak usage, network practices concerning a  particular group of users, triggers that activate network practices,  and the list goes on. Small companies operate with a small team of  employees and do not have a team of attorneys dedicated to regulatory  compliance. Small businesses simply do not have the bandwidth to take  on additional regulatory burdens.   That is why I am proud to introduce the Small Business Broadband  Deployment Act of 2017 with my colleague Senator Manchin. The bill  provides a temporary small business exception to the net neutrality  enhanced transparency requirements. There is broad support in the  record for this exception, including support from the American Cable  Association, Rural Wireless Association, Competitive Carriers  Association, Wireless Internet Service Providers Association, CTIA--The  Wireless Association, Rural Broadband Provider Coalition, WTA-- Advocates for Rural Broadband.   Providing relief from burdensome disclosure rules will allow small  businesses to focus on deploying infrastructure and serving their  customers rather than spending time on regulatory compliance. I ask my  colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this much needed legislation.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 228         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
