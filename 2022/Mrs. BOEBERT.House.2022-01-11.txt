 Madam Speaker, I rise to honor and remember the life of  Sheriff Sydney ``Duke'' Schirard, the longest serving sheriff of La  Plata County, Colorado.   His lifetime of public service included time as a soldier in the  Army,  [[Page H22]]  as a Durango police officer, as the Bayfield marshal, as a deputy in  the sheriff's office, and finally as the La Plata County sheriff for 20  years.   Sheriff Schirard fought the good fight, and he finished his race  well. His watch may be over, but the community he protected will  forever be better because of his efforts day in and day out.   While others ran away from danger, he ran toward it and woke up with  courage each and every day to serve and protect his community. He  strove to create peace, for ``blessed are the peacemakers, for they  will be called children of God.''   I grieve with the people of La Plata County and with Sheriff  Schirard's family--his two sons, four stepchildren, and three  grandchildren--and with his extended family in the La Plata County  Sheriff's Office who were positively impacted by Sheriff Schirard's  exemplary life of service.                            ____________________
