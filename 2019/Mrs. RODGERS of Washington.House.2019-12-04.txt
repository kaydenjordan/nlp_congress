 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate our leader on  the Energy and Commerce Committee yielding, and I stand in strong  support of the TRACED Act to crack down on robocalls.   I have heard from hundreds of people in eastern Washington about  this. For example, an office manager in Colfax logged more than 318  robocalls at her small business, and she told me, ``That is 318 times I  have picked up the phone to hear a robot talking to me. I dropped what  I was doing to run to the phone for one of these obnoxious calls, or I  put a real client on hold to answer an empty call. Anything Congress  can do to stop this shameful practice would be a relief.''   So, Mr. Speaker, I agree. People need relief, and they have asked  Congress to take action. So I look forward to supporting this bill and  sending it to President Trump's desk with strong bipartisan support.
