 Mr. Speaker, the facts are indisputable: President  Obama's attempt to plan our healthcare economy from Washington, D.C.,  has failed.   I have spent nearly 2 years criss-crossing 29 counties in west Texas,  and I can report from the many stories from my constituents that no  single law or policy has been more reviled, more destructive, or more  intrusive than ObamaCare. It is absolutely crushing our small  businesses and Main Street Americans everywhere.   The American Health Care Act repeals ObamaCare and is a step in the  right direction to freeing the American people from the scourge of  government-controlled health care.   For the first time since the passage of ObamaCare, according to the  Congressional Budget Office's report recently, the American Health Care  Act will lower premiums over time by 10 percent, a far cry from the  skyrocketing premiums we have seen over the last several years since  the passage of the Affordable Care Act.   The report goes on to say that the American Health Care Act will  reduce the deficit by $337 billion and make the biggest entitlement  reform in generations, saving taxpayers well over $800 billion.   This bill strikes at the heart of ObamaCare by repealing its  mandates, eliminating its taxes, and gutting its regulations.   Make no mistake, this legislation is not perfect. I will continue to  fight for more conservative and more fiscally responsible policy  outcomes like work requirements for able-bodied adults. But when the  dust settles and the debate is over, we cannot allow perfect policy  aspirations to be the enemy of good, conservative results. The  alternative, Mr. Speaker, is simply unacceptable.                                time  2015    My constituents sent me to Washington to tackle the tough issues and  solve the big problems. Well, we have got one, and it is called  ObamaCare. I committed a long time ago that if I ever had the chance, I  would repeal ObamaCare, and I plan on keeping my promise, Mr. Speaker.
