 Madam Speaker, in advance of the fifth annual Missing  and Murdered Indigenous Women's Memorial March that is taking place in  my hometown of Duluth, Minnesota, tomorrow, I rise to bring attention  to the violence facing our Native American communities.   Everyone has a right to live safely in their communities, but the  murder rate of Native American women is currently 10 times the national  average. More than half of Native American women have been sexually  assaulted, and thousands of Native American women and girls have gone  missing.   This national crisis has been ignored for far too long, and it is  time that Congress acts. That is why I cosponsored Savanna's Act,  legislation that would better prepare Tribal law enforcement to respond  to these crimes. I believe that this should be one of the easiest bills  that we pass this year and call for its quick passage.   Madam Speaker, I will be proud to march with our Native American  communities this Friday and honor those we have lost. I believe that,  together, we can bring justice to the missing and murdered indigenous  Native American women and hold the individuals who commit these acts of  violence accountable.                            ____________________
