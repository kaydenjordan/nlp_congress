 Mr. President, we have seen a number of battles here  recently that involve the question of, is our country going to make  laws by and for the powerful or by and for the people?   We saw a healthcare debate where my colleagues across the aisle  wanted to rip healthcare from 20 to 30 million hard-working Americans  in order to deliver tax benefits to the very richest among us.  Fortunately, we were able to stop that.   We have heard conversation here on the floor about the arbitration  fairness regulation, which said that nobody should be forced into an  arbitration when the other side gets to hire the judge, gets to promise  the judge future business, and gets to determine the outcome of the  decision. Yet my colleagues across the aisle voted for the powerful to  be able to have this fixed system to cheat the consumers of America.   Then most recently we had this question on the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau. The people of the United States love the fact that  we finally have an organization that fights for them in fairness and  financial deals so that predatory lending would be brought to a halt.  But my colleagues on the other side of this spectrum said: No. Let's  support the appointment of someone to run this who wants to tear down  that organization so there will no longer be the protection for people.   Time and time again, within just a few weeks, my colleagues across  the aisle have said: We are for the powerful to crush the people. Well,  we are fighting for the people, and now we are fighting for the people  on this horrendous tax legislation.   I have come to the floor to be with my colleague from Minnesota to  point out some of the worst provisions of this bill, and I turn to her  for her opening comments.    In fact, that is indeed one of the big lumps of coal  Americans are getting. One in three American taxpayers utilizes this  deduction, as should anyone who pays State and local taxes. How fair is  it that on the money people have already paid out in taxes--taxes to  one government organization--they get taxed on by the Federal  Government? It is double taxation. The Republicans, in this bill, are  standing for the unfair double taxation of Americans. It is absolutely  wrong, and it is a big deal.   The average deduction in Oregon among those who use the SALT  deduction is about $12,000. That is a very significant factor. That  means their taxes are going to go up. The Republicans, with this bill,  are saying yes to unfair double taxation, and we are saying no.    Mr. President, yet another terrible provision in this  bill is the dynasty loophole.   Now, in a bill that the Republicans are saying is targeted at the  middle class, why would you give $269 billion to the richest 0.2  percent of Americans? Envision a room with 1,000 people in it, pick out  the 2 richest people, and give them $269 billion. That is what this  bill does.   Now, this dynasty loophole is a way for the richest Americans to  bypass ever paying capital gains, as they pass their wealth from one  generation to the next. It is an enormous tax dodge, but if you or I  sell a property while we are alive, we have to pay capital gains on it.  The rich don't need to sell property over the course of their lives;  they can simply hold it to the end of their life and pass it on to the  next generation, never paying capital gains, and the next generation  gets it marked up to market rate so that can never be recovered.   What we are talking about here is a principle that the early American  Founders really detested. They had seen in Europe that very rich  families could pass on wealth from one generation to the next and could  control power in the country. That was the vision of government by and  for the powerful, accentuated by the passage of vast wealth from one  generation to the next. The Americans said: No. We want a different  form of government, one which empowers decisions to make every family  thrive; give them a chance, every family, to succeed.   That is the vision of ``We the People,'' and that is the opposite of  this dynasty loophole.   I dare a single Republican to come to this floor and explain how  giving $269 billion to the richest 0.2 percent of Americans has  anything to do with helping the middle class.    Mr. President, not only do we have the dynasty loophole,  we also have a sweetheart deal for very well-off LLCs--the type of LLCs  President Trump has. He is rumored to have hundreds. I keep hearing the  number 500. We don't actually have a document that tells us how many.   These high-end LLCs already get a big advantage over C corporations  because C corporations pay a tax at the corporate level, and then they  pay a tax at the individual level when the dividends are received. Here  we have it: a sweetheart deal that would create a windfall of $362  billion with almost 90 percent of that going to the richest 1 percent  of Americans.   Time after time after time, what we see are not benefits to the  middle class; what we see are sweetheart deals for the very rich.    Mr. President, we now go to the rapid round because we  have 4 minutes left to cover our remaining topics.   This provision is an attack on renewable energy. What does the Senate  bill do? It undermines the integrity of the usefulness of the solar and  wind energy credits, and then it proceeds to fail to address expiring  credits or the credits that need to be renewed in geothermal and in  biomass and in charging infrastructure and in microhydropower. Then the  House side makes it worse by proceeding to get rid of the credit for  electric vehicles.   What we have here is an effort to hand over the leadership on the  next big vision for power in the world to the Chinese. Republicans are  trying to help the Chinese take the lead and put America behind. That  is not America first, that is America behind, and it is wrong and we  oppose it.  [[Page S7542]]         Mr. President, the last loophole I will point out is the  Trump loophole. We know, from the one tax return we have from President  Trump, the only reason he paid taxes was the alternative minimum tax.  In fact, he paid $38 million in taxes that year, and we were told he  would have only paid about $5 million if it wasn't for the alternative  minimum tax. So there we have it, another big provision for the richest  of America.   This is not a bill that helps the middle class. It raises the taxes  on millions and millions of middle-class Americans, while provision  after provision after provision is targeted at the very richest  Americans. We need to stop this bill.   Thank you.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.    Mr. President, I have three motions to commit that I  believe the Senate should consider during our debate of H.R. 1, The Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act.
