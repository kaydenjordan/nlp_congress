 Mr. Speaker, like more than a million Americans, Vernon  Judd was drafted into service during the Korean war. Leaving his  hometown in Stark County, Ohio, to serve in the Army, Vernon Judd was  one of ten children, with whom he left behind fond memories.   His younger brother, Ken, recalled fireworks shows Vernon would put  on for the community.   Sergeant Judd was just 6 weeks away from being relieved of duty when  he went missing in action in 1950.   Being taken to a Korean prisoner of war camp, Judd survived just a  few months before succumbing to starvation, dysentery, and exposure to  the elements, according to a fellow POW military doctor. It was not  until 1954 that Judd's family learned of his death.   Nearly 70 years after his death, Sergeant Vernon Judd was identified  and returned home to Ohio.   On Tuesday, he was laid to rest at Ohio Western Reserve National  Cemetery, and the homecoming celebration attracted thousands.   Vernon Judd is one of many Americans who lost their life in service  to our Nation. His homecoming may be delayed, but it was welcomed. It  brings peace, relief, and comfort to the Judd family.   Mr. Speaker, I ask the House to join me in celebrating and honoring  Sergeant Vernon Judd and pray the families of the remaining  servicemembers missing in action find the same peace.                            ____________________
