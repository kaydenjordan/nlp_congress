 Madam Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the legacy of  public service of the late Geneva Wilson Perryman.   Mrs. Geneva Wilson Perryman was known for her passion that she shared  for making her community a better place for all.   Mrs. Wilson Perryman raised her five children in Detroit alongside  her husband, Alex, to whom she had been married for 77 years.   Geneva was well known in her neighborhood for welcoming those in need  to share a warm meal.   Mrs. Wilson Perryman was a teacher for nearly 40 years in our  community and had received numerous awards and a number of  acknowledgments for her excellence in education and her hands-on  actions in working to secure equal justice for all in our city of  Detroit.   Mrs. Wilson Perryman was outspoken. She was a feisty woman, as some  say, and made it her mission to speak truth to power.   Please join me in recognizing the late Geneva Wilson Perryman and her  [[Page H6848]]  contributions to the families of Detroit and Michigan's 13th  Congressional District as we honor her memory today.              Recognizing Congressional App Competition Winners     Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Michigan's  13th District Congressional App Competition winners, Hope of Detroit  Academy's Green Warriors.   Under the guidance of their teacher, Ms. Allie Langwald, students  Abraham Salas, Yaritza Campos, and Itzel Martinez worked diligently to  find innovative solutions to address issues in their neighborhood in  the southwest Detroit community.   Their hard work helped create the Green Warrior app, which utilizes  technology to help residents quickly and easily report illegal dumping  sites in need of cleanup and expose dangerous buildings.   In partnership, the students and their teacher worked with the city  of Detroit and other community-based organizations. Their app will now  ensure that neighborhood streets and parks are cleaned up, and  dangerous buildings are boarded up, so the community can enjoy the use  of public spaces.   Again, please join me in congratulating the Congressional App  Competition winners, Hope of Detroit's Green Warriors, for their hard  work on behalf of the communities of Detroit, Wayne County, and  Michigan's 13th Congressional District.                      Violence Against Women in Politics     Madam Speaker, I am proud to rise today during the United  Nations' 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence to call out  the disturbing rise of violence against women in politics here in the  United States.   As we know, the never-ending string of ignorant, hateful, and  downright threatening rhetoric against my sisters in service and I and  many is unacceptable, especially the deeply hateful, Islamophobic  comments from a Member of this body against Congresswoman Omar and the  straight-up death threat against Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez, as well  as our sitting President.   The hate these Members spew at every opportunity is not new. It is  the same hate that is directed against countless women all around the  globe and especially women of color in politics who are right now  breaking down barriers and trying to represent and serve their  communities.   By failing to put our party differences aside and denounce violence  and hate, I want to encourage, again, my colleagues to continue to  speak up.   During the United Nations' 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based  Violence, I am asking folks to truly be able to speak up, stand up, and  advocate for us to do better.   To that end, I am proud to have joined Congresswomen Bush, Ocasio- Cortez, Omar, Pressley, and Speier to introduce H. Res. 801, which  denounces violence against women in politics in all its forms.   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
