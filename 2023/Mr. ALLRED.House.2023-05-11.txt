 Mr. Speaker, this week, I had the honor to introduce a  resolution designating May 9 as Home Front Heroes Day. This was an idea  from Major John ``Lucky'' Luckadoo, a 101-year-old World War II veteran  and patriot who lives in Dallas.   Home Front Heroes Day would recognize those who sacrificed so much to  support our servicemembers and keep our Nation going during the Second  World War.   I was so honored last year to celebrate Home Front Heroes Day in  person with Lucky himself. We can all learn a lot from Major Luckadoo's  leadership, and it is something I hope to carry with me throughout my  time in Congress.   Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to know Major Luckadoo, who has worked so  hard to make sure that folks who were on the home front get the  recognition they deserve. I appreciate the opportunity to play a small  role in Lucky's story.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to celebrating Home Front Heroes Day for  many years to come.                            ____________________
