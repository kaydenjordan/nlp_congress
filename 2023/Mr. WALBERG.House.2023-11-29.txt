 Mr. Speaker, as a Representative of a northern border  district, I rise today to address the border crisis impacting  communities across the country, including those in my district.   What is unfolding at our southern border is a humanitarian and  national moral crisis. Under the Biden administration's failed  policies, every State has become a border State.   Border crossings are at an all-time high and include people on the  terrorist watch list and child sex predators. Fentanyl flows freely  over the border and then is trafficked across the country.   I have been to both the north and south borders and talked with  border agents. They feel like the administration has abandoned them, as  have our constituents.   In May, House Republicans passed the strongest border security  package in history, yet the Senate refuses to vote on H.R. 2 or any  other border solution.   We can't wait any longer, Mr. Speaker. The Senate must vote on H.R.  2, secure our border, and protect our communities.                            ____________________
