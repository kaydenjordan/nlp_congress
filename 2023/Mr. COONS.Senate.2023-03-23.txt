 Mr. President, I rise today to speak on a topic I have  been dreading for months, the departure from my office of my senior  adviser and close friend, Jeff Sanchez.   After 4 years of dedicated, tireless, outstanding service to me, the  people of Delaware, my family, and our country, Jeff is moving on to an  exciting new adventure.   He didn't want a big farewell party, but he is going to have to  endure, before he goes, the Congressional Record of the U.S. Senate  reflecting the contributions of this remarkable public servant.   Jeff is from California, a graduate from Chapman University. He spent  a decade on the Hill working for Steny Hoyer, Senator Patty Murray, and  Congresswoman Linda Sanchez.   In my office, he has risen quickly, four promotions in 4 years. He  became a central part of my senior team, giving me valued, strategic  advice on a whole range of issues, from policy and politics to  operations and communications. My team in DC and Delaware quickly came  to rely on Jeff.   While I have a lot of very positive and humorous input from them,  given the press of time, I will read just a few.   One staffer said:         [Jeff] was the air traffic officer for the office but also       [at times] the pilot guiding all staff to a smooth departure       with our member and a safe, comfortable landing.    Another staffer said:         Jeff is a Swiss Army knife. There is nothing this guy can't       do. Tireless worker. Great writer. Strategic thinker. Gets       the policy and the politics.    And my favorite:         When Jeff walks in[to] a room, everything just starts       working better.    His first role in my office was moving me. I mean, physically moving  me. I quickly became respectful of his skills. We have driven the  streets of DC and Delaware, from Georgetown to Capitol Hill. And while  he mostly stayed under the limit and obeyed traffic laws, when it came  to getting me to Union Station and getting me home, he was more Mario  Andretti than Uber. Sometimes my blood pressure was elevated, but we  always arrived safely and on time.   From the snows of Davos to the hills of San Francisco and from the  streets of Madrid, we traveled to remarkable places together. One of  the most striking things about Jeff is the more time you spend with  him, the more time you want to spend with him. As we got to know each  other better and spent time talking, during our drives, about our  families and our hopes for the future, we became closer, and I am so  grateful. Jeff has allowed me to offer what I hope has been meaningful  advice on life's challenges and opportunities.   I have lots of things to poke fun at Jeff. He has a mischievous wit,  his own share of quirky habits, and charming preferences. Like a  hobbit, he eats a first and second lunch, always from Cups. During late  nights when I was tied up here on the floor, he would turn down the  lights and deejay for our colleagues--something called Club Jeff. And  while he is a foodie, his highest culinary loyalty is Cheesecake  Factory.   Jeff's parents, Maria and Carlos, are wonderful people from Quito,  Ecuador. He is proud of them, and I hope you know, we are proud of you.  To Maria, Carlos, Shane, Ronald, his beloved nanny Eloysita, and  grandmother Rosa, it is important for you to hear that you raised an  amazing and incredible young man, whose integrity and work ethic  exceeds anything I have seen among others, and you are the base for his  success here in the Senate and in life.   I have been blessed to know Jeff, both professionally and personally,  and we have come through some of the most challenging and difficult  moments in our country's recent history together: President Trump's two  impeachments, Joe Biden's Presidential campaign, my own reelection to  the Senate, January 6, the whole Biden Presidency, and two of the most  legislatively frenetic years in history and a global pandemic.   During the pandemic, a core group of six of us came into my offices  day in and day out and worked hard. We spent a huge amount of time  together--hard days and long nights, working through that crisis.  Through the pandemic, Jeff was always there.   He has made me a better Senator and a better colleague. He is  responsible for and shares in my biggest successes, and his  contributions to me, to the country, and to our State are too numerous  to mention.   I will close with James 2:18:         Show me your faith apart from your works, and I will show       you my faith by my works.    In a town that has its fair share of self-promoters, Jeff has devoted  himself to others and does so with humility, discretion, and poise. In  an institution where there is often a scramble to occupy the spotlight,  Jeff chose to labor behind the scenes and give credit to others. In a  culture where some feel entitled to professional awards, Jeff has  earned everything he has achieved many times over.   It was no surprise that once Jeff decided to look for new  opportunities, he has had many compelling options. I am proud of him  and the next steps he will take in his life.   When I shared the news that Jeff would be moving on from our team,  the three most important women in my life--and I don't mean Morgan,  Chelsea, and Trinity of our office, but I  [[Page S927]]  could; I mean my mother, my wife, and my youngest, Margaret--were so  sad to see him go because they have come to trust and admire him the  way so many of his colleagues do. He is genuinely a member of our  family, and we will deeply miss him.   While Jeff is leaving my office next week, he will always be a part  of that small group of people I most appreciate, admire, and respect. I  look forward to the lifetime of friendship I know we will share.   I yield the floor.
