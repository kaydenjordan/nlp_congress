 Mr. President, earlier this week, I sat in the Supreme  Court and listened to the oral arguments in the case challenging  President Trump's decision to shut down the deferred action for  childhood arrivals program, or DACA.   DACA is the program we fought so hard for. It is what has allowed  nearly 700,000 undocumented youth across America--the bright young  people we call Dreamers--to come out of the shadows and to pursue their  dreams without fear of deportation. That includes nearly 17,000  Dreamers in my home State of New Jersey.   We all remember the heart-wrenching stories before DACA--kids  applying for driver's licenses on their birthdays only to discover they  weren't citizens; students opening college acceptance letters with  pride, only to learn they couldn't receive financial aid; young people  trying to enlist in the military, only to find out their undocumented  status disqualified them. These are the stories that I shared with  President Obama during a meeting several years ago when I made the case  for DACA with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. I thought back to that  meeting as I sat in the Supreme Court earlier this week. I remembered  bringing along a legal memo that made clear the Federal Government had  the authority to use prosecutorial discretion to protect Dreamers from  deportation. After years of pushing the administration and fearless  advocacy by thousands of Dreamers nationwide, President Obama  eventually saw the light, and the program we now know as DACA was born.   DACA offered law-abiding young people who were brought to this  country as children through no decision of their own the opportunity to  come out of the shadows and step into the light to fulfill their God- given potential. And that is exactly what they did. Dreamers put their  faith in our government.   They registered with the Department of Homeland Security, paid fees,  passed criminal background checks, and handed over personal details  about themselves and their families to authorities they have been  hiding from their entire lives. They did this all to qualify for DACA's  promise of a 2-year renewable work permit and protection from  deportation. Dreamers put their trust in the U.S. Government, but as we  all know by now, President Trump betrayed that trust. He betrayed young  people like Manny Sanchez, one of the many Dreamers from New Jersey who  traveled to Washington, DC, this week to make their voices heard.   Manny was brought to the United States at just 1 month old. Today he  is 20, attending Brookdale Community College in Middletown, NJ, where  he studies nursing and volunteers with local emergency medical  services. Without DACA, he risks being deported to Mexico, a country he  doesn't even know. ``I wouldn't know what to do, where to go, what my  future would be like,'' Manny said. ``This is really my home.''   These kids are as American as apple pie. Dreamers grew up pledging  allegiance to our flag, singing our national anthem, loving our  country. They are American in every way except for a piece of paper.  Dreamers are succeeding in our schools, playing on our sports teams,  attending our colleges, serving in our military, and loving our country  because it is their country too. Their home is here. So I refuse to let  their lives be ruined in the name of White nationalist fear mongering.  And I refuse to let them be used as bargaining chips for this  administration's anti-immigrant agenda which seeks to tie protections  for Dreamers to radical cuts to legal family-based immigration and  billions of dollars for the President's hateful, ineffective border  wall. Should the Supreme Court strike down DACA, we will have a  national emergency on our hands. It will shatter families. It will  strike fear into our communities. And it will cost our economy dearly.   In New Jersey alone, ending DACA would shrink our economy by nearly  $1.6 billion a year and reduce U.S. GDP by $460 billion over the next  decade. This is not what I call law and order. This is what I call fear  and chaos. There is no way to spin this. When President Trump said he  wanted to ``treat these young people with love,'' I say, ``Love like  this we don't need!'' Ending DACA and threatening to deport hundreds of  thousands of upstanding young Dreamers, that is not love. That is hate.  That is why now, more than ever, we in the U.S. Senate must show real  love for our Dreamers. The House of Representatives passed a bill, the  American Dream and Promise Act, a bill that would protect Dreamers and  offer them the path to citizenship they deserve, a bill that would  honor the service of our men and women in uniform, harness the  potential of talented young students across our Nation, and help create  a brighter future for all Americans.   For years, I have heard my Republican colleagues talk glowingly about  America's Dreamers, talk about how they are incredible kids, talk about  how we must protect them from deportation, and talk about how they  deserve a path to citizenship. Well, our Dreamers deserve to know  whether it was all just talk. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  must pull this bill out of his legislative graveyard and hold a vote  the American Dream and Promise Act. Let's find out exactly who in the  U.S. Senate wants to keep the dream alive and who wants to snuff it  out. There is no excuse for decrying the President's decision to end  DACA but doing absolutely nothing about it. This is the U.S. Senate. We  don't have to leave the future of America's Dreamers in the hands of  the Supreme Court. We don't have to sit on our hands and wait for this  ruling to come out. And we certainly don't have to let one reckless  decision by President Trump ruin the lives of nearly 700,000 Dreamers  and the millions of Americans who know them, love them, work with them,  serve with them, and depend on them. Only Congress can provide a  permanent pathway to citizenship for Dreamers. It has never been more  urgent that we do so.                            ____________________
