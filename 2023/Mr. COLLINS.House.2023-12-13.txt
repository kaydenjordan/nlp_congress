 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dean Dale Greene of  the University of Georgia's Warnell School of Forestry and Natural  Resources, a role in which he has served since 2015.   After decades of service to UGA and our great State, Dean Greene will  retire at the end of this year. Dale is an accomplished man. He is a  graduate of Louisiana State University, holds a master's degree from  Virginia Tech and a Ph.D. from Auburn University.                                time  1045    He joined the UGA faculty in 1986 and has served our school and this  State in so many ways since.   Dale currently sits on the board of trustees for the American  Forestry Association and has been on the board of directors for the  Georgia Forestry Association since 1992. He was appointed by two  Georgia Governors to the State Board of Registration of Foresters,  first in 2004 and then again in 2010.  [[Page H6869]]    In 2007, Dean Greene received an Outstanding Research Award from the  Society of American Foresters, the Herrick Award for Superior Teaching,  and was later inducted into the Georgia Forester's Hall of Fame.   His accomplishments don't end there. In 2008, Dale became a UGA  senior teaching fellow and, in 2011, received the Georgia Forestry  Association's Wise Owl award.   These are just a few ways that Dale Greene has been recognized for  his outstanding service to the State of Georgia, countless students,  and the field of forestry.   Mr. Speaker, as my friend embarks on his next chapter of life, he  must know that his leadership has built a strong legacy. The Warnell  School has grown and become so successful with him at the helm.   I thank him for all he has done, and I wish him continued success in  his retirement. Go Dawgs.                            ____________________
