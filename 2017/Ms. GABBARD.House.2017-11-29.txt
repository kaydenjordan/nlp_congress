 Mr. Speaker, for too long, survivors of sexual  harassment and assault have been isolated, shamed, and bullied into  silence, while their abusers walk away scot-free with the privilege of  anonymity and with no personal or financial accountability.   This has been happening right here in Congress, in media, in many  sectors in our society. No one, whether it be a Capitol Hill staffer, a  Hollywood actor, a schoolteacher, a soldier, or anyone in any  profession, at no time should they have to choose between their job and  personal safety.   Congress needs to act now to end the practice of taxpayer-funded  sexual harassment settlements, expose perpetrators of sexual harassment  and assault, and provide a fair and transparent path to justice for  survivors. This behavior is absolutely unacceptable. It has no place in  Congress or in our society. It must end.                            ____________________
