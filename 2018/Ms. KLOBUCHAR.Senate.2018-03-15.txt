 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I come to the floor today for a  number of reasons, but first and most pressing is to call on and ask  the administration to extend deferred enforced departure status for a  group of Liberians. This is a unique situation. Senator Jack Reed was  on the floor in the last hour talking about it as well.   Both the State of Rhode Island and the State of Minnesota have a  number of Liberians who didn't just come to this country--they didn't  come to this country illegally--they came to this country decades ago.  They came because of a civil war in their country of Liberia, and then  after that war was basically resolved, they were allowed to stay. So  they are all registered in this country, they are working legally in  this country, and they are in a special status called deferred enforced  departure.   Ever since George H.W. Bush, Presidents--Democrats and Republicans;  George Bush, of course, President Clinton, and President Obama--every  one has allowed them to stay.   As my colleagues can imagine, since this happened back in 1991, these  are people who have been working in our country for decades now. I met  one who is 65 years old. Some of them are now 70 years old. They have  obeyed the law. They have paid their taxes. They tend to be working in  a lot of--of course, consistently--working in our assisted living  facilities in Minnesota. They are working in our hospitals. Some of  them had healthcare experience in Liberia before they came to  Minnesota. They are a thriving community that has integrated well into  our State and into Rhode Island. We are a State where the unemployment  rate is somewhere around 3 percent and even lower in some of the areas  where this community is working. It would literally be a big jolt to  our economy--and not to mention immoral--if they were suddenly deported  and lost the legal status they have had for literally decades.   Unlike some of the other things we talk about with people who maybe  just came here--and I worked so hard on the Dreamers, to get them a  path to citizenship--this is a pretty unique situation. We hope the  administration will be practical about this. That is why Senator Reed  and I are working on this issue. We hope to get it resolved quickly  since their status is ending on March 31, which is just a few weeks  from now.   Liberians are the only group of people and it is the only country  with deferred enforced departure--or DED, as it is known--which is a  temporary legal status that requires the President to reauthorize it  every 18 months.   One idea is that the President could reauthorize it, and then they  could  [[Page S1755]]  look into it more. As we know, there is a lot going on in our country.  There are a lot of changes right now within the Office of the Secretary  of State and other things. So one idea would be that they could simply  allow the program to continue for 18 months and then come to a  conclusion on what they think they should do about it.   As I mentioned, in 1991, President George H.W. Bush first issued  temporary protected status to Liberians in response to the nation's  civil war. Since 1991, Presidents on both sides of the aisle have  extended legal protection to Liberians in the United States under  either TPS or DED--deferred enforced departure--because of civil wars,  the Ebola outbreak, and other instabilities in their country. All  Liberians covered by DED have been living in the United States since  2002. This isn't, as I said, new people coming in under that status;  these are people who have been living here with that status for  decades. As I mentioned, some are now in their seventies, and all of  them have lived here legally. They have paid their taxes and  contributed to our communities and worked at our employers. If DED is  not extended by March 31, they will lose their legal status and work  authorization and face deportation.   Minnesota, as I mentioned, has one of the largest Liberian  populations in the country. Many of these people are business owners.  They are teachers. They are healthcare workers. According to one  organization, nearly 40 percent of Liberians in Minnesota work in our  nursing homes as nursing assistants and other support staff. Imagine if  we took thousands of people away just like that on March 31, because  they wouldn't have legal status to work at the nursing homes where they  have worked for decades.   I have also called for action on the Liberian Refugee Immigration  Fairness Act--a bill that Senator Reed has introduced every Congress  since 1999--and I have cosponsored this bill. The bill would actually  provide permanent protected status, including a path to citizenship,  for those Liberians who have obeyed the law and have been here in this  temporary status for decades.   That is not what we are asking for today. We understand and we hope  that negotiations are ongoing so that we can have a more comprehensive  immigration bill. We are simply asking the administration to continue  with the 18-month status that was started back in 1991 by a Republican  President.   I met with a number of members of our Liberian community yesterday.  They are experiencing extreme fear right now that their livelihoods  will be lost and their families will be ripped apart. I am hopeful that  we will be able to resolve this, at least for that temporary 18-month  period.                       Support Our Military Spouses Act    Secondly, Madam President, on a different topic, I want to take a  moment to discuss a bipartisan bill that I introduced this week that  would help reduce the burden of relocation for military families.   When servicemembers relocate to comply with military orders, they and  their families make sacrifices to help protect our Nation. Right now,  there is a problem with the way the law treats some military spouses  who make frequent moves, and the law, ironically, makes it even harder  on them rather than easier on them.   Current law allows Active-Duty servicemembers to maintain one State  of legal residence for tax and voting purposes even when military  orders require them to relocate. That makes moving a lot easier.  Unfortunately, this convenience does not apply to a servicemember's  spouse unless they were living together at the same residence before  they got married. In other words, if you were not living with your  servicemember before you got married, you have to establish residency  every single time your family gets moving orders from the military.  From filing taxes to registering to vote, a military family then has  double the paperwork and stress each time they move.   This is a loophole that must be fixed. Why would we make it harder  for the spouses of those who are making a sacrifice by having their  loved one serve overseas and not make it easier for them to vote and to  pay their taxes and to basically be the citizen they deserve to be?  That is why, on Tuesday, Senators Cornyn, Kaine, Kennedy, Manchin, and  I introduced the Support Our Military Spouses Act--legislation that  would ensure that spouses have the same residency protections  regardless of their living arrangements before marriage. From titling a  car, to filing taxes, to registering to vote, everything is a little  easier when the law ensures that you can stay a resident of one State  and that it is the same State as your spouse's. That is just common  sense, and it cuts out a lot of redtape for military families.   The bill has the support of the Military Spouses Network, the  Military Officers Association of America, and the Council of State  Governments. This bill passed the House in July of 2017 with bipartisan  support, and I am going to work with my cosponsors to get it done in  the Senate.   We ask a lot of our military members and their families. When we can  make life easier for them, we should. This is one simple thing we can  do.                                Honest Ads Act    Finally, Madam President, I would like to mention the sanctions that  were just announced against Russia for interfering in the 2016  election. It took 14 months, multiple indictments, and a poisoning in  Britain, but the administration is finally imposing sanctions--the same  sanctions that were passed by the Senate 98 to 2 and 419 to 3 in the  House last year.   Sanctioning Russia for undermining our democracy is what we should  do, but we must remember that it is not enough to protect ourselves  from future attacks. There is no longer any doubt that our elections  will continue to be a target for foreign adversaries. Intelligence  reports make it clear that Russia used covert cyber attacks, espionage,  and harmful propaganda to attack our political system.   Trump administration officials--not Obama officials, Trump  intelligence officials--continue to sound the alarm that Russia is  continuing its efforts to attack our democracy. The CIA Director said  that he has seen no signs that Russia has decreased its activity and  that Russia is currently working to disrupt the upcoming 2018  elections. National Intelligence Director Coats, who was once a Senator  here, said that Russia is bolder.   It would be a mistake to think the sanctions passed today are all we  need to do to address these warnings. They will no doubt help because  if you do nothing, then you just embolden them to do more. It is the  policy of the United States to defend against and respond to cyber  threats to our democratic system, and we need to start acting like it.  We need to be as sophisticated as those who are trying to do us harm.   We know that Russia attempted to hack into 21 States' election  systems. In Illinois, they actually got into the voter data system.  That is why Senator Lankford and I have led a bill to take an amount of  money which is just 3 percent of one aircraft carrier and invest it in  our States, to let them, on a decentralized basis, make their own  decisions about the kind of equipment they want and to be able to  upgrade it. Forty of our States have not upgraded their equipment in 10  years. Ten of our States do not even have backup paper ballots. What  would happen if they were hacked, as they got so close the last time?  There would be no way to prove what actually happened. You would have  to vote again.   That is why we have Democrats and Republicans supporting this effort.  Representative Mark Meadows, the head of the Freedom Caucus, is leading  the bill that Senator Graham and I have--which is similar to the one I  have with Senator Lankford--over in the House. Senator Coons from the  Appropriations Committee has been a strong supporter of this effort, as  have Senator Kamala Harris, Senator Graham, and a number of other  people. This is a truly bipartisan effort because people understand  that it is no longer going to be only traditional ways of warfare when  we are attacked; it is going to be cyber. It is not going to be just  election infrastructure. It is not going to be just government  infrastructure. It is going to be our businesses, power companies--you  name it. That is why we need to upgrade our cyber protection.   The last thing I would mention on this front, as we look to the next  election and how we are going to protect our democracy, is the Honest  Ads Act.  [[Page S1756]]  This is a bill I have with Senator McCain, also cosponsored by Senator  Warner, the ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. This  is based on the fact that we know Russia spent millions of dollars  buying ads. That was reflected in the indictment of 13 Russians and  what they did and how they plotted to disrupt elections and to spend  money on political ads. A number of these ads were even purchased in  rubles.   What Senator McCain and Senator Warner and I are trying to do is  simply apply the same rules already in place to protect Americans in  our elections by making sure that we know who is paying for the ads and  what those ads are. Who is paying for the ads--those are the simple  disclaimers you see on the ads where they say, whoever the candidate  is, I paid for this ad. Who discloses the ads--that is simply when any  radio station or TV station--you can go into the station or see it  online and see what the ads are. That is not true right now of some of  the most sophisticated companies, if not the most sophisticated  companies, in America, companies like Facebook and Twitter, which have  made millions and billions of dollars, companies that are profiting off  of political ads.   It is no different from when a newspaper or a TV station allows  someone to buy an ad. They make money off it, so it is their duty to  protect the citizens, to make sure that the ads don't contain  falsehoods, that the ads are not criminal, that the ads are known to  everyone. That is all we are trying to do, is to apply the same rules  of the game to what you see when you see political ads on issues or  candidate ads.   The FEC did something just yesterday--but it was very narrow--about  candidate ads. So what you see on candidate ads and issue ads--that you  also see those same disclaimers and, most importantly, the disclosure  on ads that are on social media companies. And I use those words  carefully--``media companies.'' Newspaper print and radio--we love  them--are media companies. Facebook and Twitter--we love them--are  media companies. We are not talking about recipes and cat videos. We  are not talking about free stuff that people put up. We are talking  about paid political ads that need to be treated the same.   While we are pleased that these sanctions have been put in place,  while it is good that the FEC is narrowly trying to do something within  their jurisdiction about disclaimers on candidate ads, we must pass the  Honest Ads Act, because if we think it was bad last election when $1.4  billion was spent on election ads, try this next one out: Forecasts are  that $3 billion to $4 billion is going to be spent on social media ads  against candidates on issues, and there is no way to track it. It is  just going to go out to your Facebook page. You are not going to know  if it is true, you are not going to know who paid for it, and the ads  will just vanish.   I think Americans deserve something better, and I ask my colleagues  to support the Honest Ads Act.   Madam President, I yield the floor.
