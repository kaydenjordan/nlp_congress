 Mr. Speaker, in the lead-up to the Apollo 11 Moon  landing's 50th anniversary, people across our country, including many  from my State, Utah, have been sharing their memories of this historic  event and its inspiration in their lives. Some of the lucky ones played  a role in helping the space program reach this historic achievement.   Brigham Young University graduate Charlie Bunker remembers watching  from a common room of a boardinghouse in downtown Denver. Charlie's  companion was an Amish gentleman who turned to him and asked if he  thought the astronauts were really going to land on the Moon. Charlie  said, yes, he was sure, because he worked at a place where they made  the rockets that helped to get them there.   Charlie was a physicist who remembers, as a 19-year-old, President  John F. Kennedy issue his challenge to America to go to the Moon. And  after graduating from college and getting married, Charlie landed a job  with the Hughes Corporation in Los Angeles for a starting salary of  $8,000 a year. He worked on Surveyor, a NASA-funded program that sent  unmanned rockets to the Moon. That work led to being hired by Martin  Marietta, a Denver-based aerospace company.   Charlie and his family were living temporarily in the boardinghouse  on the historymaking night of the Moon landing. Charlie worked for  Martin Marietta for nearly 40 years, including the last few years in  Utah.   When the Deseret News asked readers to answer whether they remembered  where they were on July 20, 1969, they received hundreds of responses.  Several Utahns who were serving in the military wrote in, and one  wrote: ``I was returning from a night mission over the Ho Chi Min trail  in Laos as a pilot of a B-57. I remember it was a clear night with a  full Moon, and my navigator and I were listening to the radio broadcast  on Armed Forces radio at 30,000 feet. Later, my wife and I had Neil  Armstrong to dinner in Paris while I was Air Attache to France.''   Another wrote: ``I was at building No. 9 Manned Spacecraft Center,  now called the Johnson Spacecraft Center, in Houston. NASA set up big  TV screens and chairs for NASA employees and their friends. I remember  the pride and accomplishment of the mission and celebrations from NASA  engineers and contractors. I remember it like it was yesterday.''   Apollo 11 and the Moon landing was a jewel in NASA's crown at the  time. It set the foundation for many future American achievements in  space.   Sixteen years later, Utah Senator Jake Garn became the first sitting  Member of Congress to fly in space when he flew aboard the space  shuttle Discovery as a payload specialist in 1985.   The closest I have gotten to the Moon--to date, anyway--is when, as  the mayor of Salt Lake County, I placed the Clark Planetarium Moon rock  into the Zions Bank vault for safekeeping. The planetarium was  undergoing renovation, and we transferred our precious Moon rock under  the watchful eye of law enforcement to its secure and temporary home.   Our planetarium is one of many across the country that benefits from  Apollo's legacy and brings science education to life for students in  Utah. Those students will soon hopefully become the engineers, the  mathematicians, and the explorers who will chart the next five decades  of space research and space travel.   Here in Congress, I am proud to sit on the Science, Space, and  Technology Committee, where we continue our forebearers' legacy of  bipartisan investment in our Nation's space program. Apollo inspired a  generation of scientists and Americans, and some day soon, my four  children may become space travelers themselves when space tourism  becomes a reality. They will stand on the shoulders of the thousands of  dedicated men and women who dreamed the impossible dream and then made  it a reality.                            ____________________
