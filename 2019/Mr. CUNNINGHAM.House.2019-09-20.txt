 Mr. Speaker, on September 19 and 20, 2019, I was  absent from the House chamber. I returned to my district in South  Carolina to attend to a family matter. Accordingly, I was unable to  vote on three legislative measures on the floor. Had I been present and  voting, I would have voted as follows: ``aye'' on rollcall No. 536: H.
