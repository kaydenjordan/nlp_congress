 Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to voice my strong  support for President-elect Trump's outstanding choice for Secretary of  Education, Betsy DeVos.   A fellow Michigander, Betsy has worked tirelessly on behalf of the  children of our country, striving to improve education and return  authority back to those who know best--parents and the States. Not only  has Michigan benefited from her efforts, but she has worked across the  country to improve test scores and promote the highest level of  academic achievement. She is committed to not only promoting strong  schools, but she has also worked on an individual basis by personally  mentoring children and interacting with their parents.   I have no doubt that Betsy will continue to be a strong advocate for  our children and that she will ensure that our education is as it  should be--the greatest in the world.                            ____________________
