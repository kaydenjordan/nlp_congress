 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on  the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order  that a quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of  Penny Brammer, who passed away last week after a courageous battle with  breast cancer. She was 59.   Penny worked for the Pennsylvania FFA Association and was  affectionately known as ``Mama B'' by the Commonwealth's youth leaders  of agriculture. She inspired thousands of teenagers to have the passion  and drive to pursue their dreams.   Penny is survived by her loving husband, high school and FFA  sweetheart, Michael Brammer; her son and daughter-in-law, Greg and  Jackie Brammer; her daughter and son-in-law, Sherisa and Jason Nailor;  as well as her parents, George and Shirley Shaver. She also leaves her  adored grandchildren: Terrin, Grace, Joleigh, Jordyn, and Jayce.   Mr. Speaker, my heart is heavy for the entire Brammer family, as well  as for Penny's extended family at the Pennsylvania FFA Association and  the New Kingstown Volunteer Fire Company where Penny and Michael  enjoyed years of fellowship and service to the community.   Penny dedicated her life to helping others, especially our youth. Her  memory will live on in the hearts of all those whose lives she touched.                            ____________________
