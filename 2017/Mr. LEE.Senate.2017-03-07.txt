 Mr. President, I am truly saddened that I must address what  I fear is a growing threat to our Republic--the silencing of political  debate by totalitarian mob violence on college campuses.   I was not in Burlington, VT, last Thursday to witness what happened  at Middlebury College, but I would like to read from accounts that have  been provided by two people who were, in fact, there and who saw these  things unfold. They were the targets of the mob's violence. Their names  are Allison Stanger, professor of political science at Middlebury  College, and Charles Murray, the author of several groundbreaking  books, including the work ``The Bell Curve'' and a scholar at the  American Enterprise Institute. America deserves and needs to hear their  stories.   On Saturday, 2 days after the incident, Professor Stanger wrote on  her Facebook page as follows:         I agreed to participate in the event with Charles Murray       because several of my students asked me to do so. They are       smart and good people--all of them--and this was their big       event of the year.        I, actually, welcomed the opportunity to be involved       because, while my students may know I am a Democrat, all of       my courses are nonpartisan, and this was a chance to       demonstrate publicly my commitment to a free and fair       exchange of views in my classroom.        As the campus uproar about his visit built, I was genuinely       surprised and troubled to learn that some of my faculty       colleagues had rendered judgment on Dr. Murray's work and       character while openly admitting that they had not read       anything he had written. With the best of intentions, they       offered their leadership to enraged students, and we all know       what the results were.        I want you to know what it feels like to look out at a sea       of students yelling obscenities at other members of my       beloved community. . . . I saw some of my faculty colleagues,       who had publicly acknowledged that they had not read anything       Dr. Murray had written, join the effort to shut down the       lecture. All of this was deeply unsettling to me.        What alarmed me most, however, was what I saw in student       eyes from up on that stage. Those who wanted the event to       take place made eye contact with me. Those intent on       disrupting it steadfastly refused to do so. It was clear to       me that they had effectively dehumanized me. They couldn't       look me in the eye because, if they had, they would have seen       another human being. There is a lot to be angry about in       America today, but nothing good ever comes from demonizing       our brothers and sisters.        When the event ended and it was time to leave the building,       I breathed a sigh of relief. We had made it. I was ready for       dinner and conversation with faculty and students in a       tranquil setting. What transpired instead felt like a scene       from [the TV show] ``Homeland'' rather than an evening at an       institution of higher learning. We confronted an angry mob as       we tried to exit the building.        Most of the hatred was focused on Dr. Murray, but when I       took his right arm both to shield him from the attack and to       make sure we stayed together so I could reach the car, too,       that's when the hatred turned on me.        One thug grabbed me by the hair, and another shoved me in a       different direction. I noticed signs with expletives and my       name on them. . . . For those of you who marched in       Washington the day after the inauguration, imagine being in a       crowd like that, only being surrounded by hatred rather than       love. I feared for my life.   [[Page S1633]]     The next day, on Sunday, the American Enterprise Institute's website  published this account from Dr. Charles Murray.   Dr. Murray wrote:         If it hadn't been for Allison and Bill Burger [Middlebury's       Vice President for Communications] keeping hold of me and the       security guards pulling people off me, I would have been       pushed to the ground. That much is sure. What would have       happened after that I don't know, but I do recall thinking       that being on the ground was a really bad idea, and I should       try really hard to avoid that. Unlike Allison, I wasn't       actually hurt at      all. . . .        In the 23 years since ``The Bell Curve'' was published, I       have had considerable experience with campus protests. Until       last Thursday, all of the ones involving me have been as       carefully scripted as kabuki: The college administration       meets with the organizers of the protest, and ground rules       are agreed upon. The protesters have so many minutes to do       such and such. It is agreed that, after the allotted time,       they will leave or desist. These negotiated agreements have       always worked. At least a couple of dozen times, I have been       able to give my lecture to an attentive or, at least, quiet       audience despite an organized protest.        Middlebury tried to negotiate such an agreement with the       protesters, but for the first time in my experience, the       protesters would not accept any time limits. If this becomes       the new normal, the number of colleges willing to let       themselves in for an experience like Middlebury's will plunge       to near zero. Academia is already largely sequestered in an       ideological bubble, but at least it's translucent. That       bubble will become opaque.        Worse yet, the intellectual thugs will take over many       campuses. In the mid-1990s, I could count on students who had       wanted to listen to start yelling at the protesters after a       certain point, ``Sit down and shut up. We want to hear what       he has to say.'' That kind of pushback had an effect. It       reminded the protesters that they were a minority.        I am assured [he continues] by people at Middlebury that       their protesters are a minority as well, but they are a       minority that has intimidated the majority. The people in the       audience who wanted to hear me speak were completely cowed.       That cannot be allowed to stand. A campus where a majority of       students are fearful to speak openly because they know a       minority will jump on them is no longer an intellectually       free campus in any meaningful sense.    I suspect that most of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  may not necessarily be fans of Dr. Charles Murray. There is nothing  wrong with that, but I am confident they at least would be honest  enough and self-respecting enough not to condemn any scholar's work  without ever having read it, like many of Middlebury's faculty members  apparently did. More importantly, I am confident my Democratic  colleagues would join me in denouncing the violence of the Middlebury  campus protesters who sought to silence Dr. Murray. On countless  occasions, I have heard my Democratic colleagues come to the Senate  floor to condemn violence in all of its forms. Why would this time be  any different?   We do not agree on everything, but I am confident that if Dr. Murray  were invited to testify here on Capitol Hill--perhaps at a committee of  the United States Senate--my Democratic colleagues would eagerly join  in an open and respectful debate that would ensue as a result of that  visit. I am confident they would reject any effort to silence or to do  harm to those with whom they might disagree. In fact, I am confident  that if any outburst like that happened, whoever was chairing that  committee and the ranking personnel associated with that committee  would immediately bring the disruption to a close so an open, honest,  respectful discussion could occur within that meeting.   I know tensions are high in America today, and I know what it is like  to be on the losing side of a bitterly fought Presidential election as  we, as Republicans, found ourselves in just a few years ago in the wake  of the 2012 election cycle and in the wake of the previous Presidential  election cycle before that in 2008, but that does not and cannot give  anyone the license to shout down a fellow American, let alone to  physically assault him just because he holds a different opinion.   Democracy and freedom--the republican form of government--depend on  open, tolerant, and civil political discourse, and sustaining our  democratic freedoms is, perhaps, the sole reason the government  subsidizes institutions of higher education in this country.   It is embarrassing that teachers and students at an elite college  like Middlebury should need reminding, but speech is not violence, and  violence is not speech. Totalitarians who fail to recognize this core  fact of decency and tolerance are goose-stepping into some of the  darkest corners of the human heart.   If there is anything that should unite us in these polarized times,  it is that the kind of violence we saw on Middlebury's campus last week  must not be tolerated. That is why I commend the 44 Middlebury College  professors who have signed a ``Statement of Principles'' on ``Free  Inquiry on Campus.'' I hope more Middlebury professors will join them.  In any event, I hope all Americans will join them in standing up for  free, open, honest, respectful debate.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate be in  a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak therein  for up to 10 minutes each.
