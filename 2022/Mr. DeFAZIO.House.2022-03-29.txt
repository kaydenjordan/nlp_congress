This bipartisan legislation will authorize funding for the United  States Coast Guard for fiscal years 2022 and 2023 and address a number  of important issues concerning the maritime industry.   I would like to take a moment to express my deepest sympathies to  Congressman Don Young's wife, Anne, the rest of the family, and the  people of Alaska.   Don was larger than life. He was the dean of the House. He was  affable, cantankerous, and sometimes funny.   You know, I have stories like the Speaker mentioned today about Don  and the buck knife in his pocket, but I won't go into those now. But,  anyway, we developed a good friendship.   I feel fortunate that I had time to develop that relationship with  him, serving together on both the House Committee on Natural Resources  for 26 years and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure for  36 years.   His service as Chair of the Transportation and Infrastructure  Committee had an extraordinary impact. It was capped by the passage of  SAFETEA-LU, a surface transportation reauthorization that was named for  his beloved late wife.   It was a strong bipartisan bill that provided much-needed investment  infrastructure across the country, including my home State of Oregon.   Don believed in bipartisanship. We didn't always agree, but we would  often find a way to compromise, come together for the good of the  country, and he always, always stayed true to his values and the people  of Alaska.   Given Alaska's vast coastlines, the Coast Guard plays a particularly  important role in the State, and Congressman Young was always there to  support the United States Coast Guard.   That is why I am particularly happy to include several provisions  important to the Congressman that will have a dramatic impact on the  State of Alaska and this bill.   At a committee markup earlier this month, Don said, I have voted on  20 Coast Guard authorization bills in my career. I have served on the  Coast Guard subcommittee for 46 years. This is a good bill. It is  really needed. And it is really needed. And naming it for Don Young is  incredibly appropriate.   I would like to thank my ranking member, Sam Graves, and Subcommittee  Ranking Member Gibbs for their work. I particularly want to thank the  chair of the subcommittee, Congressman Carbajal, for this very  important and overdue additional investment in the Coast Guard and  addressing a number of other issues relating to the maritime industry.  This is evidence that bipartisanship can still live in Washington, D.C.  today.   It not only authorizes the Coast Guard but also reauthorizes the  Federal Maritime Commission which is the center of the supply chain  congestion that has plagued this country and the world for over a year.   It incorporates the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 2021 which will  begin to address several unfair shipping practices that have  contributed to inflation across every sector of the American economy.   This legislation gives the Federal Maritime Commission the authority  to protect exporters, importers, and consumers from unfair practices by  expanding their oversight and enforcement capabilities.   The largest three shipping companies in the world made more money in  the last year than they made over the last decade. It is not warranted.  They are essentially running a cartel, and it is time that we took  action.   The Federal Maritime Commission, under this administration, is  finally waking up, and they are going to take action against these  cartels and the price gouging that is going on on our consumers.   It further amends title 46 to ensure shipping capacity once contracts  are signed, increases penalties for retaliation against shippers, and  encourages reciprocal trade.   H.R. 6865 increases the Federal Maritime Commission's annual  operating budget by 10 percent over 2021. It will give them the  additional resources they need to provide effective oversight and  ensure that all foreign carriers abide by fair shipping practices which  they are not doing today.   For the Coast Guard, this bill provides more than $12 billion for  fiscal year 2022, $13 billion for fiscal year 2023. These authorized  funding levels support servicemembers, fund new asset acquisitions, and  improve the Coast Guard's crumbling shoreside infrastructure.   I am particularly pleased with the improved vessel safety measures  included in the legislation, and H.R. 6865 takes a leap forward in  small passenger vessel safety by mandating commonsense requirements for  passenger amphibious vessels and others.   Chairman Carbajal recently held a hearing on a horrible tragedy in  his district which this will also have an impact in preventing in the  future.   Moreover, H.R. 6865 offers meaningful reforms to a culture of sexual  abuse within the maritime industry. I am proud to have worked with  Members from both sides of the aisle to determine what changes are  necessary to begin to address the toxic culture in the industry and  create a safe work environment for all mariners.   H.R. 6865 includes language from my other bill, the Safer Seas Act,  which will give the Coast Guard more leverage to investigate and remove  predators who sexually harass and assault. It also includes important  safety measures such as surveillance, master key control systems, and  extends the statute of limitations for cases of sexual assault and  harassment.    This groundbreaking legislation is just one step towards bringing  justice for victims and getting predators out of the industry.   In closing, let me thank once again my Ranking Member Sam Graves,  Ranking Member Gibbs, and of course, Chair Carbajal for all their  extraordinary work on this bill.  [[Page H3920]]    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the chair of the  subcommittee, Congressman Carbajal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Garamendi), a senior member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Auchincloss), a member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Keating).    Mr. Speaker, certainly, I would assure both this  gentleman and Representative Auchincloss that I will be happy to work  with the two of them as the legislation goes to the Senate.   I want to move toward employing qualified American mariners and to  have the people who work on these ships meet the same requirements as  American mariners.   Flags of convenience have destroyed the U.S. maritime industry. We  are going to rebuild it, and we are going to rebuild it with American  crews and ships. Dominion Resources is currently building an insertion  ship.   I certainly do not want to impede projects in the near term, Vineyard  Wind and others that are immediately pending, and we will work to  ensure there are no disruptions as we move toward a cleaner energy  future.   I would be happy to work with the two gentlemen and others who are  concerned.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1600     Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman  from New York (Ms. Malliotakis).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, it was very fitting the tributes that we heard. We all  have stories about Don, and I wish we had more time to share, but his  many decades of work will stand as a monument to his life, and this  bill, in particular, will honor his extraordinary service on the  Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. I think it was called  Public Works when Don first came to serve here.   Madam Speaker, I urge support for this bill. As I mentioned earlier,  we are finally recognizing that the Coast Guard has been under  resourced for decades. We are beginning to deal with that problem,  their shoreside infrastructure, their assets at sea, and in particular,  the extraordinary people who serve in the United States Coast Guard.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to have named the bill for Don. I would  urge that this bill be unanimously approved by our colleagues, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
