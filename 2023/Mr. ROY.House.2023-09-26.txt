Sec. 14.

The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on such bill and       amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit.        Sec. 15.  The Clerk shall not transmit to the Senate a       message that the House has passed H.R. 4367 until notified by       the Speaker that H.R. 2, as passed by the House on May 11,       2023, has been enacted into law.                                time  1745                                Point of Order     Madam Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the point  of order in favor of consideration of the resolution.    Madam Speaker, the question before the House of  Representatives is: Should the House now consider House Resolution 723,  the rule that is before us, a rule that we are looking to advance this  evening to advance four appropriations bills that, when combined with  the appropriations bill we passed in July, would fund 73 percent of  government.   Meanwhile, the United States Senate has passed no appropriations  bills, and in fact, sent a continuing resolution to the floor just now,  just this evening, having not done its job to pass appropriations  bills.   The fact of the matter is the waiver we are talking about here in the  rules is a prophylactic waiver that my colleagues used all the time  when they were in the majority. They know full well that is what they  are doing. This is dilatory. This is purposeful. I would do it too if I  didn't have all my folks back for the vote. That is what I would do.  That is the reality of what we are talking about here.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle are talking about  unfunded mandates. Let's talk about unfunded mandates.   Let's talk about all of the subsidies that are going out for electric  vehicles to subsidize the elite in this country that make over $200,000  and $250,000 a year.   Let's talk about the subsidies, 90 percent of the corporate subsidies  going to billion-dollar corporations.   Let's talk about the mandates in the form of vaccine mandates, mask  mandates, and all of the mandates during COVID that shut down the  largest economy that this world has ever known.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle complain about a  shutdown. Yet, they are the masters of shutdown. They shut down and  brought to a halt the great American economy resulting in exactly what  you are experiencing right now: what the American people are feeling in  terms of inflation, in terms of inability to afford homes, inability to  afford gasoline, inability to afford power. Those are the mandates that  the American people are concerned about. Those are the unfunded  mandates that are killing their way of life right now at home.   That is the simple fact.   My colleagues are talking about the government and what it might cost  if there is a government shutdown Saturday. Let's be very clear. If  there is a shutdown on Saturday, it is because President Biden, Chuck  Schumer, and my Democratic colleagues would prefer to shut down the  government of the United States than shut down the border of the United  States and protect the American people.   That is the simple truth. That is how there would be a resulting  shutdown on Saturday.   They lament what might be the impact on government, and that is  because they have a government, the American people have a government  that is on autopilot. We have a government that is so big and is funded  with mandatory spending and is on autopilot such that you cannot  constrain it.   The American people are asking why. The American people are asking  what can you do about it.   I will give you the answer: My Democratic colleagues want more of the  same. That is why our Democratic leadership in the United States Senate  has put forward a continuing resolution on the floor of the Senate just  now, in the last hour, that will perpetuate the status quo, will  continue to fund government exactly as it was funded last December at  the obscene levels of that $1.7 trillion omnibus spending bill.   They are going to send that bill over here to the House and say to  the American people they want status quo, business as usual, and they  are going to pile on additional supplemental funding. That is their  response to what the American people are feeling and seeing.   I, if I were my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, would also  want to have a dilatory vote because I would not have actual solutions  for the American people.   What we are trying to put forward here, again, are four  appropriations bills that fund 73 percent of the government when  combined with MILCON-VA, which we passed in July. That is what my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle do not want to go ahead and  move to. They want to put forward a dilatory point of order because  they don't have answers for the American people.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, as I said, this is a dilatory tactic by my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I wouldn't want to speak  about what is going on either.   I wouldn't want to speak about the story this afternoon of Hunter  Biden receiving a $250,000 wire originating in Beijing with the  beneficiary address listed as Joe Biden's home. I wouldn't want to talk  about that.   I wouldn't want to talk about what we have been learning in the  Committee on the Judiciary. I wouldn't want to be learning about what  is going on or talking about what we have heard from the whistleblowers  or from Devon Archer. I wouldn't want to talk about that at all. I  would want to sweep that aside.   I wouldn't want to talk about the Department of Justice that targeted  Scott Smith and put him on the domestic terrorism list.   I wouldn't want to talk about a Department of Justice that targeted  Mark Houck and have used the FACE Act to go after pro-life Americans.   I wouldn't want to talk about anything that this administration is  doing. I would want to delay.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Johnson),  my good friend.    Madam Speaker, again, my colleagues don't want to focus on  the  [[Page H4486]]  issues the American people care about, and they certainly don't want to  talk about the issues that are, frankly, pretty embarrassing to the  track record of my Democratic colleagues.   As I said, they don't want to talk about Hunter Biden. They don't  want to talk about the Department of Justice and how it has been  weaponized against the American people.   They don't want to talk about a Strategic Petroleum Reserve that has  been decimated and the high cost of gasoline and electricity. They  don't want to talk about inflation. They don't want to talk about  housing prices.   They don't want to talk about a Department of Defense that is more  focused on social engineering than carrying out the mission that it is  given.   They don't want to talk about crime.   They don't want to talk about woke policies in which men are swimming  against women in swimming meets.   They don't want to talk about the border. We are going to talk about  the border, but I assure you, they do not want to talk about the  border.   They talk about consequences.   Last Thursday, Texas authorities recovered the bodies of two  migrants, including a 3-year-old boy who tried crossing the Rio Grande.  Then 2 weeks ago, a 10-year-old migrant boy drowned while trying to  cross the Rio Grande.   Last year, 853 migrants died crossing the southern border; 53 in a  tractor-trailer in the city of San Antonio, which I represent.   Thousands of Americans are dying from fentanyl poisoning. There are  moms that I have to talk to, dads that I have to talk to in Texas who  have to bury another child because we refuse utterly to secure the  border of the United States.   Again, the President of the United States, the Democratic leadership  of the Senate, and the Democrat minority in the House utterly refuse to  do their job to shut down the open border of the United States to  secure our people. They are perfectly content with then shutting down  the government because they refuse to do their job.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, last summer, our Democratic colleagues sent a  package, a minibus of six appropriations bills, and in one vote wiped  their hands and said they were done. Then there was a massive omnibus  spending bill that was sent over to us in December.   What I ask my colleagues is: What would you cut? What would you do to  actually reduce the deficit and reduce the debt of the United States  when we are $33 trillion in debt and we are going to have $2 trillion  of deficit spending this year?   We are putting forward bills that would reduce spending. We are  putting forward bills that would actually move the Department of  Defense appropriations bills over to the Senate, and do so responsibly,  the Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill, the State- Foreign Operations, and Agriculture, on top of MILCON-VA, which we  already passed.   My colleague talks about wasting time. What have we been doing for  the last 20 minutes besides waste time here on the floor of the House  with a dilatory tactic, which my colleagues fully understand has no  basis. They are objecting to a waiver that they have constantly used  themselves.   The fact is they have no message so my colleagues are resorting to  dilatory tactics.   Again, shut down the open border or risk shutting down the government  of the United States.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts, pending which  I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this  resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, on Saturday, the Rules Committee reported a  rule for four appropriations measures and made in order 440 total  amendments.   We bring to the floor H.R. 4365, the Department of Defense  Appropriations Act; 180 amendments were made in order.   This bill, combined with the amendments that were made in order,  takes significant steps to invest in resources that will help deter  China, will cut the bureaucracy, will support military families and  servicemembers, and will restore the Department of Defense's focus to  warfighting rather than social engineering.   We bring to the floor H.R. 4665, the Department of State, Foreign  Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2024.   This bill would defund international bodies like the World Health  Organization, eliminate woke offices at the State Department, defund  John Kerry, and it stands up for Israel while funding our State  Department and foreign operations.   H.R. 4368, the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug  Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2024, was also  a part of the rule.   This bill makes significant strides to reduce spending to pre-COVID  levels, prevents members of the Communist Party of China from buying  United States farmland, defunds the FDA's rule allowing abortion drugs  by mail, and makes strides in ending wokeness at the United States  Department of Agriculture.   Madam Speaker, importantly, these three bills, combined with the next  one that I am going to talk about, reflect our commitment to reduce  spending and an agreement to reduce spending further than the FRA,  which was passed earlier this year, to a target of $1.526 trillion of  discretionary spending.   That is our goal. That is our objective. It is something the American  people are clamoring for from their leaders in Washington--to actually  address the debt crisis fueling inflation and undermining the  sovereignty of our Nation.   This is why we are here. This is the job we are supposed to do. I  have offered to my colleagues that I wish this were July. We passed  MILCON-VA in July. The Senate has passed nothing.   Last year, under Democrat control, six bills were packaged together  in the summer and passed, and then a massive omnibus bill was passed in  December.   I had an exchange with one of my Democratic colleagues a minute ago  about this not being regular order, but this actually is regular order.   It is late in the process, I acknowledge. We are trying to move four  bills that would total, when combined with MILCON-VA, upwards of almost  three-quarters of the discretionary funding for our government.   Hopefully, we can reach some resolution as to how to move forward  funding the government appropriately. We obviously have disagreements  on what funding the government appropriately means, which stands here  at the center of the debate, stands here at the center of the impasse,  which brings me to H.R. 4367, the Department of Homeland Security  Appropriations Act.   It is a good bill, has strong provisions, strong language in it to  try to encourage the Department of Homeland Security and Secretary  Mayorkas to do their jobs.   In our view, it is not sufficient because the Secretary, backed by  the President of the United States, has utterly refused to do his job.   This should concern all of us. Every Member of this body, Democrat or  Republican, Texas or New York, Florida or California, ought to be  concerned with what is happening to our country, what is happening in  Eagle Pass, Texas.   Madam Speaker, 11,000 human beings, 11,000 the night before last,  304,000 apprehensions in August--this is incomprehensible. The human  toll is staggering; the deaths from fentanyl poisoning, the things that  we have talked about ad nauseam on this floor.   As I was alluding to earlier, it is not compassionate to have open  borders as currently exist under this administration and under the  leadership of Secretary Mayorkas.   Last Thursday, Texas authorities recovered the bodies of two  migrants, including a 3-year-old boy, trying to cross the Rio Grande.   Madam Speaker, 2 weeks ago, a 10-year-old migrant drowned while  trying to cross the Rio Grande, and 853 migrants died last year.   This is every day in Texas. I get a phone call or a text from a  rancher every day in Texas. They find a body on their ranch. How is  that remotely acceptable?   That is at the center of this debate. There are countless issues we  disagree on, countless issues we need to address, and the  appropriations process can, in fact, through the power of the purse,  address many of those issues. These bills do that.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle say, well, these bills  are dead on arrival. Well, that is how this process works. We put  forward bills, and if there is disagreement, if the Senate disagrees,  then we conference. I hope we can get to that stage.   I, again, will posit I wish this were July or August or 3 weeks ago,  but we sit here with four bills that will fund almost 75 percent of the  government when added to MILCON-VA.    Let's do our job. Let's work to move the DHS bill. Let's work  together to figure out how to deal with the border.   To be very clear, we must address the border. That is a nonnegotiable  truth;  [[Page H4488]]  that we must address the border. We can sit around a table and debate  how, but we must address it.   There has been too much death, too much destruction, too much damage  to States and to human beings across this country, and the Federal  Government has an obligation to do its job, and that is what we are  endeavoring to do.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   First of all, with all due respect to the gentleman from  Massachusetts, the bill we put forward does not cut funding. It  increases spending over last year.   We can debate the merits of that and debate how much we need to  restrain spending, but it is simply not true. Let's at least speak  about the facts before us and the legislation in front of us.   I heard my colleague talking about getting our act together. I would  say to my colleague from Massachusetts: How about the Senate and the  President get their act together? How about they actually do their jobs  and secure the border of United States?   The gentleman from Massachusetts just blithely swept it aside. Oh, it  is an important issue. Tell that to the people in Texas. In August,  304,000 encounters, the fifth month in fiscal year 2023 over 200,000,  2.2 million in fiscal year 2023 encounters.   Since the President took office, there have been nearly 6 million  illegal migrants encountered along the southwest border, more than the  populations of Houston and Dallas combined.   We have had 2 million released in the United States, thousands of  migrants traveling through the Darien Gap, trains chock-full of people,  children getting sold into the sex trafficking trade on a daily basis.   We know it because it is in Federal orders from judges. These are not  made-up facts. They are right before us, and my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle don't care, and the Senate leadership, the Democrats  leading the Senate and the President don't care, and the Secretary of  Homeland Security doesn't care.   My answer to the question about why we are saying that H.R. 2 must be  signed into law before the funding bill gets passed is because the law  must change, and the Secretary must be forced to do his job because he  is refusing to do it.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina  (Mr. Norman).    Madam Speaker, the only people being held hostage are the  American people by Democrat leadership in the Senate and in the White  House; holding them hostage to a wide open border, endangering them  every single day, including the 110,000 some-odd migrants that have  been sent to and gone to New York City, and that are endangering our  people on the streets.   The American people are, in fact, being held hostage because this  Democratic leadership refuses to do their job to secure the border.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Burgess), my friend and colleague.    Madam Speaker, the American people are fed up, my  constituents are fed up, the people we represent are fed up, and they  are fed up with the very deal that the gentleman from Massachusetts  just described that came out of the Senate.   Madam Speaker, that is 45 days of continued spending at the existing  levels and continuing the status quo with an additional $6 billion for  Ukraine, and nothing to deal with the border. Nothing. Zero changes at  the border.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Perry).                                time  1915     Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Gaetz), my friend and colleague.    Madam Speaker, how much time is remaining on both sides?    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from South  Dakota (Mr. Johnson), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, one of the previous speakers from my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle talked about victims, and I would note the  extent to which we have countless victims, as we have talked about  before, from the scourge of fentanyl poisonings across this country.   Two weeks ago, 1-year-old Nicholas Feliz Dominici died from fentanyl  exposure from a kilo of fentanyl at an at-home daycare in the Bronx,  New York, that, reportedly, a new arrival from the Dominican Republic  was renting out.   More than 25,000 pounds of fentanyl have been seized in FY23. I spent  time in August sitting on panels with moms and dads who lost their  children to fentanyl poisonings--six children in the school district in  which I reside. It is commonplace in Texas. It is becoming,  unfortunately, more commonplace around the country.   How about the woman who was stabbed 28 times by an illegal immigrant  with a criminal record in Pennsylvania, or the 10-year-old boy who was  on a schoolbus on the first day of school killed by an illegal  immigrant who ran into the bus? How about the father in Florida who  opened his home to a supposedly unaccompanied alien child, who was 19  years old, and he stabbed and killed the father of this family who  opened his home?   This is happening every day to the American people, and my colleagues  on the other side of the aisle do not care. They watch Secretary  Mayorkas completely ignore his duty to secure the border of the United  States, leaving us entirely exposed to cartels and to the flood of  fentanyl pouring into our communities. Border Patrol is overwhelmed,  trying to manage numbers at the border, which is completely avoidable  if the Secretary and the President would actually follow the law.   Republicans have responded with a bill that would force the Secretary  to follow the law and that would improve the laws of the United States  to secure the border of the United States, as we are constitutionally  required to do. We have made that a condition precedent for giving more  money to the Secretary of Homeland Security as he ignores his job and  endangers the American people. We will continue to do that.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I have absolutely no idea what the gentleman from  Massachusetts was just talking about. We have four bills before us here  in the House of Representatives, four bills that, when combined with  the MILCON-VA bill that we passed in July, would fund upward of 75  percent of our discretionary spending of government. That is what is on  the floor of the House.   The fact is, the four bills we have before us represent this body  doing its job. The gentleman says the Senate is going to be the adults  who save us. This is a Senate that has passed not one appropriations  bill. This is a Senate that today dropped on the floor of  [[Page H4494]]  the Senate a bill that no one had seen 45 minutes prior to the vote, a  bill which would continue to spend at the levels adopted last December  that are yielding $2 trillion a year in deficit spending.   If that represents the adults, I think I want to hang out with the  kids because that is not the job that we are supposed to do--$2  trillion a year of deficit spending when we are $33 trillion in debt,  continuing to fund an administration completely at war with the well- being of the American people and a Department of Justice weaponized  against the people like Mark Houck, a father who wakes up with a raid  at his home for defending his son, for exercising his free speech  rights, completely not pursued by local authorities, taken to Federal  court, and summarily dismissed within an hour by a jury. That is your  FBI and Department of Justice at work.    This is the same Department of Justice that wants to label Scott  Smith a domestic terrorist. That is your Department of Justice at work.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle would say the Senate  being adults and writing another check to that Department of Justice is  a good use of your money.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle would say it is a good  idea to continue to rack up $2 trillion in deficit spending, to borrow  more money, to increase inflation, to devalue the dollar, to spend  money we don't have to fund a Department of Homeland Security that  refuses to secure the homeland.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to do this while  thousands of Americans die from fentanyl poisonings, while cartels are  empowered, while China is empowered, while China is selling the  printing presses and the fentanyl pills to the cartels, while thousands  pour into Eagle Pass, while 11,000 people just the day before yesterday  poured across into Eagle Pass, while people are in railroad cars, while  children are dying, while children get sold into the sex trafficking  trade, where migrants are being held for ransom so their little girl  doesn't get raped in a stash house in Fort Worth, Texas. All of that, I  suppose, is from the adults we have in the Senate. They want to  continue to fund a lawless administration, exposing our people to  danger and exposing migrants to danger, all in the false name of  compassion.                                time  1945    Well, if that is what adults look like, count me out. I am going to  stand up for the American people who sent me here to stand up for them.   Madam Speaker, we are going to pass these four bills. We are going to  work hard to do the work for the American people while the Senate can  preen and posture with yet another swamp game by putting forward  another continuing resolution of the status quo rather than trying to  change this place, rather than trying to stand up for the people who  sent us here to do something different: to reduce spending, to secure  the border, to fund our troops at a higher level than we have ever  funded them; a $28 billion increase for the Department of Defense while  we undo the social engineering experiment and refocus the military on  its mission to defend the United States.   I am proud of these four bills. I am proud to stand up here and  advance them forward but let me be very clear: We are going to secure  the border of the United States.   It will be up to Democrats to make a choice. Will they shut down this  open border or will they shut down the government of the United States.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
