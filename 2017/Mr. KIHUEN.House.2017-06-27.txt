 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Rebuilding  America's Schools Act. Every day, students attend schools that put  their health and safety at risk. The average school building is nearly  50 years old, and teachers and children struggle to learn in classrooms  without heat, leaking ceilings, and no working internet.   Mr. Speaker, our children deserve better. Research shows that poor  school facility conditions impact teaching and learning, and  disproportionately plague schools that serve low-income and minority  students all throughout America. Regardless of their ZIP Code, all  children should have access to a quality education, and no child should  have to learn in an unsafe or dilapidated environment.   The Rebuilding America's Schools Act would provide critically needed  investments in Las Vegas and rural Nevada to improve our school  infrastructure, helping teachers teach and children learn.   President Trump has repeatedly promised to rebuild our Nation's  infrastructure. Passing the Rebuilding America's Schools Act would be  the first step in making this happen. We must make an investment in our  future generation to guarantee their shot at success.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this piece of  legislation.
