 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Granger), the ranking member, for yielding.   I rise today in support of my amendment to enhance conditions on our  aid to the Lebanese Armed Forces, LAF.   Mr. Speaker, Lebanon has historically been an appreciated partner of  the United States in the Middle East and a wonderful example of  pluralism and democracy.   Having witnessed decades of occupation by the brutal Assad regime in  Syria, father and son, Lebanon saw the withdrawal of Syrian troops in  2005 after the Lebanese people rose up in the March 15 Cedar Revolution  to demand their sovereignty and freedom.   Unfortunately, however, the gains made by the Cedar Revolution have  been lost in recent years. The Lebanese people continue to protest in  the streets for their rights to a democratic, nonsectarian, noncorrupt  government. However, disturbingly, the LAF have worked to put down the  protests, arresting protesters and committing human rights violations.   The LAF has also done nothing as Hezbollah builds precision-guided  missiles and cross-border tunnel infrastructure to attack Israel in  defiance of U.S. resolutions; yet, U.S. taxpayers continue to fund the  LAF with over $100 million each year.   This aid was surely warranted in previous years during previous  Lebanese Governments, but with the new government, the situation has  changed, and U.S. policies should change accordingly.  [[Page H3819]]    It is time to stand with the people of Lebanon and Syria and ensure  that U.S. tax dollars are not going to a military hijacked by a  terrorist organization and committing human rights violations.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.
