 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a dedicated  leader in the Permian Basin, Odessa College president Dr. Gregory  Williams.   Dr. Williams began his educational career in 1983 as a student at  Odessa College, later attending the University  [[Page H3788]]  of Texas Permian Basin, then earning his doctorate in higher education  from Baylor University. In 2007, Dr. Williams returned to the Permian  Basin to serve as president of Odessa College.   His impressive career has garnered local, State, and national  attention. As both the chairman of the Texas Association of Community  Colleges and as a member of the board of directors and the executive  board of the American Association of Community Colleges, he  continuously dedicates his time for the advocacy of community colleges  and underrepresented communities.   Thanks to Dr. Williams' stewardship, Odessa College has become one of  the most impactful educational institutions in the Nation. Not only did  his leadership earn Odessa College national recognition as a top-ranked  community college, but his tenure as president saw enrollment increase  by 35 percent and the number of degrees awarded by an incredible 197  percent.   I thank my colleague from Illinois for also representing the  achievements of Dr. Williams. He is a fierce advocate of community  colleges. I speak for the entire community in sincerely thanking Dr.  Williams for his commitment to the Permian Basin and to higher  education.                            ____________________
