 Madam President, today, yet another American community is  in shock and grief after yet another American mass shooting. This  morning, a shooter entered the Covenant School in Nashville, TN,  reportedly armed with two assault rifles and a handgun.   This is an elementary school for students in preschool through the  sixth grade. The children are as young as 3 and 4 years old.   Upon entering the school, the shooter opened fire, killing at least  three staff members and three students.   I cannot begin to imagine what the families and school community are  feeling at this moment. We send our prayers and condolences, and we are  certainly grateful to the first responders who were dispatched to the  school within minutes and ran toward the sound of gunfire.   But, once again, thoughts and prayers are not enough. These mass  shootings, especially targeting little children, are happening with  sickening regularity in this Nation. This could be the 129th mass  shooting since this year, 2023, began--129 mass shootings in America,  and we are fewer than 90 days into this calendar year. That is more  than one mass shooting a day.   What is a mass shooting? Four victims either shot or killed in an  incident.   Last year, Congress took some important steps on gun safety reform  with the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act and the Violence Against  Women Act reauthorization. The Judiciary Committee that I serve on has  done a lot of work on those measures, and I am happy to support both of  them.   But as today's shooting in Nashville, TN, demonstrates, there is more  work to be done. The fact that this is a daily occurrence in America is  unconscionable.   We are going to learn more details in the hours and days ahead about  what actually happened in Nashville, but we already know what must be  done to keep our children and communities safe from deadly shootings. I  strongly--strongly--support bills that ban assault weapons from  civilian use and close gaps in our background check system.   I cannot imagine the Founding Fathers would even envision what we are  allowing today in the name of words that they wrote in the Second  Amendment to the Bill of Rights. To think that these weapons--the one  that was used in Highland Park, in my home State of Illinois, on the  Fourth of July, last year--the man discharged 83 rounds in 60 seconds.  Tell me that the Founding Fathers had that in mind when they wrote the  Second Amendment. I don't believe it.   Today, the early reports are that assault weapons may be involved  again. We will wait until we see the actual facts coming in, but it  would be no great surprise if that is the case. It would be a grave  disappointment.   I urge my colleagues to come together on a bipartisan basis. We can't  say that we have solved this problem or even addressed it seriously  when the incidents like the one that happened today in Nashville, TN,  continue in America.  [[Page S944]]    We need to pass more reforms to keep guns out of dangerous hands and  keep our children safe.                                    S. 316    Madam President, it is good to be back. I was gone last week,  fighting off my second round of COVID. It was not serious, thank  goodness. I had good medical care, and my wife had to show a great deal  of patience with my sticking around the house for too many days. But I  am glad to be back, and I want to say a word about the issue that is  pending on the floor of the Senate because it has meant a lot to me  throughout my congressional career.   It was just over 20 years ago, in this Chamber, that Congress voted  to authorize the use of military force against Iraq. I remember that  vote as clearly as if it were yesterday.   It was a little more than a year after the vicious terrorist attacks  of 9/11. Our Nation still felt deeply about what had happened to 3,000  innocent Americans.   All evidence pointed to Afghanistan-based al-Qaida as the culprit in  that horrific 9/11 attack. Yet, within days of 9/11, some in Washington  decided to beat a different drum, not against al-Qaida or Afghanistan  but against Iraq's dictator Saddam Hussein.   Then-Vice President Cheney warned repeatedly that Hussein was  actively pursuing ``weapons of mass destruction,'' including nuclear  weapons. The Vice President was adamant. He said there was ``no  doubt''--his words, ``no doubt''--that Hussein was amassing them to use  against the United States.   Former Pentagon adviser Richard Perle argued preposterously that  Iraqis could finance their nation's postwar rebuilding from its oil  wealth and said he had ``no doubt that they will.''   And then-President George W. Bush, who claimed war was his last  choice, provocatively tried to link al-Qaida with Saddam Hussein, a  dubious claim that was naturally echoed by then-Secretary of Defense  Donald Rumsfeld.   Rumsfeld even tried to claim the war in Iraq would last--listen to  this--``five days or five weeks or five months, but it certainly isn't  going to last any longer than that.'' So said the Secretary of Defense,  Donald Rumsfeld.   Then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz and Vice President  Cheney insisted that Iraqis would be welcoming the U.S. military as  ``liberators.''   When asked about reports that a war with Iraq would require hundreds  of thousands of troops, Wolfowitz casually dismissed the warning as  ``way off the mark.''   The American people were summarily deceived and misled by the  political leaders in Washington.   Then came the war. It didn't last weeks, as we were promised. It  lasted for most of the next decade.   More than 150,000 American troops have served in Iraq. No nuclear  weapons or other weapons of mass destruction were ever found. We were  never greeted as liberators. The Iraqi oil didn't pay for the damage of  the $2 trillion cost of the war. American taxpayers paid for it.   More than 4,500 U.S. servicemembers died in that conflict in Iraq.  Another 32,000 were wounded, many of them grievously.   My colleague in the Senate, Tammy Duckworth, is one of those who was  seriously injured. It is what brought her to my attention when I  invited her to listen to a State of the Union Address. Her heroism  brought her to my attention politically. I am honored that she is still  serving here in the Senate.   Countless Iraqi civilians lost their lives in the ensuing civil war  that erupted after Saddam Hussein was toppled.   I had voted, 1 year before the beginning of the Iraq war, to support  the use of military force in Afghanistan. It made sense. They generated  al-Qaida, al-Qaida generated 9/11, and it was time for us to answer.  That is where those who masterminded the 9/11 attacks were located.   But I was never convinced that our sons and daughters should be sent  to war in Iraq. That is why I was one of 23 Senators--1 Republican and  22 Democrats--who voted against the 2002 Iraq authorization for use of  military force, known as the AUMF.   History has shown that my concern and misgivings, along with my  colleagues--23 of us--were tragically correct. I doubt few here in  Washington, at the time, could have imagined this AUMF would still be  referred to and referenced for U.S. military action over 20 years  later.   Even more incredibly, the 1991 Gulf war AUMF that was supposed to  expel Iraq from Kuwait is still in effect more than 30 years later. To  allow such resolutions to remain in effect decades after the wars they  authorized is more than just a clerical oversight; it is a threat to  our national security. It is an open-ended invitation for conflict.  That is why today's action of repealing these two AUMFs is long  overdue.    I want to thank my colleagues, on a bipartisan basis, Senator Tim  Kaine of Virginia and Senator Todd Young of Indiana, for leading the  effort. I am honored to cosponsor it.   In the end, the debate before us isn't about whether Iraq posed a  threat to Kuwait in 1991 or to the United States in 2001. It is not  even about the ultimate merits of those conflicts. This long overdue  debate on the Senate floor this week is, instead, about Congress's  responsibility when it comes to war and about the use of open-ended  authorizations to send military forces. Our Constitution is clear on  this question and on many others too. Article I, section 8 says: The  power to declare war is an explicit power of the Congress.   The Founding Fathers got that right as far as I am concerned. We  should never send our sons and daughters or anyone's sons and daughters  into war without the consent of the American people through Congress.  Our Founding Fathers were wise in making sure this awesome power of  declaring war didn't rest in the hands of a Monarch or even in a  President by himself but with the people's elected Representatives. I  have made this same argument in the House and the Senate regardless of  who was President, a Democrat or a Republican--whether it was President  Bush in Iraq or President Obama in Syria or in Libya.   We should not leave these Iraq AUMFs or any authorizations like them  in force in perpetuity. Doing so allows too much room for unforeseen  consequences and too great of a chance that the authorizations will be  stretched beyond their original intent. It makes the possibility of  going to war just too easy. It creates a dangerous disconnect between  the people's elected representatives and one of the most solemn  decisions of democratic self-government. If some AUMFs, like the one  used to respond to the al-Qaida attack on the United States, which I  supported, need updating, we also need to meet that responsibility here  in Congress.   Let me be clear. Nothing we are doing here prevents an American  President from acting in self-defense or in the face of imminent  threats to our American Nation. Repealing these AUMFs doesn't preclude  Congress from debating and possibly passing another AUMF to address  future threats, but repealing these outdated authorizations for the use  of force will help make sure that such AUMFs are not used for other  possible wars without their having explicit congressional approval.  Repealing these AUMFs will close open-ended war authorizations that  should be revisited and debated by Congress as required by the  Constitution.   I strongly support the legislation before us to repeal these  authorizations and to ensure that future AUMFs are not allowed to  remain in place. I plan on reintroducing my legislation that sunsets  any AUMF after 10 years. If the continued use of military force is  justified beyond a decade, Congress should do it expressly by vote and  debate so that the American people can be witness to this decision and  part of it. We should no longer abdicate our responsibility by relying  on a resolution that has long since served its intended purpose.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Coons),  the Senator from California (Mrs. Feinstein), the Senator from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Fetterman), and the Senator from California (Mr.  Padilla) are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, since 1987, we have recognized March as  Women's History Month. It is an opportunity to honor the women who have  served our Nation throughout our history.   This March, I want to commend one woman who has devoted her life to  serving my home State of Illinois: Colleen Callahan. After nearly 4  years of service, Colleen recently stepped down from her role as the  first-ever female director for the Illinois Department of Natural  Resources. Throughout her tenure, Colleen was a dedicated steward of  our State's natural wonders, all while navigating a once-in-a-century  pandemic. While this was an historic challenge, it was far from the  first she has faced in her career. Time and again, Colleen has stood up  in the face of adversity and persevered.   Colleen has a record of breaking down barriers. As a young woman  living on a family farm near Milford, IL, she took a keen interest in  agriculture, which, back then, was something of a boy's club. But that  didn't stop her from pursuing her childhood passion. She participated  in livestock shows and even achieved the title of Youngest Exhibitor of  a Grand Champion at the International Livestock Exhibition in Chicago  at just 9 years old. Despite her talent and success, Colleen was unable  to join the Future Farmers of America, not because of merit, but  because women were not yet eligible for consideration. But she pressed  on.   After high school, Colleen attended the University of Illinois at  Urbana-Champaign, and pursued a degree in agricultural communications,  at a time when very few women were represented in broadcast journalism.  As a freshman in college, she became the first woman to join the  Illinois State 4-H Livestock Judging Team, a true full-circle moment.  By the time she graduated with honors in 1973, she had already accepted  her first job as an agribusiness reporter for WMBD-TV in Peoria. For  the next three decades, Colleen made her dream of becoming a broadcast  journalist a reality.   And her record of accomplishment was just beginning. After years as a  successful reporter, Colleen became the first-ever female agribusiness  director for WMBD-TV. Shortly after, she served as the first female  president of the National Association of Farm Broadcasting. Being the  ``first'' is never easy, but, as evidenced by her remarkable career,  Colleen has never been afraid to venture into new territory. And,  because of her determination, she has opened many doors that have  previously been closed to women in agriculture.   In addition to her passion for broadcasting and agriculture, Colleen  also has answered the call to public service. Really, she was born for  it. Colleen comes from a family of true public servants: Her uncle,  Gene Callahan, was a dear friend of mine, and a lifelong Democrat whom  I worked alongside under former U.S. Senator, and my mentor and friend,  Paul Simon. And Gene's daughter--Colleen's cousin--is former  Congresswoman Cheri Bustos, who represented Illinois' 17th  Congressional District from 2013 to January of this year--not to  mention her father, Francis Callahan, who was chair of the Iroquois  County Democrats, and her grandfather, Joe Callahan, who was vice  chairman of the Iroquois County Democrats and a member of the Illinois  State House of Representatives.   So it was no surprise when Colleen announced she was running for  Illinois' 18th Congressional District in 2008. While she may have come  up just short in that race, Colleen speaks fondly of the experience.  She once said, ``Not winning doesn't mean losing!''   But still, Colleen went on to win countless victories for the people  of Illinois. Shortly after her run for Congress, then-President Barack  Obama appointed her to serve as the U.S. Department of Agriculture's  Illinois State Director of Rural Development.   And in March 2019, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker appointed her as  director of the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, making her  the first woman in Illinois history to hold this position. The Illinois  Department of Natural Resources helps manage our more than 400 State  parks, historic sites, wildlife, and water resources. Colleen had about  a year to get her bearings as director until the COVID-19 pandemic hit.  And during this unprecedented and tumultuous time, she certainly rose  to the occasion. She preserved and expanded our State's invaluable  natural resources at the exact moment they were needed. During the  darkest days of the pandemic, Illinoisans sought comfort and quality  time outdoors. So our State parks, historical sites, and natural areas  became a sanctuary for many--and Colleen was there for our families  every step of the way.   In 2021, she spearheaded the effort to re-name an invasive species of  fish--previously known as Asian carp--to ``Copi,'' short for the word  ``copious,'' given how abundant the carp is in Illinois rivers and  streams.   And, after a consistent, decades-long decline in general revenue  funding for the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, Colleen  secured the department's largest State budget in more than 20 years,  which is now funding long overdue improvements at sites across our  State. Today, Colleen's hard work is paying off. With these new funds,  she has played a hand in reopening the Rend Lake Resort, located in  Wayne Fitzgerrell State Park in Franklin, IL. For a long time, the Rend  Lake Resort served as Franklin's economic powerhouse, but after years  of neglect and financial troubles, the resort had no option but to  prepare for permanent closure. Its future seemed bleak until Colleen  stepped in and saved the day. And later this year, the department will  break ground on a $17.5 million renovation that will revamp the  facility and breathe fresh life into Rend Lake Resort.   This investment, along with Colleen's efforts to reduce Illinois'  carbon footprint and mitigate the effects of climate change, has and  will make a difference in the lives of every Illinoisan. While Colleen  has closed this chapter of her distinguished career, she, thankfully,  has no plans to fully retire from public life. For her, there is still  much left to be done.   I want to thank Colleen for her dedication to public service and for  never  [[Page S952]]  being afraid to shatter a few glass ceilings along the way. She is a  trailblazer and a role model to many. Illinois is truly grateful for  her contributions to our great State. Loretta and I wish Colleen and  her husband Dick much happiness in their next chapter.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 978         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Affordable College Textbook       Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The high cost of college textbooks continues to be a       barrier for many students in achieving higher education.        (2) According to the College Board, during the 2022-2023       academic year, the average student budget for college books       and supplies at 4-year public institutions of higher       education was $1,240.        (3) The Government Accountability Office found that new       textbook prices increased 82 percent between 2002 and 2012       and that although Federal efforts to increase price       transparency have provided students and families with more       and better information, more must be done to address rising       costs.        (4) The growth of the internet has enabled the creation and       sharing of digital content, including open educational       resources that can be freely used by students, teachers, and       members of the public.        (5) According to the Student PIRGs, expanded use of open       educational resources has the potential to save students more       than a billion dollars annually.        (6) Federal investment in expanding the use of open       educational resources has lowered college textbook costs and       reduced financial barriers to higher education, while making       efficient use of taxpayer funds.        (7) Educational materials, including open educational       resources, must be accessible to the widest possible range of       individuals, including those with disabilities.       SEC. 3.

There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 978         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Affordable College Textbook       Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The high cost of college textbooks continues to be a       barrier for many students in achieving higher education.        (2) According to the College Board, during the 2022-2023       academic year, the average student budget for college books       and supplies at 4-year public institutions of higher       education was $1,240.        (3) The Government Accountability Office found that new       textbook prices increased 82 percent between 2002 and 2012       and that although Federal efforts to increase price       transparency have provided students and families with more       and better information, more must be done to address rising       costs.        (4) The growth of the internet has enabled the creation and       sharing of digital content, including open educational       resources that can be freely used by students, teachers, and       members of the public.        (5) According to the Student PIRGs, expanded use of open       educational resources has the potential to save students more       than a billion dollars annually.        (6) Federal investment in expanding the use of open       educational resources has lowered college textbook costs and       reduced financial barriers to higher education, while making       efficient use of taxpayer funds.        (7) Educational materials, including open educational       resources, must be accessible to the widest possible range of       individuals, including those with disabilities.       SEC. 3.
