 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of refugees who  are at the border seeking refuge and asylum due to economic conditions  and a climate crisis in Haiti, where they witnessed a horrible  earthquake and several devastating storms. They seek shelter, food, and  opportunities.   In recent days, Haitians have shown up at our door. They are looking  to get our help. America has a longstanding tradition to help refugees.  It is simply inhumane to turn our backs on them. They have witnessed  horrendous climate conditions, the assassination of a President, and  instability in their Nation for many decades.   We must continue to hold the torch. We must continue to provide  access to each and every one of those refugees who come to our door,  and we will be able to determine which are allowed to be granted  asylum.   Let's uphold our legacy of America, a nation of immigrants.                            ____________________
