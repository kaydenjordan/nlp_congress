 Mr. Speaker, I am excited to have this opportunity to  recognize and congratulate three exceptional students in my district  who placed in the top five for their project categories at the 2018  Intel International Science and Engineering Fair. This competition is  the largest precollegiate science fair in the world and is comprised of  students from more than 75 countries who come together to compete and  share their research with others in their STEM community.   Himanshi Verma, from Eastside High School, received the fourth place  award in the biomedical and health sciences category; Gianfranco  Cortes-Arroyo, from West Port High School, received the third place  award in the mathematics category; and Evan Collins, one of my former  district interns and a student at Ridgeview High, received the third  place award in earth and environmental sciences category.   STEM education is vital to the advancement of American society, and I  am proud to represent students who will lead their generation in  innovation and expertise.   Congratulations again to Himanshi, Gianfranco, and Evan, and I wish  you all the best in your future endeavors.                            ____________________
