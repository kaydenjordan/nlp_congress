 Mr. President, I am happy to be joined today on the floor  by Senator Heinrich, who has been a real fighter for healthcare for New  Mexicans, and I am looking forward to staying on the floor and hearing  him talk about how he feels about this Republican healthcare bill as  well.   I rise today for the third time this session to oppose plans by  President Trump and the Republicans to gut our healthcare system and to  throw millions of Americans off their health insurance.   On May 4 of this year, the day that House Republicans narrowly passed  their TrumpCare bill, the President held a celebration at the White  House in the Rose Garden and pronounced the bill a great plan.   Well, TrumpCare may be a great plan if you are wealthy and healthy,  because if you are wealthy you get big tax cuts and if you are healthy,  your premiums may not go up, and may even go down--that is, until you  are sick.   TrumpCare is not a great plan if you are over the age of 62, if you  are a hard-working family trying to make ends meet, if you live in a  rural area, if you have or have not had an illness like cancer or heart  disease or diabetes, or if you are a woman. Twenty-three million  Americans will be left high and dry--out of health insurance by 2026.  They don't think TrumpCare is a great plan. To them, it is a mean plan.  Actually, those were President Trump's own words several weeks after  the Rose Garden celebration. President Trump came clean with the Senate  Republicans, admonishing them that the bill is ``mean'' and needs to be  more ``generous, kind, and with heart.'' For the first time since his  inauguration, I agree with the President on healthcare.   Since day one of the 115th Congress, Republicans have had the  Affordable Care Act in their sights, and so has the President. They  have tried mightily to do away with the rights and benefits under the  ACA. But there is good news. The American people have rallied. They  have called, they have emailed, and they have gone to town halls. They  have marched, they have made their views known, and they have shared  their stories. So far, they have stopped Republicans from gutting our  healthcare system.   Just this past Saturday in my home State, simultaneous rallies in  opposition to TrumpCare took place in 20 counties. I say to them: Keep  up the fight, and I will continue to fight as hard as I can. We need to  do all we can to stop this attack on healthcare.   The consequences of upending our healthcare system are enormous. They  are enormous for the 20 million Americans who now have healthcare  because of the ACA through private insurance and through Medicaid  expansion. TrumpCare hurts the most vulnerable--the elderly, the  disabled, and those with fewer resources.   The consequences of gutting the ACA and restructuring Medicaid are  enormous for our economy, one-sixth of which is related to healthcare.  They are enormous for hospitals that rely on third-party reimbursements  under the ACA and Medicaid expansion. These hospitals need those  revenues, and even more so for rural hospitals that keep their doors  open thanks to the ACA, as well as the Indian Healthcare Service  facilities, which have reduced wait times and added services because of  the ACA.   But the majority in Congress refuses to hold hearings, and they are  blocking all public participation. This is unconscionable, and it is  undemocratic.  [[Page S3628]]    Before Democrats voted on ObamaCare, the Senate held 100 committee  hearings, roundtables, and walk-throughs. The final Senate bill  included 147 Republican amendments. The majority leader has missed an  opportunity for political and moral leadership on one of the most  important issues we face. Senator McConnell should have an honest and  open process, including Senate committee hearings, with full public  participation and a chance for patients to tell Congress how this  proposal impacts them--not hidden meanings, not limited debate and a  simple majority vote.   Americans deserve an open process from their elected leaders. That is  why I introduced a bill last week with my Democratic colleagues called  the No Hearing, No Vote Act. This bill would require a public committee  hearing for any legislation that goes through the fast-track budget  reconciliation process, including the TrumpCare legislation.   Members of Congress were elected to improve lives, not destroy them,  and I believe we need bipartisan cooperation to ensure we don't do  that.   If we wanted to improve on ObamaCare, we could: No 1, make sure that  all Americans have healthcare; and No. 2, make healthcare more  affordable.   So I will tell my colleagues what is really happening here. The  American people don't want the benefits they have gained through  ObamaCare to be repealed and replaced with an inferior plan. They do  not support TrumpCare. Only 17 percent of Americans support the House  Republicans' current bill. With this degree of public opposition, it is  baffling that Republicans keep pushing the bill that kicks 23 million  Americans off their healthcare.   But the moral underpinnings of TrumpCare are as bankrupt as Trump's  New Jersey casinos. The winners of TrumpCare are the wealthy, and the  Republicans are plainly serving those interests. The Republicans can  keep trying to hide TrumpCare, but Americans understand that it is just  plain wrong.   I want to talk about a few of the ways that it is just plain wrong.  While women make up half of our population, no women serve on Senator  McConnell's healthcare working group. Yet women are uniquely affected  by TrumpCare. For example, the range of cost-free preventive services  under the Affordable Care Act includes screenings for breast cancer,  including mammograms, bone density screenings, cervical cancer  screenings, domestic violence screenings and counseling, breast feeding  counseling and equipment, contraception, and folic acid supplements.  All of these services were critical to maintaining women's health and  the health of their babies as well.   New Mexico leads the Nation in the percentage of births that are  covered by Medicaid at 72 percent of all births in the State. So these  services that are now available to every woman are essential.   TrumpCare would repeal the cost-free preventive care requirements for  the Medicaid expansion population. Not only would this repeal risk the  health of women and their babies, but it would result in increased  medical care costs overall. Preventive medical services save money in  the long run.   The Affordable Care Act requires insurance plans to provide a range  of essential health benefits. For women, these required services  include maternity and newborn child care. But TrumpCare would allow  States to apply for a waiver to define their own essential health  benefits beginning in 2020. So States could choose to exclude maternity  and newborn care, and women would end up paying more for this care. The  result is women not getting the care they need.   TrumpCare would cut Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood for 1  year. Planned Parenthood provides preventive medical and reproductive  health services to women and men, and Planned Parenthood funding  provides a safety net to low-income women. According to the CBO,  cutting off Medicaid payments to Planned Parenthood for 1 year would  mean a total loss of access to services in some low-income communities  because Planned Parenthood is the only public provider in some regions.   Take Elena from Albuquerque, NM. When she was 30 years old and in law  school, Elena found out that she had the BRCA gene mutation, which puts  her at a much higher risk for breast and ovarian cancer. The treatments  for the BRCA gene mutation include a mastectomy and ovary removal-- treatments she couldn't afford.   Thankfully, Elena qualified for Medicaid under the expansion. She got  her breast cancer screenings and decided to have a mastectomy because  of the cancer scare. Elena had three surgeries, costing thousands of  dollars, covered by Medicaid, and now the chances of her getting breast  cancer are very low. But Elena now worries that if she decides to have  her ovaries removed and TrumpCare becomes law, she will not be able to  have this potentially lifesaving surgery. If she has had a lapse in  Medicaid coverage, her Medicaid expansion coverage will be gone, and  because TrumpCare would end the ban against insurance companies denying  coverage for people with preexisting conditions, she may never be able  to get insurance or surgery.   Public schools and schoolchildren will be hurt by TrumpCare. Schools  are now eligible to receive Medicaid funds for necessary medical  services for children with disabilities. Schools are reimbursed for  vision, hearing, and mental health screenings. These services help  children get services early so they can be ready to learn.   Right now, New Mexico schools are reimbursed $18 million from  Medicaid, but under TrumpCare, States would not have to consider  schools' Medicaid-eligible providers, and the costs would be on the  public schools. The problem is, New Mexico public schools cannot take  on these kinds of costs. That might mean hundreds of schoolchildren  each year will go without vision, hearing, and mental health treatment  because no one else will be able to provide them.    Dr. Lynn McIlroy, superintendent of the Loving Municipal Schools, a  rural school district in Southeastern New Mexico, said:         Medicaid funding is vital to our continuum of care and       service to the majority of our students. Often, our school       nurse is the only medical professional our students ever see.    New Mexico has one of the highest percent Native American populations  in the country, more than 10 percent of our residents. Even though many  Native Americans receive healthcare through the Indian Health Service,  IHS has not always been able to provide needed care due to a lack of  funding. Medicaid expansion has changed that and changed that  dramatically.   Dr. Valory Wangler, who works with the Zuni Pueblo, says: Since the  Affordable Care Act, patients of Zuni have access to special services  that were once difficult to fund and often delayed or denied.   An IHS physician working on the Zuni Reservation had a patient with  severe arthritis that was making it difficult for her to stay  physically active and work at a local school. She needed knee  replacement surgery. Before Medicaid expansion, IHS had trouble funding  knee replacements, and the surgery was denied for years because IHS  could only afford to pay for life and loss of limb services. This  patient is now on the Medicaid expansion. She was able to get a total  knee replacement, is working full time, staying fit, and is no longer  in pain.   One of the ACA's most popular provisions is the protection from  discrimination if you have a preexisting condition. This is one of the  most mystifying parts of TrumpCare. Republicans would end that  protection by allowing States to waive out and set up high-risk pools.   All of us know someone with a serious illness or condition, like Kitt  here. Kitt is 4\1/2\ years old and has type I diabetes that will  require lifelong care. Her mother Dana is worried about TrumpCare. Dana  says: It breaks my heart that elected officials are leaning toward  dropping the Federal mandate to guarantee affordable health insurance  for those with preexisting conditions. Sit down with a child who has an  unbearable disease and be their warrior in DC to make everything  possible for that special soul and their family to have an easier  tomorrow.   I hope we will all be those warriors to protect that healthcare  program which has been put in place for them.   I yield to Senator Heinrich.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
