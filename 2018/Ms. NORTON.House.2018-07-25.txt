 Mr. Speaker, I ask the House to celebrate the District of  Columbia, one of only eight big cities with a AAA bond rating. Indeed,  only 22 of the States have a AAA bond rating.   This outsized performance should encourage Congress to recognize the  D.C. budget autonomy law, which would improve D.C.'s credit profile  even more.   Fully respecting D.C.'s budget autonomy also would mean lower taxes  and less Federal funds the District needs from the Federal Government.  I have already gotten the rating agencies to count as a positive to  D.C.'s credit rating my annual provision in the D.C. appropriation  exempting D.C. from the threat of shutdowns when the Federal Government  shuts down.   Seven-hundred thousand D.C. residents pay the highest Federal taxes  per capita in the United States. The rating agencies have awarded D.C.  for ``exemplary fiscal governance.''   Mr. Speaker, I ask the House to do the same by recognizing D.C.'s  budget autonomy over its own 100 percent local budget.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  any extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today to speak to two  issues. One, is the dagger thrown at the heart of the right of Federal  employees to organize. The second will be ICE raids that randomly  rounded up residents of the District of Columbia without a warrant and  without any cause.   Let me proceed first to the gang-up on Federal employees by the  executive and Republicans in the House to undermine the rights of  Federal unions to represent Federal employees.   We have seen Republicans for years try to weaken the rights of  Federal employees. Certainly, we have seen them go at unions before.  But this time, they have gone even further. The intention to destroy  the right of a union to represent Federal employees is the clear intent  of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle.   I shall explain why that intent is so obvious this evening. The  American Federation of Government Employees had a rally today.  Attending also were many other employee unions, but the AFGE led the  rally because of the acute danger that the current work of the  Republican House and the President present to the right to organize and  to be represented.   Federal employees are represented in virtually every category of work  by the AFGE. If we look at what the President and the House Republicans  are doing, it is clear that they have declared war on their own Federal  employees. They have done it by striking at the heart of the right to  be represented by a Federal union.   I will explain how they have moved against that right, but, first,  let me explain where that right comes from and why there is any such  right at all.   You certainly don't have that kind of right in the business sector.  You can't  [[Page H7680]]  go to the business sector and say: Hey, look, I have a right to have a  union here.   You have to fight for it, and I might add, so do Federal unions have  to fight for it. They have to get their cards and the Federal employee  votes. But there is an important trade-off here. The Civil Service  Reform Act of 1978, recognizing that the Government did not want to  allow Federal workers the right to strike--which is a constitutional  right--designed a system which is indeed a trade-off. You will give up  the right to strike, and, in return, you, Federal employees, will have  the right to be represented by a union if you win a union election and  the Federal Government will not oppose your right to organize.   That is very important because employers in the private sector, of  course, do oppose. I don't mean to say that Federal agencies don't try  their best to see that an agency doesn't get representation, but they  cannot simply keep that from occurring. That is the trade-off from the  Civil Service Reform Act.   One of the most important aspects of the right to represent Federal  employees is to use official time-on-the-job to represent employees to  settle matters with a Federal agency. That is the whole reason that  this right was given in the first place. Even apart from a right to  strike, if you have an employee who has a grievance, there has got to  be some way to make sure that grievance is attended to.   Official time use, by another Federal employee operating as a  volunteer, allows such matters to be settled in a peaceful way without  a strike. What the official time means is, an employee says: With no  pay, I agree to help other employees through the system to have their  matter brought to the agency and somehow dealt with. They either win or  they lose or they settle. Employees often don't understand the system.  They don't use the system every day, so a volunteer works to help them  use the official time.   Now, official time only means that that volunteer employee is given  time from his or her work to represent this person. Does that mean the  person doesn't have any work? It does not. It is a real sacrifice, Mr.  Speaker. That person isn't given a lesser workload, that person has to  find a way to get that done and to represent employees as well, or to  trade off with another employee who will also represent employees.   Remember, this is to keep labor peace and to keep the Federal  Government working so that there is a civilized way to settle a matter  between the Federal employer and an employee.   But the AFGE has had to turn to the courts in order to get this right  enforced.   Why in the world would that be necessary given the Civil Service  Reform Act of 1978?   It is going to be necessary because what is being proposed in this  House is in violation of that act.   I shall explain. Republicans today are so intent on destroying  unions--understand, unions are not nearly as powerful as they once were  decades ago--but Republicans are so intent on destroying unions that in  the case of Federal employees, they are using the two branches of  Government at once--remember, they control three--the two political  branches of Government to destroy the representation of a union.   They control the executive, they control the House, they control the  Senate. So they pull all stops, using all of their energy and all of  their power against their own Federal workers.   I think of it as a two-fisted approach. One fist is pending on this  House floor, as I speak. Indeed, it is due to come to the House floor  in September. It is a bill I fought in committee along with many other  members.   You can't just abolish official time to represent employees, because  the Civil Service Reform Act gives them that right.   This is why I think that what the House does in this bill cannot  stand, because what it does is to so reduce the amount of time, so- called official time, that you can help many employees get through the  system. You are like a lawyer. The employee is fresh to the system, so  he or she needs somebody to tell the employee how to get through the  system.   But if there is so little time, while you are helping one employee  who may be using up all the time that the House Republican bill would  give, which is one-quarter of the time that is now being allowed.   Where did they get that figure from? Nowhere.                                time  1945    It is just a matter of not being able to wipe it all out, so let's  wipe out almost all of it. It gives so little time to represent all  those who need to go through the system with the help of a volunteer  employee that I do not believe, for a moment, that this matter will  stand. That is why I think the AFGE was right to go to court now. I  will tell you in a moment why it has gone to court, even though this  bill has not passed the House, as I speak.   Not only is so little time given that you couldn't possibly handle  all of those who have issues or grievances--it is only a quarter of the  time an employee has, that has been previously spent helping other  employees to get through the process. There also is an enforcement  mechanism in the House bill that is truly vicious.   If you go into overtime in helping another employee, you will do so  at your own risk, because you will lose your pension credits if you  devote more than the amount of time prescribed in this bill. That loss  of pension credits is also without due process and arbitrary. That also  is why I believe this bill can't stand. But my Republican friends are  so anxious to cripple Federal employee unions that they also have asked  for the other fist, a Trump executive order.   If you look at this executive order, which is essentially the same  thing as the pending bill, you can't help but ask: Why two fists on  these Federal workers? Why get the President and the Republican House  to promise to do the same thing? How many branches, how many arms of  government do you need to try to stamp out the rights of Federal  employees?   I believe I know why the House has turned to President Trump. The  House bill is so extreme, so clearly illegal, in my judgment, that it  will be difficult to get it through the Senate. So, the President, who  obviously has control over the workforce, is being asked to do the same  thing by executive order.   I don't believe he can do it. I don't believe he can just wipe out  official time, if not all of it, so much of it, so that employees  cannot be served. But the President may have preempted the House bill,  that may come on the floor in September, by his executive order against  official time.   If you play chess though, watch out, because he has hopped right into  it. Now that he has signed an executive order, now that he has come  forward with an executive order, he has allowed the AFGE to make a  brilliant move.   Before the ink was dry on the executive order, the AFGE had gone to  court, in a brilliant chess move. And I have no doubt that they will  win in court because the flaws of the bill are so clear. I think courts  will agree with AFGE. Had the Republicans tried to kill official time  and the Senate or to get the same thing through an executive order, you  have the same problem, even perhaps worse.   The executive order is a clear violation of the Civil Service Reform  Act.   Understand why the act has worked for so many decades. It is because  of labor peace, to use a word that is often used to describe why unions  have been important in the Federal sector. You need labor peace. You  don't need strikes or disruption by Federal employees.   But you have got to have a tradeoff. That tradeoff is adequate  representation through a formal process. If that formal process is cut  to smithereens and you leave a figment of it in place, don't think that  the Federal courts will be fooled by that. This process has worked, but  it won't if you make it impossible to do the job that the Civil Service  Reform Act prescribes, and that is to represent Federal employees.   Now, the unions aren't fools. They recognize they can't depend on the  House or the President. They also recognize there is an election coming  up and they know that, at least as of the moment, the people are there  to correct for issues either ignored in this House or by threats like  the pending bill and the executive order on official time that  threatens their rights.  [[Page H7681]]    The all-powerful Federal Government has absolutely nothing to lose by  allowing its employees, who have so little authority, fair access to a  process that does no more than allow them to be heard before all- powerful Federal agencies.   What could the largest employer in the world be afraid of?   It looks as if it is afraid of its own employees, ordinary citizens  represented also by Members of the House and the Senate, who ask for no  more than a process and, if I may say so, a fair process to be heard, a  process that does not show anything like guaranteed winning, but it is  at least a process.   Well, perhaps these employees are to be feared after all because  today they showed up in great numbers. Remember, they showed up on the  streets of Washington, D.C., but there are millions of them throughout  the United States. They showed up in a fighting mood, fighting back.   I am pleased to come to the floor to represent the thousands of  employees who showed up. I am simply one among hundreds of Members of  the House who will always show up for workers when their rights are  being threatened.   As it turns out, the American Federation of Government Employees  represents both D.C. employees of the D.C. government and Federal  employees of the Federal Government and I am proud to represent them  all.   All that my Republican friends have done is raise their fighting  spirit, which has already shown that our chances of taking back the  House of Representatives have grown every single day.   The second issue I want to say a word about has to do with  indiscriminate raids of the kind we have never had in the United States  of America before. These are raids on residents. I have seen their  effect here, so I will talk about these residents living in the  District of Columbia.   When you hear of such raids and indiscriminate arrests, perhaps you  will understand why cities like the District of Columbia have declared  themselves to be sanctuary cities that protect, particularly, their  immigrant residents from arbitrary action, recognizing that they will  not be able and do not wish to protect them when, in fact, there is a  right to take them back to where they came from. But that is not what I  am talking about this evening.    In the District of Columbia, at least a dozen individuals were  arrested last week when it is clear that they would not have been  arrested had there been a warrant or had anything but racial  profiling--racial and ethnic profiling, I might add--been used, a  brazen act.   As it turns out, some of the people arrested were, for example, MS- 13. So far as the numbers show, that is 37. Those are people for whom  they had a warrant. Those are people for whom there is probable cause  that they committed a crime. But that is 37 out of 132. They never  could have gotten the rest of these residents without indiscriminate  racial profiling.   What did they do?   First of all, they went to predominantly Latino D.C. neighborhoods,  and they went there for a reason. They snatched what appeared to be  anyone on the streets who looked like the people they wanted, based on  race or appearance.   When you have, in the United States, police picking up people based  on their appearance, you understand what a police state looks like. The  reaction will be, I am sure, intimidation from going into the streets  of your own city.   Now, ICE boasts that it went looking and found people who present a  significant security threat, but they were only able to show 37 such  people. When you round up citizens without a warrant and without  probable cause based on what they look like, that is what you get:  indiscriminate arrests, arrests based on appearance, arrests where you  cannot possibly show a significant public safety threat.   I am not here to say that MS-13 or others who pose such a threat  should not be arrested. I am here to say that breaking up families is  an outrageous way to enforce a law and does not, in fact, do so.   The Washington field office was responsible for this roundup, and  they have indicated the people whom they arrested.   I am not here on this floor this evening to defend--here I am reading  from people they say they arrested--the El Salvadoran national  identified as a high-ranking MS-13 member.   I am not here on this floor to defend a Bolivian national who has  four prior convictions for rape and intercourse with a victim under 13.  They are not what I am here talking about.                                time  2000    I am here talking about people who were in the streets minding their  own business, with no criminal arrests, with no criminal background,  with families at home waiting for them.   Yes, we have got to deport people from this country, even if they  come in ways that we could otherwise understand. Deportation has to  occur. It occurred in the last administration. Some were deported right  at the border. I am not here making the case to open the borders wide  open and let everybody in.   But the courts have already turned around the procedures now being  employed, because every day you read in the papers and see on  television how many families have been disunited, children and parents  broken up, parents deported without their children. The authorities are  still looking to unite hundreds of children with their parents. That  just isn't what we do in the United States of America.   Since one of these roundups occurred here in the Nation's Capital,  and the shame is that it would occur in the Capital of the United  States, I thought it was my responsibility to come to this floor to  call it out and to indicate that these raids are one of the reasons why  the District of Columbia will always be a sanctuary city--not a city  for MS-13, not a city for those who should be deported, but a city for  those who have a right to go through a lawful process.   We will not stand for residents to be rounded up in the streets. That  means that each and every one of us could be rounded up in the streets  based on what we look like. We will not have it. We will resist it.   There is a way to deport people. There is a way to make sure that you  come into this country legally and to make sure that you are deported  if you do not.   The wrong way to do it, the way that we cannot tolerate, is to go to  police state tactics, unknown before in our country, and particularly  police state tactics in the Capital of the United States, Washington,  D.C.   So, Mr. Speaker, as the House prepares to go home later in the week,  these are two issues I felt I had to put before this body. I would hope  that we all would think of better ways to accomplish our ends.   If our problem is with Federal employees, let's deal with that  problem and not try to nullify a statute that took into account our  differences, the Civil Service Reform Act.   As for Hispanics and other immigrants being snatched off the streets,  I would hope that I do not stand alone in saying tonight that that is  not the American way. There are hundreds of jurisdictions that are with  us as sanctuary cities to stand and say that that is not the American  way. I am pleased that the courts of the United States have protected  sanctuary cities just as these cities have protected residents from  arbitrary treatment in the United States of America.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
