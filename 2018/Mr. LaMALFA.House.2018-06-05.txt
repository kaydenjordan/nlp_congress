 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on behalf of a bill I  have introduced, H.R. 2946, which would repeal the burdensome 12  percent Federal excise tax on heavy trucks, known as the FET.   It was first created to help fund World War I--that is right, World  War I, 100 years ago. The antiquated FET is the highest excise tax  levied by the Federal Government today. The financial and regulatory  burdens created by the FET hurts truck retailers, drivers, and  businesses across the country. It depresses the market for newer heavy- duty trucks, which are cleaner, more efficient, and everybody in  government seems to be clamoring for them to be replaced for those  reasons.   A repeal of this outdated legislation would seek to promote the use  of more modern trucks on our roads--again, something government seems  to want and demand. By incorporating this repeal effort into any future  infrastructure funding measure, Congress can rebuild our Nation's  crumbling road system while ensuring our commercial truck fleet is both  cleaner and safer.   I urge my colleagues to support inclusion of this bipartisan bill and  repeal the FET, which only hampers economic growth and discontinues  truck replacement, which is what everybody seems to want.                            ____________________
