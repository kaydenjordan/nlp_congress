 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the passing and the  important contributions of a great Floridian for his unrelenting  determination to protect the Florida Everglades. Nathaniel Pryor Reed  was a man whom I was proud to know, and he was one of Florida's most  influential environmental leaders.   He served six Florida Governors and two United States Presidents,  advising them on environmental protection and conservation. He worked  instrumentally in the legislation of the Endangered Species Act and the  Clean Water Act. He was an avid fisherman and a conservationist. He  served on more nonprofit boards than I can count, and he was a founding  member of the Everglades Foundation, serving on the board of directors  since its inception 25 years ago.   He championed the bipartisan saying: ``The Everglades doesn't care  what party you belong to, she cares what you do.''   Nathaniel ended every phone call by sending his sincerest best  wishes, and he always truly meant it. Today we send him our sincerest  and remember his unwavering commitment to America's Everglades and his  service to our Nation.                            ____________________
