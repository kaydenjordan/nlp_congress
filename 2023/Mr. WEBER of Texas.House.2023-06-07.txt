Proclamation to Honor Steve Mataro, Servant Builders, and DSW Homes     Mr. Speaker, I also rise to honor Steve Mataro:   Whereas, just over 35 years ago, Mr. Mataro founded Servant Builders  as a recovery mission geared toward helping young men with addiction  learn a trade in construction while rebuilding relationships with  families and communities; and   Whereas, Servant Builders provided job training and placement  assistance for over 200 men, enabling a better future for their entire  families; and   Whereas, Mr. Mataro utilized the same principles learned through  Servant Builders in launching DSW Homes in southeast Texas in 2009 to  assist rebuilding homes following Hurricane Rita, often providing job  training and assistance to the very men whose homes were being rebuilt;  and   Whereas, lessons learned via Servant Builders are displayed in often  accommodating low-income and elderly homeowners, driving clients to  construction appointments, and even temporarily paying their rents; and   Whereas, now operating in four states and the U.S. Virgin Islands,  DSW Homes currently completes an average of 1,000 homes annually in  disaster-hit regions with a record of 15 days from demolition to  completion for a total of 12,000 homes; and   Whereas, since Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Rockport, Texas, on  August 25, 2017, DSW Homes has rebuilt homes for over 3,000 families  throughout five recovery zones.
