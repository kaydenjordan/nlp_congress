 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 118th Congress  for restoring the oversight function of the House.   Since winning the majority, House Republicans have held 565 oversight  hearings, compelled Biden officials to testify 561 times, sent 862  letters to the administration, and issued 45 subpoenas, and we are just  getting started.   Our Founders never intended for a President to be able to bypass  Congress  [[Page H3580]]  through executive action, like forgiving more than $400 billion in loan  debt with the stroke of a pen.   They never intended for a Federal agency to be able to circumvent the  people's Representatives and use their regulatory authority to advance  so-called progressive ideas. The judicial branch is doing its part to  curb the rogue--often unconstitutional--actions of this President, but  the American people can count on this half of the legislative branch to  conduct its critical oversight function, just as our Founders intended.                            ____________________
