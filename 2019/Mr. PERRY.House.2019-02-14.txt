 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Texas for the  opportunity.  [[Page H2021]]    Mr. Speaker, this is bad policy following bad process--an 1100-plus- page bill dropped at midnight last night, and we are acting like we  can't walk and chew gum at the same time. We are acting like we can't  keep our Federal Government open and fix our border situation.   Let's talk about what is happening because that is the problem. At  least, if nothing else, we should do no harm. Let's not make the  situation worse.   Mr. Speaker, this bill provides amnesty for anyone in a household of  an unaccompanied minor, and it protects the people who have smuggled  those children into the United States and encourages them to do that  even more.   And even more than that, once they are here, we cut $700 million out  of ICE, and we reduced their bed space. So there are less people  looking for those people who are here illegally.   Then when we find the criminals, when they have committed some crime  and we find them, we can't even keep them. We have to release them back  into our communities. Mr. Speaker, city councils are now deciding where  we secure our border.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the time and urge a ``no'' vote.
