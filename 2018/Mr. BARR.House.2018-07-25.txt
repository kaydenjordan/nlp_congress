 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a special  man, Mr. John A. Palumbo, from Lexington, Kentucky, who passed away  earlier this month at the age of 97.   Mr. Palumbo was born in 1921 in Schenectady, New York. As a youth, he  was a boxer, winning a Golden Glove, and then moved to Lexington to  attend the University of Kentucky.   During his time as a student, World War II was raging, and Mr.  Palumbo volunteered for the United States Army Infantry 1st Division.   Following basic training, he was sent to England to train for the D- day invasion. He landed on Omaha Beach at H-hour plus 58 minutes,  actually swimming ashore when his landing boat received a direct hit  and sank.   He fought across Europe and received many citations for his brave  service, including the World War II Victory Medal and the Bronze Star.   After the war, Mr. Palumbo returned to Lexington, finished his  education, married Nancyetta, and earned a law degree from the  University of Kentucky. He worked for years in the lumber business and,  as a Lexington developer, contributed greatly to the city of Lexington.  He was well respected in the business community and was active in  several civic organizations.    Mr. Palumbo and his fellow veterans are true heroes. As members of  the Greatest Generation, they willingly served to protect the freedoms  we enjoy today.   I am humbled to honor the life of an American hero, Mr. John A.  Palumbo, before the United States Congress, and I extend my deepest  condolences to his family during this time.                            ____________________
