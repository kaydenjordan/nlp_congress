 Mr. Speaker, when I helped clients win asylum  cases as a young law student, I heard the tragic stories of how they  fled their countries, carrying with them fear and pain but little else.   It is already very hard to win asylum. You must first show that you  have a credible fear of being persecuted in your home country. Asylum  seekers must later prove their claims in an administrative or court  process.   There are many things wrong with our immigration system, but showing  credible fear is the right first step. Now, we are seeing major  permanent proposed changes to our asylum law as a condition for  emergency funding for Ukraine, Israel, and the Indo-Pacific.   I stand in strong support of this emergency aid. It is essential, but  just as it was wrong to tie Israeli aid to gutting the IRS' ability to  go after tax cheats, it is wrong to tie harmful, significant, and  permanent changes to asylum law to passing essential aid for our  allies.   Instead, we need comprehensive immigration reform. We need to protect  our Dreamers, and we need to support our allies. Our Latino  communities, our asylum seekers, and our allies abroad deserve better.                            ____________________
