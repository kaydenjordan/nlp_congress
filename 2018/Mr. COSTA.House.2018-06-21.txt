 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this Republican partisan bill.   Just a few days ago, I traveled to San Diego with several of our  colleagues to see firsthand how current immigration policy is being  enforced.   There were children separated from their parents and migrants seeking  asylum.   Our immigration system is broken, and everybody knows that. And this  administration is making a challenging situation worse.   Our immigration system needs to be dealt with. Why don't we try  sitting down and working together on real bipartisan reform?   This is a partisan proposal that holds Dreamers and vulnerable  children hostage and does nothing for California farmworkers.   What is worse, it builds a $25 billion wall that, by itself, does not  provide comprehensive solutions for our border security, which we all  believe in.   By the way, didn't the President promise that Mexico would pay for  this wall?   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to do the right thing. Vote ``no.''  Let's get back to working on bipartisan reform, reform that provides us  with the border security we need and fixes our immigration system and  respects the dignity and the humanity of aspiring Americans.
