 Mr. Speaker, as a pediatrician, I understand that  sometimes competing concerns about making sure that children who are  food insecure get enough good-quality food to eat at school, and at the  same time making sure those meals do not contribute to our epidemic of  childhood obesity and its accompanying diseases.   It was trying to balance those priorities that led to 2012 guidelines  that prohibited schools from offering 2 percent and whole milk.   Interestingly, data compiled and analyzed from multiple studies since  then does not show a correlation between whole milk and increased  obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, or heart disease when compared  with other milks. In fact, some studies show the opposite.   In addition, milk is packed with nutrients like calcium and vitamin  D. As a consequence of the drop in milk consumption since these  restrictions, many children lack sufficient vitamin D and calcium  intake.   Vitamin D deficiency is known to adversely affect bone growth and  bone density. It may also play a role in increasing the risk for  autoimmune diseases. Many of my patients had very low vitamin D levels.   While some children will choose water instead of the lowest fat  milks, many others will choose juice or other sugary drinks which carry  zero nutritional value and pose known health risks.   I am proud to have introduced the Whole Milk For Healthy Kids Act,  and I encourage my colleagues to vote with me in passing this bill.                            ____________________
