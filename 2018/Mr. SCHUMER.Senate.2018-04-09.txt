 Mr. President, first, let me welcome back my fellow  Senators after a productive State work period. Let me welcome our  newest Senator, Cindy Hyde-Smith, the junior Senator from Mississippi.  She is the first woman to represent the State of Mississippi, and I  welcome her warmly to this Chamber.                            ____________________     Mr. President, over the past weeks, as we have been  away, we have heard of the passing of two of our Senators: Zell Miller  and Danny Akaka.   I would like to say a few words about Danny Akaka, who was a good  friend of mine. In everything he did, he was a soldier, a teacher, and  a statesman. He embodied the spirit of Hawaii. He was so sincere in his  beliefs and such a kind and gentle man that Senators went out of their  way to help him and, of course, he fought so hard for his State. He  taught us so much in his modesty, in his persistence, and in his love  of his constituents.   So for all he taught us, for his service and for his friendship, we  say ``mahalo'' one final time.                            ____________________     Mr. President, it was Tammy Duckworth who first informed  me of Senator Akaka's passing, and it shows God's rhythms of life, the  passing of Danny Akaka, after a long service and wonderful life, and  now we have  [[Page S1995]]  just learned of the birth of Tammy Duckworth's child. It is a  milestone. Tammy Duckworth, a few hours ago, became the first Senator  to give birth while in office. We are very glad to hear that she and  her newborn daughter are happy and healthy.                            ____________________     Mr. President, like all of my colleagues, I spent the  past few weeks crisscrossing my State meeting with constituents. I am  always struck by their commonsense values. Folks want to be able to  afford quality healthcare. That is probably their greatest worry. They  know healthcare is so vital to them and for families. They know costs  keep going up. They are worried about premiums, especially after the  Republican Congress has done so much to sabotage our healthcare system;  talking about tearing down the healthcare system but never building it  up in any way.   Folks also want a good job with decent benefits and higher wages, but  they are not seeing much of that in the wake of the Republican tax  bill. In fact, many of them are disappointed that they are not  receiving more. They are seeing corporations buy back a lot of their  stock, which boosts compensation for executives and shareholders, but  they don't see that much of a bump in their paychecks. The bottom line  is, they are asking: Why are the wealthy getting so much more money in  the tax break than we are? I have heard that from one end of my State  to the other.   Another problem: folks want to be able to send their kids to school  and know they will be safe. I talked to one mom whose daughter just  doesn't want to go to school after what happened in Parkland. She is  afraid. She is 7 years old.   A few weeks ago, I marched with hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers  in the March For Our Lives. Their energy and optimism and dedication  give me hope that finally the time has come for Congress to take  meaningful action on gun safety.   Another example where our Republican colleagues who run this Senate  haven't done enough--not close to enough--is on the issue of gun  safety. On these issues and more, the Republican majority has done very  little. What they have done has been on behalf of entrenched special  interests: tax cuts for corporations and the superwealthy, gutting  healthcare to pay for more tax cuts, and holding back on commonsense  gun safety laws like universal gun safety checks because the NRA  opposes it.   The American people are fed up with large, special, and powerful  interests getting their way, while average folks get left behind. That  is what I heard while traveling my State.   In November, the American people will have a chance to move this  country in a dramatically different direction, away from the corporate  special interest-driven politics, away from the swamp--I will talk more  about that later, but President Trump has made it worse, despite claims  that he is making it better--and toward politics that work for the  middle class and those struggling to get there. The enthusiasm among so  many Americans--not just core Democrats but others--of going to the  polls and making their voices heard because they want a change in  direction in this country was heartening and strengthening to me. The  Democratic Senate minority is working to get away from those special  interest politics. That is what a Democratic majority will deliver if  elected in November.                            ____________________     Mr. President, this week the Senate will consider  several nominations, including the nomination of Andrew Wheeler to be  Deputy Administrator at the Environmental Protection Agency. Mr.  Wheeler--not atypical of this administration, not atypical of the dense  swamp that they have made a whole lot worse--is, what else, an industry  lobbyist who has worked on behalf of big polluters and climate change  deniers. He spent years working to undermine or lobby against  environmental protections he may soon oversee. As a lobbyist, he helped  raise money for a few Republican Senators who sit on the committee that  recently approved his nomination. Swamp, President Trump? You are  creating it; you are making it a lot worse.   Wheeler's nomination fits the pattern in the Trump administration of  nominating industry lobbyists to lead agencies that are supposed to be  a watchdog over those very industries. The nerve it takes for President  Trump and his allies to preach ``drain the swamp'' after all the  President has done to fill the swamp since coming to Washington. His  Cabinet is filled with multimillionaires, hedge fund managers,  corporate executives, and former lobbyists with sprawling conflicts of  interest. Mr. Wheeler is only the latest in a long line of swamp  nominees. I will be opposing his nomination.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the Wheeler nomination sheds even more  light on the current storm surrounding EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt.  If there was ever somebody who characterizes the swamp, it is Scott  Pruitt, and all Americans should believe that, regardless of your views  on the environment or whether wind or solar or natural gas or oil or  coal is the right form of energy.   What Pruitt is doing is just incredible. In a relatively brief tenure  at EPA, he has amassed an embarrassing list of scandals. He has ordered  the construction of an expensive soundproof office at the EPA for  reasons unknown, when none of his predecessors, Democratic or  Republican, saw any need for such a facility. He has typically flown  coach when paying for travel out of his own pocket but elected to fly  first class when the taxpayers foot the bill. After moving to  Washington, Administrator Pruitt rented an apartment for a cutrate  price from--guess who--an energy lobbyist and former campaign donor who  represents multiple clients with businesses before the EPA during  Pruitt's tenure.   The level of hypocrisy in this administration is staggering.  President Trump says he is going to drain the swamp. Pruitt  characterizes the swamp in just about all of his actions, and Trump  sticks by him. If you want to drain the swamp, Mr. President, get rid  of Mr. Pruitt.   Unfortunately, President Trump has stood by Pruitt, despite obvious  abuses of the taxpayers' money and trust. Why? Well, he likes what he  is doing to unwind critical environmental protections on behalf of  powerful industries.   The bottom line is simple. President Trump is so beholden to the  special interests that supported Administrator Pruitt and his extreme,  anti-green, industry-driven agenda that he is willing to turn a blind  eye to serious ethical problems. If Big Oil and Big Gas are happy with  EPA Administrator Pruitt, so, it seems, is President Trump.   In supporting Administrator Pruitt, President Trump is lowering the  bar of government ethics and accountability to the floor. What abuse of  the American people's trust will President Trump not tolerate if  Administrator Pruitt is allowed to continue in his position despite  flagrant graft? How can the President, with a straight face, say he  aims to drain the swamp when he allows a man like Pruitt to stay? How  much will President Trump let the standards for ethical conduct in his  administration deteriorate?   I say to President Trump: The corruption and incompetence of this  administration has reached a fever pitch.   President Trump, if you truly mean to drain the swamp--and it doesn't  seem that you do--you ought to fire Administrator Pruitt immediately.  Accept his resignation. Let him leave, which alone will clean up  Washington in a way that Pruitt has not cleaned up our environment.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now, on the CBO report.   Today CBO came out with a report that revised its projections of the  deficit, saying they have ``increased markedly'' since the Republican  tax bill added about $1.9 trillion to the deficit. By 2020, the annual  deficit will surpass $1 trillion.   It is a reminder of just how wrong the predictions were that the  Republican tax bill would somehow pay for itself. It is also a reminder  of how unconcerned the current Republican Party is about deficits.  [[Page S1996]]    When it comes to tax cuts for big corporations and the rich, deficits  are no impediment, but now that these tax cuts are in place, I predict  that deficits will once again morph into a dire problem, a scourge on  the Nation, an excuse for Republicans to target Medicare, Medicaid, and  Social Security.   That has been the playbook since the Bush era: explode the deficit  with tax cuts for the rich and powerful, then use the deficit they  created as a reason to cut Social Security and Medicare.   Lo and behold, this week the majority in the House will vote on a  balanced budget amendment--a way for Republicans to force cuts to  Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security. It is hard to believe they  can say it with a straight face, but we will hear Republican Members  say this week that Washington needs to get its fiscal House in order,  only a few months after they added $1.5 trillion to the deficit by tax  cuts that mainly benefited the wealthy and the powerful. It is the  height of hypocrisy.   The American people deserve better than this patronizing Kabuki  theater. They deserve a Congress squarely focused on helping the middle  class, not the powerful, not the special interests, not those at the  very top of the economic ladder. So far, this Republican Congress has  shown it is not up to the job, and every day more and more Americans  realize that.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
