 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and for  her tremendous leadership on so many issues as a ranking member.   As a member of the Appropriations and Budget Committees, I rise in  strong opposition to this continuing resolution, which really could be  called the ``Failure to Govern Resolution.''   This bill, as my colleague from Ohio said, shamefully kicks the can  down the road once again, this time until January 19.   Why? Republicans have been too busy passing the greatest tax scam in  history rather than responsibly funding the government.   This reckless, short-term resolution ignores our critical year-end  priorities like passing a bipartisan, long-term reauthorization of the  Children's Health Insurance Program or a DACA program.   Every day, 122, DACA recipients are losing their protections. They  are afraid. They are fearful. There is so much anxiety. We should not  do this today without protecting them.   This continuing resolution does not honor the temporary protected  status for immigrants. It does not raise the budget caps equally for  defense and nondefense spending. Much-needed funding for the opioid  epidemic, community health centers, and our veterans is also not  included.   I could go on and on about the problems with the CR, but I just have  to tell you that the reality is this bill, like the tax giveaway,  underscores the majority's complete lack of regard for everyday  Americans and struggling families.  [[Page H10400]]    Continuing resolutions leave the American people out on a limb, with  no confidence in their Federal Government.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.    I guess we should not be surprised by this approach, since  the playbook for this administration from day one has been, as Steve  Bannon said early on, that their goal was deconstruction of the  administrative state. That is exactly what is happening with this CR.  This is unacceptable.   By passing a short-term spending bill that entirely neglects urgent  and vital needs and underfunds job training, affordable housing, and  education, we really are selling the American people short.   Unfortunately, this is another effort to disregard the lives of  millions of people. It is totally irresponsible, and it does nothing to  help create jobs, better wages, or a better future for our children and  their families.   I urge a ``no'' vote on this bill. We need to begin to try to do our  job here.                                time  1615
