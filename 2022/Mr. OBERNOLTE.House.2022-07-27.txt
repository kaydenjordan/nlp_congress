 Madam Speaker, I represent one of the largest  geographic districts in the country. Access to healthcare is a very  real problem for the people I represent because many of them live hours  away and hundreds of miles away from specialized healthcare.   For my constituents, one of the few positive developments that came  out of COVID-19 was the expansion of the way that telehealth can be  used to provide quality healthcare in districts like mine.   This bill, H.R. 4040, would take a very meaningful step in making  permanent the changes to law that enable the provision of that  telehealth, and I strongly urge its adoption.
