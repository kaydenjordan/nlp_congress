 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, is it timely for me to call up my  amendment No. 931?    I would do so and ask that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, Deng Xiaoping often repeated a Chinese  proverb:         Hide Your strength. Bide your time. Never take the lead.    As a result of that strategy, which worked beyond anybody's  imagination, whether by the People's Republic of China or the Chinese  Communist Party, America slumbered during the economic rise of the  People's Republic of China. American companies invested. Chinese  students studied here and then went home to use their new education to  compete against us while intellectual property theft, forced technology  transfers, and cyber crime emanating from the People's Republic of  China have become rampant.   Well, I think it is fair to say that the colossus that is America has  finally awakened from its slumber and realized what a challenge China  is to us and to world peace.   Today, the market value of American investments in the PRC numbers in  the trillions of dollars. Those are American companies that invested in  China that helped them to grow their economy. It is no exaggeration to  say that we have helped to build their economy into a near-peer status  and helped them to finance a military that threatens us and our allies  in the Indo-Pacific.   What this amendment does that Senator Casey and I have been pursuing  is to seek transparency. We need to understand as policymakers exactly  what is going on. We are not asking for any sort of limitation on  investments in the PRC. It just makes sense to me that we should know  what is going on so that we can consider whether there are any policy  options that we ought to embrace.   We policymakers need to know what American companies are doing to  help finance an aggressive, authoritarian adversary. What we do know  about this and what we do about this is a debate for another day.  First, we need to know the facts.   I ask my colleagues to join us in supporting this commonsense  amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 931
