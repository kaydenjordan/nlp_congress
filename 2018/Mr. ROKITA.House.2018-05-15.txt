 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5242) to require the Attorney General and the Secretary of  Education to conduct a survey of all public schools to determine the  number of school resource officers at such schools, as amended.  [[Page H3948]]    The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5242         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``School Resource Officer       Assessment Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. SURVEY OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS.         Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this       Act, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Education       shall jointly conduct and submit to Congress, a survey of the       assignment of school resource officers at public elementary       schools and secondary schools, which shall include, with       respect to each such school that chose to respond to such       survey, a determination of whether--        (1) on or after January 1, 2018, such a school has been       assigned a school resource officer; and        (2) in the case of a school that has been assigned such an       officer--        (A) the number of such assignments; and        (B) whether each such assignment is on a full-time or part-      time basis.       SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) ESEA terms.--The terms ``elementary school'' and       ``secondary school'' have the meanings given the terms in       section 8101 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of       1965 (20 U.S.C. 7801).        (2) School resource officer.--The term ``school resource       officer'' has the meaning given the term in section 1709(4)       of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (34       U.S.C. 10389(4)).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 5242.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5242, the School  Resource Officer Assessment Act of 2018. As we focus on our work in  this Chamber this afternoon, it is fitting that we recognize that it  is, as my colleagues have so far pointed out, National Police Week.   One of my great privileges as a Member of Congress is to interact  with members of the law enforcement community and see firsthand the  selflessness and true sense of service that they bring to their work.   Any one of us might say we want to protect and serve our communities,  but it is these fine men and women who walk the walk every day. Their  tireless efforts to improve public safety and build relationships  across communities and with all of their fellow citizens deserve our  appreciation and our total support and respect.   One of the best ways we as legislators can support members of the law  enforcement community is by using data and not emotion as the basis of  the decisions we make here in Washington that impact the way local law  enforcement officials have to do their jobs.   H.R. 5242, the School Resource Officer Assessment Act of 2018, seeks  to improve our decisions by providing better data on the work of law  enforcement in schools.   The research and evidence that comes from the appropriate use of data  can improve our understanding of how these policies work and the best  ways to support the efforts of community leaders across our Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I commend the tireless sacrifices made by those in the  law enforcement community and their families especially, and I thank  them for their service. I simply urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for supporting the  bill.   I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Louisiana  (Mr. Higgins), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Higgins), my friend, for  introducing this bill. I am bringing it forward as an opportunity to  support safer communities and those who take on the responsibility and  make the sacrifices to make our schools safer.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Higgins for his service not just to this  institution and to his constituents, but to the citizens of this  country he protected as a military police officer, as well as those in  Louisiana, where he served as local law enforcement. Like all of the  men and women we honor for National Police Week this week, our  colleague from Louisiana has ``walked the walk'' and it is an honor to  serve with him.   Mr. Speaker, I simply urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R.  5242, and I yield back the balance of my time.
