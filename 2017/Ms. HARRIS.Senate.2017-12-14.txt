Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into a  colloquy with my colleague, the senior Senator from California.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, Californians and San Franciscans have lost  a tireless champion for diversity, equity, and inclusion. Mayor Edwin  M. Lee was the son of Chinese immigrants and the city's first Asian- American mayor. Mayor Lee grew up in public housing and moved from  Seattle to the Bay Area to attend law school at UC Berkeley in the mid- 1970s. As a former civil rights attorney, Mayor Lee began his career in  public service fighting for fair housing and went on to serve in five  different city departments under four mayors before becoming mayor  himself. As mayor of one of America's largest cities, Mayor Lee worked  hard to transform San Francisco into a hub for innovation and  technology while still upholding the city's longstanding values of  equity and justice.    For 65 remarkable years, Mayor Lee demonstrated to all  those he worked with, knew, and came to serve that through humble and  steadfast leadership each one of us can create a more inclusive and  just community for future generations.
