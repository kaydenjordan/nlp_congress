 Mr. President, I proudly rise to speak about the  nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to be an Associate Justice of  the U.S. Supreme Court.   When I began law school in the fall of 1979, the only woman Justice  at the Supreme Court was a white marble statue on the steps. There were  no women members of the Court. There had never been women members of  the Court.   The motto engraved over the Court's entrance, ``Equal Justice Under  Law,'' sounded great, but it also rang hollow for the more than half of  the U.S. population that had never seen themselves represented on the  U.S. Supreme Court.   And it was more than just the absence of women on the Court. In 1868,  the 14th Amendment to the Constitution was adopted in core memorable  phrase guaranteeing to all persons the equal protection of the law. But  the Court, for more than 100 years, refused to extend equal protection  to women.   In one of the first cases testing the meaning of the phrase ``equal  protection of the law to all persons,'' the Supreme Court considered an  Illinois State law restricting the practice of law to men only. A  dynamic, young, feminist activist, Myra Bradwell, passed the Illinois  bar exam and applied for a law license to practice law in Illinois. She  was turned down because she was a woman. She appealed her case to the  Illinois Supreme Court, and they turned her down because she was a  woman. And then she came to the U.S. Supreme Court and said: We have  just changed the Constitution to guarantee equal protection of the law  to all persons, surely, you cannot turn me down in my quest to practice  law after I have passed the Illinois bar exam.   The Supreme Court of the United States, in 1873, by a vote of 8 to 1,  ruled that she was not entitled to an equal right to practice the  profession of her choosing.   Let me read you a key part of the decision in that case:         The paramount destiny and mission of women are to fulfill       the noble and benign office of wife and mother. This is the       law of the Creator.    So a wife and mother can't be a lawyer? So every woman must be a wife  and mother? That is what the Supreme Court determined in analyzing the  simple phrase ``all persons are entitled to equal protection of the  law.''   Here is a great trivia question: When did the Supreme Court finally  decide that equal protection of the law applied to women? 1971. It took  103 years after the 14th Amendment was adopted for the Supreme Court to  say: Wait a minute, equal protection of the law to all persons, that  means women.   In the case of Reed v. Reed, the Court ruled that a State statute  providing that males must be preferred to females in the administration  of estates--it was an estate administration case--the Court ruled, wait  a minute, that violates women's rights to equal protection. Who was the  lawyer in that case? A dynamic, young civil rights lawyer with the ACLU  named Ruth Bader Ginsburg.    So within my career as a civil rights attorney, from when I started  law school in 1979 to today--43 years later--I have seen great change  in the law's treatment of women and in their representation on the U.S.  Supreme Court.   The nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson will make history. She  will be the first African-American woman on the Court. And she will  move a Court that had never had a woman member when I started law  school to a Court where four of the nine members are women.   What powerful evidence of the capacity we have as a nation to come  closer and closer to the equality ideal that was articulated as our  moral North Star in the opening phrase of the Declaration of  Independence drafted by a Virginian in 1776.   So I celebrate the history-making nature of this appointment, but it  is not the reason for my support.   I support Judge Jackson's nomination because of her stellar academic  credentials, her prestigious judicial clerkships, her dedicated service  as an attorney and member of the U.S. Sentencing Commission, her well- respected tenure as a Federal trial and appellate judge, and the  multiple attestations that she has received attributing to her fairness  and to her character.   In particular--in particular--I think that her successful  confirmation as a Justice will add two critical skill sets to this  nine-member collegial body: first, that she is a public defender; and,  second, that she has been a trial judge.   That she was a public defender--so much of the Court's docket deals  with issues that are at the heart of the American criminal justice  system. There are currently members of the Court--Justice Sotomayor,  Justice Alito--who had experience as prosecutors in both the State and  Federal courts before they began their service in the judicial branch.  That experience as prosecutor is really important experience, and it is  an important expertise to have on the Supreme Court.   But a Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson will be the first public defender  ever to sit on the Court. And for a Court of nine to share perspectives  and grapple with resolution of questions involving the criminal justice  system, for that Court only to have people who prosecuted cases and not  have people who have defended, in particular, the most indigent  criminal defendants--it is a Court that doesn't have the balanced 360- degree perspective that we would want in these important matters. So  the fact that she served honorably as a Federal public defender, in my  view, is a strong trait for her, but it is even a better trait if you  think about what we would need in a nine-member Supreme Court.   Second, she has been a trial judge, a Federal district court judge in  the district court for the District of Columbia. And that is really,  really important. There is only one other member of the Court now who  was a trial judge, and that is Justice Sotomayor. Some of the members  of the Court, as far as I know--I can find no evidence--not only were  they not trial judges, some of them I am not sure ever tried cases.   What does it mean to have a trial judge on the Court? Well, again,  think about the docket of the Supreme Court. So much of the docket of  the Supreme Court is ruling on questions and controversies, whose  ultimate goal is to make the Nation's trials--civil and criminal  trials--more fair: admissibility of evidence, sentencing standards,  definitions of police misconduct that could either gain or shed  sovereignty immunity in a trial going on in a trial court, how to  impanel jurors, how to instruct jurors, when to strike a juror if there  is evidence that the juror may have a bias or prejudice. These are all  cases that come before the Supreme Court all the time. And these kinds  of cases, it is particularly important to have a Court that is well- represented by people who have actually been in the courtroom and done  it.   What trial judges have to do is they have to figure out how to  instruct and impanel jurors and deal with the juror who may have a bias  question. They have to rule on evidentiary objections in a split  second; dispose of discovery disputes; rule on dispositive motions like  motions to dismiss or summary judgment motions; in bench trials,  actually render judgments, which usually involves credibility  determinations among competing witnesses.   The judges in the Federal system are those with the power of  sentencing, the most difficult power of all. If you have not been a  trial lawyer or a trial judge, you might underestimate how difficult  and challenging each of those tasks are. But if you have had the  experience of being a trial lawyer or trial judge, you understand how  important they are.   I asked Judge Jackson as I interviewed her, tell me how you think  that being a trial judge might help you on the Court. She said, so much  of our opinions are essentially instructions to State and Federal trial  courts, here is how to conduct a fair trial. I think my experience will  enable me to write opinions that are more workable; that are more  understandable; that are more practical; that are more likely to lead  to a result that is fair to the parties, but also one that will  increase the  [[Page S1995]]  respect for the decision making in courts themselves.   When I was Governor of Virginia, I did not have the power to put  judges on the bench, except in rare instances. In the Virginia State  system, I wouldn't even nominate judges. The legislature would choose  the judges, and the Governor had no role, except--except--when the  legislature would deadlock. If the house and senate couldn't agree on  filling a position, then the Governor got to put in a judge or a  justice until the legislature came back next year, and then they would  have to vote on whether to ratify what the Governor had done.   Three times, when I was Governor, my two Republican houses deadlocked  on an appellate judge: one on the court of appeals and two on the  Virginia Supreme Court. So I had this opportunity. As somebody who  practiced civil rights law for 17 years, as somebody who was married to  a juvenile court judge, I had the opportunity to consider and then  nominate people to be appellate judges.   I decided pretty quickly, as I analyzed who should be appellate  judges--and I followed this rule in all three of my opportunities--that  I would appoint a great trial judge. In each of the three instances, I  appointed a great trial judge because I knew that that great trial  judge would be able to sit on an appellate court and render rulings  that weren't sort of philosopher, king-or-queen rulings that might  sound good in a law review article or in a panel discussion, but they  could render rulings that would be instantaneously understood in  courtrooms all across the Commonwealth and be able to be implemented by  the other trial judges, who were doing their best every day to conduct  fair trials.   So that is why I think the second factor that Judge Brown Jackson was  a district court judge handling trials, multiple trials and motions  every day, will put her in such good company as she joins Justice  Sotomayor as the only other member with that experience.   I will conclude and just say a Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson will add  depth and perspective to a Court that needs it. As we near the 150th  anniversary of Myra Bradwell's quixotic case, the confirmation of  Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson will make the statue of justice and the  engraved phrase ``Equal Justice Under Law'' more accurate reflections  of our Nation's highest Court.   With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.
