 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the Lady Rock Lions  basketball team for winning the 2018 National Association of Christian  Athletes Division 2 women's tournament.   These young women from The Rock School in Gainesville played through  a grueling season to earn their spot in the tournament this past  February. Their dedication paid off, and the Lady Rock Lions were named  national champions.   Their hard work, discipline, and unbreakable spirit have earned them  the right to stand among the greats of high school basketball. I am  confident in their ability to continue to succeed both athletically and  academically, and I look forward to watching these young women bring  more honor, pride, and success to not just their lives, but to our  district.   Go Lady Rock Lions and, yes, you do rock.                            ____________________
