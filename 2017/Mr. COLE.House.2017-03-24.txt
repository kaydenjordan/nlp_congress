 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for his  remarkable leadership in this important debate.   Seven years ago, I was on this floor and I heard that, if you liked  your plan, you could keep it. I heard, if you liked your doctor, you  could keep that doctor. And I heard that healthcare costs were going to  drop by $2,500 per family. None of it was true.   I sit here now and look at my State, and I know what is happening  next year. The rates on the ObamaCare exchanges are going up by 69  percent. We are down to a single provider. That is what 7 years ago  brought us.   Today we have a chance to do something different, and everybody from  my State will do something different. They will vote for a plan that  actually does what it says it is going to do. Number one, they will be  able to actually have plans that are designed by Oklahomans, not by  bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. They will be able to have a tax credit,  if they are not already insured under Medicaid or Medicare or from  their employer. They will be able to have an individual tax credit to  purchase a plan that they design, that they like. They will be free of  the mandates of ObamaCare, free to make their own decisions, free of  the mandates that require them to buy insurance products that they  simply don't need.   I have got a lot of people in my district that are in their fifties  and sixties. Some of them might like to have children again, but they  are not likely to have children again, and they mostly don't want  maternity care.   So it is a pretty simple choice for us. It is a choice to be free and  make our own decisions. It is a choice to design our own plans. It is a  choice to have Federal assistance where we need it, but to be used  under our direction. It is an easy choice.   I urge the passage of this rule, and I urge the passage of the  underlying legislation.                                time  1000    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a statement from  NETWORK, the lobby for Catholic Social Justice; a letter from the  National Alliance on Mental Illness; a letter from the Mental Health  Liaison Group; and an article in the New York Times entitled ``Late GOP  Proposal Could Mean Plans That Cover Aromatherapy but Not  Chemotherapy.''         Dear Representative: NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social       Justice urges you to vote NO on the American Health Care Act       (AHCA). This legislation fails to protect access to quality,       affordable healthcare for vulnerable communities. It would       widen the gaps in our society by making massive cuts to       Medicaid, giving large tax breaks to the very wealthiest       families and corporations, and threatening the health       security of American families.        Our faith teaches that access to healthcare is an essential       human right that is necessary to protect the life and dignity       of every person. The bill would drastically increase the       number of people without health insurance--and I know that       behind those numbers are millions of stories of families       facing medical bankruptcy, forgoing treatment, and losing       loved ones who could have been saved by preventative care.        The AHCA cuts Medicaid spending--an essential source of       care for millions of children, seniors, people with       disabilities, and people experiencing poverty in our nation--      and a per-capita cap would force states to ration care. The       legislation would also increase costs for older and sicker       patients and burden low- and moderate-income families with       much higher premiums by cutting $312 billion of financial       assistance for people purchasing health insurance on the       individual market. This is far from the Gospel mandate to       care for our most vulnerable sisters and brothers.        For any replacement to the ACA to be sufficient, it must       meet these 10 conditions--a Ten Commandments of Healthcare if       you will--and the AHCA breaks nine of 10 commandments:  [[Page H2383]]             1. Thou shalt provide affordable insurance and the same       benefits to all currently covered under the Affordable Care       Act. AHCA fails.        2. Thou shalt continue to allow children under the age of       26 to be covered by their parents' insurance.        3. Thou shalt ensure that insurance premiums and cost       sharing are truly affordable to all. AHCA fails.        4. Thou shalt expand Medicaid to better serve vulnerable       people in our nation. AHCA fails.        5. Thou shalt not undercut the structure or undermine the       purpose of Medicaid, Children's Health Insurance Program       (CHIP), and Medicare funding. AHCA fails.        6. Thou shalt create effective mechanisms of accountability       for insurance companies and not allow them to have annual or       lifetime caps on expenditures. AHCA partial fail.        7. Thou shalt not allow insurance companies to discriminate       against those with pre-existing conditions. AHCA partial       fail.        8. Thou shalt not allow insurance companies to discriminate       against women, the elderly, and people in poverty. AHCA       fails.        9. Thou shalt provide adequate assistance for people       enrolling and using their health coverage. AHCA fails.        10. Thou shalt continue to ensure reasonable revenue is in       the federal budget to pay for life-sustaining healthcare for       all. AHCA fails.        At its heart, this bill has lost sight of community and the       common good. Its biggest problem is that it lacks the       awareness that it is community which makes healthcare       effective. Healthcare is not just about the individual--it is       a communal good. The hyper individualism evident in the AHCA       is sucking the life out of our nation. Just focusing on one's       individual self is contrary to our Catholic faith and       contrary to our Constitution. We will track the vote and       score it in our 2017 voting record.        This dangerous legislation is not the faithful way forward       and must be rejected. Stand by Gospel principles and vote NO       on the AHCA.            Sincerely,                                       Sr. Simone Campbell, SSS,                                   Executive Director, NETWORK Lobby      for Catholic Social Justice.                                   ____                                                National Alliance on                                                  Mental Illness,                                       Arlington, VA, March 8, 2017.      Re The American Health Care Act.       Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, House Energy and Commerce Committee, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Frank Pallone,      Ranking Member, House Energy and Commerce Committee, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Walden and Ranking Member Pallone: NAMI is       the nation's largest grassroots mental health organization       dedicated to building better lives for the millions of       Americans affected by mental illness. On behalf of our       nonprofit, nonpartisan organization, I am writing to express       our views on the American Health Care Act (AHCA), which seeks       to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA).        The mental health crisis in our nation is well documented.       Half of all Americans with mental illness go without       treatment. Last year, Congress passed significant bipartisan       legislation to address the crisis in our nation's mental       health system. However, addressing the mental health needs in       our country relies on a foundation of affordable, quality       health coverage with fair and equal coverage of mental health       and substance use conditions. Thus, the importance of       Medicaid and insurance safeguards for individuals living with       mental illness cannot be overstated. Unfortunately, the       proposed reforms in the AHCA threaten to undermine the       historic progress being made to improve mental health and       substance use care.             Restructuring Medicaid Threatens Mental Health Care         Medicaid is the single largest payer of mental health and       substance use services in the United States. Medicaid is also       the largest funding source for the country's public mental       health system. One in five of Medicaid's nearly 70 million       beneficiaries have a mental health or substance use disorder       diagnosis.        NAMI is deeply concerned with proposed provisions to       convert Medicaid financing into a per capita cap model. This       would limit federal funding to a lump sum for all enrollees       and, instead of providing more flexibility, would shift       financial risk for health care costs--including unexpected       costs, such as promising new innovations in treatment--to       states. Current estimates are that the per capita cap       provisions would shift an alarming $370 billion in Medicaid       costs to states over the next ten years. In the face of       budget shortfalls, states will be forced to cut people from       coverage, reduce health benefits and access to care, and/or       reduce already low provider payments, escalating our nation's       healthcare workforce crisis.        The AHCA would set per capita caps for Medicaid at current       funding levels, adjusted for medical inflation. Funding for       mental health and substance use services is already       inadequate in Medicaid programs and, under this model, could       not be improved without cutting other health care. Further,       the deep reductions in federal Medicaid funding would mean       that people with mental illness will face even more desperate       circumstances when trying to access critical mental health       care.                Freezing Medicaid Expansion Puts Lives at Risk         Nearly 1 out of 3 people covered by Medicaid expansion       lives with a mental health or substance use condition.       Medicaid expansion has proven to be a lifeline that helps       people with mental illness who typically fall through the       cracks. Medicaid expansion provides coverage to people with       mental health conditions who are too sick to navigate the       traditional Medicaid application process, who are just stable       enough not to qualify for disability (often because they are       coming out of a psychiatric hospital), or who have first       symptoms of a serious mental illness.        NAMI strongly urges the Committee to take further steps to       preserve enrollment in Medicaid expansion, rather than the       proposed end to new enrollment in 2020. Expanded eligibility       has brought mental health treatment and the hope of recovery       to millions affected by mental illness. It is helping keep       people healthier and productive in their communities.       Congress should not abandon this important means of improving       coverage for and access to critical mental health treatment.        NAMI also urges the Committee to reject provisions in the       AHCA that would lock enrollees out of Medicaid expansion       should they experience a lapse of coverage of more than one       month. This is a high price to pay for forgetting to pay a       premium while in the hospital or experiencing severe symptoms       of mental illness. Denying coverage only serves to further       de-stabilize lives with costly consequences for individuals,       families and communities.        Finally, NAMI is very concerned that the AHCA removes the       requirement for Medicaid expansion plans to cover essential       health benefits, including mental health and substance use       treatment. Congress' significant commitment to mental health       and substance use services in recent legislation should not       be jeopardized by making these vital services optional in       Medicaid. Our country can ill afford to weaken coverage at a       time when the need for mental health and substance use       treatment is so high.                Continuing Insurance Subsidies and Protections         To help Americans afford quality health insurance, NAMI       strongly urges the Committee to continue current levels of       federal support, tied to income, to purchase health care       coverage. Without assistance tied to income, more people with       mental illness will be unable to afford coverage for mental       health care. This threatens their overall health, resulting       in more costly and difficult-to-treat conditions and denying       people the chance to reach and maintain recovery and a stable       life in the community.        NAMI appreciates that the Committee included essential       insurance safeguards in the AHCA. These safeguards include       protecting Americans from losing or being denied coverage       because of pre-existing health conditions. This also includes       continuing to allow young adults to remain on their parent's       health insurance plans to age 26 and banning annual and       lifetime caps for insurance coverage.        Cutting corners in health coverage will keep people from       getting the treatment they need and will push people with       mental illness into costly emergency rooms, hospitals and       jails. Making the investment early in affordable, quality       mental health care promotes recovery and reduces the high       long-term financial burden to taxpayers in avoidable       disability, criminal justice involvement and hospital care.        NAMI urges the Committee to maintain coverage and services       for people with mental illness by preserving financial help       based on income, removing the proposed per capita cap       financing model for Medicaid and protecting expanded Medicaid       eligibility. We appreciate the challenges in reforming       America's health coverage and look forward to working with       you to improve mental health coverage and care for children       and adults throughout our nation.            Sincerely,                                              Mary Giliberti, J.D.,      Chief Executive Officer, NAMI.                                   ____                                      Mental Health Liaison Group,                                                     March 17, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      House Minority Leader,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Democratic Leader Pelosi: The Mental       Health Liaison Group (MHLG) wishes to express our serious       concerns about the provisions of the American Health Care Act       (AHCA) that would restructure the Medicaid program and end       the Medicaid expansion, as well as provisions of that       legislation that would significantly reduce the Federal       premium assistance that enrollees receive from the Federal       government to maintain continuous insurance coverage, and       impose a significant penalty for not maintaining continuous       coverage. We are also very concerned that the legislation       would eliminate required coverage for prevention and       treatment of mental illness and substance use disorders under       state Medicaid managed care and alternative benefit programs,       as Medicaid is the major source of Federal funding in every       state for mental health and substance use services.  [[Page H2384]]         The MHLG is a coalition of dozens of national organizations       representing consumers, family members, mental health and       substance use treatment providers, state behavioral health       agencies, advocates, payers, and other stakeholders committed       to strengthening Americans' access to mental health and       substance use services and programs.        The elimination of Medicaid expansion under the AHCA would       leave without coverage the 1.3 million childless, non-      pregnant adults with serious mental illness who were able,       for the first time, to gain coverage under Medicaid       expansion. It would also leave uncovered the 2.8 million       childless, non-pregnant adults with substance use disorders       who also gained coverage under expansion for the first time.       These are populations that Congress promised and worked to       serve with the passage of 21st Century Cures and the       Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) of 2016,       respectively. And it is important to remember that untreated       mental health and substance use disorders intensify and serve       to increase the number of co-morbid medical conditions in       those populations, thereby multiplying total Medicaid program       costs.        Medicaid is the single largest payer for behavioral health       services in the United States, accounting for about 26       percent of behavioral health spending, and is the largest       source of funding for the country's public mental health       system. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the       Medicaid provisions of the AHCA would reduce Medicaid funding       over 10 years by $880 billion, or about 25 percent. With an       estimated 14 million people--one in five of Medicaid's 70       million enrollees--living with mental illness or substance       use disorders and depending heavily on Medicaid services,       allowing states to determine whether those services should be       covered could very well leave many low-income Americans       without access to medically necessary prevention and       treatment services.        Medicaid covers a broad range of behavioral health services       at low or no cost, including but not limited to psychiatric       hospital care, case management, day treatment, evaluation and       testing, psychosocial rehabilitation, medication management,       as well as individual, group and family therapy. In three       dozen states, Medicaid covers essential peer support services       to help sustain recovery. Additionally, because people with       behavioral health disorders experience a higher rate of       chronic physical conditions than the general population,       Medicaid's coverage of primary care is critical to help this       population receive needed treatment for both their behavioral       health and physical health conditions.        In states that have expanded Medicaid and which have been       particularly hard hit by the opioid crisis, such as Kentucky,       Maine, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia, Medicaid pays       between 35 to 50 percent of medication-assisted treatment for       substance use disorders. CARA and 21st Century Cures were to       increase payment for those services, but the elimination of       mandated coverage under Medicaid would likely result in state       cost shifting, so that CARA moneys (should they be       appropriated) and moneys provided under 21st Century Cures       for prescription opioid addiction prevention and treatment       services would supplant, rather than supplement, the existing       Medicaid coverage of services in the states.        Similarly, converting Medicaid into a per capita cap block       grant program or a simple block grant program will shift       significant costs to states over time. Ultimately, states       will be forced to reduce their Medicaid rolls, benefits, and       already low payment rates to an already scarce workforce of       behavioral health providers. Mental health and substance use       disorder treatments and programs will be at high risk       because, even though they are cost-effective, they are       intensive and expensive. Furthermore, the elimination of the       ACA's required Medicaid managed care coverage of mental       health and substance use disorder services and the long-term       reduction of real funding dollars will leave states and       managed care plans no alternative but to reduce or eliminate       services in order to balance state Medicaid budgets and       operate within managed care organizations' capitated rates.        In addition, these cuts will hit children with serious       emotional disorders, as well as adults with mental illness.       Fifty percent of Medicaid beneficiaries are children.       Seventy-five percent of mental conditions emerge by late       adolescence. The loss of Medicaid-covered mental and       substance use disorder services for adults would result in       more family disruption and out-of-home placements for       children, significant trauma which has its own long-term       health effects, and a further burden on a child welfare       system that is struggling to meet the current demand for       foster home capacity. In addition, we estimate $4 to $5       billion in Medicaid assistance will be lost by schools for       specialized instructional support services, including mental       and behavioral health services.        More directly, the rollback of the maximum eligibility       level for children ages 6 to 19 from 133 percent of the       Federal Poverty Level to 100 percent FPL will undoubtedly       have the result of reducing access to mental health and       substance use disorder services, and critical Early and       Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT)       services, for those older children. This is a particularly       problematic change since 5 percent (1.2 million) of       adolescents between the ages of 12 and 17 had substance use       disorders in 2015 and EPSDT screening is the most effective       early identifier for emergent mental health issues.                  ahca changes to private insurance coverage         If Medicaid is not to provide the avenue for recovery for       individuals with mental illness or substance use disorders,       then the private insurance market may have to serve as an       alternative, but the $2,000 to $4,000 refundable tax credits       provided under the AHCA to subsidize insurance premiums       constitute a significant reduction in the advance premium tax       credits paid under the ACA, which averaged 72 percent of       gross premiums. Further, the 30 percent premium surcharge       required under AHCA to be imposed for a failure to maintain       continuous coverage will likely hit hardest the lowest-income       enrollees who will be struggling to maintain premium payments       for coverage. It will be particularly destructive for those       enrollees whose serious mental illness or substance use       disorders may render them cognitively impaired and thus       unable to maintain premium payment schedules until they       recover, when the sizeable surcharge will leave them unable       to pick up coverage. For the foregoing reasons, these       provisions of the AHCA leave us very concerned for the       continued well-being of the individuals with serious mental       illness and substance use disorders we have been better able       to serve since the implementation of the ACA's expanded       coverage.        We urge you to continue to protect these vulnerable       Americans' access to and coverage of vital mental health and       substance use disorder care and services, and to not reverse       the recent progress made with the enactment of key mental       health and substance use disorder prevention and treatment       reforms under the 21st Century Cures Act and CARA.

Proposal Could Mean Plans That Cover Aromatherapy But Not                                Chemotherapy                          (By Margot Sanger-Katz)         Most Republicans in Congress prefer the type of health       insurance market in which everyone could ``choose the plan       that's right for them.''        Why should a 60-year-old man have to buy a plan that       includes maternity benefits he'll never use? (This is an       example that comes up a lot.) In contrast, the Affordable       Care Act includes a list of benefits that have to be in every       plan, a reality that makes insurance comprehensive, but often       costly.        Now, a group of conservative House members is trying to cut       a deal to get those benefit requirements eliminated as part       of the bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act       moving through Congress. (The vote in the House is expected       later today.)        At first glance, this may sound like a wonderful policy.       Why should that 60-year-old man have to pay for maternity       benefits he will never use? If 60-year-old men don't need to       pay for benefits they won't use, the price of insurance will       come down, and more people will be able to afford that       coverage, the thinking goes. And people who want fancy       coverage with extra benefits can just pay a little more for       the plan that's right for them.        But there are two main problems with stripping away minimum       benefit rules. One is that the meaning of ``health       insurance''  [[Page H2385]]       can start to become a little murky. The second is that, in a       world in which no one has to offer maternity coverage, no       insurance company wants to be the only one that offers it.        Here is the list of Essential Health Benefits that are       required under the Affordable Care Act:        Ambulatory patient services (doctor's visits)        Emergency services        Hospitalization        Maternity and newborn care        Mental health and substance abuse disorder services,       including behavioral health treatment        Prescription drugs        Rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices        Laboratory services        Preventive and wellness services, and chronic disease       management        Pediatric services, including oral and vision care        The list reflects some lobbying of the members of Congress       who wrote it. You may notice that dental services are       required for children, but not adults, for example. But over       all, the list was developed to make insurance for people who       buy their own coverage look, roughly, like the kind of       coverage people get through their employer. A plan without       prescription drug coverage would probably be cheaper than one       that covers it, but most people wouldn't think of that plan       as very good insurance for people who have health care needs.        Under the Republican plan, the government would give people       who buy their own insurance money to help them pay for it. A       20-year-old who doesn't get coverage from work or the       government, for example, would get $2,000. If the essential       health benefits go away, insurance companies would be allowed       to sell health plans that don't cover, say, hospital care.       Federal money would help buy these plans.        But history illustrates a potential problem.        In the 1990s, Congress created a tax credit that helped       low-income people buy insurance for their children. Quickly,       it became clear that unscrupulous entrepreneurs were creating       cheap products that weren't very useful, and marketing them       to people eligible for the credit. Congress quickly repealed       the provision after investigations from the Government       Accountability Office and the Ways and Means Committee       uncovered fraud.        Mark Pauly, a professor of health care management at the       Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, who tends       to favor market solutions in health care, said that while the       Obamacare rules are ``paternalistic,'' it would be       problematic to offer subsidies without standards. ``If       they're going to offer a tax credit for people who are buying       insurance, well, what is insurance?'' he said, noting that       you might end up with the government paying for plans that       covered aromatherapy but not hospital care. ``You have to       specify what's included.''        A proliferation of $1,995 plans that covered mostly       aromatherapy could end up costing the federal government a       lot more money than the current G.O.P. plan, since far more       people would take advantage of tax credits to buy cheap       products, even if they weren't very valuable.        There's another reason, besides avoiding fraud, that health       economists say benefit rules are important. Obamacare       requires insurers to offer health insurance to people who       have pre-existing illnesses at the same price as they sell       them to healthy people, and the Republican bill would keep       this rule. But if an insurance company designs a plan that       attracts a lot of sick people, it will be very expensive to       cover them, and the insurance company will either lose money       or end up charging extremely high prices that would drive       away any healthy customers.        Sherry Glied, the dean of the Robert F. Wagner Graduate       School of Public Service at New York University, who helped       work on the essential health benefits in the Obama       administration, raised the example of mental health benefits.       Parents of adolescents with schizophrenia will be sure to buy       insurance that covers only mental health services. Other       parents won't care about that benefit.        The result: Any company offering such benefits will end up       with a lot of customers requiring expensive hospitalizations,       while its competitors that drop them will get healthier       customers who are cheaper to insure. If mental health       services are optional, no insurance company will want to       offer them, lest all the families with sick children buy       their product and put them out of business.        And then healthy people who develop mental illness, or drug       addiction, will also learn that their illness isn't covered.       The result could be a sort of market failure: ``If you don't       require that these benefits are required, they often just get       knocked out of the market altogether,'' she said.        Before Obamacare passed, there were few federal standards       for health insurance bought by individuals, and it was not       uncommon to find plans that didn't include prescription drug       coverage, mental health services or maternity care. But plans       tended to cover most of the other benefits. That was in a       world where health insurers could discriminate against sick       people. In that era, insurers in most states could simply       tell the mother of a mentally ill child that she couldn't buy       insurance. That made it less risky for insurers to offer       mental health benefits to everyone else.        David Cutler, a professor at Harvard who helped advise the       Obama administration on the Affordable Care Act, said he       thinks the kind of insurance products that would be offered       under the proposed mix of policies could become much more       bare-bones than plans before Obamacare. He envisioned an       environment in which a typical plan might cover only       emergency care and basic preventive services, with everything       else as an add-on product, costing almost exactly as much as       it would cost to pay for a service out-of-pocket.        ``Think of this as the if-you-have-rheumatoid-arthritis-      you-should-pay-$30,000 provision,'' he said. Such a system       would mean that Americans with costly problems--cancer,       opioid addiction, H.I.V.--would end up paying a substantially       higher share of their medical bills, while healthy people       would pay lower prices for insurance that wouldn't cover as       many treatments.        There is most likely a middle way. Republican lawmakers       might be comfortable with a system that shifts more of the       costs of care onto people who are sick, if it makes the       average insurance plan less costly for the healthy. But       making those choices would mean engaging in very real trade-      offs, less simple than their talking point.    Mr. McGOVERN.
