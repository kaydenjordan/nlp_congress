 Madam Speaker, the perpetrators of this heinous attack on  our Nation's democracy were Americans encouraged and emboldened by  President Trump because he could not accept the outcome of a free and  fair election.   His actions are seditious, and the President has proven that he is  not fit to serve. History will look back on this moment to see who  stood strong in support of American democracy.   As my colleagues have said, we must come together, but our Nation  cannot begin to heal until there is accountability for the atrocity we  witnessed last week.
