 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 447, the  National Apprenticeship Act.   This bill invites continued Federal rules that hinder Idaho's ability  to use industry-based standards.   There is a lot of success with apprenticeships in Idaho. From  companies like Idaho Power, Micron Technology, and St. Luke's Hospital  to small businesses of all types, apprenticeships are crucial to job  growth in the Gem State.   These businesses partner with colleges and universities across my  State, connecting skill development to college degrees from regionally  accredited schools.   Whether it is Idaho Power partnering with the College of Southern  Idaho or the many small entrepreneurs working with schools like College  of Western  [[Page H414]]  Idaho, North Idaho College, Lewis-Clark State College, and others,  businesses need the flexibility to use approved third parties to  certify apprenticeship programs.   Make no mistake, Idahoans are used to dealing with heavy-handed  Federal bureaucracy. Despite long wait times for approval by the  Federal Department of Labor, our State officials continue to succeed in  setting up apprenticeship programs. But often, Idaho's labor officials  must use existing occupations because the Federal Department of Labor  doesn't have standards for new ones.   Why make it harder by removing qualified third parties that can  approve industry-recognized apprenticeship programs needed for our  economy?   Why eliminate the opportunity for employees to participate in  industry-based programs where they can go to school, get paid work  experience, and earn an industry credential?   Idaho's economy has been resilient, despite government intervention  due to COVID. Last year, I said if the government shut down the  economy, it had an obligation to help open it back up.   We should not hamper companies trying to create apprenticeship  programs for the types of jobs they need. We should help industry by  freeing them to develop high-quality, high-paying jobs for the future.   We should give jobseekers more opportunities to grow and succeed, not  with Federal boundaries, but only by the limits of their imaginations.   It is for these reasons I vote ``no'' on H.R. 447.                                time  1000
