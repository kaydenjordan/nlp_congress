 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the lives taken  during the Henry Pratt shooting in Aurora, Illinois, nearly 4 years  ago.   On February 15, 2019, gun violence stole the lives of five innocent  people and injured six police officers when a person who should not  legally have had a gun opened fire in a workplace.   Unfortunately, this is a reality that we are all too familiar with as  Americans. Throughout our Nation, in every State, gun violence  continues to claim innocent lives. These victims are our family  members, our friends, and our neighbors. We must do better.   I am proud that Congress came together in the last year to pass the  most significant piece of gun violence legislation in nearly three  decades, but more must be done.   We cannot wait for the next tragedy. We must continue to pursue  commonsense gun safety measures that will keep guns out of the wrong  hands and help save lives.   Mr. Speaker, I stand with the Aurora community during this time of  remembrance and reflection.                            ____________________
