 Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize Mr. Gary  Johnson on the occasion of his retirement. Gary has served as the  airport director for the city of Stillwater Regional Airport, SWO for  the past 32 years and has a lifelong dedication to the aviation  community. Under his steady leadership, Stillwater Regional Airport has  grown into one of Oklahoma's best general aviation and commercial  airports. Earlier this year, Stillwater Regional Airport celebrated its  100,000th commercial passenger in less than 2 years--made possible  because Gary brought regular commercial service back to the airport.   Gary began his career in aviation by graduating from Southeastern  Oklahoma State University with a bachelor's of science in professional  aviation-business. In addition to being a pilot, he started his own  fixed based operator, the Stillwater Flight Center,  [[Page S6220]]  before becoming the airport director at Stillwater. As airport  director, Gary has been a fixture in the Oklahoma aviation community,  even serving as president of the Oklahoma Airport Operators Association  twice. Gary was awarded the Airport Manager of the Year in 2017, the  same year that Stillwater Regional Airport was recognized as Oklahoma  Airport of the Year by the Oklahoma Airport Operators Association and  the Federal Aviation Administration.   At the Federal level, Gary has been a passionate advocate for  aviation, serving on the board of the American Association of Airport  Executives and as a vocal member of the U.S. Contract Tower  Association, ensuring that all Members of Congress are aware of the  importance of general aviation to their constituents and to their  communities.   I know that I join his family, the Stillwater Regional Airport, and  the city of Stillwater community in thanking Gary for his years of  service and contributions to the aviation community.   Congratulations on your retirement.                            ____________________
