 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, yesterday the Senate took a number of  steps forward on our considerable to-do list for the week. We confirmed  four well-qualified jurists who are now our country's newest district  court judges and voted to advance the nominations of 10 more--10. That  is what you call big progress for the Federal Judiciary. Today, we are  going to continue moving these nominations forward.   For too long, thoroughly uncontroversial judicial nominees just like  these have been held up and delayed by our Democratic colleagues, even  when the vacancy qualifies as a judicial emergency.   Uncontroversial district judges used to be confirmed promptly in big  groups by voice vote. These days, in a kind of protest theater, our  colleagues across the aisle usually insist that we hold a cloture vote  and then a rollcall confirmation vote on each one. But we are getting  the President's impressive nominees on the job one way or another, and  we will continue doing just that.   Our work doesn't stop there. The administration remains in need of a  full complement of leaders at the Pentagon and in the diplomatic corps.  Last night, we voted to confirm David Norquist, the President's pick to  serve as No. 2 at the Pentagon under our new  [[Page S5208]]  Secretary of Defense, Mark Esper. We also voted to advance the  nomination of Ambassador Kelly Craft, a very impressive individual, to  serve in the critical role of U.N. Ambassador.   Ms. Craft is a fellow product of the Bluegrass State. She has already  made Kentucky and the Nation proud through significant public service,  including as an alternate delegate to the United Nations and, most  recently, as Ambassador to Canada.   In each of these cases, this impressive nominee earned an unopposed  confirmation, and, in each case, she repaid the Senate's confidence by  skillfully and effectively advocating for the interests of the United  States on the international stage. During her tenure as Ambassador to  Canada, America's relationship with our northern neighbor was tested. A  number of challenging policy hurdles threatened to trip up progress on  several important issues, including trade negotiations, but, by all  accounts, Ambassador Craft's involvement led to greater cooperation.   She worked on finalizing the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, encouraged  cross-border participation in joint sanctions efforts, and helped more  Americans do business in Canada. As she stands in this new role, she  brings the ringing endorsements of peers and counterparts she engaged  all along the way.   The Premier of Ontario and a former Canadian Ambassador to the United  States has said: ``She's done the job very well.''   And another quote: ``Every Premier I know thinks the world of her. .  . . She really proved herself over some tough times.''   Our partners to the north have a healthy respect for the hard work  and qualifications of Ambassador Kelly Craft, and so does the Senate.  Last week, even in this contentious moment, a wide bipartisan majority  of our colleagues on the Foreign Relations Committee voted to recommend  her nomination to be U.N. Ambassador favorably here to the floor, and  before we adjourn this week, we will confirm her.                            ____________________     Madam President, the Senate needs to pass the  bipartisan budget agreement secured by the administration with Speaker  Pelosi. The deal we have in front of us is a product of extensive  negotiations between President Trump's team and the Democratic House. I  am confident it is not exactly the legislation that either side of the  aisle would have written if one party held the White House, the House,  and had 60 votes in the Senate. That is what we call divided  government, but I am equally confident that this is a deal that every  one of my colleagues should support when we vote on it in the near  future.   This government funding agreement is the right deal for our national  defense. It is the right deal because it ensures the United States  maintains its full faith and credit. It is the right deal because it  brings predictability and stability through 2020 and moves toward  restoring regular appropriations. It is the right deal because it  secures these priorities without partisan poison pill riders that would  take us backward on the issue of protecting human life and curtail  central Presidential authorities.   The Republicans' No. 1 priority was investing in our national  defense. After 8 years of neglect and atrophy under the Obama  administration, Congress has worked hand-in-hand with the Trump  administration to begin writing a new chapter. More of the resources  our Armed Forces need, more flexibility for commanders, more cutting- edge tools for U.S. servicemembers, and more investments in  modernization will not only rebuild the military that we need today but  set us on the trajectory we need to be on to secure our future.   All in all, I don't think any Senators are actually rooting for a  destabilizing continuing resolution. I certainly don't think any  Senators are rooting for a debt limit crisis that could put our full  faith and credit at risk. I believe that every one of our colleagues  wants this agreement to pass. That means every one of our colleagues  should actually vote for it.   The House has passed this deal. The President is ready and eager to  sign it. It is our turn to do our job.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, pursuant to yesterday's authority, the  Senate will now vote on the following nominations: Executive Calendar  Nos. 48, 55, and 351.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and  the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, at 3 p.m. today, the Senate will vote  on confirmations of the following nominations: Executive Calendar Nos.  205, 231, 232, 345, 350, 364, and 402.   I ask unanimous consent that if the nominations are confirmed, the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and  the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.  [[Page S5229]]     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  remaining votes be 10 minutes in length.
