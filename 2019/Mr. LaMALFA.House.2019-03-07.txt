 Mr. Speaker, let me point out an important difference  between the last Congress and this one.   Last Congress, under Republican leadership, our number one priority  was tax reform and jobs, putting more money into the pockets of the  American people who have earned it. That is why our bill, H.R. 1, the  Tax Cut and Jobs Act, was that first priority.   Even back in 1995, the first bill under Republican leadership was the  Congressional Accountability Act, to make sure Congress and its staff  had to abide by the same rules as the rest of Americans.   This Congress, under Democrat leadership, it appears their priorities  are much different. Their H.R. 1, supposedly, their most-prized bill,  hence, they give it the number 1 bill, is not a generational policy  reform to benefit Americans, but, rather, politics and rigging  elections; that is the Democrat priority; sweeping Federal mandates  that institute a 6-to-1 government match for small donor political  contributions.   That means 6 to 1 of your tax dollars going to match contributions  made for campaigns; $200 would yield $1,200 from the Federal Government  into a campaign.   In what world is it defensible for the Federal Government to be  forced to use your taxpayer funds, you to be forced for your taxpayer  dollars to support a candidate for office, regardless of whether you  support that candidate.   The bad news is it doesn't end there. Democrats want to take some of  the corrupt policies already implemented in my own State of California  and institute them nationwide.   For example: Ballot harvesting. Since its implementation in  California, this practice has opened up our State to endless potential  for election fraud. Just a couple of months ago, this exact practice  sent one North Carolina election into chaos, with every Democrat in the  State demanding a re-election. In the North Carolina one they were  using similar practices.   Ironically, this bill is completely silent on ballot harvesting. In  fact, Democrats blocked an amendment I worked on that would make ballot  harvesting illegal in all States, not just where it is convenient for  their elections.   In Orange County, California, 250,000 provisional ballots were  counted after election night, with people delivering hundreds of them  at a time.   Now, I am a staunch supporter of ensuring every voter has access to  the polls, but this bill isn't about that. This legislation only  undermines the security of our election system and limits the already- lacking safeguards that are in place to ensure the integrity of our  electoral process.   How are the voters, the people, the citizens of America supposed to  have confidence in their election system when they see these games  being played?   To make matters worse, this bill will actually weaken voter ID laws.  It automatically registers everyone in the DMV database, no questions  asked, alive or dead.   When this issue has come up in California, we have seen numerous  problems in the DMV process. California voter rolls have little  integrity. We have tens of thousands of so-called voters that are  registered that may not even be eligible, may not even be citizens.                                time  1030    This has also, in that process, made the REAL ID process in  California questionable as well, where the people are going to have to  go get their ID redone in order to be able to use the airports.   While some of my other colleagues on the other side of the aisle like  to peg voter ID laws as prohibitive, the National Bureau of Economic  Research published a study proving that is not the case.   We all support easy and fair voter registration, but it has to come  with sensible voter protections and fraud prevention safeguards. As we  saw in California this past election cycle, thousands of ballots  continued to be harvested even after election day. That is a huge  problem.   If this bill needed another nail in the coffin, even the ACLU has  condemned the legislation as unconstitutional. That is because it hurts  free speech and attempts to silence those who would dare disagree with,  in this case, Democrat priorities.   Just a few years ago, a California theater director was forced to  resign over harassment due to a political donation, just for advocating  for his own beliefs.   Democrats boldly dubbed this legislation the For the People Act, but  a more appropriate title would be ``Democrat Politicians Protection  Act.''   Once again, H.R. 1 under Republican leadership was the Tax Cuts and  Jobs Act and, years ago, an accountability act. H.R. 1 under Democrat  leadership is an unconstitutional bill to force Americans to help  reelect more Democrats. That should paint a substantially contrasting  picture for the American people what the priorities are of the two  parties.   Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to this terrible bill.                            ____________________
