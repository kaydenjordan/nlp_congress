 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 256.   Though a combat-tested security partner, Iraq continues to be a  fragile state. The 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force allowed  the United States to end Saddam Hussein's reign of terror. It also  allowed us to return and assist the people of Iraq when decisions made  by the Obama-Biden administration led to the formation of ISIS and  enabled the terror group to establish a caliphate in northwestern Iraq  in 2014.   Now, that same Authorization for Use of Military Force provides the  United States with the legal authority for military operations in  support of our Iraqi partners, if needed, and against terrorist threats  in Iraq, including those from the Iran-backed militia groups.   This critical piece of legislation provided the authority for last  year's strike on Iran's terror mastermind Soleimani, whose IEDs, I  might remind people, killed more than 600 American soldiers and wounded  thousands more.   The Authorization for Use of Military Force also provides authority  to strike Iranian-backed Shia militia groups that have and are  currently attacking Americans in Iraq.   This shortsighted and purely political effort to repeal the authority  without a replacement sends the wrong message and will embolden the  Islamic terror groups and the world's largest state sponsor of terror,  Iran.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill until we have a  viable replacement that addresses the threat of Iran and its proxies.   We have already turned our backs on Afghanistan. We should not repeat  this error in Iraq.
