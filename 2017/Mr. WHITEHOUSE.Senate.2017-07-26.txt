 Madam President, I appreciate the remarks of my  friend.   I would simply note that nothing he has said explains why you would  want to strip hundreds of millions of dollars out of Medicaid or why  you want to deny coverage to elderly folks who get Medicaid support for  their nursing homes, people who are in the throes of addiction getting  medical support for opioid treatment, children are often born on  Medicaid--why you want to do all that. Nor does it explain why you  would want to give big tax breaks to the most well-off people in the  country.   Fine, let's fix the markets, if that is the problem, but this isn't  really about that. This is stripping money out of Medicaid to give it  to very wealthy people who are doing quite well already, in my view.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, something else happened this  afternoon in Washington that I wish to relate today on the floor, which  is that the American Enterprise Institute hosted the launch of Senator  Schatz's and my American Opportunity Carbon Fee Act. I am delighted the  American Enterprise Institute did that. Their conservative credentials  are rock solid, but they do not fear debate, and they were  extraordinarily helpful and open-minded in allowing us to make the  announcement and in hosting a discussion on the bill that followed.   Virtually every person on the Republican side who has thought the  climate change problem through to a solution has come to the same  place--a revenue-neutral, border-adjustable price on carbon. That means  that all of the revenues are returned to the American people.   Former Treasury Secretaries Baker, Shultz, and Paulson--all  Republicans--former EPA Administrators Ruckelshaus, Thomas, Reilly, and  Whitman--all Republicans--and leading economists and former  Presidential economic advisers Arthur Laffer, Gregory Mankiw, and  Douglas Holtz-Eakin--all Republicans--along with many others, support a  revenue-neutral, border-adjustable carbon fee. Well, that is what we  do.   You all know the phrase ``offering an olive branch.'' Former  Republican Congressman Bob Inglis described our proposal as an olive  limb, not a branch, when pairing a carbon tax with corporate tax  reduction. He said it provides what he called ``an opportunity for  conservatives to show how free enterprise can solve climate change.''   When I first came to the Senate in 2007, this place was humming with  bipartisan action on climate change for years--but, in 2010, a dead  stop. The Republican Party disappeared from the field after the fossil  fuel industry secured from five Justices on the Supreme Court the  infamous Citizens United decision. The fossil fuel industry, as if it  saw the decision coming, immediately launched a veritable Soviet May  Day parade of political artillery and rocketry. No special interest had  that kind of political muscle before Citizens United. The combination  of this industry political weaponry, plus the proliferation of dark  money, plus the shady science simulacrum of climate denial has been  formidable.   Despite this, there is room for optimism. There are Republicans who  are willing to work with us. They just need some prospect of safe  passage through the political kill zone that the fossil fuel industry  has created.   Over 1,000 American companies have voiced their support for the Paris  climate agreement, including corporate powerhouses like Walmart,  Goldman Sachs, PepsiCo, and Google. If American companies were to  mobilize in  [[Page S4269]]  Congress just like they did for the Paris Agreement, that would be a  game-changer.   But notwithstanding all of that corporate support, the big business  trade associations and lobbying groups have lined up against action on  climate change. The so-called U.S. Chamber of Commerce--probably more  accurately described as the U.S. chamber of carbon--is one of climate  action's most implacable enemies, despite the good climate policies of  so many of its member companies. How is it representing its members? It  is incredible.   The American Petroleum Institute represents Shell, BP, Total, and  Exxon--companies that claim to support the Paris Agreement and the  Climate Leadership Council's carbon fee proposal--but API opposes  anything getting done.   We all know here that corporate America commands extraordinary  attention in our political system. If American corporations aligned  their political engagement on climate change with their actual position  on climate change, which should not be asking too much of them, we  could get going.   So, in a spirit of hopefulness, Senator Schatz and I reintroduced at  the American Enterprise Institute our American Opportunity Carbon Fee  Act, a framework that I hope both Republicans and Democrats can  embrace. The bill would establish an economy-wide carbon fee on carbon  dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. The fee would be assessed  where it is easiest to administer, minimizing the compliance burden.  Other greenhouse gases would be tied to their carbon dioxide  equivalency with a bumper for fluorocarbons to account for their high  greenhouse gas potency. Sequestering, utilizing, or encapsulating  carbon dioxide emissions would earn you a credit. The market would  begin to work in this space.   Our bill sets the 2018 fee per ton of carbon emitted at $49--the  central range of the social cost of carbon last estimated by the Office  of Management and Budget. That fee would increase each year at a real 2  percent until emissions fall 80 percent below 2005 levels, and then it  would follow inflation.   Border adjustments for energy-intensive goods traded with countries  that have weaker or no carbon pricing will make sure that we protect  our industries at home. We took care to design the border adjustments  in harmony with World Trade Organization rules.   This carbon fee would produce meaningful reductions in carbon  emissions. The nonpartisan Resources for the Future projects a 36- percent drop by 2025, compared to the benchmark year of 2005, exceeding  the U.S.-Paris Agreement commitment significantly.   In addition to the environmental value, of course, a carbon fee also  generates revenue--in this case, nearly $2.1 trillion in revenue over  10 years. Our plan would return every dime of that to the American  people. Here is how.   First, the bill lowers the top corporate income tax rate from 35  percent to 29 percent--a longstanding goal of Republicans. This would  cut American corporate taxes by almost $600 billion over the first  decade.   Second, it provides workers with a $550 refundable tax credit--$1,100  for a couple--against payroll taxes. The tax credits, which would grow  with inflation, would return almost $900 billion to the pocketbooks of  American households over the first 10 years.   Third, it would provide a matching benefit to Social Security  beneficiaries, veterans program beneficiaries, and certain other  retirees. These benefits would total nearly $500 billion over 10 years.   Finally, the bill would establish a block grant program, delivering  the remaining funds to our States--over $100 billion to help workers in  coal country, for instance, or provide coastal protection for seaside  States facing terrible threats of sea level rise, at the discretion of  the State, to meet local needs and concerns.   I understand the suffering in coal country. Coal country will  continue to decline as natural gas drives coal out of the energy  market. There is now no mechanism to remedy that inevitability.   Remember Huey Long's old slogan, ``Every Man a King''? With a carbon  fee, we could make every miner a king--a solid pension, retirement at  any time, full health benefits for life, a cash bonus based on years  worked, a voucher for a new vehicle, a college plan for their kids.  These things become doable with carbon fee revenues.   It is not the miners' fault that the coal industry has collapsed.  They worked hard. They did dangerous work. It is a rigorous occupation  to be a coal miner, and they are entitled to respect. Give them their  dignity. Make them kings. With a small fraction of the revenue from a  carbon fee, we could assure every single coal miner a lifetime of  comfort, security, and financial stability.   Senator Schatz and I extend an open hand, an olive branch. Give  Senator Schatz and me a Republican to negotiate with. That shouldn't be  too much to ask. Then let's talk about the economics. Let's talk about  where the revenue should go. And because I know it is a part of the  Baker-Schultz-Paulson proposal, let's talk about where we can get fact- based, scientifically rigorous analytics of which regulations might  become unnecessary or duplicative of a carbon fee's emission  reductions.   Let's restart the bipartisan conversation we had going until 2010.   Let me close with an appeal to our patriotic sense. America holds  herself out as an exemplary nation, a ``City on a Hill.'' The tactics  of climate denial and political menace the fossil fuel industry has  deployed around here have degraded our city.   There is a remorseless functioning of the laws of physics, of  chemistry, and of biology. Deny them all you want, but time will tell.  And even now, everyone, from our Secretary of Defense to every single  Senator's home State, State university, understands that climate change  is real and urgent, is teaching the science of climate change in those  universities, and is warning of the dire consequences.   When the Presiding Officer left the Environment and Public Works  Committee the other day, I was talking about the Leopold Center at Iowa  State University and the powerful language in which they describe the  present effects on agriculture of climate change and the danger of  disruption to the fundamental systems of the planet. That is the home  State universities telling us what the facts are.   So one day there will be a reckoning, and the longer our American  democracy lies incapacitated at the hands of the fossil fuel industry,  the worse the outcome will be, and the worse the outcome, the greater  the harm to the country we love that holds its example up to the world.   We are all extremely fond of John McCain. John McCain returned to the  Senate yesterday and called our country ``the strong, inspiring,  inspirational beacon of liberty and defender of dignity of all human  beings.'' Some beacon, if we continue to get this wrong because of what  one industry did to our politics, using political menace, dark money,  and fake science.   America deserves better than what we are doing in this Chamber on  this issue.   I thank the Presiding Officer.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I intend to file the following  motion to H.R. 1628 and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in  the Record. The motion is supported by Senators Brown, Franken, Van  Hollen, Cardin, and Feinstein.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Mr. Whitehouse moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions with       instructions to report the same back to the Senate in 3 days,       not counting any day on which the Senate is not in session,       with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) establish a public health insurance option.
