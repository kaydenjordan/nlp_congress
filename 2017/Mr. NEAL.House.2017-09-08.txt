 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, as I stand in support of this legislation, it is  important to acknowledge that it not only addresses the needs of the  residents who are cleaning up after Harvey, but it ensures that we will  also avoid a first-ever default on the full faith and credit of the  United States.                                time  1000    What is important about this moment is the following: We are adhering  to what is known as the national principle, and the national principle  means that, if there is an earthquake in California, we rise to the aid  of the people of California. If there is a hurricane in Texas, we rise  to the aid of the people in Texas. If there is a tornado in  Springfield, Massachusetts, as there was a few years ago, we all come  to the aid of the people of Springfield, Massachusetts. If there were  horrific forest fires in the State of Alabama, as happened a few years  ago, we all come to the aid of the people of Alabama.   Now, why is that important? Because we don't check gender, and we  don't check race, and we don't say: Is it a blue State or a red State  or what is the political affiliation of those who are affected?   Instead, we say: The national principle ensures that this is about  the American family in moments of great challenge and great difficulty,  and we don't use the opportunity to remind people of what the budget  might look like at that moment. Instead, we come to their assistance  and we figure out how to pay for it later on.   So on this occasion, there is a very important consideration that is  married, and it includes the idea that, with the Trump administration  and congressional Republicans and Democrats on this side, we are going  to not only do what we are supposed to do in terms of raising the  national debt, but we will come to the assistance of members of the  American family, as I, a moment ago, described.   Now, let me point out something else as well. We need to stop playing  games with the national debt limit. We had tax cuts here in 2001 and  2003 that cut Federal revenue to 15 percent of gross domestic product,  despite the fact that the historic postwar norm average is closer to  17.5 percent. Actually, in some of those years before that, it rose to  18.5 cents on the dollar--a reasonable expenditure. But instead, as  those numbers slipped to 15 percent, the argument became somehow that  it was about future payments.   The argument over the debt limit is about expenses incurred, what we  have obligated ourselves to with veterans benefits, a war in  Afghanistan, a war in Iraq. And even though I voted against the war in  Iraq, we need to come to the aid of those veterans and those veterans  hospitals, and we need to come to the assistance of those 1 million new  veterans who were created because of it. And again, not asking  questions, is it a blue State expenditure? is it a red State  expenditure? It is about the national principle.   The idea that we would cast doubt on the full faith and credit of the  United States to earn a few political points and to try to convince  people that this is about future spending, it is not about future  spending. This is about the credit card having come due for, in most  instances, reasonable expenditures, not the least of which includes the  obligations we have to Social Security, Medicare, and our senior  citizens.   So this agreement that we have rendered today is a reasonable and  sensible bipartisan achievement, and we should use this as an example  and as a template for what we might do going forward to address many of  the challenges that are going to confront the American people.   And be assured of this: Whether it is in Florida or it is in Houston,  the expenditure requirements here are going to bulge, and we should not  be dismissive of that. So raise the debt limit and come to the aid of  the American family today.
