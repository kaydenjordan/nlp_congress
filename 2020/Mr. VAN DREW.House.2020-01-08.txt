 Mr. Speaker, today, I would like to recognize the  various CASA branches throughout our region that have dedicated  themselves to vulnerable children in southern New Jersey.   CASA stands for a court-appointed special advocate. They are selfless  volunteers who act as the child's voice during legal proceedings. These  volunteers specialize in understanding the physical and emotional needs  of the child and work tirelessly until finding them a permanent home,  preferably with family members or with an adopted family.   Because of organizations like CASA, abused or neglected children have  present, trustworthy adults in their lives who sympathize with their  struggles, who understand them, and who fight on their behalf.   Therefore, I thank all the CASA branches in our district for  protecting the youth of south Jersey and ensuring that every child has  a caring home. I thank them for their good work, for their love, and  for the difference that they make in people's lives.                            ____________________
