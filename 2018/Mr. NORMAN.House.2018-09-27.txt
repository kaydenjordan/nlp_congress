 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of Grover  C. Fewox, who died September 13, 2018.   Mr. Fewox went to war at the age of 17. He was one of 16 million  Americans who served in World War II. His wartime service was  concentrated in the bloody ocean battlegrounds of the Pacific aboard  the Sperry, a submarine tender and the first United States Navy ship to  be launched after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor.   His career began on April 29, 1942, as a seaman apprentice in the  United States Navy. He was honorably discharged on December 13, 1963,  as a senior chief torpedoman, after 21 years of dedicated service.  While serving in the United States Navy, Mr. Fewox was awarded the  National Defense Service Medal and seven Good Conduct Medals.   Like so many others answering America's anxious calls to service, he  found the experience of war to be rites of passage to manhood. He was  never much for war stories, but he surely enjoyed a constancy of  fellowship with his fellow travelers in organizations such as the Fleet  Review Association and The American Legion.   Mr. Fewox served in the Navy for 16 years after the war ended, and  when he retired in 1962, he moved to Charleston to work at the naval  weapons station. He had begun a second career of public service, and he  and his wife, Neta, would raise three daughters in Hanahan, South  Carolina.   Mr. Fewox and Neta committed to their marriage in the early days of  the war. He mailed her an engagement ring from a West Coast duty  station. As the years passed, they had a date every day. It was a  standing happy hour, of pause for undistractible table talk over  refreshments of drinks and some snacks. It was a discipline that  nurtures bonds; it was the practice of that love story that grew  stronger after 72 years.   Upon his retirement, he received a letter of appreciation from the  commanding officer of the naval weapons station in Charleston, South  Carolina. Among other things, the letter said:         Your performance as an electronic mechanic was very       professional, as evidenced by a Sustained Superior       Performance Award and cash award for the period of June 5,       1967, through June 5, 1968, and again May 4, 1977, through       May 4, 1978. In addition, you have received numerous letters       of appreciation for superior performance and are a member of       the 1,000 Hours Sick Leave Club.        Your attention to duty, cheerful cooperation, adaptability,       knowledge, and general attitude toward your work within the       Ordnance Department have been most praiseworthy. Your       contributions to the team effort of ``Service to the Fleet''       and the resultant high quality of accomplishments are greatly       appreciated. Your dedicated service reflects great credit not       only to yourself but to the naval weapons station as well.        As you complete your civil service career, allow me to add       my personal ``Thank you and well done.'' You can reminisce       with pride that you have given your best to the naval weapons       station in Charleston. I know that your fellow workers and       your many friends join me in wishing you and Mrs. Fewox the       blessings of a long, healthy, and happy retirement.    It was signed D.M. Agnew, Commanding Officer of the naval weapons  station.   There are 7,200 World War II veterans still with us in South  Carolina. Because of Mr. Fewox and others who made up the Greatest  Generation, America won that horrible war and then led the rebuilding  and reknitting of the world, kindling global trade patterns and  commercial alliances. It was a postwar world order anchored by  America's strength and determination to nurture freedom and human  dignity.    Undoubtedly, America is a better place because Mr. Fewox answered the  call.                            ____________________
