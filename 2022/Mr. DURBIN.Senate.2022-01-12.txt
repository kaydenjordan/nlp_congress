 I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized for up to 15  minutes and Senators Padilla and Cantwell for up to 5 minutes each  prior to the scheduled vote.    Madam President, there are several issues swirling around  the Senate at this moment. They relate to the voting rights of  Americans. They relate to the voting rights of Senators--interesting  that they would both be on parallel tracks as we debate them on the  floor. It appears that the voting rights of Americans is witnessing a  historic shift. You see, my Democratic Party, and yours, in history has  a spotty record when it comes to voting rights. In fact, Southern  States--then in the thrall of the Democratic Party--wrote a terrible  record after the Civil War.   We released African Americans from slavery, guaranteed them the right  to vote, and then watched what happened. There was jubilation all over  the country, I believe, for the most part, and there was jubilation in  the southern States by African Americans who had newfound freedoms they  never dreamed of with the end of slavery. And they took them to heart.  They did register to vote.   And there were dramatic differences in many States because in many  States the slave population, the African-American population, was much  larger than any voting had ever reflected, and now they had the chance.  And as they were elected to local offices and even congressional seats  and even a senatorial seat, there was a backlash from the White  population.   This period of Reconstruction after the Civil War lapsed into a  period of denial of the right to vote and elaborate plans by Whites-- White Democrats, I might add--in southern States to manufacture  obstacles to the voting of African Americans--poll taxes, for example,  literacy tests, things that had little or nothing to do with  citizenship but were designed expressly to jeopardize the voting  opportunities for those without advanced educations or the kind of  clout necessary to overcome.   And so the net result was the South went White again in terms of its  political leadership. It was known as Jim Crow. And the Democratic  Party of that day was behind it. The opposition came from Abraham  Lincoln's party, the Republican Party. They were the ones for abolition  of slavery. They were the ones who supported Reconstruction. They were  the ones, by and large, who sent the Federal troops in to enforce  equality in the South. But, ultimately, sadly, as a result of a  brokered Presidential election, there was a concession made that gave  to the Democrat Party-controlled South States' rights to determine  voting standards. And that was the situation that applied in the United  States from that period of time in the mid-19th century, until the  1960s, when this issue was debated anew, right here in Washington,  right here in this Chamber.   And those who opposed striking down the Jim Crow laws, those who  opposed efforts to deny to African Americans the right to vote,  asserted one abiding principle: States rights. The States should be  allowed to make this decision. It didn't go very far. It took a lot of  years of debate, I might add, I don't want to oversimplify it.   But anyone who took the time to read this book, the Constitution of  the United States, understands it is explicit. It doesn't take long to  read the sections that are applying.    Listen to this and think in your mind whether there is any question  who has the authority to determine the rules of Federal elections. And  I read: ``Article I, section 4--The Times, Places, and  [[Page S180]]  Manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be  prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress  may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the  Places of chusing Senators.''   The 15th Amendment went further on the issue of race, and the net  result of it was the passage of some laws in the 1960s, the Voting  Rights Act, and the establishment of standards to open up opportunities  to vote in the South for people of color.   It took that long from the late 19th century to the 1960s before that  issue was addressed effectively. But for the longest time, it became a  consensus issue. Republicans were as supportive of this as Democrats.  In fact, proportionally, they were more supportive. The Republican  Party--the party of Abraham Lincoln--rejected the theory of States  rights and said there will be Federal standards that are created and  will be enforced on a bipartisan basis by Presidents of both parties.   It was an amazing evolution in America, considering what we had been  through, a civil war and all that followed, to have reached the point  where we said that the Federal Government could review decisions made  by States if they, in any way, discriminate on a racial basis or any  other basis in terms of ethnic identity.   That was so popular and so bipartisan that for years the renewal of  that law was automatic. There was hardly a dissenting vote. Boy, have  times changed. They have changed to the point where the Democratic  Party is now supportive of the Voting Rights Act and what it sought to  achieve. And the party of Abraham Lincoln, the Republican Party, comes  to the floor every day and argues States rights.   Yes, we are back into that mode again, but the argument is coming  from the Republican side of the aisle. The tables have turned. The  Democratic Party of the South is a different party today, thank  goodness, and a party that stands for the principle that people are  entitled to the right to vote.   So we staged a national election in 2020. In light of the pandemic  that was looming over this Nation, we opened up opportunities to vote,  and two things happened. We had the most dramatic turnout of voters in  the United States of America for the office of President. We had never  seen that kind of turnout of voters.   And No. 2, when the Agencies of government took a close look at the  votes that were cast, they found no evidence--virtually none--of voter  fraud or manipulation of the outcome of the election.   It was obvious to all who were honest about it, including some  Republicans who have said as much in the last few days. But one man  dissented. That man, of course, was the former President of the United  States, Donald Trump, the loser--the official loser--in the 2020  election.   He is still in total denial. His momentous ego cannot countenance the  possibility of rejection by the American voters, and so he claims the  Big Lie that somehow or another this vote was stolen from the poor  little former President. Though he can't come up with any evidence to  prove any aspect of that and has failed miserably virtually every time  he has gone to Federal court to argue it, he still continues to make  that argument.   It was that argument that was the inspiration behind the  insurrectionist mob that was here in the Capitol Building a little over  a year ago trying to stop the electoral college vote count. They  failed, as they should have. The Constitution prevailed. The will of  the American people prevailed. And so in legislatures across the  country, including the State of Wisconsin, we see Republican  legislatures saying that we are unhappy with the results in the 2020  election; we want to change the rules when it comes to voting in our  State.   And almost without exception, every change in these Republican  legislatures results in a limited time to vote, a limited ability to  vote, new obstacles to vote, and on and on and on.   I have yet to see any of these Republican-led leislatures demonstrate  an effort to the contrary, to expand the right to vote.   And so based on article I, section 4 of the U.S. Constitution, we  have written a bill, a bill that establishes basic standards of voting  across America as this document envisioned: standards for voter  registration, standards for absentee ballots, standards for same-day  registration, standards for making election day a national holiday.  Every one of these things that we have proposed in our pending  legislation is an expansion of opportunities to vote for eligible  voters.   It gets down to the bottom line: When it comes to eligible voters,  should we create obstacles of hardship or should we make it easy for  them to vote without endangering their families, without losing their  jobs, without hardship?   I think that is the basic mission of a democratic legislature, is it  not: the greatest possible participation of the greatest number of  voters? Then let them decide on issue after issue.   So that is the issue of voting rights in America that now comes to  the floor of the U.S. Senate.   On the question of the voting rights of Senators, it is interesting  to me, every morning, that those in the Chamber start the session by  pledging allegiance to the flag. It is apparent, from some of the  arguments on the Republican side, that they want to start this meeting  of the Senate each day additionally with a pledge of allegiance to the  filibuster.   Now, that is strange, because if you have any history in the U.S.  Senate, you know what the filibuster has become. It is not an  occasional problem and challenge. It is now the standard.   The filibuster, you see, requires 60 votes for passage of a measure  in a body of 100 people. It is an extraordinary majority. It gives  power to the minority, which the Senate, of course, was designed to do  by giving two seats--two Senate seats--to every State, large and small,  but it goes a step further.   Despite what you may have heard on the floor earlier, the use of the  filibuster--I should say the abuse of the filibuster--has led to the  elimination, virtually, of debate and amendments on the floor.   I have often said that if you are suffering from insomnia and watch  C-SPAN and turn on the U.S. Senate, you will see a perfect room and  structure for a wedding reception because there is always plenty of  room on the floor of the Senate. We should be leasing this out and  using the money to reduce the national debt, the Senators use it so  infrequently.   There was a time--can you believe this now?--10 years ago, there was  a time when 12 appropriation bills would come out of the committees and  come to the floor and be subject to amendments, and we would take turns  offering amendments to all 12 appropriations bills. That was the  ordinary course of business. It is no longer the case. It hasn't been  that way for 10 years.   And when it comes to the debate and amendments on all the other  items, the numbers tell the story.   I want to thank my friend Jeff Merkley, who has done amazing research  on the Senate and its procedures.   In the 109th Congress, we considered 314 amendments. That declined to  just 26 amendments under Republican leadership in the last Congress.  Twenty-six amendments in a year? Compared to 314? Thank you, to the  filibuster. That is where we are today. Thank you, to the 60-vote  requirement. That is where we are today. And thanks to my colleagues on  the Republican side who are trying to ignore those numbers. They are so  graphic.   On nominations, there were only three cloture motions in the history  of the United States before 1975--three. After 1975 to now, 852 times  cloture has been filed on nominations--852 weeks of Senate time  potentially obstructed.   That is the Senate today. That is the Senate under a filibuster. And  if this Senate is going to join the House in establishing standards for  equal voting rights across America, the filibuster is the obstacle.   I know this story personally. I introduced the DREAM Act 20 years  ago--20 years ago. And you say: Senator, I thought you were a hotshot  legislator. What are you waiting for? Pass it. I sure wish I could.   I brought it to the Senate floor five times in that 20-year period,  the DREAM Act to help young people living in this country to have a  chance, a pathway to citizenship. On five different occasions it has  been stopped by  [[Page S181]]  filibuster. Don't tell me the filibuster opens debate and opportunity.  The filibuster has shut down debate on the DREAM Act five times in the  last 20 years, and that is just one isolated example that is personal  to me. That is what the filibuster is all about. It is stopping us from  doing anything substantial on voting rights. It is stopping us from  passing the DREAM Act. It is stopping us from passing meaningful  immigration reform.    The filibuster is designed for people who want to say no--no to  progress, no to government, no to the Senate being engaged in the  issues that affect the American people and families.   I have seen colleagues come to the floor on the Republican side with  quotes from me defending the filibuster. That was when I was a hopeful  person in the Senate.   My hope has been dashed by reality--by the reality of a Senate that  has been shut down when it comes to national debate and shut down when  it comes to national achievement.   That, to me, has got to come to an end. I am prepared to sit down  with any Republicans of good will--and Democrats included--and come up  with some meaningful rules.   You know, incidentally, that we are sitting here with a calendar that  is loaded with nominations? It is not the filibuster, but it is  something quite near to it, where one or two Republican Senators have  decided that they don't want to take the ordinary course for  nominations. They want to drag them out interminably.   That is unfair to President Biden. It is unfair to the American  people. If you want to defeat a nomination, do your best. But to stop  the debate of the Senate on these nominations to impose your will and  to slow down the business of the Senate, I think is an unacceptable  standard.   And so for the voting rights of American to have a chance to be  protected and for the voting rights of Senators to finally be engaged  on the floor in that process, we have to be ready to make a change. I  am ready. And as I said, I am ready to do it on a bipartisan basis. But  for goodness' sake, this empty, silent Chamber is no indication of what  the Founding Fathers had in mind when they created this legislature.   We are supposed to be engaged in debate, not afraid of debate. We  shouldn't be running off and hiding behind 60 votes. I am open for  change. I wish some Republicans would join us.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the Senator  from Hawaii (Mr. Schatz) are necessarily absent.
