 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding 1 minute.  Maybe I can get another. I miss the magic minute, as all of you know,  because this is not enough time to debate this issue.   Something that is as bad as fiscal responsibility is fiscal  demagoguery. The Speaker of this House has said default is not an  option.   Mr. Speaker, 84 of the Republicans in this House have never voted to  extend the debt limit so that default would have been inevitable.   That is what this is about; trying to make some sort of deal. I urge  my Republican colleagues to follow what they know to be the only  rational alternative; that is, vote for a debt extension.   Pay our bills. America does not welch on its debts. You believe that;  we believe that. Mr. Speaker, 84 of their Members have not believed  that, but we have a majority of this House that believes it.    Mr. Speaker, I urge Republicans to stop creating this lack  of confidence in this body to be fiscally responsible. Let me repeat  that: Stop allowing no confidence in this body's ability and  willingness to be fiscally responsible. Vote ``no.''
