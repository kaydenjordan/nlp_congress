 Madam Speaker, recently, I received an impassioned letter  from Elizabeth Bradley, a young woman from Bessemer City, North  Carolina, about the American ideal.   In her letter, she writes: ``The American ideal is the revolutionary  thought that it is not by government, nor wealth, nor any human  intervention that people have rights, but by the divine power of God.''   Ms. Bradley is exactly right, Madam Speaker.   The American ideal has withstood the test of time because of those  who put their faith in God's plan rather than their own.   Madam Speaker, let us never forget that we are one Nation under God,  and the freedoms we proudly espouse are a gift that He has bestowed  upon us.                            ____________________
