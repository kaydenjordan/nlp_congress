 Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill?    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill?    I am opposed in its current form.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to  recommit.   The Clerk read as follows:         Ms. Titus moves to recommit the bill H.R. 3971 to the       Committee on Financial Services with instructions to report       the same back to the House forthwith with the following       amendment:        Add at the end the following:       SEC. 3. PROTECTING CONSUMERS FROM EXCESSIVE HOUSING COSTS AND                     PREDATORY LENDERS.         (a) In General.--No creditor or servicer may make use of       the amendments made by this Act if the creditor or servicer       has either been--        (1) found to have committed or engaged in an unfair,       deceptive, or abusive act or practice under Federal law in       connection with any transaction with a consumer for a       consumer financial product or service; or        (2) convicted of fraud under Federal or State law in       connection with a residential mortgage loan.        (b) Definitions.--For purposes of this section, the terms       ``State'' and ``consumer financial product or service'' have       the meaning given those terms, respectively, under section       1002 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer       Protection Act.    Ms. TITUS (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  to dispense with the reading.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from Nevada?   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from  Nevada is recognized for 5 minutes in support of her motion.    Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill. It  will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the  bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.   My motion to recommit is just a commonsense measure that I believe  everybody in this House can support because it would prevent the bad  actors from being able to use the exemptions in the underlying bill to  dodge the consumer protections that are found in both the Truth in  Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act.   My motion says if a lender has committed or engaged in an unfair,  deceptive, or abusive act or practice under Federal law in connection  with any transaction with a consumer for a financial product or  service, or if they have been convicted of fraud under Federal or State  law in connection with a residential mortgage loan, they cannot avail  themselves of the bill's decreased requirements.   As you know, Mr. Speaker, I represent the heart of the Las Vegas  valley. More than 43 million visitors come to my district every year  from all around the world to enjoy our first class resorts, hotels,  entertainment, and the natural beauty around us. It is also, though,  home to over 2 million people.   Less than a decade ago, southern Nevada, unfortunately, had the  additional distinction of being at the epicenter of the foreclosure  crisis that was caused by the Great Recession. At its peak, nearly 70  percent of all homes in the Las Vegas valley were under water, and the  foreclosure rate was five times the national average. For 62 straight  months, Nevada led the Nation in foreclosures and delinquent mortgages.  This is the number--just think about this--219,000 foreclosures  occurred during that period.   Newspapers from coast to coast read like obituaries as home after  home was boarded up, homelessness skyrocketed, and major developments  along the Las Vegas strip that were under construction went belly-up,  leaving high-rise rusting skeletons in the middle of the desert. We  lost 80,000 construction jobs during that period.   We were one of the first States to be hit so hard by the recession  and one of the last States to recover. But housing prices are coming  back and new construction is taking place.   Unfortunately, it seems that my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle want to turn back the clock and go back to the abusive practices,  including predatory lending, that contributed to the Great Recession.   Supporters of this legislation--you have heard them--say it is needed  to provide relief for smaller sized institutions and smaller sized  mortgage servicers. But that is really the red herring here. The CFPB  has already, as you heard too, provided a targeted exemption to cover  those folks.   This bill is really about protecting the large servicers that failed  to provide necessary loan documentation and to communicate openly with  their customers, in turn contributing to millions of unnecessary  disclosures and settlements for abusive business practices during the  financial crisis.   Nevada, in fact, had to bring lawsuits against financial institutions  like Countrywide and Bank of America that engaged in this predatory  lending.   My motion to recommit would ensure that such lending practices and  loan servicing activities cannot resurface at the expense of consumers.   This is especially important also in light of the fact that at the  same time we are eroding consumer protections put in place after the  financial crisis, my Republican colleagues are also simultaneously  taking away affordable housing from my constituents. The ``Job Cuts and  Tax Act'' passed by this House eliminates tax-exempt private activity  bonds, a move that will stifle investments in affordable housing.   The Nevada Housing Division, for example, has already suspended its  mortgage credit certificate program which provides an average of $2,000  a year in Federal income tax savings to first-time home buyers and  veterans because of the threat of this provision.   Furthermore, multifamily housing bonds make affordable housing  possible for seniors, people with disabilities, veterans, and low- income families. Without the tax exemption on these bonds, Nevada can  lose up to 7,000 rental homes.   So, Mr. Speaker, I ask you: How can this body pass a bill that  eliminates affordable rental homes; makes ownership more expensive for  first-time home buyers; and opens the door, again, to predatory lending  practices that target low-income borrowers and put them at risk of  foreclosure?   This mix of anticonsumer and antiaffordable housing policies does not  bode well for a country that suffered a housing crisis just a decade  ago, so I would urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this motion to  recommit.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.                            ____________________
