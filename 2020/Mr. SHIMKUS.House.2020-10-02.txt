 Mr. Speaker, since last Friday, I have been working in  good faith to find a path forward on a bill to ban asbestos. Democrats  ended that effort yesterday evening.   The bill passed the Energy and Commerce Committee with bipartisan  support last November, but the majority added new language just last  Friday.   One minute is not enough to detail my concerns with that language or  to describe every offer our side made to try to reach agreement. The  committee record will have to speak for itself.   The record shows the bill passed 47-1. Every Democrat on the  committee voted for it. It shows the bill does not affect talc  litigation. And it shows exactly which special interest objected, trial  lawyers who didn't get exactly what they wanted.   I want to offer my apologies to Linda Reinstein, who has been a  tireless advocate for more than a decade and has fought the good fight  in honor of her late husband, Alan, for whom this bill is named.   We know the 47-1 bill I have right here could pass.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee  on Energy and Commerce and the Committee on Education and Labor be  discharged from further consideration of H.R. 1603, and I ask for its  immediate consideration in the House with an amendment adopted by the  Committee on Energy and Commerce on November 19, 2019, by a vote of 47  yeas and 1 nay.
