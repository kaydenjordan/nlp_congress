 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  3178, the Medicare Part B Improvement Act of 2017, which includes my  legislation, the Dialysis Certification Act.   Kansas currently ranks among the top three longest wait times for  dialysis center surveys. The lack of manpower at the State  administrative agency that contracts with CMS for these surveys has  left some clinics waiting 2 years for a certification. This bill gives  dialysis providers the opportunity to receive surveys and  certifications from a CMS-approved third-party accreditor, much like  hospitals are able to do now.                                time  1400    Those third-party organizations must demonstrate their standards are  as good as or better than the standards used by CMS, and the Secretary  must approve them.   I toured several clinics in my district last year, and I was  frustrated to learn that a state-of-the-art clinic, necessary to fill a  need in Topeka for ESRD patients, has been waiting 2 years for an  initial survey, and a clinic in Pittsburg, Kansas, has been waiting for  250 days. Without these clinics, patients are forced to find clinics  much further away, which, depending on the access to transportation,  can be a barrier to treatment. That is unacceptable, and this problem  will be easily solved by this provision.   I want to thank my cosponsor, Congressman John Lewis, the Energy and  Commerce Committee and the Ways and Means Committee chairmen for  quickly moving this bill to the House floor for action. This provision  will allow dialysis clinics across America to more easily obtain a  survey so they may serve patients that depend on their care.
