As one who  was born and raised in the neighboring city of Caribou, it is a great  pleasure to celebrate the generations of industrious and caring people  who have made Limestone such a wonderful place to live, work, and raise  families.   The story of Limestone begins long before its incorporation in 1869.  For thousands of years, Aroostook County has been the home of the  Micmac and Maliseet; the name Aroostook comes from the Native American  word for ``beautiful river.'' French explorers, led by Samuel de  Champlain, first visited the area in 1604.   For decades after the American Revolution, Maine's northernmost  region was the site of a protracted and tense border dispute between  our new Nation and British Canada. As negotiations to end what is now  called the Bloodless Aroostook War neared completion in the early  1840s, families and entrepreneurs settled in the area.   Among them was General Mark Trafton, a veteran of the War of 1812,  who was drawn to the region by the great deposits of limestone, vast  stands of timber, and fertile soil. Soon a thriving settlement  developed, and the prosperity derived from quarries, sawmills, and  farms was invested in schools and churches to make a true community.   Later in the 19th century, the people of Limestone joined their  neighboring towns in connecting their remote region to the world with  their own hands. Town by town, they built roads and railroads with  pick, shovel, and wheelbarrow. These transportation networks, combined  with the region's rich soil, made Aroostook County an agricultural  powerhouse, and the potato industry remains an essential part of the  Maine economy.   People were drawn to Limestone in search of liberty and opportunity,  and they have always worked and sacrificed to extend those blessings to  others. Veterans' monuments throughout the area stand in honor of the  many heroes who gave their lives so that all could be free.   During the Cold War, Loring Air Force Base was established in  Limestone, due to its proximity to northern Europe, and it became a  crucial forward post in America's defense. The closure of the base in  1994 was a difficult challenge for the people of Limestone, who  responded with the qualities that wrote their history: strength,  determination, and a strong work ethic. With the transformation of the  former base into the Loring Commerce Centre, Maine's largest industrial  park, they are building new jobs and opportunities.   Limestone's support for our Armed Forces continues at the Defense  Finance and Accounting Service facility at the Loring Commerce Centre,  where hundreds of hard-working and dedicated employees have established  a reputation for excellence. The Loring Job Corps Center, also at the  former air base, has helped thousands of young people gain the skills  to succeed in the workplace and to further their educations. In  addition, part of the air base was converted into the Aroostook  National Wildlife Refuge, a protected area of forests and wetlands, and  home to moose, lynx, waterfowl, and rare plant species.   The Maine School of Science and Mathematics, MSSM, a public  residential magnet high school, was established in 1995 and is ranked  as the best high school in Maine and among the best in the country. The  MSSM Key Club, a joint effort between the school and the local Kiwanis,  carries out many community service and charitable projects throughout  the year.   The spirit of Limestone is evident in the energy that so many will  devote to this exciting yearlong sesquicentennial celebration. The  celebration of Limestone's 150th anniversary is not merely about the  passing of time. It is about the people who for generations have pulled  together, cared for one another, and built a great community. Thanks to  those who came before, Limestone, ME, has a wonderful history. Thanks  to those there today, it has a bright future.                            ____________________
