 Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, March 3, 2020 I regret not  being present for a vote session. Had I been present, I would have  voted in support of H. Res. 387 Condemning continued violence against  civilians by armed groups in the Central African Republic and  supporting efforts to achieve a lasting political solution to the  conflict, Roll Call vote 81, and voted in support of H.R. 4508 Malala  Yousafzai Scholarship Act, Roll Call Vote 82.                             personal explanation
