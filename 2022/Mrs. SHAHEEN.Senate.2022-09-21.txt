 Mr. President, I come to the floor to recognize  the Dover Adult Learning Center--DALC--on its 50th anniversary. For  five decades, the hard-working team at the DALC has supported thousands  of adult learners in their quest to reinforce their learning skills and  improve their lives through high-quality adult education. I join a  grateful community in saluting them for the indispensable service they  provide not only to each participant, but also to local partners and  businesses who benefit from an educated and engaged workforce.   We all know that an education is the key to unlocking so many doors  of opportunity. These doors could lead to a fulfilling new job, a hard- earned promotion at a current place of work, or additional education  and training at a community college. No matter the destination, the  Dover Adult Learning Center works closely with community members  throughout their educational journey to identify personal goals and  provide tailored instruction that guides them toward their full  potential. The center offers an inviting atmosphere where students of  all types--including people with disabilities, people who are homeless  or unemployed, teens who might otherwise drop out of high school or  immigrants learning English--feel comfortable honing their reading,  writing, math, and digital literacy skills. At the Dover Adult Learning  Center, a high-quality adult education is always within reach.   Each June, the Dover Adult Learning Center holds a graduation  ceremony where participants are able to celebrate the successful  completion of their program alongside family, friends, center staff,  and volunteer tutors. It is a time to reflect on a period of personal  growth and achievement. It is also a chance to look forward with hope.  For many graduates, an exciting future with new possibilities is only  just beginning. Through their experience at the Dover Adult Learning  Center, they are given the tools to venture into this new world with an  open mind and a lifelong appreciation for learning.   As a former teacher at the Dover Adult Learning Center, I know from  personal experience how hard the center works to provide these programs  and accommodate each participant through a variety of learning options,  flexible schedules, and access to supportive services like childcare.  Its staff and educators are creative in connecting and engaging with  each student, and they are always there to offer support and guidance.  We should take a moment to thank all of the teachers, staff, and  volunteers for the skill, dedication, and passion that they bring to  their roles at the center each and every day.   On behalf of the people of New Hampshire, I ask my colleagues and all  Americans to join me in congratulating the Dover Adult Learning Center  on five decades of service and wishing its team all the best as they  continue their important work in the coming years.                            ____________________
