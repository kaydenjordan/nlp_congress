 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, last night, President Donald Trump, in  an interview with ABC News, said that if he were offered information  about an opponent from a foreign source in the next election, he would  take a look at it and might not go to the FBI.         I think you might want to listen. There isn't anything       wrong with listening. If someone called from a country . . .       [and said] ``we have information on your opponent''--oh, I       think I'd want to hear it.    That is shocking, shocking--yet, sadly, is par for the course for  this President.   My predecessor, Senator Moynihan, said, ``We are defining deviancy  down.'' No President has defined deviancy down more than Donald Trump,  and his remarks last night defined deviancy down to a new low.   To say that it is OK for foreign countries to interfere in our  elections, with their motives not being what are in the interests of  the American people, is disgraceful, shocking. It is as if the  President has learned absolutely nothing from the past 2 years of  investigations into Russia's interference of the 2016 elections. This  is precisely how the whole thing started. A foreign power reached out  to establish connections with a Presidential campaign by dangling the  promise of information about an opponent, and President Trump said he  would welcome it. He asked Russia to interfere.   When he wonders why people think there might be collusion, well, this  is why. This is a President who says: Russia, come help. That doesn't  prove collusion, but it sure proves that he doesn't mind foreign powers  interfering with an election.   Again, the President's comments are undemocratic, un-American, and  disgraceful. The President's comments suggest he believes winning an  election is more important than the integrity of an election. That idea  is flat-out wrong. The President's idea that winning an election is  everything and the integrity of an election is nothing is one small  step away from dictators and autocrats, who manipulate the results of  an election because they care more about staying in power than they  care about democratic principles. Donald Trump seems to fall into that  category in which winning is everything and integrity is nothing.   It is simple. When a foreign power tries to give a campaign  information on an opponent, that is foreign interference in our  elections. It is exactly what the Framers worried about at the very  founding of our Republic.   It is up to us in Congress to protect that legacy, the wellspring of  democracy--free and fair elections. It is up to all of us in Congress-- Democrats and Republicans. When a foreign power interferes in our  elections, the Democrats shouldn't say ``If it helps our side, we are  OK with it,'' and the Republicans shouldn't say ``If it helps our side,  we are OK with it.''   Where are the Republicans going to be with this latest step over the  line by Donald Trump? Are they going to sit and cower and do nothing?   We have multiple bipartisan elections security bills that are just  languishing here in the Senate. We even  [[Page S3454]]  have a bill that has been introduced by the ranking member of the  Intelligence Committee that would make it a campaign's legal duty to  report to the FBI when a foreign power offers its assistance.   It is very simple. If a foreign power comes to your campaign and  offers assistance, you tell the FBI. This would say you are required to  by law. It is Senator Warner's bill. Are our Republican colleagues  going to be with us on that? We will find out shortly because later  this afternoon, my friend Senator Warner will ask our colleagues for  the unanimous consent to pass his bill that says: If Russia, Iran,  North Korea, or anyone else offers campaign help, you must report it to  the FBI ASAP.   My Republican friends should take a few hours to decide if they  really want to block that bill, because if they do, it would be a  disgrace and another step in defining deviancy down in this grand  democracy that is becoming more and more at risk.   The Republican blockade of elections security thus far, led by Leader  McConnell, has to come to an end. Bipartisan elections security bills  are languishing because Leader McConnell will not bring them to the  floor. One of his own colleagues, the chairman of the Rules and  Administration Committee, said we are not bringing them to the floor  because Leader McConnell doesn't want to. He stands in the way, with  his graveyard, on an issue that is vital to American integrity,  American democracy. Leader McConnell needs to bring these bills to the  floor.   Again, I ask our Republicans to think hard as Senator Warner asks for  his unanimous consent request later this morning or this afternoon. Are  you going to say it is OK when a foreign power goes to you or to any  other candidate or a sitting President and says, ``We will help you win  the election--shhh--and we will help you to be quiet about it and not  to tell law enforcement''? I hope not.   The embrace of our Republican colleagues of everything Donald Trump  does, including things they know are wrong, has become stunning and  appalling. Let's see, in this instance, if it gets even worse.                            ____________________     Madam President, on taxes, a year and a half ago, as the  Senate debated the Republican tax bill, the Democrats predicted that  giving enormous tax breaks to big corporations and the superrich would  not trickle down to working Americans. We predicted then, as usual,  that corporations would find a way to direct those newfound profits to  themselves, not to their workers, not to their communities, and not for  the good of the country.   Our Republican colleagues protested. They said trickle-down works.  They talked about tax cuts. They tried to deliberately avoid who they  were designing the tax cuts to benefit, but it was largely the very  wealthy and the very powerful corporations. They said it was going to  benefit everybody.   Well, here we go. The analyses keep pouring in of what a sham--a  disgrace--this tax bill was, especially for middle-class, average  Americans.   An analysis by JUST Capital showed yesterday that 56 percent of the  tax savings from the Trump tax bill have gone to shareholders in the  form of stock buybacks and direct distributions--56 percent, a  majority. Do you know how much workers got? While the shareholders-- most of them wealthy--got 56 percent, workers got 6 percent of the  whole benefit of the tax bill. This was by JUST Capital, which is not a  leftwing group; it is a group that is composed of people who know all  about and participate in corporations and finance.   If you don't believe that one, this morning, the Business Roundtable,  which is made up of the 200 largest CEOs in America--hardly a leftwing,  radical group--reported that America's CEOs expect to spend less on  capital investments now than before the tax bill was passed.   So this idea of giving these companies big tax breaks so they will  reinvest them is not happening. They are going to buybacks. This is not  dealing with the No. 1 problem that America faces--the maldistribution  of wealth and income as it agglomerates to the top and the middle class  and those trying to get into the middle class being left out.   I remember when President Trump promised his tax bill would be a  ``middle class miracle''--his words--and that the average American  family would see a $4,000 raise. I remember when many of my Republican  friends came to the floor to tout workers' bonuses in the wake of their  tax bill even though many of them were merely your typical annual  bonuses. It turns out, as to yesterday's report, that 2 percent--just 2  percent--of the tax bill's overall windfall went to workers' bonuses,  which is an average of a measly $28 per worker, while their corporate  parents and their larger shareholders got hundreds of thousands and  millions.   Several of my Republican colleagues still laud the tax bill. They try  to link it to positive economic news, but you will never hear them  mention that most of the bill's benefits flowed to multinational  corporations and to the top 1 percent of America. You won't hear them  mention that it did very little to raise wages for average Americans.  Alas, the Republicans are giving themselves credit for building a theme  park for everyone when all they have done is renovate the exclusive  country club.   As many Democrats predicted, a year and a half after its passage, the  Republican tax bill has overwhelmingly benefited shareholders and  corporate executives but not workers and their families.                            ____________________     Madam President, now, on a very important topic that  affects New York and America, there is the renaming of a ship.   The men and women who wear this Nation's uniform are some of the most  inspiring people you will ever meet. There is no shortage of stories of  their valor, of their courage under fire, or of their sacrifices made  voluntarily on behalf of a grateful nation. Yet I have the  responsibility and the honor this morning of sharing the story of a  particularly exceptional servicemember from my State of New York, SCPO  Shannon Kent.   Shannon Kent was from Upstate New York. She was born in Oswego and  was raised in Pine Plains. She graduated from Stissing Mountain High  School and left college to join the Navy, following in the footsteps of  her father and her uncle--a police commander and a firefighter--both of  whom were first responders on September 11. Duty ran in the veins of  the Kent family.   Shannon was a pioneer in the special operations community. She was  one of the first, if not the first woman to pass the course required to  join Navy SEALs on missions. That is amazing in itself. Shannon was an  outstanding linguist and a seasoned cryptologist, whose work  ``contributed directly to the capture of hundreds of enemy insurgents  and severely degraded enemy combat capability,'' which earned her a  slew of accolades, including multiple commendation medals--the Purple  Heart and the Bronze Star.   What an amazing woman--brave, strong, brilliant, and with a large  body of knowledge. Amazing. Her courageous efforts and groundbreaking  achievements have inspired numerous programs for integrating women into  the special operations forces, with there being combat jobs and special  operations training now open to female servicemembers. Senior Chief  Kent was living proof that women could not only keep up with but lead  our Nation's most highly trained and capable servicemembers.   Of course, Shannon was more than just a sailor; she was a loving wife  to her husband, Joe, a caring mother to her two children, a cancer  survivor, a scholar, and an unstoppable athlete who stayed true to her  New York roots, often going out for runs in her faded New York Yankees  cap.   On January 16 of this year, SCPO Shannon Kent was among four  Americans and more than a dozen others who were killed in a suicide  bombing in northern Syria.   Senior Chief Kent was on her fifth combat deployment, once again  conducting some of the Nation's most classified and dangerous missions.  After her tragic death, one of her commanding officers said: ``Senior  Chief  [[Page S3455]]  Petty Officer Shannon Kent deserves to be honored in a manner befitting  of her noble service to our country and enduring contributions to the  United States Navy.''   I could not agree more. So, today, I am proud to introduce an  amendment to the annual Defense authorization bill urging the U.S. Navy  to name a ship after New York native and American hero, SCPO Shannon  Kent.   Of the 289 Active-Duty ships in the Navy, only five--only five--are  named in honor of women. Of the 53 named vessels currently under  construction, only one--just one--is named in honor of a woman. And no  Navy ship has ever been named for a woman who fought and died in combat  as Shannon Kent did.   It is time to address this disparity, recognizing the integral role  that female servicemembers play in protecting our great Nation. RADM  Grace Hopper, the namesake of the USS Hopper, once said:         A ship in port is safe; but that is not what ships are       built for. Sail out to sea and do new things.    That is what RADM Grace Hopper said.   Well, SCPO Shannon Kent was built to set out to sea to do good  things. So should we. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment to  name the first naval vessel after a woman who has fought and died in  combat, the brave, patriotic, wonderful Shannon Kent.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, will my colleague kindly yield the  floor before I leave?   I agree with the first half of his sentence.                       Joint Resolution of Disapproval     Mr. President, first, I thank my friend from Virginia  for offering this unanimous consent request. I express my severe,  severe disappointment in our friends on the Republican side blocking  it.   The bottom line is very simple. When a President feels it is more  important to win an election than conduct a fair election, we are a  step further away from democracy and towards autocracy. That is what  dictators believe--winning at all costs. That seems to be what  President Trump said yesterday.   The shame of this is that our Republican colleagues can't even bring  themselves to say that when a foreign nation tries to interfere in our  election, it ought to be reported to the FBI. How minimal. How minimal.   How disgraceful it is that our Republican friends cower before this  President when they know that the things he does severely damage  democracy. This one is a new low. It is OK for foreign powers to  interfere, and we don't have to report it to law enforcement? That is  welcoming foreign powers to interfere, and, as my friend from Virginia  said, the President's own FBI Director said it is going to get worse in  2020. But our Republican friends say: Let's cover it up because it  might have an effect that we like.   Today is a new low for this Senate, for this Republican Party here in  the Senate, and for this democracy.   I would urge my friends, when they go home over the weekend--my  friends on the other side of the aisle--to rethink this. We will offer  this unanimous consent request again. To say that it is OK to  interfere, that we shouldn't have any law enforcement, that we should  have no knowledge, is to encourage Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran  to interfere in our elections with no recourse. Shame. Shame.   It is truly outrageous that this unanimous consent request, which  should bring all of us together, is being blocked by our Republican  friends.   I thank my colleague for his wise, wise unanimous consent request.   I yield the floor.
