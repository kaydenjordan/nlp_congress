 Madam Speaker, the Census can be used to either  marginalize or to empower communities. This President decided on the  path of marginalization.   They did that by coming up with an idea to silence the voices of  immigrant communities throughout the country by adding a citizenship  question that they deemed necessary to enforce the Voting Rights Act.   For 53 years, no Department of Justice had a problem enforcing the  Voting Rights Act without Census block data on citizenship. All of a  sudden, 2017 comes around, and you know what? We have a problem.   This is the excuse that they had. This is the reason they had to add  this question to the Census. It is just completely false, even to the  extent that we saw that they said that the Department of Justice was  the one that asked for it.   Then, we find out later that they had to shop around to the  Department of Homeland Security and other Departments in order to get  somebody to try to ask the Census Bureau to add the question. Then,  they went back to Jeff Sessions, who carried out their request.  [[Page H5945]]    We are investigating because everything that they have said, the  Department of Commerce and Wilbur Ross, has been a complete lie.   If you don't believe me, the recent Supreme Court decision said,  ``Unlike a typical case in which an agency may have both stated and  unstated reasons for a decision . . . the sole stated reason seems to  have been contrived.''    What does ``contrived'' mean? It means forced, artificial,  manufactured, false. False, that is what it is. It is a contrived  reason.   The American people have a right to know the real reasons, not the  contrived reasons, not the ones that were manufactured, not the ones  that were made up. That is why we are asking for these documents. That  is why, when Congress cannot perform its obligations for oversight and  as a check on the executive branch, then we must hold these individuals  in contempt.   I ask my colleagues to do the same thing.                   Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore
