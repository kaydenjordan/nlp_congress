 Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the 100th  anniversary of the Army's 1st Infantry Division, or the ``Big Red  One.''   From their heroic start, the 1st Infantry Division has played a vital  role in our Nation's history, serving in almost every American war  since 1917. Today, the Big Red One has over 5,000 soldiers deployed  worldwide, with an additional 10,000 in my district at Fort Riley. They  are preparing to deploy in support of ongoing operations.   Since 1917, more than 13,000 soldiers of the 1st Infantry Division  have paid the ultimate sacrifice. We honor those who have worn the  patch of the Big Red One and those that do so today. I cannot be more  proud of our troops at Fort Riley. I am honored to represent them. I  thank them all for their service.                            ____________________
