 Madam Speaker, I have been concerned since the  beginning of this impeachment process that it has been driven by a  predetermined guilty verdict.   It is unfair. It is wrong. And now, every future President, Democrat  or Republican, will have to worry that the impeachment process will be  driven as a blunt-force political instrument.   It has been said that this day is sad. It is not sad; it is  regrettable. But this day will end shortly. The House has had its  cathartic moment. Tomorrow will begin a new day. Let's get back to  work.
