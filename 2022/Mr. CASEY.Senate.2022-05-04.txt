 I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in morning  business.   The ACTING PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I rise this morning to express concern for  the people of Ukraine and the hundreds of millions who are going to bed  hungry across the globe.   Every day since that terrible day, February 24, we have watched in  horror as Vladimir Putin and his army, his forces, killed innocent  Ukrainians, over and over and over again like nothing--nothing--we have  seen since World War II.   Russian forces continue to besiege and shell Ukrainian cities like  Mariupol, where over the last two months, civilians have lived in  bunkers under perpetual fire. These are civilians in those bunkers.   Only yesterday, 130 civilians managed to escape the battered Azovstal  steel plant. Describing the last several months, one evacuee said:         You can't imagine how scary it is when you sit in the       shelter, in a wet and damp basement which is bouncing,       shaking. We were praying to God that missiles fly over our       shelter, because if it hit the shelter, all of us would be       done.    Sadly, 200 more Ukrainian civilians have been unable to evacuate,  even as Russian forces began storming the steel mill just yesterday. So  our prayers are with them and the remaining brave Ukrainian fighters  continuing to hold on to this plant.   But atrocities continue across all of Ukraine. In Donetsk yesterday,  three civilians were killed on their way to collecting water-- collecting water--for their families.   The United States, of course, must continue to help Ukraine fight  against Mr. Putin and his forces. Mr. Putin is the incarnation of evil.  It is as clear as any debate could be.   The good news is, countries all over the world are unified against  him. But we have a long way to go. Now, I and so many others across the  House and the Senate strongly supported the appropriation that Congress  made back in March--$13.6 billion in emergency appropriations to  support Ukraine, and I stand by President Biden's recent $33 billion  request to help Ukraine defend itself over the long term.   Unfortunately, in that first number, the $13.6 billion, the good news  is we had support for that in both parties. But I have to say for the  record: Not enough support on the Republican side. Here in the Senate,  31 Republicans voted against the $13.6 billion. And when you add up the  Senate Republicans voting against the $13.6 billion in the spending  bill and add them to the House Republicans, which is, obviously, a much  bigger number, it is more than 200 Members of the Republican Party in  the U.S. Congress voted against every single penny of the $13.6 billion  for Ukraine.   So I hope--I hope--when it comes to the $33 billion that I hope we  will be able to pass--but I am sure it will be a number at least  comparable to that. But whatever the number is for the people of  Ukraine, I hope that we will get unanimous support in the U.S.  Congress.    I hope we won't see more than 200 Members of Republicans in the  Congress voting against the people of Ukraine. This is not a difficult  choice. You are either on one side or the other.   I said Mr. Putin is the incarnation of evil--he is. The good news is,  we have another choice. The other choice is Mr. Zelenskyy, the people  of Ukraine, and those brave fighters in Ukraine. They are the  personification of all that we claim to stand for when we talk about  democracy.   This isn't a moment to theorize or to talk about democracy in glowing  terms without taking actions. They are doing the fighting on the  battlefield. The least that we can do is vote the right way. That is  the power you have as a Member of Congress. House, Senate, Democrat,  Republican or Independent, you have the power to vote. And I hope that  we will have unanimous support for the $33 billion that the President  has asked for.   Now, what will that funding entail? I won't go through all of it, but  this funding will include $20.4 billion in additional security and  military assistance for Ukraine. It is important to put that into  context, so it is basically 20 of the 33 will be for security and  military assistance. That is on top of what has already been  appropriated just since the battle--the war in Ukraine started when  Russia invaded.   With President Biden's leadership and with a lot of support in the  Congress, we have been able to provide billions of dollars just on the  military and security assistance, not to mention the humanitarian  support, the sanctions, and the unified approach that so many countries  around the world have taken.   But we have a lot more to do, and in my judgment, the $33 billion  won't be enough. We are going to be back at it probably in a few months  providing more. But at a minimum, we have got to get this done for the  people of Ukraine. Part of that appropriation will be the replenishing  of donated NATO weapons and equipment.   This help, in total--all of this security assistance and other  humanitarian support--will be critical to Ukraine's  [[Page S2298]]  ability to prevail--to prevail--over Russian forces through the summer  and the fall. We must continue to provide all of the artillery, the  anti-tank, the anti-air weapons, and air defense systems and other  capabilities that Ukraine can use to block Russian authoritarianism and  support the Ukrainian people. However, regardless of how much support  the United States, NATO, and other allies and partners provide, we must  remember that nothing we do--nothing we do--is comparable to the  awesome sacrifice for freedom and democracy that Ukrainians are now  making every day when they give their lives--they give their lives in  this war--and have their own families shattered in the process.   They are upholding--the people of Ukraine, those brave fighters on  the battlefield every day, every week, every month now, those  Ukrainians are upholding democracy, not just for themselves, not just  for our country, but for the entire free world.   There are, of course, other consequences to this war. The war has  already driven over 13 million Ukrainians from their homes. These  Ukrainians, who are either refugees going to another country or  internally displaced within Ukraine but are outside of their homes,  that number is equal to the entire population--roughly equivalent, 13  million, to the entire population of my home State of Pennsylvania.  Just imagine that, 13 million people being displaced. And,  unfortunately, it doesn't seem like that will be the end.   So I want to commend the European Union and Ukrainian neighbors in  the region for their warm welcome to such an unprecedented refugee flow  from Ukraine. Now, recently, just two weeks ago, traveling through  Italy, Georgia, and France, I saw everyday Italians, Georgians,  Frenchmen and Frenchwomen opening their hearts and their homes to  Ukrainian refugees, not to mention the people of Poland, who have done  so much, and so many others.   Just one example, in Italy, faith-based nonprofits like Sant'Egidio  that we had time to meet with on our trip have led the way in providing  support to those in need.   I also commend the administration's work to support these refugees  across Europe and those remaining in Ukraine, much of that work funded  by part of the $13.6 billion that Congress appropriated in March.    Mr. President, I thank the majority leader.   I will resume my comments about food security.   As I mentioned earlier, across the world now, we not only have 276  million people who now face acute food insecurity--as I said, meaning  that they are in immediate danger of not being able to find their next  meal--but what is ahead is an exacerbation of that problem. Another 47  million people will likely face these same dangers by the end of this  year.   So a food security problem, which was a substantial problem before  the pandemic, made ever worse by the pandemic, has gotten much worse  because of the war in Ukraine--all caused by an attack on a sovereign  country by a brutal dictator, Mr. Putin.   So this is one of the many reasons why this war in Ukraine--or why  all of us, I should say, across the free world have a stake in what  happens in Ukraine.   I wanted to also highlight what the United States is doing in the  midst of this terrible food insecurity crisis.   We can't afford to forget and should not forget about the tens of  millions who are struggling to survive as a result of this invasion. To  feed all of those in need, the World Food Programme, which does such  good work all across the globe--goes into conflict zones to provide  food to people--that program estimates it will take more than $18  billion.   The United States must not share this burden alone, but if we don't  lead the way, no one will. That is true in so many instances. It is  true with regard to the President's leadership against Mr. Putin by  helping the people of Ukraine; it is also true in terms of American  leadership on food security.   President Biden's request for $33 billion for all aspects of the  challenge in Ukraine doesn't include enough, in my judgment. It  includes $1.6 billion for food security and humanitarian assistance.  Now, that sounds like a lot of money, but it is not enough to meet the  moment.   And despite my consistent urging, Congress has appropriated flat  funding for the U.S. food security program, Feed the Future, over the  last 10 years. Adjusting for inflation, the program has been cut by  almost a third of its total programming, from almost $1.5 billion in  today's dollars to just over $1 billion.   So, today, we face the same global food crisis which the Feed the  Future Program was originally created to address after the 2008  recession. So after a recession, we had a global food security  challenge, and now after a pandemic, and exacerbated by the war in  Ukraine, we have potentially an even greater challenge.   So we must again rise to the challenge. When I say ``we,'' I mean the  U.S. Government, the Congress, the branch of our government that  appropriates money, has to rise to the challenge by providing the  resources that are necessary to feed those who face famine--not just  missing a meal here and there, famine itself.   We have got to support these smallholder farmers, who are the  backbone of the world's food supply, and sustainably strengthen food  systems to protect against the next war, the next pandemic, the next  drought, or the next flood.   So that is why I am leading a letter to appropriators urging robust  funding of all--all--global food security accounts in the fiscal year  2023 budget, specifically calling for an almost $200 million increase  just for the Feed the Future Program, not to mention those other global  food security programs and accounts.   This funding will only put a dent in the growing food security  crisis, but it will inspire our allies and our partners to follow us.  America leads the world in so many ways, and, fortunately, most of the  time on food security we have led the world as well.   We need to do that again. We need to lay the groundwork for a more  secure food future and save tens and tens of thousands of lives-- potentially a lot more than that--in the immediate future.
