 Mr. President, I rise to vote against Leonard Grasz's  nomination to serve as a circuit judge for the Eight Circuit. Mr. Grasz  is one of two Trump judicial nominees who has received an  ``unqualified'' ranking from the nonpartisan American Bar Association,  ABA. I am appalled that Republicans advanced this nominee out of the  Judiciary Committee and are bringing this vote to the floor.   Republicans have made it their mission to fill our judiciary with  radical ideologues. The Trump administration has outsourced judicial  nominations to the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation, and  their nominees have included a nominee who believed in corporal  punishment, one who questioned the constitutionality of the 14th  Amendment, and one equated a woman's right to an abortion to chattel  slavery. Many of these nominees are simply unfit to serve and  undeserving of the prestige of receiving a lifetime appointment.   No judge nominated by the Obama administration received an  ``unqualified'' ABA rating. When asked to clarify their rating for Mr.  Grasz, a spokesperson for the ABA said that ``[t]he evaluators and the  Committee found that [Mr. Grasz's] temperament issues, particularly  bias and lack of open-mindedness, were problematic. The evaluators  found that the people interviewed believed that the nominee's bias and  the lens through which he viewed his role as a judge colored his  ability to judge fairly.'' I am disappointed that, instead of insisting  on qualified nominees, my colleagues have decided to instead attack the  ABA's ranking system.   I sincerely hope that many of my colleague across the aisle will vote  no against this nominee and demand more from the Trump administration.    Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the  tremendous service of David Radcliffe, who joined our staff as a  Brookings fellow this year. David's expertise in defense, veterans, and  homeland security issues was invaluable, helping to ensure we met the  needs of Maryland. David came to our office with a wealth of policy  knowledge from his civilian work at the Department of Defense and his  military service as an Army Ranger. He not only adapted quickly to his  work in the Senate, he helped define his role in a new office. His  versatility, kindness, and equanimity endeared him to constituents  across the State. David was unfazed by any change in plans or new last- minute requests, simply responding, ``Semper Gumby''--always be  flexible. His strong principles, willingness to pitch in wherever  needed, and sense of humor made him a great colleague and terrific  staffer in my office. We owe him a debt of gratitude, and we will miss  him greatly. My whole staff and I wish him well as he embarks on his  next journey in service to our country.                            ____________________
