 The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Kansas (Mr. Moran).   Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Moran)  would have voted ``yea.''    Mr. President, I reserve the right to object.   I wonder if the Senator from New Hampshire would allow me to pose a  question about her request?    Is it true that under the so-called Marketplace Certainty  Act, this would appropriate billions of additional dollars to insurance  companies?    Mr. President, I appreciate the response from the Senator  from New Hampshire. I think I want to explore that a little more. I  don't think the cost-sharing subsidies go directly to beneficiaries  but, rather, to insurance companies.   Nevertheless, this is exactly the kind of proposal that the Senate  can vote on next week when we proceed to the healthcare bill. As we  know, unlike traditional legislation, there is an open and unlimited  amendment process, and  [[Page S3976]]  Members on both sides will have a chance to offer amendments and have  the Senate vote on them. So I would encourage all of our colleagues who  have ideas about how to shape the healthcare policy to vote to get on  the bill and then to offer amendments.   It has been 7 years since ObamaCare was passed. It is in meltdown  mode. We are glad to have our colleagues across the aisle offer  suggestions on how to improve the current terrible situation for so  many millions of people, but I must object.
