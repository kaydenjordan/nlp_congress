 Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of a law  enforcement officer from Summerville, South Carolina, who spent his  career ensuring the safety of South Carolina residents and our  neighborhoods.   Doug Wright began his career in 1997 by joining the Summerville  Police Department. He has since dedicated over 20 years of his career  to protecting our community, and I can think of no better thing to do  today than to recognize the good work that our law enforcement does  every single day in our communities and keeping us safe.   Through his career, Doug has worked diligently as a patrol team watch  commander, uniform patrol division commander, and supervisor of the K-9  unit. And I would be remiss if I didn't mention Doug's 6 years as a  Marine reservist.   In April, Chief Wright was promoted to chief of police for  Summerville after serving as deputy. The vote by town council members  was unanimous. This is a glowing endorsement of the work that Doug has  done in his career for Summerville over the last 20 years.  [[Page H3761]]    Most recently, last week I was honored to award Chief Wright with a  commendation from Congress for his work, and I was also able to watch  and witness some of the less-than-lethal work that the Summerville  Police Department is doing with the BolaWrap during that time.   Chief Wright exemplifies service in the Lowcountry in South  Carolina's First Congressional District.                               A Notable Rescue     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize and highlight a  notable rescue that took place off the coast of South Carolina's First  Congressional District.   Many of us in the Lowcountry took for granted tropical storm Elsa  when it hit our shores.   On July 7, as Elsa was beginning to strengthen at the beginning of  this season's hurricane season, a family of six was visiting the  Lowcountry from West Virginia. They were caught in 6-foot waves north  of St. Helena.   That afternoon, the family had sailed their 21-foot Carolina skiff to  tiny Otter Island from Edisto Beach.   As the weather worsened and the wind picked up, the boat drifted off  the island into stormy waters.   Unfortunately, there was no SOS system available to the family, and  the father actually decided to jump in the water and swim out for help  after spotting a shrimp boat. The emergency was radioed in, and Skipper  Clay Emminger of Beaufort Water Search and Rescue answered the call of  duty.   Ultimately, the Coast Guard was able to reach the family, despite  deteriorating visibility, and a woman and four female children were  hoisted to safety in a Dolphin helicopter.   I am pleased this family was rescued, and I wish to extend my  sincerest thanks to the U.S. Coast Guard, the Beaufort County Sheriff's  Office Marine Unit, and South Carolina's Department of Natural  Resource.                                time  1015                          Recognizing Gregg Russell     Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight the efforts and  talents of Hilton Head's very own folk musician and, indeed, a South  Carolina legend by the name of Gregg Russell.   For 40 years, Gregg has highlighted and delighted families around the  Old Liberty Tree at Harbor Town in Hilton Head Island.   While these days Gregg is singing songs for families and children, he  shared the stage with many celebrities over the years. He even wrote  the hit song, ``Come Away Home'' about Hilton Head Island, which  inspired the movie of the same name.   His performances are renowned to locals and tourists alike who visit  Hilton Head Island, and he has received a nomination for an Angel Award  and won Best Children's Live Action Video in 2000.   Gregg doesn't just contribute with his music to our community,  through his charity, Hilton Head Heroes, Gregg and his wife, Wendy,  provide needy and sick children every year with a vacation to Hilton  Head Island as well.   On Gregg's 40th year anniversary--and it actually might be a few more  than that--I am happy to draw attention to his career here on the House  floor and thank him for everything he has done for the Hilton Head  Island community.                            ____________________
