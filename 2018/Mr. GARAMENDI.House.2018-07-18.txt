 Mr. Speaker, well, the latest tweets from the  President:   ``So many people at the higher ends of intelligence loved my press  conference performance in Helsinki.''   Obviously, he is referring to Putin, because there are not many  people in the United States who saw that press conference as a success.  In fact, it was an unmitigated disaster.   Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats said, ``The red lights  are blinking.'' Our election process, our critical infrastructure, is  being attacked by Russia, and what is the House of Representatives  doing today? Eliminating funding to protect our election process.   Obviously, those who vote for this reduction in funding are not at  the higher levels of intelligence.                            ____________________
