 Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for shepherding this  important resolution to the floor.   Today, Yemen is the worst humanitarian crisis on the planet. Eighty- five thousand children under the age of 5 have died of starvation since  2015, and 150 children die every single day.   The U.S., alongside Saudi Arabia, which has used starvation as a  weapon of war, has supported targeting for deadly airstrikes, provided  logistical support and refueling, and sent Special Operations Forces to  the Yemeni border.   It is time for these activities to end, absent congressional consent.  The American people deserve a transparent debate and a vote by  Congress, per Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, before the U.S.  engages in war-making.   While the President is tweeting about wars and nuclear bombs, we must  reassert our authority and end the unconstitutional U.S. participation  in Yemen's civil war.   Mr. Chairman, I urge all my colleagues to vote in favor of this  resolution.
