 Mr. President, today, I am honored to recognize  in the Record Mr. Robert M. Williams, Jr., who recently retired after  almost half a century as editor and publisher of the Blackshear Times  in Blackshear, GA.   While he may be a small-town newspaperman, Robert Williams is known  throughout south Georgia and across much of our State because of his  work ethic, his devotion to the printed word, and his dedication to the  newspaper business and what it means to a community. For more than 48  years, Robert has worked to be accurate, fair, and to provide his  readers with the news that affects them and the community they all  cherish. He has personally written more than 2,000 columns during his  career.   It is worth mentioning that the newspaper's motto, printed at the top  of the front page of the printed publication and online, is one Robert  has also claimed as his own: ``Liked by Many, Cussed by Some, Read by  Them All.'' With the weekly newspaper also turning 150 years this year  under Robert's leadership, both have long been widely read.   At Just 20 years old, Robert began his career at the Blackshear Times  after coming down to the community from the University of Georgia in  Athens, GA. He was brought in by two legendary Georgians themselves,  Roy Chalker, Sr., and Wilkes Williams of Waynesboro, to turn their  investment around. Turn it around he did, settling well into the  community at the same time. A short 5 years later, Robert purchased the  Blackshear Times. Under Robert's leadership during the last 48 years,  the newspaper has won hundreds of awards in a variety of categories.   Robert and his wife Cheryl have both loyally and successfully served  not only this publication, but the newspaper industry as a whole. The  Blackshear Times is one of five newspapers that Robert and Cheryl have  owned as part of their SouthFire Newspapers organization, which also  includes the Alma Times, the Charlton County Herald, the Telfair  Enterprise, and the Monroe County Reporter in Georgia. Robert and  Cheryl have both served as president of the Georgia Press Association,  our State's newspaper industry advocacy organization. Robert was also  president of the 2,300-member National Newspaper Association in 2014,  serving nationally as the voice of small-town newspapers.   Locally, Robert Williams served two terms on the Blackshear City  Council and served as executive director of both the Pierce County  Industrial Development Authority and the Pierce County Chamber of  Commerce. Robert is also a graduate of the Leadership Georgia program,  an organization we both hold dear and that has guided our service to  the State. Robert has found countless ways to give back. Whether it was  as a member of the Georgia Agriculture Exposition Authority that  governs the Georgia National Fairgrounds in Perry or the local college  foundation board, Robert and Cheryl have made an impact well beyond  Blackshear both professionally and personally.   Last week, Robert announced the sale of the Blackshear Times, bidding  farewell after one of the longest editorial tenures in Georgia. With  his final column as editor and publisher, Robert was incredibly  gracious, thanking his colleagues, employees, mentors, and the fine  bankers who gave him those first loans.   I speak for all Georgians when I say thank you to Robert and Cheryl  for the difference you have made in our State. I count myself lucky to  call you a friend, and Dianne and I wish you both the very best as you  plan your future.                            ____________________
