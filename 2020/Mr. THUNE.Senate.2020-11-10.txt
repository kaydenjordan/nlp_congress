 The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from Tennessee (Mr. Alexander), the Senator from Missouri (Mr. Hawley),  the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Moran), and the Senator from Alaska (Mr.  Sullivan), and the Senator from Indiana (Mr. Young).   Further, if present and voting the Senator from Tennessee (Mr.  Alexander) would have voted ``yea.''    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, before I begin, I want to acknowledge the  tremendous news released yesterday that early results of a COVID  vaccine are showing a greater than 90 percent rate of effectiveness.  This is great news and a testament to the innovative power of the  private sector and the efforts of Congress and the Trump administration  to expedite the development of COVID vaccines.   The trial for this vaccine will continue, and FDA approval will be  required, but these early results are very, very encouraging. It has  been a tough year for Americans and people all over the world, but  hopefully this is a sign that the light at the end of the tunnel is  coming.                            ____________________     Madam President, we are now a week on from the election,  but there are still a lot of outstanding races to determine. Votes are  still being counted or will soon be recounted in many States. The  Presidential race has yet to be certified, and it is important to  remember that while media outlets can predict a winner, official  results do come later, and there are still House and Senate races that  have yet to be decided.   One thing is clear, though: The blue wave that Democrat pollsters and  the media predicted was coming did not arrive. Americans emphatically  did not endorse the socialist aims of the far left. Instead, they sent  a much more moderate message. And I hope that when all the votes are  counted and the outcomes of all the races are determined, Democrats  will be able to overcome the virulent partisanship that has  characterized their behavior over the past 4 years and work with  Republicans to deliver results for the American people                            ____________________     Madam President, tomorrow we celebrate Veterans Day, the  day set aside to honor all those who have served in the U.S. Armed  Forces.   This year, we observed the 75th anniversary of the end of World War  II, and our Nation's World War II veterans, the veterans of the  ``greatest generation,'' have been on my mind a lot.   Sixteen million Americans served in World War II--16 million. These  veterans were a fixture in our lives. So many Americans grew up with a  dad or a grandfather or a grandmother who had served in World War II. I  was one of them.   My favorite veteran, my dad, was a World War II pilot who flew  Hellcats off the deck of the USS Intrepid in the Pacific. I came to  know the values of the ``greatest generation'' through my dad-- humility, patriotism, quiet service.   These warriors who helped save the world didn't brag about their  achievements. They deflected praise. If they hailed any exploits, it  was those of their comrades. My dad won the Distinguished Flying  Cross--or, I should say, received the Distinguished Flying Cross, but  that is not what he talked about. He did, however, talk about Cecil  Harris, one of South Dakota's aces, whose advice for a deft maneuver  saved my dad's life during a dogfight. It was a move straight out of  ``Top Gun,'' only decades before the movie.   My dad always talked about how South Dakota is the only State with  two aces with more than 20 shootdowns during World War II. And he  talked about the other pilots in his squadron and praised their  character and their service.   As I said, these veterans of the ``greatest generation'' have been a  fixture in our lives for a long time. But 75 years on from the war,  their numbers are dwindling and dwindling quickly.   My dad died in August of this year at the age of 100. We lose more  and more of these veterans every day, and they will be sorely missed,  but their legacy lives on in the generations of veterans that have  followed them.   In every age and every era, men and women have stepped forward to  answer the same call that the ``greatest generation'' answered. And in  every era, those men and women, the men and women of the U.S. military,  have embodied the values that characterized men like my dad--humility,  courage, love of country, self-sacrifice, a love of freedom and for  their fellow man.   Service in the military was once commonplace. But in an age when only  a small percentage of the population serves, we need to ensure that we  don't forget the vital role of our Armed Forces and the price our men  and women in uniform pay to ensure that all of us can live in freedom.  It has been said 10,000 times--but it is no less true the ten  thousandth and first time--that we live in freedom every day because of  the men and women of the U.S. military. We owe them a debt we cannot  hope to repay. But on Veterans Day and every day, we can remember to  say thank you.   I cannot close without mentioning the men and women I have met who  have served and are serving--in particular, the members of the South  Dakota National Guard and the airmen at Ellsworth Air Force Base in  South Dakota.   Right now, members of the South Dakota National Guard are deployed in  support of Combined Joint Task Force--Horn of Africa. The South Dakota  Guard also recently served a rotation of deployments to Europe in  support of Operation Atlantic Resolve and to the Middle East to support  coalition forces. Like many of their counterparts across the country,  they have also been a part of the domestic coronavirus response.   At Ellsworth, the B-1 bombers of the 28th Bomb Wing continue to  demonstrate their flexible, global reach through Bomber Task Force  deployments. The Bomber Task Force missions strengthen our continued  coordination with NATO allies in Europe and assert America's commitment  to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific.   From the Baltics to the South China Sea to the Middle East, the  airmen at Ellsworth Air Force Base continue to  [[Page S6631]]  answer our Nation's call and remain ready to respond to threats  anywhere in the world at a moment's notice.   As I said, we owe our men and women in uniform a debt we cannot hope  to repay, but we can resolve to live our lives in such a way as to be  worthy of their sacrifices. Today and every day, may we remember the  gratitude that we owe our military men and women and imitate their love  of freedom and their devotion to our country.   I yield the floor.
