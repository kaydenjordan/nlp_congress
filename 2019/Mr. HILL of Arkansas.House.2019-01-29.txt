 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to bring attention  to Majd Kamalmaz, an American being held by Syria's dictator, Bashar  al-Assad.   In February 2017, Majd was detained by Syrian police while visiting  the country for the funeral of his father-in-law.   When I spoke to Majd's children, last week, they told me they had  tried to convince him not to go to Syria, but their father always put  others ahead of himself.   Majd's personal motto is ``be in peace,'' and that motto has been on  display throughout his life, in his work around the world, in places  like Kosovo, Indonesia, Lebanon, and here at home after Katrina.   Majd's children have not seen or heard from their father for nearly 2  years. Madam Speaker, I echo their plea and call on President Trump to  do what he can to ensure that their father is safely returned to his  homeland in America.                            ____________________
