 Mr. Speaker, what Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic  Jihad are doing to Israel is nothing short of evil and barbaric. Even  worse, some of my colleagues across the aisle and in the national media  are excusing this violence against our closest ally in the Middle East.   It is a fact that Hamas and the PIJ, if they were to lay down their  weapons, there would be peace. But if the Israelis laid down theirs,  they would be exterminated. This is no secret because these two  terrorist groups explicitly say their goal is to wipe Israel off the  face of the map, and their actions back up their words, Mr. Speaker.   I think a history lesson and global current affairs update is in  order for Members of Congress and media organizations taking the side  of terrorists intent on exterminating Israel and the entire Jewish  population.   For starters, nobody should forget that, in 1997, it was President  Bill Clinton's State Department that placed Hamas and the PIJ on the  United States' list of foreign terrorist organizations. Both groups are  still on the list today and for good reason.   Israel removed their forces from the Gaza Strip in 2005, but in 2007,  Hamas violently forced out Fatah, its rival Palestinian faction, and  consolidated its control over the entire Gaza Strip. A terrorist  organization controlling territory within mere miles of Jewish  communities leaves Israeli civilians vulnerable to violent attacks, Mr.  Speaker.   Israel's military blockade protects its rightful homeland from  infiltration by radical jihadi terrorists. The blockade is important  for preventing the transfer of weapons from Iran's Revolutionary Guard,  which gives support to Hamas and PIJ. God only knows the devastation  recent missile attacks would have inflicted if the Iranians were able  to smuggle guided missiles into the Gaza Strip.   Despite the blockade, Hamas and PIJ still construct their terror  tunnels and manufacture their rockets with dual-use materials like  concrete, steel, chemicals, fuel, explosives, and many other things.  These materials, which the Israelis allow to pass through their  blockade, are meant for infrastructure in Gaza, only to wind up  confiscated by the terrorists for their horrific attacks, Mr. Speaker.   If anybody questions the existence of the tunnels or their use, I  recommend they go on the next codel to Israel to  [[Page H2430]]  see for themselves. I have been there and stood in them. They are, in  fact, 100 percent real.   This is a dilemma for Israel. They want to improve civilian life in  Gaza by letting these important materials pass through its blockade,  but they also know their enemies will steal these materials and try to  harm Israelis.   The violence that began last week came as a result of protests  regarding an ongoing Israeli court order to evict Palestinian families  from the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood of Jerusalem. Palestinian Authority  President Mahmoud Abbas, who is serving his 16th year of what is  supposed to be a 4-year term, Mr. Speaker, called for unrest in the  streets. Not to be outdone, Hamas and the PIJ recognized a political  opportunity to assume the mantel as protectors of all Palestinian  people.                                time  1045    These terrorist groups responded by gutlessly and indiscriminately  firing over 3,000 missiles since last Monday at hospitals, schools, and  other civilian population centers across central and southern Israel.   Thankfully, the United States provides Israel with generous military  assistance for the Iron Dome and other missile defenses. This system  has intercepted 90 percent of the missiles. However, there have been 10  Israelis killed, including two children.   Israel has the right to defend itself from unprovoked terrorist  attacks from Hamas, PIJ, and anybody else. The Israelis responded  forcefully, actively trying to limit civilian casualties by calling  residents in targeted buildings and deploying ``knock on the roof''  warnings. This is a courtesy that terror groups like Hamas and PIJ do  not and will never return.   Without these important measures, Mr. Speaker, hundreds more  Palestinian civilians would be dead because Hamas and PIJ use  commercial and residential buildings to house their military operations  and ammunition depots. This disgusting tactic is the reason why the  Palestinian death toll is higher and why the lives of dozens of  innocent Palestinian children have been lost.   These terror groups are more than willing to use their own people as  human shields for the sake of vilifying Israel. Unfortunately, the most  radical Members of Congress and the American mainstream media have  bought this narrative hook, line, and sinker, Mr. Speaker.   Hamas and the PIJ are no friends of ours and want the same fate for  Israel that so many terrorists want for the United States: the complete  and total destruction of democracy.   If you are going to blame Israel alone for the recent violence, you  are being nothing more than a useful idiot and a publicity tool for the  two terrorist organizations.                            ____________________
