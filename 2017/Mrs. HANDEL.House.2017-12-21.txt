 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 1766) to reauthorize the SAFER Act of 2013, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 1766         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Sexual Assault Forensic       Evidence Reporting Act of 2017'' or the ``SAFER Act of       2017''.       SEC. 2. PEDIATRIC SEXUAL ASSAULT NURSE EXAMINERS.

SEC. 3. REDUCING THE RAPE KIT BACKLOG.         (a) Reauthorization.--Section 2(c)(4) of the DNA Analysis       Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 (34 U.S.C. 40701(c)(4)) is       amended by striking ``2017'' and inserting ``2022''.        (b) Sunset.--Section 1006 of the SAFER Act of 2013 (34       U.S.C. 40701 note) is amended by striking ``2018'' and       inserting ``2023''.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from  Georgia (Mrs. Handel) and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee)  each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Georgia.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on S. 1766, currently under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from Georgia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on S. 1766, currently under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from Georgia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   S. 1766, the Sexual Assault Forensic Evidence Reporting Act of 2017,  also known as the SAFER Act, will strengthen State and local law  enforcement's ability to reduce the number of untested rape kits and  help take more offenders off our streets.   Congress provides significant resources annually to the Department of  Justice to help reduce backlogs of untested forensic evidence. This  legislation will reauthorize the Attorney General's authority to  allocate 5 to 7 percent of funds made available to carry out the Debbie  Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program to help communities audit their  backlogs, which is an important first step in any effort to eliminate a  backlog.   Despite the cases analyzed and improvements made with our Federal  resources, backlogs persist due to the ever-increasing demand for  evidence testing. According to the National Institute of Justice, as  the value of DNA evidence is increasingly recognized, more evidence  gets collected and submitted to laboratories for analysis.   Delays in analysis of forensic evidence often result in delays of  justice: serial offenders can continue victimizing, and innocent  individuals may be incarcerated. The SAFER Act helps address this  common impediment to the response to rape and sexual assault at the  State, local, and Tribal levels.   Importantly, the SAFER Act also would clarify that pediatric forensic  nurses are eligible for training and employment grants. This provision  underscores the critical role that pediatric sexual assault nurse  examiners can play in a community's response to children who are  victims of abuse.   S. 1766 can help ensure that resources provided for DNA analysis are  focused on grant recipients making a good faith effort to estimate and  manage their backlog of untested samples and improve efforts to get sex  offenders off of our streets.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important measure,  and I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 1766, the Sexual Assault  Forensic Evidence Reporting Act of 2017. This bipartisan legislation  passed the Senate on October 23, 2017.   I am glad that this House is moving this legislation, because it is  about children. It is about the scourge that children, women, and  others find themselves victims of--sexual assault.   S. 1766 will reauthorize the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of  2000 through the year 2022, by amending the language in section 2(c)(4)  of 34 U.S.C. 40701(c)(4).   Furthermore, this legislation also amends other sections of the DNA  Sexual Assault Justice Act of 2004 by ensuring that role of forensic  nurses pertains to both adult and pediatric care.   The SAFER Act also amends this statute by making a provision after  ``elder abuse'' for the need of nurse examiners, particularly where  there is the need for pediatric sexual assault nurse examiners,  including such nurse examiners working in the multidisciplinary  setting, in responding to abuse of both children and adolescents.   Finally, this legislation will sunset through 2023 by amending the  SAFER Act. The SAFER Act is a critical program, administered by the  U.S. Department of Justice, that allows:   Local law enforcement programs to obtain funding for programs to  reduce the rape kit backlog in communities across the country;   Victims of sexual assault get justice more quickly than in the past;   Thirty-five percent of funds available under the Debbie Smith Act for  grants to local law enforcement agencies to focus more resources on  rape kit testing;   Five to seven percent of the Debbie Smith Act funding to be used by  local jurisdictions to conduct 1-year audits of untested sexual assault  evidence to identify serious areas of backlog; and  [[Page H10363]]    Forensic testing to be done by both pediatric and adult sexual  assault nurse examiners.   This is a very important measure that will address the large volume  of cases that fester due to the excessive backlog in our processing of  rape kits.   According to the National Institute of Justice, a multidisciplinary,  victim-centered approach and standardized, efficient evidence  processing in sexual assault cases are the focus of its new report.   The report, ``National Best Practices for Sexual Assault Kits,''  outlines 35 suggestions for laboratories and law enforcement to improve  their sexual assault investigations, tackling issues such as evidence  collection, storage, and maintenance; backlog tracking and processing;  victim advocacy and notification; and sensitivity to trauma in sexual  assault victims.   A working group--consisting of victims and victim advocates, sexual  assault nurse examiners and medical examiners, forensic laboratories,  law enforcement agencies, prosecutors, and members of the judiciary-- developed the suggestions over a 2-year period following the Sexual  Assault Forensic Evidence Reporting Act of 2013, the SAFER Act, a  component of the Violence Against Women Act. We will soon reauthorize  the Violence Against Women Act, and we will be happy to have this  expansion included in this.   A victim-centered approach is the focus on the needs and the concerns  of a victim to ensure the passionate and sensitive delivery of services  in a nonjudgmental manner. A trauma-informed approach considers the  impact of trauma and victim safety considerations.    Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Texas, Congressman Poe, and my  colleague from New York, Congresswoman Carolyn B. Maloney, have worked  on a number of these issues, and also Senator Cornyn, because this is a  very important step. I remember the days, in our respective  jurisdictions, that we had a mounting backlog of rape kits. Do you know  what that means, Mr. Speaker? Women and children do not get either  their day in court or do not get justice.   Mr. Speaker, I believe that this is a timely and very important  legislative initiative.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support the legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Poe), my colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Poe), my colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, let me start by recognizing the tremendous leadership of  my colleague, Representative Ted Poe from Texas. I thank him for giving  me the honor of being his wing woman in presenting this important piece  of legislation today.   And, indeed, the SAFER Act is an important piece of legislation to  reinforce the efforts of our local and State law enforcement in their  work to reduce the number of untested rape kits and help take these  sexual assault predators off the streets.   At the same time, this legislation underscores the critical role that  the pediatric sexual assault examiners play in this process and makes  them eligible for key training.   So, again, I ask my colleagues to pass this bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.                                time  1445    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. Handel) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, S. 1766.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.   The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn.                            ____________________
