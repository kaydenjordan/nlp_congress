 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hoeven). Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Mr. President, it is no surprise that the economy  continues to be one of the top issues on the minds of Americans. The 8  years of the Obama administration were characterized by weak economic  growth, a dearth of jobs and opportunities, and almost nonexistent wage  growth. The Obama administration ushered in long-term economic  stagnation.   The Congressional Budget Office predicts that the economy will grow  at a rate of just 1.9 percent over the next 30 years--a full percentage  point lower than the average growth rate over the past 50 years. We  cannot resign ourselves to that. Resigning ourselves to long-term  growth of 1.9 percent would mean resigning ourselves to decades of  fewer jobs and opportunities, low wage growth, and a reduced standard  of living. Fortunately, there are a lot of things we can do to get our  economy thriving again and to spur economic growth.   A recent report from the Economic Innovation Group identified one  important problem with our economy today, and that is a lack of what  the EIG calls economic dynamism. Economic dynamism, as the Economic  Innovation Group defines it, refers to the rate at which new businesses  are born and die.   In a dynamic economy, the rate of new business creation is high and  significantly outstrips the rate of business death, but that has not  been the case in the United States lately. New business creation has  significantly dropped over the past several years. Between 2009 and  2011, business death outstripped business birth, and while the numbers  have since improved slightly, the recovery has been poor and far from  historical norms.   The Economic Innovation Group notes that in 2012--which, by the way,  was the economy's best year for business creation since the recession-- it still ``fell far short of its worst year prior to 2008.'' This is  deeply concerning because new businesses have historically been  responsible for a substantial part of the job creation in this country,  not to mention a key source of innovation. When new businesses are not  being created at a strong rate, workers face a whole host of problems.  ``A less dynamic economy,'' the Economic Innovation Group notes, ``is  one likely to feature fewer jobs, lower labor force participation,  slack wage growth, and rising inequality--exactly what we see today.''   Restoring economic dynamism would go a long way toward boosting  economic growth and providing new jobs and opportunities for American  workers. One big thing we can do to achieve this is to relieve the  burden of excessive government regulations. Obviously, some government  regulations are important and necessary, but too many others are  unnecessary and do nothing but load businesses with compliance costs  and paperwork hours. The more resources businesses spend on complying  with regulations, the less they have available for growth and  innovation. Excessive regulations also prevent many new businesses from  ever getting off the ground. Small startups simply do not have the  resources to hire individuals--let alone consultants and lawyers--to do  the costly work of complying with scores of government regulations.   Unfortunately, over the past 8 years, the Obama administration spent  a lot of time on imposing burdensome and unnecessary regulations on  American businesses. According to the American Action Forum, the Obama  administration was responsible for implementing more than 675 major  regulations that cost the economy more than $800 billion. Given those  numbers, it is no surprise that the Obama economy left businesses with  few resources to dedicate to growing and creating jobs or that new  business creation seriously dropped off during the Obama  administration.   Since the new Congress began in January, Republicans in Congress and  the President have been focused on repealing burdensome Obama-era  regulations. So far, we have saved individuals and businesses  approximately $67 billion and freed them from 56 million hours of  paperwork. Eliminating burdensome regulations will continue to be a  priority for both Republicans in Congress and for the White House.   In addition to removing burdensome regulations, we need to focus on  reforming our Tax Code. Our current Tax Code is strangling businesses,  both large and small. Some corporations escape with paying very little  in taxes, but others end up paying the highest corporate tax rate in  the developed world. Meanwhile, small businesses and family farms face  high tax rates, at times exceeding those paid by large corporations.   Tax reform needs to address these obstacles to growth. We need to  trim our excessive corporate tax rate to make U.S. businesses  competitive in the global economy, and we need to reduce taxes for  small businesses so that we do not choke off these sources of growth  and innovation. Measures like allowing new businesses to deduct their  startup costs and expense more of their investments in machinery and  equipment would spur new business creation and help small businesses  thrive.   Our goal is to take up tax reform this year, and I am looking forward  to that debate. Reforming our Tax Code will go a long way toward  restoring dynamism to our economy and encouraging growth, job creation,  and better wages.   There are other growth-boosting measures we can take as well, like  removing unnecessary barriers that restrict access to capital. Both new  and existing businesses rely on capital to help them innovate and  expand.   The last 8 years were discouraging years for American workers, but  the stagnation of the Obama years does not have to be the new normal.  American workers and job creators are as dynamic and creative as ever;  we just need to clear the obstacles from their paths. I look forward to  working with my colleagues this year as we make putting our economy on  the path to long-term health and vitality a top priority for the U.S.  Senate.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.  [[Page S2511]]        Mr. McCONNELL.
