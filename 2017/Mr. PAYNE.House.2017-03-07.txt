 Mr. Speaker, it took 7 years, but it is finally here: the  House Republican plan to make America sick again.   Under this plan, millions of Americans will lose their health  insurance, and millions of other families will pay more for worse  coverage. At the same time, the Republicans' bill rolls back Medicaid  expansion and allows insurers to charge older enrollees more.   We always knew that the House Republican plan would harm the most  vulnerable Americans, but we still do not know how much this bill will  cost and how many Americans it will cover.   Now, House Republicans prefer it this way. They know that their bill  will cover far fewer people than the Affordable Care Act does. They  want to hide this fact from the American people and rush this bill  through committee.   Mr. Speaker, this is an obvious and embarrassing display of cowardice  from the House Republicans. The American people deserve to know the  consequences of this bill just as they deserve quality and affordable  access to health care. With the Republican plan, it looks like the  American people will get neither.                            ____________________
