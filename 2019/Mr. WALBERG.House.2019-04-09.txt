 Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1644. I  believe, if we use words appropriately, that should be named the  ``Regain Big Government Control of the Internet Act.''   Thankfully, after 2015, we only had a short time of what was so- called net neutrality, which are words that sound good but aren't true.  It was Big Government takeover of net neutrality, and this bill opens  the door to disastrous effects like that on getting broadband into  rural America, where I live.   I still don't have broadband. In 2015, under the so-called net  neutrality, we saw that broadband build-out stop. I am still looking  forward to it someday. So this bill would take us backwards, not  forwards.   It is clear that the bill also could have several unintended  consequences which are completely at odds with the authors' intended  outcomes.   Instead of doubling down on the light-touch framework which has  resulted in the widespread success of the internet, Mr. Chair, my  colleagues seem more interested in imposing more and bigger government  regulation.   The bill only forbears from what the FCC claims it forbore from, not  what it can forbear from through the backdoor of sections 201 and 202.   Instead of letting the markets work under a framework which still  robustly protects consumers, this bill would inject even more  uncertainty into the market. It seems that, instead of locking in  protections for consumers, the only thing it is really locking in is  more partisanship.   I urge my colleagues to work with Republicans on bipartisan  legislation that protects consumers and promotes broadband deployment  in rural America, the place I live and the place I lack broadband now  and, with the continued effort to have Big Government control, I  probably will still lack.   It is time to change that, and I encourage my colleagues to oppose  H.R. 1644, the ``Regain Big Government Control of the Internet Act.''
