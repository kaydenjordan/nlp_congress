 Mr. Speaker, I stand with my colleagues today  shocked and dismayed by the actions of this administration.   For the past few years, the Oversight and Reform Committee has worked  in a bipartisan fashion to modernize the Postal Service with former  Representative Mark Meadows leading the charge.   Now, like too many things over the past 3\1/2\ years, mail has become  a partisan issue. The Postal Service is a pillar of our democracy. It  is essential for providing critical services such as: lifesaving  prescriptions, Social Security  [[Page H4278]]  benefits, paychecks, tax returns, letters home from military families,  and absentee ballots to millions of Americans.   The VA delivers prescriptions to 80 percent of our veterans via the  mail. This intentional and ridiculous slowdown means vets are skipping  doses while checking empty mailboxes.   While I was back home, one of my businesses told me they hadn't  received mail for 10 days. Another person told me they received mail  every other day.   This cannot go on, and we cannot trust the word of a Postmaster  General who is unqualified and whose sweeping operational changes  degrade the Postal Service, delay the mail, and threaten our upcoming  election. We must pass the Delivering for America Act so we can return  the United States post office to normal and ensure we have a safe  election where everyone is counted.
