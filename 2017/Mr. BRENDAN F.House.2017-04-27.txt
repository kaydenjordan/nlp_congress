 BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)    BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, President Trump  campaigned throughout this country, including my home State of  Pennsylvania, as a great populist, as a champion of the working class.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank President Trump and his administration  for revealing their true intentions yesterday when they revealed their  Wall Street written and designed tax plan--a giveaway for millionaires  and billionaires. And not one thing--not one--for 99.9 percent of the  working American people.   Mr. Speaker, we do need tax reform, and you would see broad  bipartisan support for that. But it has to be real. It has to be paid  for. And it must include relief for those three-quarters of the  American people who pay more in payroll taxes than they ever do in  individual income taxes.   Enough of focusing on Wall Street and the corporate income tax rate,  and let's start focusing on Main Street and American workers.                            ____________________
