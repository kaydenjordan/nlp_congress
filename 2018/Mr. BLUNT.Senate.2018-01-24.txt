 Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator Barrasso and  Senator Carper for their bipartisan work to get this nomination to the  floor.   I have known R.D. James for a long time. He understands the projects  involved, the work involved, and the challenges involved. He is a civil  engineer and brings a lot of experience to this job.   The work of Senator Carper and Senator Barrasso is deeply  appreciated. I think it will be appreciated by the Corps and the  Department of Defense.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.
