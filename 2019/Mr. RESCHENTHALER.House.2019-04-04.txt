 Madam Speaker, this week, as the humanitarian and  security crisis at our southern border worsens, my colleagues across  the aisle have failed to act. Instead, House Democrats chose to focus  on issuing illegal subpoenas for the Mueller report, including its  underlying evidence, investigative sources, and grand jury materials.  House Democrats are effectively demanding that Attorney General Barr  break the law.   For nearly 2 years, Democrats misled the American people about the  special counsel's investigation. Now that it is clear that there was  absolutely no collusion with Russia, my colleagues across the aisle are  grasping at straws and completely ignoring the crisis at our southern  border.   Daily border crossings at our southern border have hit levels that we  have not seen in decades. Adding to the complexity and gravity of this  crisis is the dramatic increase in the number of unaccompanied children  and family units.   Customs and Border Protection apprehended more than 100,000 family  unit aliens in 2018. That is up 600 percent since 2013. The  overwhelming surge of migrants has stretched our facilities to a  breaking point.   Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues across the aisle end the  partisan showmanship and work with us to address this crisis.                            ____________________
