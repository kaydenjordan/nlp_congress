 Madam President, first of all, thank you for your  flexibility at the chair today.                                Appropriations    Madam President, the purpose for rising today is to advocate on  behalf of our military, the men and women who are the bravest in the  world. I feel compelled to do so because I can imagine that in these  days of hyperpartisan politics, some of them may feel like some of us  are abandoning them, and I want them to know for sure that we are not.   We all took an oath to the Constitution, and the highest priority in  the Constitution for the Federal Government is, of course, to provide  for the Nation's defense against all enemies, foreign and domestic.   Unfortunately, my Democratic colleagues seem to be shirking from this  responsibility lately. They are willing to settle for, seemingly,  mediocrity, and right now we have excellence, the best. First of all,  they are planning to come to this Chamber tomorrow to block the all- important Defense appropriations bill; that is to say, to block the  funding for our military; that is to say, to block the largest pay  increase for the men and women of our military in over a decade--just  to name one topic that is being funded, or would be funded, by this  appropriations bill that they are going to block.   Back in July, the House and Senate, on a bipartisan basis--I say to  the Presiding Officer, you just gave a wonderful speech about the  importance of working together. On a bipartisan basis, we passed a  major budget bill. It was a win for our military and a win for our  country because it was supposed to provide them with certainty and an  important path forward as they chart that path--that strategic path-- for America's superiority.   To echo the House Speaker and the Democratic leader at the time: ``A  bipartisan agreement has been reached that will enhance our national  security.'' These aren't my words--although I agree with them--these  are the words of the Democratic leadership of Congress.   After passage, the Democratic leader went on to say: This deal would  ``strengthen our national security and provide our troops with the  resources they need.'' I agree with the Democratic leader. Please-- please--change course while you still can and support this important  funding bill tomorrow.   I agreed with my colleague from New York then, and I supported that  legislation for the exact reason to ``strengthen our national security  and provide our troops with the resources they need.''   This deal passed with strong bipartisan support. It was widely  applauded.  [[Page S6288]]  Yet here we are today, this week, with our colleagues preparing to  block the funding for our troops for which they were just a couple of  months ago patting themselves on the back.   This whole process shouldn't even be this complicated. In fact, I am  convinced that the American people are tired of us complicating simple  things. We agreed to this 2-year budget agreement just a few months  ago. I voted for it. Party leadership pushed for it. The President  signed it. Then we voted for a short-term continuing resolution to get  in order before getting to the final appropriations deal.   I reluctantly voted for the short-term CR, but the only thing worse  than a CR, of course, is a government shutdown. So that was what we  were confronted with.   If one asked the military community how they feel about continuing  resolutions, they would be quick to tell you they don't work. They  don't work at all. They do not provide certainty beyond certainty. They  don't allow new programs to be launched. They don't allow the pay  increases that our appropriations bill does. So evidently it has not  been a priority for our Democratic colleagues, but they do have  priorities, as we know.   This impeachment craziness, this obsession with eliminating, getting  rid of our Commander in Chief a year before the election of the  Commander in Chief is what their priorities are, clearly, not the  priorities stated in the Constitution or that they were bragging about  a couple of months ago.   Of course, in addition, they are now standing in the way of us  passing the reconciled National Defense Authorization Act--the  authorization that provides the guidance for these priorities that are  also part of our appropriations bill.   We went through all of that, and for what? I didn't agree to the  deals we made or take these tough votes just so the Democrats could  block Defense appropriations and leave our military stuck with  political gridlock that they have imposed on us now.   By failing to pass this appropriations bill, by standing in the way  now of reconciling in the conference committee the National Defense  Authorization Act, they really are standing in the way of our military.  Now there is talk of a ``skinny NDAA''--that is to say, a watered-down  skinny version.   For 58 years in a row, we have done what you just talked about and  what the previous speakers talked about. We have worked in a bipartisan  way to pass an NDAA 58 years in a row.   As the first North Dakotan ever to sit on the Senate Armed Services  Committee, I treated this NDAA with the utmost importance and still do.  We made some significant progress, from nuclear deterrence to UAS  development, establishing a Space Force, and honoring the sailors of  the USS Frank E. Evans--a provision the Democratic leader and his  colleague from New York supported, I will add. Both the House and  Senate versions of the NDAA advanced important policies for my State,  for our country, and really for the world.   We should be working collaboratively to combine these versions and  pass the best plan possible for our military. Instead, our work is  being sacrificed at the altar of partisan politics, caught up in a  partisan impeachment process that makes no sense.   Let's make something clear about this skinny NDAA.   Our chairman is not introducing it with haste or without great  consideration. He first warned that this could happen well over a month  ago. He said it would happen if our Democratic colleagues proved to be  so incapable of setting aside their problems with President Trump that  they could not advance the interests of our Nation's military. Ever the  optimist, I thought they would. I thought they would.   Now, my Democratic colleagues are balking at any and all forward  progress on the NDAA because of their opposition to President Trump and  his priorities for border security. They want to limit his authority to  transfer anymore funds in order to build physical barriers at our  southern border.   So I want to be clear. The President would not need to use that  authority to use any military construction funds to build a wall if our  Democratic colleagues would simply provide the necessary funding  through the normal appropriations process, as they always have and as  we always have. I, for one, will not be so unreasonable in negotiating  with them. For example, if--and I mean only if--my Democratic  colleagues would fund the administration's border security request  through the appropriations process, then count me in for limiting the  President's transfer authority. I am willing to compromise, but you  can't have it both ways. You can't say we are going to take away the  President's constitutional authority on the one hand, and then, on the  other hand, make sure you don't fund the priorities that he needs to  fund, which is, again, the highest priority of our government.   To reiterate my earlier point, I applaud the chairman for his  handling of this process. He has been vigilant and focused on  completing the NDAA, and I don't blame him for where we are today. No,  House Democrats have not been willing partners and have forced the  chairman to devise a backup plan for their intransigence.   That is what I find so disappointing. Surely, our Democratic  colleagues know the threat that our foreign adversaries pose. For  crying out loud, we just came from a classified briefing. If it is not  clear enough, I don't know when it will be.   Whether it is the crisis at the southern border or the critical  missions that bring terrorists like al-Baghdadi to justice, I am sure  my colleagues want to do whatever it takes to keep our country safe.  Surely, they are capable of putting partisan politics aside in order to  pass the 59th straight National Defense Authority Act. Anything to the  contrary would be unprecedented.   Yet here we are. I find it astonishing that with all the wannabe  Commanders in Chief right here in the Senate, they are playing politics  with the funding and authorities of the troops they hope to lead.   Can you imagine one of these Presidential candidates becoming the  Commander in Chief and the first talk they have with the troops is,  ``Yeah, I held up your funding and your pay raises.'' It is not a great  way to start.   If it were up to our committee, this bill would have already passed.  If it were up to our conference, this NDAA would be on its way to the  President's desk. But unfortunately, it is not. That is the unfortunate  reality we face today.   The Democratic Party is continuing to put their hatred of President  Trump and his agenda above the needs of our Nation's military, and,  thus, our Nation's defense. It is a dereliction of duty. I find it  sickening, and I find it embarrassing. We are better than this. This  institution deserves better than this. The American people expect and  deserve better than this.   I want to make one last plea before they block tomorrow's vote.  Please put our military men and women, our highest priority, ahead of  partisan politics.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
