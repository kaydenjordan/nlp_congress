 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I stand in strong support of this legislation. I want  to commend my colleague, Congressman Suozzi, for introducing it.   Madam Speaker, I am really disappointed in my Republican colleagues.  They are raising a class warfare argument. They sound like the  progressive left.   The fact is, one of the reasons why cities like New York and counties  like Nassau and Suffolk have had to raise their property taxes is  because for 50 years, we have been subsidizing other States.   Seventy percent to 80 percent of the money we send to the Federal  Government comes back to us, the rest goes to other States. So during  all these years when they have been able to develop using our money, we  have had to raise local taxes, and now they are turning it into class  warfare.   These aren't millionaires. The people in my district who are getting  screwed by this are not millionaires. They are cops, they are  firefighters, construction workers, the people who answered the call on  9/11.   What they are doing is undermining the middle class.   What is middle class in other States may be different from mine.   The reason we are high is because of the fact we have had to  subsidize all the rest of them for all these years, sort of like when  politicians come to New York to raise their money and then go back home  and vote against us.   I will say that the strongest advocate for this--when this was first  raised in 1986 in leading to the defeat of the attempt to take away  SALT--was Donald Trump. He said the States that work the hardest would  get hurt the most because of this.   Now, also let me just say--and I will end on this--that we have  subsidized other States long enough. We are asking for fairness. It is  wrong for conservatives to be talking about having a tax on a tax.   Madam Speaker, I urge passage of this bill to have some equity in the  tax code.
