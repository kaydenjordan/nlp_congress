 Mr. President, I want to come down to the floor and  talk about the issue that is certainly the focus of America and the  world right now, and that is Ukraine, and that is the President's State  of the Union Address, which will be a very important one tonight.   And I know that Americans all across our great Nation are glued to  their televisions, social media streams. And what we are seeing in  Europe is quite remarkable, quite unsettling--another major war on the  European continent. We are seeing children in bomb shelters singing the  Ukrainian national anthem. We are seeing brave young men and women on  the front lines taking up arms to defend their country. We are seeing  grandmothers take to the streets, foisting upon Russian conscripts the  seeds of their country's flower. One of the most effective acts of  resistance I have ever witnessed.   Mr. President, you and many of us were over in Europe just about a  week ago at the Munich Security Conference, where we had the  opportunity to meet with many of these brave Ukrainian ministers, the  mayor of Kyiv, parliamentarians, young parliamentarians. And our  message--my message certainly was a hard one. At the time, the war had  not started, but we were seeing increasing intelligence that it would  any day.   And the message was, if war comes, it will be important for the  Ukrainian people, the leaders, to fight. And we are seeing that. All  across the country, the people in Ukraine are fighting and willing to  die for freedom, for their country.   I want to say I think I speak for the whole Senate: Watching these  acts of courage and heroism has been truly inspiring, and we all  applaud the courage and heroism that we are seeing in Ukraine, and we  stand with the people of Ukraine.   Given the circumstances in Ukraine and across the globe and in our  country, where working families are struggling under increasing energy  costs and inflation, I want to talk a little bit about the President's  State of the Union tonight and what I certainly hope he is going to  tell the American people.   I and several of my colleagues here, Republican colleagues in the  Senate, will be sending a letter to the President very soon, urging him  to announce specific actions that relate to an entirely new world with  this invasion of Ukraine by Russia and start to announce a course  correction on issues under which the Biden administration has been  going the wrong way on two key, key areas.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  the letter to the President.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    U.S. Senate,                                      Washington, DC, March 1, 2022.      President Joseph R. Biden,      The White House,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. President: We appreciate your call for Americans       to come together in light of Russia's brutal, unprovoked       invasion of Ukraine. We strongly support working with our       allies and partners--one of our nation's most important       strategic advantages--as well as sending U.S. troops to       support and defend NA TO allies in Eastern Europe during       these challenging and dangerous times.        Yet, as our nation prepares for this new era of       authoritarian aggression led by the dictators in Russia and       China, we have serious concerns that we encourage you to       address in tonight's State of the Union and thereafter act       upon immediately.        First, you must submit a robust military budget that       significantly increases defense spending to reflect the       realities of our geostrategic competition with China and       Russia. Your Fiscal Year (FY) 2022 budget proposed       significant real cuts to the Department of Defense when, at       the same time, you proposed massive increases to almost every       other federal agency and department. Putin and Xi were       undoubtedly encouraged that the President of the United       States proposed significant budget cuts to his own armed       services. We implore you not to make the same strategic       mistake again. The FY 2022 National Defense Authorization Act       (NOAA) was a clear bipartisan rebuke of your misguided       defense budget cuts. You must put forward a robust, real       increase in defense spending focused on the current and       future readiness and lethality of our force. You should also       continue to press our NATO allies to meet their two percent       of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) goal for defense spending.        Second, your Administration's energy policies--which focus       on restricting, delaying, and killing the production of       American energy--have had the predictable but catastrophic       effect of driving up energy prices for American working       families, increasing pinks slips for American energy workers,       and significantly empowering our adversaries, especially       Putin, who has used energy as a weapon for decades.        You recently told the American people in a press conference       that your Administration was using ``every tool at our       disposal to protect American families and businesses from       rising prices at the gas pump'' and ``taking active steps to       bring down the cost.'' Mr. President, respectfully, that is       not true and the facts show it.        Time and time again, your administration has taken steps to       unilaterally disarm the American energy sector. We hope that       in your address tonight, you make a strategic course       correction on your misguided energy policies that properly       reflects your recent promises to reduce energy prices for       American families, protect the national security of the       United States, and provide meaningful support to our allies       who are struggling to meet their energy needs. You can do       this through the following actions:        1. Rescind your decision to cancel the Keystone XL Pipeline       and fast-track other similar energy infrastructure projects       across the country.        2. Work to rescind the recent decision by the Federal       Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) that makes it much more       difficult to approve natural gas pipelines.        3. Commit to fast tracking and producing American energy on       federal lands, including the 1002 Area of the Arctic National       Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), the National Petroleum Reserve of       Alaska (NPR-A), and the Gulf of Mexico, all of which have       decades of abundant proven reserves of oil and gas.        4. Expedite the permitting of critical minerals mining and       processing, particularly Alaska's Ambler Road project, and       reinstate the leases issued to Twin Metals Minnesota LLC for       the northeastern Minnesota mining project.        5. Reinstate the January 2021 proposed rule from the U.S.       Office of the Comptroller of the Currency that would prevent       America's large financial institutions from black-listing       whole sectors of the economy and ensure the energy sector has       fair access to capital and banking service to advance       critically needed energy projects.        6. Direct the Department of Justice to appeal the U.S.       District Court's decision invalidating the Department of the       Interior's Lease Sale 257. Appealing the Court's decision to       block this sale will demonstrate the administration's       commitment to continuing critical offshore development.        7. Direct the Department of the Interior to finalize a new       5-year offshore lease plan by June 30, 2022.        8. Use your bully pulpit to encourage--not discourage--      America's financial institutions to support American energy       independence by investing in American oil and gas.        9. Sanction Russian oil and gas exports to America and our       allies. We have seen a spike in American imports of Russian       energy during your Administration. We would replace such       imports, which only empower Putin, with increased production       of American energy for our citizens.  [[Page S866]]             10. Issue all pending export licenses and announce an       initiative to surge American liquefied natural gas (LNG)       exports to our allies and partners in Europe who are being       blackmailed and are trapped by the whims of tyrant Vladimir       Putin.        11. Terminate the positions of White House Climate Czar       Gina McCarthy and Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John       Kerry, who have aggressively pushed an all-out assault on       America's energy sector--at home and abroad--and whose       actions are dramatically weakening America's geostrategic       advantages. John Kerry's statements just days ago clearly       portray someone who does not care about the lives lost in the       crisis in Ukraine but rather protecting the climate agenda no       matter the cost. In his own words, he said, ``Massive       emissions consequences to the war, but equally importantly       you're going to lose people's focus. You're going to lose,       certainly, big country attention because they will be       diverted, and I think it could have a damaging impact,'' and       ``I hope President Putin will help us to stay on track with       respect to what we need to do for the climate.''        12. Withdraw your nomination of Sarah Bloom Raskin based on       her commitment to reduce American energy projects that would       provide energy to our allies and reduce America's dependence       on Russian oil.        It is our sincere hope that you announce these changes in       your address this evening. Only then will your promise to use       ``every tool at our disposal to protect American families and       businesses from rising prices at the gas pump'' be fulfilled       and our national security appropriately protected.        The American people are looking to their President to rise       to this critical moment. Our national security, global       stability for ourselves and our allies, as well as the       prosperity of every American family are on the line.        We await your response in tonight's address.            Sincerely,      Dan Sullivan,        United States Senator.      Kevin Cramer,        United States Senator.      Roger Wicker        United States Senator.      James Lankford,        United States Senator.      John Cornyn,        United States Senator.      John Hoeven,        United States Senator.     Mr. President, let me begin with one of the areas of  course correction that we are urging the President to undertake, and  that is in the area of national defense.   There are many lessons that we are going to learn from this Ukrainian  invasion, but one of them is certainly that we have entered a new era  of authoritarian aggression, led by the dictator in Russia--that is  Putin--and the dictator in China--that is Xi Jinping. When they sense  weakness, particularly military weakness, they are acting.   As I mentioned, this new era of authoritarian aggression is something  we need to be ready for. It is led by the dictators of Russia and  China, who are increasingly isolated and dangerous. They are driven by  historical grievances, they are paranoid about their democratic  neighbors, and they are more than willing to use military force and  other aggressive actions to crush the citizens of such countries on  their periphery. These dangerous dictators, Putin and Xi Jinping, are  increasingly working together to achieve their aggressive goals.   We must wake up to the fact, and that is what we are calling the  President to do--hopefully he does in his speech tonight--that this new  era of authoritarian aggression is likely to be with us for decades.   What are the areas which we should focus on and which we are  respectfully requesting the President to focus on and announce tonight?  Well, first, as I mentioned, our Nation's national defense. Now,  unfortunately, this has not been a priority of Democratic Presidents.  That is a fact. This has not been a priority often of my Democratic  colleagues--some; not all but some.   Let me just give you some of the numbers. In the second term of the  Obama administration, the Pentagon's budget was slashed by 25 percent-- 25 percent. Our military readiness plummeted.   When I got elected to the Senate--in many ways, I ran because of  these issues in 2014. When I was elected in 2015, I was on the  Readiness Subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee. The numbers at  the time were classified because they were so horrendous in terms of  our military's readiness. Three out of fifty-eight brigade combat teams  of the U.S. Army were at the tier 1 level of readiness needed for  deployment--3 out of 58. The Air Force was the smallest and oldest in  terms of aircraft age ever, and less than half of the U.S. Navy and  Marine Corps' aviation fleet could fly. That was the U.S. military  during the end of the second term of the Obama administration. When you  gut defense spending, you gut readiness, you gut lethality.   During the Trump administration, when the Republicans had control of  the Senate, we worked to reverse this dangerous hollowing out of our  military by dramatically increasing funding. Many of the areas I talked  about involving readiness and lethality returned back to the levels  that the American people expect of their military.   Unfortunately, when the President, President Biden, was elected, he  reverted back to what Democratic Presidents always do: He submitted a  budget that cut defense spending in real terms, inflation adjusted,  about 3 to 4 percent cuts.   What was remarkable, if you looked at the Biden budget, everywhere  else, it was double-digit increases. You name the Agency, it got a  double-digit increase, with the exception of two: Department of Defense  and Homeland Security. Budgets are an indication of priorities, and  this President was not prioritizing his own armed services.   So what we are doing with regard to the letter today is asking the  President of the United States: You can't do that anymore, Mr.  President. We are in a new era.   We had a hearing in the Armed Services Committee today. I asked both  the witnesses what they thought Xi Jinping and Putin thought when the  President of the United States put forward a budget to cut his own  military. The witnesses answered today in this hearing: Undoubtedly, it  helped embolden Putin and Xi Jinping.   So the first thing we are asking the President to make clear in his  speech tonight is that he needs to put forward a robust, real increase  in defense spending to make sure we have current and future readiness  and lethality of our military forces. Obviously, if you turn on the TV  and see what is going on around the world, this needs to happen.   The President also needs to continue, as every President has done  before him, to call out our NATO allies, whom we are acting closely  with right now, to meet their obligations that they have committed to  for years, which is to spend at least 2 percent of their GDP on defense  spending.   The good news is, Germany just announced that it was going to do  this, that it was going to double its budget. That is remarkable. That  is great news. But we can't have Germany leading on the calls  for increasing defense spending and lethality. The President of the  United States needs to do it, and he needs to do it tonight.    The second issue that we raised in our letter on the critical need  for a strategic course correction with this administration is with  regard to energy. Everybody knows it. Everybody feels it. Everybody  understands it. Yet, for some reason--I think driven by the far left of  the Democratic Party--this administration won't get real on energy.   Let me talk about that for a minute because it is a topic I care  deeply about and, by the way, have been pressing the Biden  administration on since day 1, that this is bad for our economy, bad  for working families, and bad for national security.   What am I talking about? Well, first, it is important to understand  what President Biden inherited. Over the 4 years of the Trump  administration, with Republicans in control of the Senate, we were able  to achieve a bipartisan goal of American foreign policy and energy  security that we collectively as a nation had been seeking for decades:  American energy independence.   Before the pandemic hit, the United States was the largest producer  of oil in the world, bigger than Saudi Arabia; the largest producer of  natural gas in the world, bigger than Russia; and a leader in producing  renewables--all-of-the-above energy.   At the same time, and I really want my colleagues on the other side  of the aisle to listen to this, we led the world in terms of major  economies on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Since 2005, we have  reduced these by almost 15 percent. No other industrialized nation in  the world has a record like  [[Page S867]]  that, including our high standards on producing energy. In China, the  emissions are going through the roof. In the United States, they are  coming down dramatically because of the American energy revolution.  Millions of jobs were created because of this revolution in energy, in  U.S. manufacturing, in energy sectors, and our energy independence  significantly enhanced our Nation's national security.   I often recount this story. In a meeting about 4 years ago I had with  Senator John McCain--a close friend of mine and mentor in the Senate-- and a very senior level Russian dissident. At the end of the meeting, I  asked this brave Russian dissident: What more can the United States do  to undermine the Putin regime and to undercut Vladimir Putin's malign  influence in Europe and around the world? Without hesitation, this  Russian dissident said: It is easy, Senator; America needs to produce  more American energy. That is exactly what we did, and our country and  our allies benefited enormously.   So what has been the policy of this administration? From day 1--and I  mean day 1--1 hour into his administration, President Biden has  intentionally done the opposite. We are not going to produce more  American energy, as that Russian dissident told me and Senator McCain  to do to undermine Putin. To the contrary, the Biden administration  made the conscious decision: We are going to undercut the production of  American energy.   Since taking office, this administration has shut down energy  production, has made it hard to produce on Federal lands, has killed  energy infrastructure like pipelines, has strong-armed American  financial institutions and not invested in energy here and particularly  in places like my State, the great State of Alaska.   All of this restricting, delaying, killing the production of American  energy, driven by a far-left agenda that makes no sense, has had the  very predictable result of what? Catastrophically driving up energy  prices for American working families--we are seeing that every day; my  colleagues know that--increasing pink slips for American energy  workers. Keystone XL laid off 10,000 workers, a lot of laborers. First  day on the job--that was the President's call.   Here is the thing that matters right now: This war on American energy  has significantly empowered our adversaries, especially Vladimir Putin,  who has used energy as a weapon for decades.   Again, I see this every day. Think about this statistic if you are an  Alaskan citizen. This administration comes up to Alaska and tries to  delay and shut down the production of American energy. Guess what. At  the same time, year 1 in the Biden administration, we are now importing  700,000 barrels a day of oil from Russia--almost a 40-percent increase  in year 1 from the Biden administration. Does any American or any U.S.  Senator think that makes sense--killing American energy production in  our great Nation and importing hundreds of thousands of barrels more  from Vladimir Putin? Because if you do--well, actually, I don't think  anyone thinks that makes sense. But that is what is happening right  now. In effect, the United States, in many ways, along with countries  in Europe, is funding the very war that Putin has launched.    The United States still is the world's largest producer of natural  gas, but, again, due to the irrationality and hostility toward  pipelines, we can't get enough natural gas to the Northeast. So you see  places like Boston importing LNG from where? Russia.   This is insane. This is insane. This is a colossal, strategic  mistake. It is clearly harming American working families. I am sure  every Senator hears about it when they go home. But it is also national  security suicide.   It is being done, supposedly, to lower carbon emissions, but I want  to be clear about that, too, because it isn't. In fact, oil produced in  the United States has lower emissions than oil produced in most other  countries. LNG shipped to Europe from the United States has a 41- percent lower carbon emission footprint than gas piped in from Russia,  and we also have some of the most rigorous environmental standards  anywhere on the planet in terms of production.   So, again, the Biden administration's energy policies are  strengthening Putin, increasing costs and hurting Americans, and are  actually doing zero to address global emissions. The only conclusion I  can come up with is the far left has undertaken some kind of holy war  against the production of American energy, and it makes no sense.   So here is what we are asking the President. He gave a speech to the  American people the other night where he said that he is using all  available tools to address these energy challenges. With all due  respect to the President of the United States, that is not true. The  President knows it; his team knows it; every Senator here knows it, and  the American people know it.   So in our letter today that we are sending to the President, we are  saying, President Biden, if you want to keep your word to the American  people on what you just told them, ``all available tools,'' here is  what you can actually announce tonight at the State of the Union that  will have very significant, real impacts on lowering energy costs in  America and increasing our national security relative to Putin.   Some of the actions we requested the President to take in the letter  we are sending him before the State of the Union.   Simple, rescind your decision to cancel the Keystone XL Pipeline and  fast-track other similar energy infrastructure projects around the  country.   Work to rescind the recent decision by the Biden administration's  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, that makes it much more  difficult to actually approve natural gas pipelines. My understanding  is my good friend from West Virginia Senator Manchin is holding a  hearing on this very issue on Thursday because he knows that this is  national security suicide.   Commit to fast-tracking and producing American energy on American  lands, particularly where the Congress has told you to do so, like ANWR  in Alaska, like the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska--Congress has  said produce there; that is the law--like the Gulf of Mexico. We have  decades in our great Nation of abundant proven reserves of oil and gas.  So why are we importing so much from Putin right now?   This brings me to another request. And this is a request of many  Senators, and I believe Democratic Senators also. We should be banning  the importation of Russian oil into the United States. Canada just  announced it was doing it yesterday. Why would we be importing 700,000  barrels a day of Russian oil when we have millions and millions of  barrels in Alaska? Can somebody answer that question?   I hope the President of the United States looks at our letter and  recognizes these are commonsense approaches that are going to be needed  to address this new era of authoritarian aggression, not just with  Vladimir Putin but with Xi Jinping as well. When you look at what the  Communist Party fears more than anything, it is American energy  dominance. And yet this administration has come in, in year 1,  unilaterally disarmed one of our most important strategic advantages in  the world.   One other thing we mention in the letter, which makes so much sense,  is to issue all pending export licenses and announce an initiative to  help surge American liquefied natural gas to our allies in Europe and  partners in Europe who right now are being blackmailed and trapped by  Vladimir Putin's use of energy.   Again, you would think that would be a no-brainer.   And we hope the President looks at the American people tonight and  goes through this list of good energy ideas that we have given him and  says he is going to do it--says he is going to do it.   The world is reeling right now. Our country certainly is hurting, in  terms of inflation and many other challenges, many of which are self- inflicted like the energy challenges. We can take steps to strengthen  our country. And a strong United States, of course, strengthens the  world.   We have seen this time and time again throughout history. Our country  is the beacon of freedom and hope, and the light of that beacon can  only shine brightly, can only cast light on all corners of the globe  when we are strong. And it shines most brightly when our  [[Page S868]]  citizens are not struggling, but when we have strong communities,  strong families, bolstered by good-paying jobs that provide dignity.   Our light of freedom shines most brightly when our country is on a  common mission, and I think the President can call us toward a common  mission tonight by listening to some of the things that we as  Republicans have implored him to talk about and focus on in his speech.   As I mentioned, as a country, it is important that we wake up to the  fact that this new era of authoritarian aggression will likely be with  us for decades. We need to face it with confidence and strategic  resolve.   Our country has extraordinary advantages relative to the  dictatorships of Russia and China if we are wise enough to utilize and  strengthen them. Our global network of allies, our lethal military, our  world-class natural resources and energy resources, our dynamic  economy, and most important, our democratic values and commitment to  liberty.   Xi Jinping and Putin's biggest weakness and vulnerability is that  they fear their own people. We should remember and exploit this  vulnerability in the months and years ahead.   I yield the floor.
