 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R.  3003.   In jurisdictions within my district, Cook County, cities like  Chicago, Evanston, and Skokie, which are immigrant rich, we have  adopted sanctuary cities, sometimes called welcoming cities, ordinances  in order to reassure immigrants that they can, with safety, talk to law  enforcement within our jurisdictions.   Skokie Mayor George Van Dusen said: ``It has taken the Village of  Skokie years--decades really--to form the bridges that we have of trust  with our immigrant community.''   These policies work. A January study found that sanctuary cities tend  to be safer and have stronger economies than not.   This bill would push communities to abandon sanctuary city policies,  breaking down that hard-earned trust between immigrants and law  enforcement. Turning law enforcement into immigration enforcement makes  cities less safe.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.    Mr. Speaker, it makes immigrants less likely to  report crimes. This bill protects criminals in our communities and not  victims.   I urge my colleagues to vote for safer communities and vote against  this bill.
