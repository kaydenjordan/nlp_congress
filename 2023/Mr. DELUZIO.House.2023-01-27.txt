 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the striking workers of  the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette who are more than 100 days into their  unfair labor practice strike.   CWA and Teamsters members went on strike this fall. They were joined  in solidarity by members of the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh. Striking  workers continue to keep the community informed through their strike  publication, the Pittsburgh Union Progress.   A healthy democracy requires a free press, and Western PA is no  exception. We need strong, independent journalism. The destruction of  small news outlets and consolidation in the industry are big problems  for the freedom of the press in our country, including in Western  Pennsylvania.   Owners at Block Communications recently acquired the Pittsburgh City  Paper, a weekly focused on local issues. The News Guild-CWA has raised  concerns about this acquisition and its impact on competition, workers,  and journalistic independence. I share those concerns.   While I am glad that a judge found Block Communications broke the law  in the Guild's NLRB case, the fight isn't over. I stand in solidarity  with the striking workers in Western Pennsylvania and with workers  across the country fighting for the dignity that we all deserve.                            ____________________
