 Mr. President, I have a motion to commit at the desk, and  I ask that it be reported.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes of  debate, equally divided.    Mr. President, my motion to commit is to send this bill  back to the Finance Committee to adopt the commonsense rule that should  have been in there from the beginning that we are not going to give  bailout money to sanctuary States and sanctuary cities.   Now, to whom are the States and cities giving sanctuary? Criminal  illegal aliens. Where is the sanctuary for their victims? Why should  cities and States that refuse to cooperate with Federal law enforcement  receive Federal bailouts? They should not.   I reserve my time.    Mr. President.    The immigration system is broken because the Democratic  Party will not enforce our borders. You see that with the Biden border  crisis right now. We can fix one small part of it by stopping Federal  bailout dollars from going to cities and States that refuse to  cooperate with Federal law enforcement.                           Vote on Motion to Commit    I ask for the yeas and nays.
