The motion is agreed to.                            ____________________     Mr. President, earlier today the Senate moved forward  with the President's nominee to head up the Office of Management and  Budget, Congressman Mulvaney. Congressman Mulvaney spent years  representing the people of South Carolina and has been thoroughly  engaged on budget issues during his time in the House of  Representatives.   He has highlighted the fact that the Federal Government is on an  unsustainable fiscal path if nothing changes in Washington, DC, and  that it is reckless to keep running up the Nation's credit card with  trillions in more debt and unfunded liabilities, not to mention the  immorality of passing down to the next generation the obligation of  actually paying that money back.   So Congressman Mulvaney is actually, I think, a very good choice for  this critical role, and I look forward to voting on his confirmation  soon.
