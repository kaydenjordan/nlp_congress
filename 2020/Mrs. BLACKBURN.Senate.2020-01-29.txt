 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk on  my behalf. I am also joined by Senators Loeffler, Cramer, Lee, and  McSally.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senators Blackburn, Loeffler, Cramer, Lee, and  McSally ask of counsel for the President:         Is the standard for impeachment in the House a lower       threshold to meet than the standard for conviction in the       Senate, and have the House managers met their evidentiary       burden to support a vote of removal?    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, as for the standard  in the House, of course, the House is not making a final determination.  In the structure of the Constitution, an impeachment is simply an  accusation, and as in most systems where there is simply an accusation  being made, the House does not have to adhere to the same standard that  is used in the Senate.   In most instances, House Members have suggested in debates on  articles--  [[Page S648]]  of whether or not to approve Articles of Impeachment--that they should  have clear and convincing evidence in the view of the Members voting on  it that there was some impeachable offense, and that is all--some, not  even that standard. So there is simply enough evidence that an  accusation can be made. It is definitely a lower standard than the  standard that has to be met here in a trial for an ultimate verdict.   The Constitution speaks in terms of a conviction in the Senate. As  both Professor Dershowitz and Judge Starr pointed out in their  comments, everywhere in the Constitution in which there is any mention  of impeachment, it is spoken of in terms of the criminal law. The  offenses that define the jurisdiction for the Senate in its sitting as  a Court of Impeachment are treason, bribery, and high crimes and  misdemeanors. The Constitution speaks of a conviction, upon being  convicted in the Senate. It speaks of all crimes being tried by a jury  except in cases of impeachment--again, suggesting notions of the  criminal law.   As we pointed out in our trial memorandum, all of these textual  references make it clear that the standards of the criminal law should  apply in the trial, certainly to the extent of the burden and standard  of proof to be carried by the House managers, which means proof beyond  a reasonable doubt. It is very clear that there is not any requirement  for proof beyond a reasonable doubt simply for the House to vote upon  Articles of Impeachment.   There is a very much higher standard at stake here. As we pointed out  in our trial memorandum, the mere accusation made by the House comes  here with no presumption of regularity at all in its favor. The Senate  sits as a trier of both fact and law, reviewing both factual and legal  issues de novo, and the House managers are held to a standard of  proving proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every element of what would  be a recognizable impeachable offense.   Here they have failed in their burden of proof. They have also failed  in the law. They have not stated in the Articles of Impeachment  anything that on its face amounts to an impeachable offense. On that  fact, I think we have demonstrated very clearly that they have not  presented facts that would amount to an impeachable offense even under  their own theories. They have presented only part of the facts and left  out the key facts. Mr. Purpura, I think, went through, very  effectively, showing that there are some facts that don't change.   The transcript of the July 25 call shows the President doing nothing  wrong. President Zelensky said he never felt any pressure. His other  advisers have said the Ukrainians never felt any pressure. They didn't  think there was any quid pro quo. They didn't even know that the  military assistance had been held up until the POLITICO article at the  end of August.   The only two people with statements on record who spoke to the  President, Gordon Sondland and Senator Ron Johnson, report that the  President said to them there was no quid pro quo, and the aid flowed  without anything ever being done related to investigations.   That is what is in the record. That is what the House managers have  to rely on to make their case, and they have failed to prove their case  beyond a reasonable doubt, failed even to prove it by clear and  convincing evidence--failed to prove it at all, in my opinion.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from California is recognized.
