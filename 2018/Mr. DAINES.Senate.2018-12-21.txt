 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, today I have the honor of  recognizing Bob Dellwo of Choteau, MT, for his over 94 years of service  to his community, country, and family.   Bob was born in Conrad on August 1, 1924. After his family moved to  Choteau, Bob grew up and attended Teton High School, where he was a  member of the football team. From 1942-1946, Bob volunteered to serve  in WWII. While serving in the Navy, most of his time was spent as a  radio man on a dive bomber, where he twice earned the Distinguished  Flying Cross.   In January of 1946, Bob married his sweetheart Helen. The two were  married for over 55 years. Together, they had four children they raised  in Choteau and Helena. As owners of various small businesses throughout  the years, they were well known and active in their communities.   Bob took immense pride in his 22 grandchildren and great- grandchildren and rightfully so. In fact, his granddaughter Liz holds a  special spot in the Daines office, having worked on Team Daines for  many years. A kind and lighthearted spirit, Bob enjoyed being with his  family more than anything, and that is how he chose to spend his time.   Bob leaves behind a legacy of friendship, family, faith, and  community. His dedication and service to others throughout his life  will have a lasting impact for generations to come. I join his family,  friends, and community in mourning his death, but we take comfort in  knowing he is in a better place now with the love of his life,  Helen.                            ____________________     Madam, today, I wish to honor the men and women of  the USS Montana Committee and their notable contributions to our State  and our Nation in 2018.   The USS Montana Committee is a group of volunteers from Montana who  have dedicated themselves to promoting awareness and fostering support  for the future commissioning of the USS Montana and all those who will  sail aboard her in defense of our Nation. A Virginia Class nuclear  fast-attack submarine, the USS Montana will protect carrier and  expeditionary strike groups, hunt and destroy enemy ships, and conduct  strategic national security missions around the globe. We wait with  great anticipation as her 2020 commissioning quickly approaches.   Montana has a proud heritage of military service. Some 3,500 Active- Duty servicemembers currently serve at Malmstrom Air Force Base in  Great Falls, and another 4,500 citizen-soldiers serve in the National  Guard and Reserve at various locations across the State. Montana also  proudly boasts the highest percentage of veterans per capita in the  contiguous United States. Beyond the borders of our landlocked home,  more than 2,200 U.S. Navy sailors currently call Montana home, adding  134 new Montanans to their ranks in the past 12 months.   Once she is commissioned, the USS Montana will be the second U.S.  Navy warship to bear our State's namesake. The first, an armored  cruiser, AC 13, was commissioned 1908 and served with distinction in  World War I. In fact, her keel was laid 112 years ago this week on  December 15, 1906. The bell from that ship is currently on display in  the lobby of the University of Montana's Adams Center. It has a legacy  of its own, playing a prominent role in one of the oldest college  football rivalries in the nation.   2018 has proven to be a banner year for the USS Montana, her crew,  and her network of volunteers in Montana. In May, we celebrated the  laying of her keel, a proud naval tradition and one of the most  significant milestones in the ship's construction prior to delivery.  The celebration incorporated a number of Montana themes and traditions,  including a Native Blackfeet blessing by Mariah Gladstone of Kalispell.  We were also introduced to her command leadership team: commanding  officer, CDR Michael Delaney; executive officer, LCDR Jeffrey Kahn; and  chief of the boat, SCPO Michael Dassau. We even got a look at the  ship's preliminary emblem, which incorporates strong symbolism of the  State, the submarine force, and the naval service. The ship also  enjoyed prominent recognition on the cover of the 2018 Montana Voter  Information Pamphlet distributed statewide in preparation for the  midterm elections.   The USS Montana Committee was proudly represented and facilitated  these key events by raising awareness and funding across the state.  Over the course of the year, the committee held events in Butte,  Missoula, Helena, Columbia Falls, Kalispell, Billings, Colstrip,  Lewistown, Miles City, Sidney, Great Falls, and Glasgow. In September,  the committee facilitated a statewide tour with the commanding officer,  with stops in Billings, Helena, Great Falls, and Missoula. These  efforts have made great strides in fostering a strong and enduring  relationship between the State of Montana and the U.S. Navy.   In recognition of these and other notable accomplishments, I ask that  the following names who have volunteered for the USS Montana Committee  be entered into the Record.
