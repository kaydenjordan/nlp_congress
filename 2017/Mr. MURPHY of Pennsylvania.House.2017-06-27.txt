 Mr. Speaker, tonight, I am joined by a  number of Members here to talk about one of the most insidious problems  our Nation has faced in a long time. It is the problem of opioid abuse.  We are in a crisis mode.   We have now reached a point where we will have more deaths from drug  overdoses this year than there are names on the Vietnam Veterans  Memorial Wall in Washington. That is a frightening concept.   There is almost no county, no State in America, that is not affected  by this. Some areas have much more. Places in eastern Kentucky,  southern West Virginia and up the Ohio Valley, and places in New  England and out West have seen this as a growing problem as death rates  rise.   There are things we can do about this. But in order to have some  discussion of what we can do about this, we are going to talk about how  we got to this problem and then what we can do to go beyond that.   I want to start off by yielding to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  Walden), the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, to talk  about what this means in one State alone, the State of Oregon.    I thank the chairman for his passion and  hard work on the Energy and Commerce Committee. We know this is a life- and-death issue. This is one of those things where Members are coming  together from both sides of the aisle to deal with.   Let me lay out the background here. How did we get here?   About 80 percent of addictions begin with a prescription. When we see  what has happened here on this chart of heroin increased use and  prescription opioids, there is something that occurred at the beginning  of this millennium where things really began to take off.   On this next poster, seeing here how this is increasing at such a  rate--about 9 or 10 percent--it is understandable you are looking at  some of these rates increasing severalfold just in the last decade,  with increasing jumps. As fentanyl has gotten here, it is even worse.    Back in 1980, Dr. Hershel Jick, a Boston doctor, wrote a letter in  The New England Journal of Medicine, and he said this: ``Out of nearly  40,000 patients given powerful pain drugs in a Boston hospital, only  four addictions were documented.'' Since he published that letter, it  has been cited again about 600 times. Doctors, academics,  pharmaceutical companies, and others use it as evidence of the  unlikeliness of developing addiction.   But it has been criticized soundly, saying that never should have  been said. In fact, The New England Journal of Medicine took the  unusual step of posting a one-sentence warning over the so-called  Porter and Jick letter to the editor that the Journal published in  1980, and it says: ``For reasons of public health, readers should be  aware that this letter has been heavily and uncritically cited as  evidence that addiction is rare with opioid therapy.''   Accompanying this note was an analysis from Canadian researchers  exploring the frequency the letter had been cited, which was almost 600  times.   Here is the tragedy of this. Many physicians and many pharmaceutical  companies said: See, prescribe these opioids; people will be okay. That  was found not to be the case.   Jump ahead to 2001, when The Joint Commission released their pain  management standards, and then shortly after that the American Medical  Association said: let's make pain one of the  [[Page H5222]]  vital signs. The other vital signs being blood pressure, heart rate,  respiratory rate, and temperature. But when pain was also made one of  those as well, doctors began asking questions about that, and basically  screening people along the lines of: On a scale of 1 to 10, what is  your pain level?   Everything else is measured with an instrument objectively, but pain  is subjective. In fact, it is so subjective that it was found that 51  percent of people who are on an opioid have a mood disorder, such as  depression or anxiety. There is a huge amount there.   The thing about this, if a person fails to screen for presence of a  mood disorder, along with other aspects, you really increase their risk  for addiction.   About 50 million Americans, for example, have low back pain. Twenty- five million of those are on an opioid. Of that group, about 40 percent  have been found to have depression. If you combine depression and  opioid use, you could triple or quadruple your risk for misuse, abuse,  and addiction. It would make sense that before a doctor prescribes in  these cases, concurrently they would also be screening for mood  disorders. That does not appear to be the case.   Here is another part of the problem. Under the Affordable Care Act,  hospital payments are tied to patient pain satisfaction surveys, which  reward hospitals financially when patients give them a high rating for  managing pain. In turn, the hospitals get less money if the patient  says: my pain was not handled.   That is actually question 14 of the Hospital Consumer Assessment of  Healthcare Providers and Systems survey. It asks the question: How  often did the hospital or provider do everything in their power to  control your pain? Doctors feared negative responses, as did many  hospitals, and it was found that probably had an impact on increasing  prescriptions.   Another part of the problem is treatment access. Quite frankly, if  you want to get help, you can't find it. Unfortunately, getting access  to high-quality treatment is unlikely in the United States. Of the 27  million Americans suffering from addiction, less than 1 percent receive  evidence-based treatment.   We have a shortage of trained providers, and half the counties in  America have no psychologists, no psychiatrists, and no clinical social  workers.   Let me add to this also that medication-assisted treatment is one of  those things put up here as a treatment method. If I show you here,  medication-assisted treatment is when a person is replacing their  illegal drug with something like methadone or Suboxone, which Chairman  Walden just referred to.   But here is part of the problem. It is supposed to be the doctor  writing the prescription and then the patient is getting other  treatment. But as is found with medication-assisted treatment, just in  Pennsylvania alone, nearly 60 percent had no counseling in the year  they received the buprenorphine. Forty percent were not drug-tested in  the year they received the buprenorphine.   This is important because a person may receive a prescription but  still remain on heroin or another drug. Thirty-three percent have  between two to five different prescribers writing them a prescription  for this. Where do all those prescriptions go?   This is one of the top diverted drugs. Many times, the patients  simply take those drugs, sell them, and buy the street drugs. Twenty- four percent of those buprenorphine prescriptions didn't see a  physician in the prior 30 days.   In other words, with medication-assisted treatment, we simply have a  failure to provide other treatment and a low expectation for  improvement, in many cases thinking we will replace one addiction with  another.   Another part is in the area of hospital care. When treating opioid  and heroin addiction, inpatient and residential treatment is crucial  for full recovery, but there are simply not enough treatment centers  and beds. Today, our Nation suffers a shortage of 100,000 inpatient  treatment beds.   Further, we don't have enough providers. When we do have providers,  many times they end up overprescribing.   There was a law in the United States back in the Nixon era called 42  C.F.R., consolidated federal registry. Basically, it made it so that  physicians could not find out in the record if a patient was on other  opioids, in treatment for that, or taking buprenorphine or methadone.   So what happened? Someone shows up in the emergency room, they are in  pain, perhaps a doctor looks in the record and doesn't see anything  there, and writes a prescription. If that person was in treatment and  was recovering from an addiction, and at that point not taking other  drugs, look at what just happened. The doctor may prescribe some  opioids for that patient who was used to taking quite a few at any  given time to have an effect. Now they have this, and they are no  longer thinking: I will take just one or two. They may take more. So  you risk overdose.    The second thing you do is risk a relapse. That person was perhaps  clean for months or years. Now they have OxyContin or some other  opioid, they take it, and they have a relapse.   But there is a third problem that goes with that, and that is the  person may be on other drugs, such as benzodiazepines or other  respiratory suppressants, and that becomes a problem because then the  doctor doesn't know about drug interactions.   So we have this law in place which prohibits sharing of information  about substance abuse treatment between doctors. Doctors unknowingly  prescribe these for people. It causes more problems. We need to deal  with this.   Another level here is fentanyl. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid which  is a staggering 50 times more potent than heroin and 100 times more  potent than morphine. It has a high potential for abuse. A mere 2  milligrams is fatal. A single packet of sweetener for your coffee is  1,000 milligrams. Take two of those and that is enough to kill you.   Since last 2013, fentanyl has contributed to at least 5,000 overdose  deaths in the U.S., and that is soaring. However, due to gaps in the  data collections, it is likely the number of overdose deaths in the  U.S. is actually much higher.   A low-cost, high-profit, hard-to-detect profile of fentanyl is  increasingly more trafficked to traffickers and relatively easy to  manufacture. China is a major part of this, in that the illegally  manufactured fentanyl shipped to the U.S. via labs in Mexico, smuggled  across the border, then hits our streets.   One other thing I want to point out here, in terms of this problem.  If we look at what some have analyzed in terms of areas that are  hotspots for substance abuse, you can see in here for persons on  disability, look at the sections in Kentucky, West Virginia, Virginia,  along the Mississippi Valley, up the Ohio Valley, and parts out West.  This isn't the only causal factor. Many times you have people on  disability and pain, and what happens is they may be prescribed opioids  as part of that.   When you look here, where age-adjusted death rates occur for drug  poisoning--those overdose deaths--look at the hotspots in America. It  is just about the same out here in the Mississippi-Ohio Valley,  portions out West, where you have these problems.   All of these come together in terms of crime, in terms of drug  cartels, in terms of fentanyl, in terms of poor access to treatment.   I mentioned the hospital beds. By the way, over half the counties in  America have no psychiatrist, no psychologist, no social worker, and no  licensed drug treatment provider.                                time  1700    It is no wonder we are in this mess. We will talk more about some  solutions here, but I wanted to recognize a number of Members who might  want to talk about this.   Let me first go to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter).  Representative Carter is also a pharmacist. Let's hear some of his  perspective.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter).    As a pharmacist, when people come into  the pharmacy, for example, if they want to get Sudafed, a cold  medication, they have to go through some special process. It is behind  counter. Is that right?    Now, what if they wanted to pick up an  opioid prescription? Do they have to show an ID? Are they required by  law to have the same kind of restrictions?    But as the gentleman knows, that is data  within the State, but across State lines, that data is still not  populated.    I appreciate that. That is a problem we  are going to have to fix in our committee.   I want to call up the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Johnson), eastern  Ohio. Speaking of being able to jump across State lines and have  prescriptions filled, minutes away from the Pennsylvania/West Virginia  border, could travel down there, and also part of that deadly area  along the Ohio Valley where so much of this is occurring.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to Mr. Johnson.    I thank the gentleman from Ohio.   I want to next recognize the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Bucshon).  Certainly he sees this issue, too. As I mentioned before, one of the  problems physicians have, if they do not know what kind of  prescriptions that person is on, for example, a medical record may show  if a person has an allergy to penicillin or something, but you may have  no idea that that patient may, for example, be taking buprenorphine or  methadone unless they tell you or you test for it. And as a surgeon,  what happens when they go to get anesthesia and the complications come  from that, but it is part of the reasons why we have to make sure that  you as a physician have access to these records, things we can clean  up.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Bucshon).    I thank the gentleman for his impassioned  words and dedication here.   I want to refer back to my map here a moment. Dr. Bucshon was  referring to his district in southern Indiana here, which, on this 2014  map, was already showing high mortality rates for those who have drug  overdoses.   Look here in the State of Washington, also an area that, on this 2014  map, showed a lot of problems, and now the problem is getting worse.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Newhouse)  to speak on this issue.                                time  1715     Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's  comments and his dedication to helping his State of Washington.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Rothfus), whose district is just north of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to  talk about some of the problems, in his experience, and his thoughts  about what we should be doing about substance abuse.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and  friend for his dedication on this issue. And, yes, he is right: we have  to cross party lines and work on this together.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot), another  friend, who has seen these problems, as well, in his district and knows  full well how these problems have merged well into the Ohio area, as it  is an insidious problem.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Ohio.   I point also on this map here to the Cincinnati area in southern  Ohio, which is one of the hot spots in 2014 that has continued to grow  as a problem. We recognize this is both a local problem and a  nationwide problem.   I want to tell a story here.   Last December, when the President was signing into law the 21st  Century Cures Act, which included my legislation, the Helping Families  in Mental Health Crisis Act, a former State Senator from West Virginia  took the stage to introduce it. David Grubb talked about his daughter,  Jessie, who, herself, had been in rehab, in treatment, something like  three or four times, had had several drug overdose instances and had  been revived. But what happened to her also is part of what they called  the loaded gun that never should have happened.   She went into the hospital for some surgery, but the doctors and  nurses never told her discharging doctor that she was in recovery for  heroin addiction. The point we made before about the NASPA list, or the  other lists there, or the 42 C.F.R., blocks information from going into  the medical record. So while someone was out to protect her privacy,  they didn't protect her from death.   She was given a prescription of 50 opioid painkillers. Remember, I  said before that when a person is given this prescription, they run the  risk of relapse, overdose, or bad drug interactions. In her case, it  was an overdose that finally took her life--another important reason  why we have to deal with this 42 C.F.R. and get rid of that arcane and,  quite frankly, deadly law.    Let me talk about some other recommendations of what I believe  Congress can do to help.   The references made before by Dr. Bucshon and others about the  prescription drug monitoring program--and also Buddy Carter of Georgia  mentioned this, too--where a pharmacist or a physician can say, ``Is  this person on other opioids? Have they jumped across the border? Have  they seen four, five, or more physicians for some opiates?'' by having  a better PDMP, prescription drug monitoring program, or National All  Schedules Prescription Electronic Reporting program, we have to make  sure that all States use the same system and that it collects data from  across borders so doctors can easily see this.   But part of this, too, in dealing with the 42 C.F.R., is  understanding Federal  [[Page H5226]]  law prohibits including buprenorphine and methadone in the PDMP. How  absurd and how cruel that is that a doctor would not even be able to  know that a patient is taking one of those prescriptions.   Also, some of these drugs can end up being a respiratory suppressant,  and when the patient takes another drug such as benzodiazapine, it can  add to that effect and add to further complications.   Another aspect, too, which we must be further engaged with is  vigorous public education programs across all age groups, beginning  with early elementary school.                                time  1730    When schools have some of these programs--and we will bring forth  some models that talk about these programs in a future hearing I will  be holding in the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee--these are  very, very important to help students, early on, understand the dangers  of this.   This is not just recreation, but it is so easy to slip into  addiction. Given that 80 percent of drug abuse begins with a  prescription, whether it is a student, athlete, perhaps a football  player who injures a leg or something and he is given some of these  drugs, it is essential the whole family be counseled from the onset,  understanding the concerns and dangers of continuing to take these  drugs.   We also have to have drug take-back programs and public education  programs stressing the importance of proper disposal of unused opiates  and pain prescriptions to prevent them from being stolen or misused.  For example, if a family is selling their home and they are having an  open house and strangers come into the house and while they are there  they say, ``Can I use your restroom?'' and the family lets them do  that, don't be surprised if that person has no intention of buying a  house but does have an intention of going into the bathrooms and  checking the medicine cabinets and finding any medication and taking  it.   Also, when teens come over to the house for parties or socializing,  don't be surprised if they also go into medicine cabinets, look in  drawers in the bathrooms or drawers in other places of the house  looking for some of those drugs which they, themselves, will take or  sell.   We have to make sure we have vigorous patient education programs  about doctor-prescribed opioids to make sure people know about that  before the addiction takes foot. And taking one of these prescriptions  may only take 3 or 4 weeks before it begins to kick in and cause  problems.   I know myself, back in 2005, I was in a rollover accident in Iraq  with a couple of other Members of Congress. Our vehicle rolled, and as  a result of that accident, I ended up having a mild concussion,  snapping my neck, having some temporary paralysis, and a great deal of  pain. Well, battlefield medicine is one that gets you out of the area,  stops the bleeding, stops the pain, and ships you off to some other  hospital, and that was the case for me.   But I know what happens. Everywhere I landed in a helicopter or an  ambulance, appropriately so, the physicians would ask me a number of  orienting questions, but also say: ``Are you in pain? On a scale of 1  to 10, how much pain are you in?'' And when I proceeded to say that  number, immediately, as they would do for many other people in the  battlefield, they would administer morphine or some other pain reliever  and move you on from there.   What happened, though, returning to the United States, where pain  continued for me, I was prescribed some pills for that pain, but I was  also prescribed fentanyl. Never once was it ever described to me: ``Be  careful with this. This is highly addictive. This is a problem.''   Now, after a few weeks on this and recognizing it was hard to even do  my job because I couldn't keep my head clear, I just said: ``That it  is. I am not taking this anymore.'' But at that point, my body had  already begun to develop some tolerance for this, and when I stopped  taking it, I had some reaction.   Granted, it was not as severe as some of those who have been taking  these drugs at a higher dosage and longer, but I could feel myself  actually saying I understand what people mean when they say their skin  feels like it is peeling off of them and they feel a sense of nausea  and other problems as well.   Now, I can't even imagine what it is like for someone who is taking  higher doses for longer periods of time. But it is extremely important  that, every time a prescription is written, pharmacists have an  opportunity to counsel patients and doctors are also doing more than  simply passing out a prescription.   Pharmacists should do what Buddy Carter was saying before: make sure  they have the person showing a photo ID. Is this, indeed, a  prescription they are picking up for themselves or claiming they have  it for someone else? Perhaps that prescription was stolen from someone.   We have to make sure that we also understand, for those out there  trying to legalize marijuana, I caution you, because the marijuana that  is out there on the streets or presented in many areas can cause  tremendous psychiatric problems for those who are already at risk. The  longer you are on some of the types of marijuana, the greater risk you  have for things like delusional behavior.   We have to make sure we also eliminate Medicaid payments for those  question 14 responses I made reference to before when you are in the  hospital to ask if the hospital adequately addressed your pain.   In the area of treatment and recovery, we have to expand the mental  health workforce. As I said before, half the counties in America have  no psychiatrists, no psychologists, no drug and alcohol counselors, and  those who are out there likely have their schedule so filled, they  don't even have room to treat someone. Not all of them even know how to  treat addictive disorders.   The fact that a majority of people who may have an addiction disorder  also have a concurrent mental health disorder is another reason why we  have to increase this workforce by tens of thousands. Just for child  and adolescent psychiatrists alone, we need another 21,000 of those.   We need tens of thousands more psychologists. It is important that  the schools of medicine, schools of psychology, and schools of social  work are graduating more people with these degrees and getting them  into our workforce.   I have had legislation before, and we passed some things in the 21st  Century Cures Act and in my Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis  Act, to provide more funding so that more of these folks can continue  with their education. It is essential. It is like trying to fight a war  without soldiers, trying to fight this war, which is killing more  people every year than the entire war in Vietnam, but we do not have  the soldiers to fight this.    We also have to make sure that, with regard to the government- sponsored medication-assisted treatment which I referred to before, we  cannot simply rely on synthetic opioid maintenance alone. We have to  make sure there are requirements to have that person in counseling and  treatment.   I have heard from some persons that go to those treatment programs  that they have no counseling at all, and some have great counseling. In  some cases, sitting in the waiting room, perhaps a nurse or someone  simply checks up on them: ``What are you doing? How are you doing?''  That is considered and written down as group therapy. That is not  acceptable in any way, shape, or form.   We need 100,000 more inpatient psychiatric beds, and we have to make  sure insurance companies recognize that an addictive disorder is a  chronic disorder. Simply giving someone a weekend or a few days for  withdrawal and then putting them back on the street is not an answer.   That is why we have to encourage private insurance companies and  Medicaid and Medicare. And I say Medicare because a large number of  people who are having some of these problems are also the elderly.   We have to make sure that we increase the availability of fast-acting  opiate blockers for first responders, such as Narcan. But let's keep  this in mind: In some cases, we hear of some of those pushers of these  drugs who also give an accompanying dosage of Narcan, recognizing that  the drug will bring that person to a near-death experience.  [[Page H5227]]    We have heard from first responders and others, law enforcement,  where someone may actually have a party where someone will remain there  expecting that someone will actually have an overdose and die in order  to bring them back to life. That is how some of these people are  seeking some of those experiences.   We have to make sure that States review their laws, as some are  doing, that if you take one of these opiates and you do have that near- death experience, perhaps that should be treated the same as a suicide  attempt, that that person is in imminent danger of harming themselves  or someone else and perhaps determine if they need an inpatient  psychiatric stay.   We have to make sure we have support of employment for those in  recovery to break the cycle of recovery and reexposure. Many times,  persons who are trying to stay clean, they can't get a job because they  can't pass the drug test, so they may be in a job and have exposure to  other people who still end up with substance abuse.   We have to make sure they have higher standards and increased  accountability for payment models that require evidence-based treatment  in halfway houses, three-quarter houses, and residential treatment  facilities.   We have to deploy certified addiction counselors to emergency rooms  because we know that, when a person comes to an emergency room, if they  see an addiction counselor there, they are not just simply given a  business card and told, ``Call someone next week and we hope you get  treatment''; but if they see an addiction counselor in the emergency  room, they increase their chances of follow-up by 50 percent, according  to a Michigan study.   We must make sure the FDA is working with companies to find  alternatives to opioids and that, again, Medicaid and other physicians  are educated on some of those aspects.   Physician training has to also be ramped up: require them to have  training in opioid prescribing practices on risk for addiction and  abuse and prescribing limited dosages. Instead of prescribing dosages  for a month, perhaps just a couple of days. In many cases, they are not  adequately trained in alternatives to opioids and the potential harm of  overprescribing.   We have to increase training requirements for healthcare providers  who deliver this medication-assisted treatment. Right now, in many  cases, they only have a few hours of training, and then they can go and  prescribe this and have very little, if any, training at all in drug  addiction counseling. Before doctors write a prescription, we can make  sure they are looking at the NASPER list or other lists as well.   In the area of law enforcement, it is critical that what is called  the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas program is made more  available, with greater access around the country.   Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have left in our segment here?    We have to make sure we have more border  security so that we are intercepting these drugs as they come across  the border.   We need funding for the post offices because, in many cases,  unwittingly, the letter carriers are the ones who are delivering to  people's homes fentanyl and other drugs.   In the incarceration system, we have to make sure we are testing  inmates for the presence of drugs in their system during their  incarceration. We can offer them medications which, upon discharge,  actually block any effects of some of these drugs.   We need to also make sure that Medicaid and other insurance  companies' payments resume immediately upon release from their  incarceration to prevent them from relapsing or returning to the drug  culture.   We also have to make sure we have solid data collection. In many  cases, when we show the charts about death rates around the country,  the charts may be grossly inaccurate. In many cases first responders,  paramedics, and coroners do not keep accurate data on these rates. The  persons themselves may not even be tested to see if they died from a  drug overdose.   There are several items in here listing what we can be doing here as  a nation, and there are many more. The point is we have fallen short  and we have seen some problems with this. There is more that we can do  and we must do in order to save lives.   I know I just have about 3 minutes left, Mr. Speaker, am I correct?    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman  from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur) to talk about some of the issues dealing with  substance abuse.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from Wisconsin (Mr. Gallagher).    I yield to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  Blumenauer).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from  Oregon, and I thank all the Members speaking here tonight. I want to  say, as you saw, this was a bipartisan coalition of Members. We are  much better off working hand in hand to pass legislation that changes  issues than standing next to each other as pallbearers for another  59,000 people in our Nation next week.   Mr. Speaker, with that and with some hope that we can pass this  legislation and save some lives, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
