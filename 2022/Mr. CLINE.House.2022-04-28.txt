 Madam Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor  the life and legacy of a good friend and Rockbridge County resident,  Bobby Berkstresser, who recently passed away at the age of 71.   Bobby was truly a kind soul who had a passion for both people and  business. In 1981, he purchased his first business, Lee Hi Travel  Plaza, in Lexington. At the time, he had only eight employees on  payroll, but over the years he grew it exponentially and was able to  expand.   When Bobby passed, he employed more than 400 people, and his second  business, White's Travel Center in Raphine was the largest east of the  Mississippi, a fact of which he was definitely proud.   He brought honor and pride to the job and, in 2018, he was honored  with the NATSO Hall of Fame Award for his contributions to the  industry.   His employees say, ``He was not only your boss, he encouraged you,  and he was family to a lot of people.'' That was certainly how everyone  felt about Bobby Berkstresser.   Aside from owning White's and Lee Hi, Bobby was deeply committed to  his community. He regularly contributed to local nonprofits, in  addition to serving on several boards, including the Bank of Botetourt,  Rockbridge YMCA, Rockbridge United Way, Rockbridge County Board of  Supervisors, former Carilion Stonewall Jackson Hospital, RALS,  Rockbridge Republican Committee, and NATSO.   Madam Speaker, it goes without saying that Rockbridge County lost a  giant. His passing will be felt by this community for quite some time,  and my thoughts and prayers remain with his wife, Sue, and his beloved  family.                                time  1030                          Rejecting the Biden Budget     Madam Speaker, as Americans face the worst rate of  inflation in 41 years, President Biden's proposed budget does nothing  to help ease the burden on our country's struggling families.   Despite experts predicting that a recession is coming, the  President's proposed budget would further exacerbate high inflation by  spending $73 trillion over the next decade and would be funded by the  highest sustained tax burden in our Nation's history.   As Americans pay record prices at the pump, this budget proposal  prioritizes radical Green New Deal energy policies and continues  Biden's destruction of American energy independence with increased  taxes on the oil and gas industry.   Who is going to feel those increased taxes? Working men and women in  the Sixth District of Virginia and across this country. Further, it  pushes unnecessary and already rejected Build Back Better social  programs and provides benefits to illegal aliens, which is entirely  unacceptable.   For my constituents in the Sixth District, I will continue to hold  Biden administration officials accountable and demand justifications  for this spending spree that is this budget when they come before the  committees on which I serve.   Madam Speaker, I stand in strong opposition to the President's  proposal, and I urge its rejection should it come before this House.                            ____________________
