 Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today to  honor two young men who gave their lives in service to the State of  Texas and the United States when their Apache helicopter crashed in  Galveston Bay, Texas, during a training mission last week in my  congressional district.   My deepest sympathies go out to the families of Army Chief Warrant  Officer 2 Lucas Lowe of Daisetta, Texas, a resident of the 36th  Congressional District, which I represent, and Army Chief Warrant  Officer 3 Dustin Mortenson of League City, Texas.   The heartbreaking loss of these two fine Texas Army National Guard  pilots, assigned to the First Squadron 149th Attack Reconnaissance  Battalion of the 36th Infantry Division, has been felt throughout our  southeast Texas community. Both men tragically leave behind a wife and  family. Chief Warrant Officer Lucas Lowe's wife, Kami, was also  pregnant with twins due next month, in February.   As a former Texas Guardsman myself, my prayers remain with all those  who have been impacted by this terrible tragedy. As the U.S.  Congressman for District 36, it is my commitment and duty to the  families to see that they get the support they need during this very  difficult time.   Please keep these families in your thoughts and your prayers. May God  bless these two soldiers, their families, and all who serve their  country.                            ____________________
