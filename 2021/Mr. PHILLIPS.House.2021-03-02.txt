 Mr. Speaker, Congress should be making it easier for  Americans to vote, not harder. That is why I am pleased to support H.R.  1, especially in the face of reprehensible efforts all around the  country to disenfranchise legal American voters.   I also believe that when a State changes its election procedures,  they have a responsibility to ensure that voters are informed of those  changes. That is why I wrote an amendment to H.R. 1 called the Voter  NOTICE Act, which simply requires States to form public outreach to  ensure that voters are proactively made aware of their voting rights.   As we are too well aware, Mr. Speaker, bad actors are all too eager  to exploit uncertainty and spread disinformation to mislead Americans  and divert the will of the people. The antidote is truth, and the Voter  NOTICE Act will deliver it.
