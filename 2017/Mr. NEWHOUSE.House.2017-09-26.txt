 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize National  Hispanic Heritage Month. Each year, Americans observe National Hispanic  Heritage Month from September 15 to October 15 to celebrate the  contributions of Americans of Hispanic descent to our Nation's diverse  history and culture.   Our central Washington communities are blessed to include a growing  number of Hispanic Americans, and I have witnessed firsthand the many  ways Hispanic Americans strengthen our communities and our way of life.  Hispanic Americans have greatly contributed to our country's history.  These Americans have enhanced our economy through entrepreneurship, and  many have served our Nation honorably in the U.S. Armed Forces.   America is truly the world's melting pot where people of diverse  backgrounds and cultures come together as one people united by shared  values. We cherish our unity and diversity. In the upcoming month, we  will celebrate Hispanic Americans' patriotism and the traditions they  add to American culture.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring National Hispanic Heritage  Month.                            ____________________
