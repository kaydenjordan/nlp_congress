 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, my bipartisan amendment would prevent  funding from this bill to be used to carry out the Defense Department's  ``unfunded priorities list.'' This list that the DOD is required to  send to Congress is simply a wish list of things that individual  commanders and generals would like to fund and by definition have been  determined nonessential to our national security.   This practice does not serve the national security interests of the  United States, and it was not mandatory until the passage of the fiscal  2017 NDAA. Mandating these wish lists only serves special interests in  the defense contractor industry eager to grow their profits by selling  expensive equipment that was not important enough to make it into the  Pentagon's own budget. This is corruption and a waste of taxpayer  dollars.   This practice has long been criticized by DOD officials and lawmakers  of both parties. Bush-appointed Defense Secretary Robert Gates all but  banned the list, strongly discouraging his generals from submitting  wish lists to Congress during his tenure. Senator John McCain, chair of  the Senate Armed Services Committee, publicly stated his skepticism of  the practice.   In fact, in response to a letter that I sent to the Department of  Defense on this practice, Under Secretary of Defense Michael McCord  said on behalf of Defense Secretary Austin: ``Therefore, the Department  supports your proposal to repeal the requirement in 10 U.S.C. 222a''-- that is, to send Congress an unfunded priorities list.   These wish lists are packed with billions of dollars of excessive  line items, this year totaling more than $17 billion on top of the $842  billion requested by the White House. The Space Force alone requested  half a billion in unfunded priorities, almost all classified.  Meanwhile, we cannot verify that the money that we authorize for DOD is  even spent responsibly because the Department of Defense has never  passed a budget audit.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues, especially those across the aisle  who are interested in fiscal conservatism, to vote ``yes'' on this  bipartisan and commonsense amendment.   I thank my Republican colleagues, Congressman McClintock and  Congressman Davidson, as well as members of my own party, Congressman  Garamendi and Congressman Moulton, who understand that this is wrong  and have worked in concert with me to rein in this wasteful spending  that has no benefit to our national security.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. McCollum), the top Democrat on the  Appropriations Committee's Defense Subcommittee.    Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Garcia).    Mr. Chair, I include in the Record the letter from Under  Secretary of Defense Michael McCord that I quoted from earlier.                                     Under Secretary of Defense,                                     Washington, DC, March 20, 2023.      Hon. Pramila Jayapal,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Jayapal: I am responding on behalf of       Secretary Austin to your letter of January 31, 2023,       regarding the submission of unfunded priorities lists (UPLs)       to Congress.        The Department appreciates your sustained commitment to our       service members, their families, and our entire work force.       We are grateful for your leadership, and we share your       commitment to maximizing the impact of every dollar Congress       appropriates.        The practice of senior military leaders providing to       Congress a list of unfunded priorities was initiated by       Congress, first as a request and, since 2017, as a statutory       requirement. This process was created by Congress and we       agree the Congress should reconsider the merits of this       approach. Every Department of Defense (DoD) budget supervised       and submitted by Secretary Austin is built to implement his       National Defense Strategy and represents the Department's       highest priorities. The current statutory practice of having       multiple individual senior leaders submit priorities for       additional funding absent the benefit of weighing costs and       benefits across the Department is not an effective way to       illuminate our top joint priorities.        Although Secretary Austin follows a similar practice to       that of former Secretary Gates by requiring that these lists       are submitted for his review, that process alone does not       effectively address the underlying issue of requiring       individual leaders to submit proposals with no necessary       connection to the Secretary's global priorities. Therefore,       the Department supports your proposal to repeal the       requirement in 10 U.S.C. 222a.        In contrast to the UPL requirement, in November 2022, after       the Congress had already decided to increase the Department's       budget, and in response to multiple Congressional inquiries       as to how higher than expected inflation was impacting the       Department, DoD  [[Page H4614]]       provided the congressional defense committees, as drafting       assistance for conference, our best assessment of the highest       priorities for additional funding, with a focus on addressing       unbudgeted inflation. This document was in lieu of, not in       addition to, any unfunded priority list submitted under 10       U.S.C. 222a.        That list included upward adjustments for various fact-of-      life increases including service member's Basic Allowances       for Housing and Subsistence rates, health care costs,       additional costs to complete military construction projects,       and fuel price impacts. The list also included other critical       emergent requirements such as the Civilian Harm Mitigation       and Response Action Plan you noted, as well as additional       funds to increase capacity to enable the Defense Industrial       Base to accelerate the replacement of defense articles being       drawn down and provided to Ukraine.        I hope that this information is helpful and look forward to       working with you in the 118th Congress. A similar letter is       being sent to the other signatories of your letter.                                                     Michael McCord     Mr. Chair, I close out by saying that we know that the  Department of Defense is necessarily a hierarchical institution where  the top leaders identify the most important priorities across a very  vast swath of departments within the Department of Defense, and they  are the ones who we confirm, frankly, to be in charge of that  appropriations request and budget.   What is happening now with this unfunded priorities list--and we have  had testimony on this in the Budget Committee and other committees--is  that these lists are just coming from people who simply do not have any  authority to determine the importance.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of the amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
