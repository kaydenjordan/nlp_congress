 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize National Gun Violence  Survivors Week and the countless Americans whose lives have been  impacted by gun violence across the country.   This issue is personal to me, as it is for so many others. When I was  16 years old, as a young police cadet, an accidental gunshot left me  paralyzed.   Last week, I had the honor of spending time with former Congresswoman  Gabby Giffords, our colleague, in my home State of Rhode Island.  Gabby's life was forever changed by a gunman in 2011, but she never  stopped fighting. She spoke of the courage it takes to stop gun  violence, courage that she embodies every single day.   So, to the parents, children, students, teachers, and countless  others who have lost loved ones to gun violence or faced gun violence  themselves, I encourage you to keep fighting.   Together, we can reform our gun laws and keep guns out of the wrong  hands and save others from tragedy.                            ____________________
