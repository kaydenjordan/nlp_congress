 Madam President, I would like to take the opportunity  to express my appreciation to Grace Steenbergen for her hard work as an  intern in my office in Cheyenne, WY. I recognize her efforts and  contributions to my office as well as to the State of Wyoming.   Grace is a native of Pine Bluffs. She is a sophomore at Baylor  University, where she studies political science with a minor in legal  reasoning and analysis. She has demonstrated a strong work ethic, which  has made her an invaluable asset to our office. The quality of her work  is reflected in her great efforts over the last several months.   I want to thank Grace for the dedication she has shown while working  for me and my staff. It is a pleasure to have her as part of our team.  I know she will have continued success with all of her future  endeavors. I wish her all my best on her journey.                            ____________________
