 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss  the Thomas Jefferson Public Service Act of 2018, a bill that will  effectively put term limits in place without amending the Constitution.   The act will reduce the salary of an elected Member of Congress to $1  a year after they serve six consecutive terms in the House, or two  consecutive terms in the Senate, and does not require a constitutional  amendment.   My home State of Florida passed term limits with 76 percent approval.  A recent nationwide poll showed that over 82 percent of the American  voters support term limits for Congress.   Is it possible a disruptive game-changing measure such as this could  instill confidence in Congress and set the stage for a wave of  innovation and accomplishment?   From Cincinnatus to President George Washington, history is replete  with examples of leaders who served their country for a time and then  returned to private life or other public service.   It is time to return to the concept of the citizen legislator.                            ____________________
