 Madam Speaker, for far too long, we have failed to  serve veterans struggling with the invisible wounds of war, veterans  who nearly gave everything to us.   From veterans who served in Vietnam and Korea to those who have  recently returned home from Afghanistan and Iraq, Congress has done too  little to curb the often-devastating effect post-traumatic stress can  have in the lives of the brave men and women who served our Nation in  combat.   That is why I am proud today to rise in support of my colleague  Representative   Steve Stivers' bipartisan bill, which will help  veterans in the Lowcountry and across this Nation manage the symptoms  of post-traumatic stress by pairing them with trained service dogs.   With the help of a service dog, many veterans with severe post- traumatic stress are able to return to work, attend college, and spend  more meaningful time with their families and their loved ones. The  brave men and women who voluntarily raised their right hands and swore  an oath to defend our Nation deserve nothing less than the opportunity  to succeed when they return home.   The PAWS Act is a critical step in the right direction. I urge all of  my colleagues to join me in supporting this bipartisan legislation.                            ____________________
