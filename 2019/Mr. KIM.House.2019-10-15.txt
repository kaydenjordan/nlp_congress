 Madam Speaker, I rise because Congress needs to take bold  action to help seniors afford healthcare.   I have talked with countless seniors in Burlington and Ocean Counties  who see the costs of healthcare rise with no relief in sight. That is  why, today, I am proud to introduce the Helping Seniors Afford Health  Care Act.   By expanding access to the Medicare Savings Program, we can help  millions of seniors afford prescription drugs and other critical care.   When our seniors can't afford their healthcare, they are forced to  decide between their own health and essentials like rent and food. That  is not a choice that any senior should have to make.   We have a chance in this Congress to make an impact for the people we  serve. We owe it to our senior citizens who have worked hard and  contributed so much to this country to help them realize the American  Dream of a healthy, affordable retirement.   Madam Speaker, I hope you stand with them and join me in supporting  this bill.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.
