 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   For 2\1/2\ years, Americans have heard Democrats in this House  criticize the historic tax cuts for exploding the debt. They have  listened to Democrats repeat that criticism even as individual income  tax revenues actually rose by $22 billion over CBO projections.   But today, Speaker Pelosi proposes a bill that is so reckless, so  outrageous, and so fiscally irresponsible that it will add $3 trillion  to our national debt overnight. And instead of hearing about the  deficit or even concerns about this pandemic, struggling Americans are  watching House Democrats push for legislation to legalize voter fraud,  give stimulus checks to illegal immigrants, bail out mismanaged State  and local governments, and restore tax breaks to blue State  millionaires and billionaires.   So, to taxpayers across America, if you have ever had any doubt about  where Democrats in this House actually stand on deficits and the debt,  watch today's vote.   Instead of surrendering our country to socialism, we need to reopen  our economy and allow Americans to safely get back to work. The  government cannot sustainably respond to this crisis or any crisis  unless and until we have taxpayers who are actually working.
