 Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to instruct at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we have unfortunate circumstances. We do not have a bill  that the majority has brought up for consideration, the Labor-HHS  appropriations bill, as I believe it is our duty. I will remind  everyone that this bill was twice delayed in the markup for Labor-HHS,  so we are trying to make the best of a bad situation.   Meanwhile, the Senate has passed a Labor-HHS-Education bill. The  Senate bill is not perfect. In fact, there is much to improve, but it  provides a foundation for conference negotiations between the House and  the Senate.   The House bill, unfortunately, despite an increase of $18 billion in  nondefense spending, the House Labor-HHS-Education bill is held to  level funding. Out of a total increase of $18 billion, the Labor-HHS- Education bill should receive an increase of about $5.5 billion, and  yet we received a zero increase, and Chairman Cole has heard me say  this over and over and over again.   This allocation means that the House bill includes no new investments  in the Child Care and Development Block Grant, nor new funding to help  students afford a postsecondary education. The House bill also  eliminates funding for family planning and teen pregnancy prevention  programs, as well as health and safety grants. It even cuts funding for  community health centers by $100 million, and the list goes on.   In addition, the House Labor-HHS-Education bill is loaded with  ideological poison pill riders, including riders to block funding for  the Affordable Care Act, block funding for family planning, block  funding for Planned Parenthood clinics, and it adds new riders to  protect Monsanto and to allow religious discrimination in child welfare  services.   However, there is one crucially important issue that is addressed in  the House bill that must be included in the final conference report.  That is the President's manufactured crisis at the border. I speak, of  course, of family separation, which has inflicted terrible trauma on  children, their parents, grandparents, siblings, aunts, and uncles.   The administration's policy of separating families is child abuse.  Experts have sounded the alarm on the lasting damage that we are doing  to these children. Parents are the buffer. With them, the children can  endure incredibly stressful circumstances. Without them, the children  are at risk of lasting mental and physical damage, and they are  suffering these wounds at our hands.   Now, months and months later, approximately 500 children who were  separated from their families remain in HHS custody. For most of these  children, their parents were deported, and HHS has been unable to  reunify these families, and unfathomably, may never be able to reunify  them.   The administration has tried to pass off responsibility of reunifying  these families to third parties like nonprofits. It is unconscionable.  In the House bill, Democrats advanced the first congressional action to  address this manufactured crisis. The full committee, I might add, on a  bipartisan basis, adopted 12 amendments. These amendments must be  retained in the final conference report.   These amendments, to discuss them very briefly, did a number of  things. They expressed the sense of Congress that families should not  be separated and that families should be reunited immediately. They  required HHS to provide Congress a plan for swift reunification, to  provide regular reporting, and to ensure the agency and its partners  are upholding the highest standards with regards to care and privacy.  [[Page H7804]]    Family separation is not the only crucial element of the conference  committees. Student safety must also be paramount, and thus, it is also  important to address the issue of guns in our schools.   Arming teachers is not the answer to school shootings, and it is  outrageous that Secretary DeVos would even consider using taxpayer  dollars on such a dangerous proposal.   If the Trump administration actually wants to keep students safe, it  should allow the Federal Commission on School Safety to consider the  role guns play in school violence, support funding for gun violence  prevention research at the CDC, and fully fund the Student Support and  Academic Enrichment Program to provide more mental health services and  bullying prevention programs in our schools.   The Secretary has said she has no intention of weighing in on whether  funds can be used or cannot be used to arm teachers. However, she  should say that this money is not there for guns in the classrooms.   In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, we must make the best of a bad situation.  Republicans are not operating under regular order and abdicating our  responsibility as the House of Representatives. Yet, as we proceed, we  need to ensure that we advance the best policy under the circumstances.  I believe that we should have had the House Labor-HHS bill come before  the floor of the House.   I urge my colleagues on the conference committee to keep these  priorities in mind as they work toward a final bill. The American  people deserve nothing less. They are already getting too little. Let  us not forget that our obligation and duty is to give people a better  chance at a better life.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1815     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New York (Mrs. Lowey), the ranking member of the Committee on  Appropriations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Scott), the ranking member of the Committee on Education  and the Workforce.    It is my understanding, Mr. Speaker, that the gentleman  needs to yield back, and then I close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   In closing, let me again urge the House conferees to look at the  Senate Labor-HHS bill as a base for improvement, and I mean seriously  to improve it.   I ask them again to please pay close attention to the priorities that  we have outlined here today. The work of the Labor-HHS bill has always  reflected our priorities as a Nation, helping to provide services that  meet our most basic needs, our health, our children's education, and  the scientific research that uncovers the cures of tomorrow. These are  challenges that only the Federal Government has the ability, the  capacity, and the resources to help us meet.   The central problem of the House bill is that it fails to meet that  threshold. The American people are tired of Congress spending trillions  in tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans while telling families and  working people that we simply do not have the resources to invest in  things that impact their daily lives. We can make those investments,  but only if we make them a priority.   I want to say to the chairman of the subcommittee, to Mr. Cole, that  we have been able to bargain in good faith over the last several years,  and that ought to be our goal in this effort, so that we can meet the  mission of what this Labor-HHS bill has at its core. It is about the  people of this country and meeting their needs.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
