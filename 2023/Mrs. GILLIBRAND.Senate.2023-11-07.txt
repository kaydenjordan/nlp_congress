 Mr. President, today, I want to tell you about a  story of love, a love between two people that is beautiful and deep. It  is the story of a couple known as Judy and Gad, two people in their  seventies who believe in humanity and in peace.   Judy is a native New Yorker who teaches English literature and  mindfulness. Gad is a chef and a jazz musician who friends describe as  funny and authentic. The couple raised four children and have welcomed  seven grandchildren. They inspire those around them with their big  hearts and their open minds.   On the morning of October 7, they were walking near a kibbutz, Nir  Oz. When rockets rained down overhead, they hid face down in nearby  fields. At one point, Judy called an ambulance because the couple had  been shot, but the ambulance couldn't reach them, and now they are both  missing.   Judy and Gad are just two of the hundreds of people held hostage by  the terrorist organization Hamas. They are peaceful, loving people who  don't deserve to suffer. But since October 7, their family hasn't heard  from them, and as the war in Gaza grows, they are concerned about the  couple's safety and well-being.   Another family in Nir Oz was also taken by the terrorists. Their  cousin, a New Yorker, has been working with my office. She says they  are ``six of the human beings she loves most in the entire world.'' She  says she won the lottery as a member of their close-knit family.  According to Alana, the New Yorker we have been working with, Danielle  is like her sister, a natural nurturer who gives great hugs.   Danielle was with her 5-year-old daughter when they were taken  hostage by Hamas. They were visiting Danielle's sister Sharon, her  brother-in-law David, and their 3-year-old twin girls. When the attack  began, the family hid in their bomb shelter as Hamas set fire to their  neighbor's house. The shelter filled with smoke and forced them out to  face the terrorists. The last time they were heard from was on a phone  call with a relative. Sharon said, ``I don't think we can survive this,  I love you'' and hung up.   While these horrors can test our resolve, the love within these  families should be an inspiration to all of us. It should strengthen  our commitment to keep fighting for their safety. In this darkness, we  must never lose that strength. To quote from an inscription written in  defiance of the Holocaust, we must ``believe in the sun even when it is  not shining.'' We must ``believe in love even when feeling it not.''                    Nomination of Ramon Ernesto Reyes, Jr.    I would now like to speak about the vote we are about to have on the  floor. I would like to stand in support of Judge Ramon Reyes, an  accomplished jurist and dedicated public servant whose breadth of  experience on and off the bench will make him an outstanding addition  to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York.   On February 9, 2023, Reyes was voted out of committee by a vote of 11  to 10. All committee Democrats voted aye. Reyes was unanimously rated  ``well qualified'' by the ABA.  [[Page S5393]]    This nominee was born in Brooklyn. He earned a B.S. from Cornell, a  J.D. from Brooklyn Law School, and his L.L.M. from New York University  Law School. In addition to an Eastern District clerkship, Reyes had a  varied legal practice over the course of 13 years, representing  corporate defendants in a large firm, helping draft legislation from  the New York City Council, handling both civil and criminal matters,  and assisting a U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York.   Reyes was appointed in 2006 to serve as the Federal magistrate judge  for the Eastern District of New York. Since taking the bench, Judge  Reyes has presided over 33 trials--15 jury trials and 18 bench trials.  They cover a range of cases that come before this district court,  including criminal matters, employment issues, and civil rights cases.   With his significant trial experience and depth of knowledge of the  district to which he has been nominated, Judge Reyes will be a  tremendous asset to the Eastern District of New York, and I urge my  colleagues to support him.   I yield the floor.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
