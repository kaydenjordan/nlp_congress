 Mr. Speaker, the 12th Congressional District is  celebrating. We are celebrating the grand opening of Covenant Community  Care, an essential health clinic on Joy Road in Detroit.   For 8 years, Covenant Community Care operated a small healthcare  clinic, limiting very much their ability to provide and serve the most  vulnerable. However, my team and I worked incredibly hard and  successfully obtained community project funding of $500,000 to expand  to a 10,000 square foot health center, tripling healthcare services for  our community.   The facility will serve 10,000 patients and offer primary care like  medical, dental, and behavioral health services. I saw it myself. It is  incredible. This increases healthcare access to people living in that  part of Detroit that is right now designated by the Health Resources  and Services Administration as a ``health professional shortage area''  and a medically underserved area.   Again, I am incredibly proud and congratulate the CEO there, Joslyn  Pettway, and the Covenant Community Care staff for their ongoing  partnership to serve and care for our communities and residents.                            ____________________
