 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life  of Georgia State Representative Jay Powell, who passed away in late  November at the age of 67.   At the time of his passing, Representative Powell had served in the  Georgia General Assembly for 10 years and had dedicated his time in  public service to helping the rural areas of our State. His colleagues  remember him as a straightforward talker and remember that, if he said  he was going to do something, he did it.   A testament to his honest character, during his tenure, he rose to be  one of the most powerful members of the assembly as the chairman of the  Rules Committee. There, he played a large part in deciding which bills  came up for a vote.   One of his most important priorities included introducing a bill that  would require small fees collected by the State, like police fines, to  be spent exactly where taxpayers are told they would be spent.   Representative Powell is going to be deeply missed in Georgia and  throughout rural Georgia. His family and friends will be in my thoughts  and prayers during this most difficult time.              Recognizing Petty Officer 2nd Class Nathan Newberg     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Petty  Officer 2nd Class Nathan Newberg for being named USO Coast Guardsman of  the Year for 2019.   Stationed in Savannah, Georgia, I am so proud that the USO recognized  Officer Newberg for his brave efforts to rescue the crew of an  overturned cargo ship off the coast of the First Congressional District  of Georgia.   In early September, Officer Newberg responded to a 3 a.m. call about  the Golden Ray cargo ship capsizing. In early September, he was  subsequently lowered from a helicopter, crossed along the side of the  ship, and descended inside to rescue the Golden Ray's captain and a bar  pilot. His effort, along with the rest of the Coast Guard, rescued all  24 of the ship's crew.   In addition to his work with the Golden Ray, he has helped evacuate  individuals with health conditions from cruise ships, worked to recover  coastguardsmen's bodies that were missing  [[Page H213]]  in action since World War II in Greenland, and completed over 125  aerial flight-hours in support of Coast Guard missions.   I thank Officer Newberg for his service to our country. I  congratulate him on being named USO Coast Guardsman of the Year for  2019.                   Recognizing National Pharmacist Day 2020     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  National Pharmacist Day 2020, which was celebrated on January 12.   According to Census data, there are over 200,000 pharmacists across  the U.S., with another 25,000 pharmacy aides. Every day, these  pharmacists are providing vaccines for a number of illnesses and  carefully counseling patients on prescriptions to help heal sickness  and reduce pain. Through this work, pharmacists are considered one of  the three most trusted professions in America.   Today and throughout the rest of the year, I encourage everyone to  visit their pharmacist, ask questions about their prescriptions, and  get to know the people who provide their medicine and work to keep them  healthy.   As the only pharmacist currently serving in Congress, I am proud to  recognize the work these individuals are doing every day to serve their  local communities around the country.                            ____________________
