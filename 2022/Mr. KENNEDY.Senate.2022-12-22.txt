 Mr. President, this bill, the Consolidated  Appropriations Act of FY23, addresses an issue that I have been dealing  with for well over a decade, since I was Louisiana State Treasurer. The  U.S. Treasury Department is sitting on nearly $30 billion in mature,  unredeemed savings bonds, issued years or decades ago to hard-working  Americans who wanted to invest in America. States, who have long held  the responsibility of holding and making available lost assets, have  tried to subject these savings bonds to the time-honored, reliable  escheatment and unclaimed property process. At every turn, their  efforts have been opposed by Treasury, which has also rebuffed any  offers from the States to use their vast capabilities to help reunite  bondholders or their rightful heirs to these funds. Instead, Treasury  has made its own attempts at digitizing and updating its voluminous  bondholder records and creating a database for users--efforts which  have failed to make any meaningful dent in the amounts of unredeemed  debt, according to their own status report.   This bill includes a provision that directs Treasury to provide  States with information relating to bond purchases, including the name,  applicable address, co-owners or beneficiaries, and the bond serial  numbers which claimants often need to reclaim their funds. I understand  that Treasury has said it may not have enough data in its records to  match the serial numbers with the name and address of the bondholder;  this is why the bill's language includes some flexibility, stating that  the information Treasury must provide to States ``may'' include bond  serial numbers. This wording allows Treasury to use its discretion in  the limited instances when it is incapable of providing those numbers,  but the overall language makes clear that Treasury is obligated to make  every effort to locate relevant and necessary information and provide  it to the correct States. I expect Treasury to issue regulations which  will fulfill these responsibilities.   The bill's definitions ensure that this will cover both paper and  paperless bonds--and I want to clarify also includes bonds that were  issued in paper but have been lost, stolen, or destroyed. Treasury's  own 2021 report on mature unredeemed debt describes the process for  bond owners who have the necessary information but not the paper  document itself as lengthy, complex, and a hindrance that discourages  claimants. The clear purpose of this legislation is to make this  process simpler by opening it up to States, and Treasury should issue  regulations reflecting this intent.                            ____________________
