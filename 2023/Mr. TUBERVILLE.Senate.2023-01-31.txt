 Mr. President, today, I want to begin by recognizing  a former colleague of mine and some of Alabama's student athletes.   The Saint James Academy Trojans in Montgomery, AL, recently won the  Class 3A Football State Championship for the first time in the school's  history. The team, no doubt, put in many long hours on and off the  field to prepare for this great, historic achievement. Winning is  always fun, but the lessons learned about dedication, discipline, and  perseverance will stay with these young men and coaches forever.   I also want to extend a special congrats to the Trojans' coach, Jimmy  Perry, on the State championship and on his recent retirement  announcement. What a way to go out.   I first met Coach Perry when I hired him in 1999 to be the director  of football operations at Auburn University. It was clear then that he  had a very bright future ahead of him in the world of coaching, and it  is fitting that his coaching career has ended with this historic  victory.   So congratulations to Coach Perry and his team at Saint James  Academy. I wish them all the best and the coach all the best in future  endeavors.                            ____________________     Mr. President, last week, I spent time on the floor  urging my colleagues to prioritize freedom in the 118th Congress. By  learning from the mistakes of overregulation in the past, we can focus  on creating a brighter future and a more prosperous future for all  Americans.   We should be doing everything we can to fix the problems created by  the government and get Americans back on their feet by unleashing our  economic potential and opening doors of opportunity. Unfortunately, too  many here in Washington are still focused on growing the size of  government and adding regulations they say will save the environment.  However, very rarely does making the government larger benefit the  American taxpayers and the American citizens of this country.   For decades, fans of Big Government have used climate change warnings  to grow their power--for decades, for as long as I can remember. They  have claimed we are near the edge of a climate cliff--a prediction they  know is impossible to prove and has never come true. Of course, they  claim the only solution to this cooked-up crisis is for you, the  American taxpayer, to sacrifice even more of your freedoms to tackle  this so-called climate dilemma. This sacrifice won't come from the  elites, who flew their private jets to Switzerland just a few weeks  ago--the ones who are crowing about this. They flew, just a couple of  weeks ago, to lecture, while they were there, the working families of  this country. No. These sacrifices are expected to be made by average,  hard-working American taxpayers. That is what they want.   They want you to give up your affordable gas for imported fuel that  is  [[Page S160]]  triple the cost. They want you to give up your ground beef for  overpriced and underwhelming meat substitutes. They want you to give up  affordable, abundant clean energy we could produce right here in  America for the enormous cost of green energy policies. They even want  you to be banned from cooking on gas stoves because how you cook in  your own kitchen is now the government's business. They want our  farmers to cut back and worry about emissions while they are focused on  feeding the country and the rest of the world, which is a huge  priority. Most importantly, they expect you, the American taxpayer, to  foot the bill for their radical climate agenda--obviously.   Well, I think I speak for most Americans when I say: No way. We  should say ``no way'' to overpriced electric cars that are made with  cobalt, processed and sold by China, and plugged into a charger that is  powered by fossil fuels anyway. How do we come up with electricity? By  fossil fuels.   We should say ``no'' to fake meats--products that taste as bad as  their price and that will eventually kill our livestock producers' way  of life. What are we trying to do--put our farmers out of business?  Exactly. That is what the climate agenda is about, even though, as we  all know, our food security is national security, and we should be  promoting domestic food production by protecting our Nation's farmers  in every possible way we can--in every way.   We should say ``no'' to unreliable energy sources and the  skyrocketing utility bills we are seeing today because America cannot  operate and achieve economic success without fossil fuels. It is  impossible. I don't know what we are trying to prove. We will come  back, but, hopefully, it is not at the sacrifice of the American  taxpayers.   We should say ``no'' to trillions and trillions of taxpayer dollars  spent on an agenda that is based only on the rantings of failed  candidates like Al Gore and John Kerry, global elites at a ski resort,  and a European teenager who needs to go back to school and learn to  read and write and learn math and stay out of politics at her age. That  agenda is based solely on fearmongering and unproven theories-- unproven--but that is how the left likes it. That is how they use  fear--to push policy. Their agenda ignores reliable clean energy  sources, like nuclear and natural gas that should be viable, but that  does not fit their narrative. That is the reason they don't talk about  it.    They know nuclear energy--nuclear energy--is the answer, but the  climate change group who continues to bark about this, they don't want  answers. They don't want to talk about nuclear because the problem  itself is too valuable for their pocketbooks and politicians'  ambitions. Instead, their narrative has created a growing--growing-- group of Americans and people around the world who now genuinely  believe they should live in fear every day. We are teaching it in our  schools, we are teaching it in clubs, and it is wrong. These are the  folks who throw soup at famous paintings while gluing themselves to the  wall and shut down city streets and major highways, calling themselves  climate activists.   For standing here on the Senate floor calling this out, some may call  me a climate change denier, so I want to be clear. As a conservative, I  believe in protecting our environment, conserving our natural  resources, and doing what we can to make sure Americans live in a  clean, safe environment, in clean communities that will last for  generations to come. But I do not believe that we need to give up our  livelihoods, our way of life, our access to affordable food and energy  because of false claims that we are just a few years away from  extinction. These claims are simply not true, and repeating them is  dangerous. Instead, I believe we should be investing--investing  heavily--in American energy production because we already produce some  of the cleanest energy on the face of the Earth.   Giving up our cars, our farms, and our affordable gas prices will do  nothing--will do nothing--to stop the changing climate. It has done it  for millions of years, and nothing we can do is going to stop that. In  fact, in recent years, the United States has only been responsible for  about 11 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions--11 percent.  In comparison, China, a country with zero plans to cut back, is  responsible for 27 percent of global emissions. China's total emissions  of greenhouse gases in 2019 were more than our country and every  developed country in the world combined.   Our adversaries, like the Chinese, have no plans--they have no  plans--to cut back their usage because their economies are growing  thanks to affordable energy. In 2020 alone, China invested almost $475  million in coal projects. That was in addition to the 1,100 coal  powerplants they already have in use--almost four times the number we  have in the United States. Guess what. They are building 350 as we  speak. They are not slowing down. Their emissions level will continue  to increase rapidly.   Meanwhile, our country's emissions have fallen by about 17 percent  since 2005, thanks--now, think about this--thanks in part to our turn  to abundant, cleaner sources, such as natural gas, of which we have a  200-year supply already under the ground in this country as we speak.  We couldn't use it in 200 years. But we refuse to dig for it, and we  refuse to use it.   Not only can we produce the world's cleanest natural gas, we also  have the ability to produce the cleanest nuclear power in all of the  world--the cleanest. We have refused to use it. We want to import the  dirtiest oil, refine it here in our country, and pollute our country  because we are too stubborn to use our own.   That will eventually change. It always goes back around. We will use  our energy and in just a short period of time. But the climate  extremists running the current administration's energy policies would  rather beg foreign countries and make deals with dictators whose  countries produce all that dirtier oil. It makes no sense.   Blaming the United States for a global problem we didn't create is  unfair to whom? The American taxpayers.   Importantly, the energy that we can and should produce at home is  terrible for our own economy--that is what they are saying. It makes no  sense.   We have to be able to do two things at once: Help our economy thrive  and promote innovation that leads to cleaner energy production. We can  do two things at one time, but a cult-like obsession with climate  alarmism is making us weaker and poorer in the name of a problem  created by politicians.   I am calling for commonsense solutions. Let American companies  produce more energy. Recognize the benefits of clean energy, like  natural gas and nuclear--that is the answer. Stop scaring people into  depression by warning of the great climate extinction. Fear is a  terrible thing to use. It is not true.   We should focus on solutions that will actually help our people. Last  year, I introduced the Restoring American Energy Independence Act. This  bill would have reversed President Biden's shutdown of American energy  and returned American energy to full production. Of course, it went  nowhere with a Democrat-controlled Senate. It didn't get to first base.  I hope to see this legislation and other sensible energy solutions put  forth in this Congress.   Sooner or later, we are going to use common sense, we are going to  start looking after our country and the American taxpayer, and we are  going to get off this high horse of thinking we have all the answers,  when we do have them here, and it is our American energy.   I hope to see this legislation and other sensible energy legislation  and solutions put forth in this Congress. We have to do something. We  can't keep punishing the American citizen and the American taxpayer,  because if we keep our energy policies woke, we are going to go broke.  This country is going to go flat broke. We are going to lose our  farmers, we are going to lose small businesses, our prices are going to  continue to rise, and it seems like nobody cares.   We better start taking care of the American people. If we unleash  domestic production, we can produce clean energy, we can make it more  affordable, and we can make life a lot simpler and better for the  American people and also our allies. Let's wake up and smell the roses.  [[Page S161]]                                ____________________
