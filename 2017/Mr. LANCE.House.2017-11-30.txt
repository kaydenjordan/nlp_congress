 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the great  work of the Energy and Commerce Committee on the Brownfields  Enhancement, Economic Redevelopment, and Reauthorization Act.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Shimkus for leading another  environmental victory to the House floor.   The brownfields program has worked and it must be reauthorized. Over  59,000 sites nationwide and 419 in New Jersey have been transformed by  remediation and redevelopment, freeing our land and water of harmful  chemicals and other hazards. This is a tremendous win for environmental  protection, economic development, and for communities that have  struggled with contaminated sites.   In the district I serve, facilities in Dover, East Amwell,  Phillipsburg, Roxbury, and Somerville are slated for revitalization.   This public-private partnership has been a winning formula, as the  brownfields program has already prompted $22 billion in private  investment across this Nation, a major return on a minimal, though  important, Federal investment.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this important legislation.
