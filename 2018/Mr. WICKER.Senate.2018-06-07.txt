 Mr. President, I rise today to comment about the economy,  but I want to observe that I am proudly wearing a seersucker suit  today. I would mention to my colleagues that Senators have worn  seersucker suits for decades, for literally centuries, on this Senate  floor.  [[Page S3283]]    This is officially Seersucker Thursday in the Senate--a tradition  that was begun by my predecessor, the former majority leader, Senator  Trent Lott of Mississippi, and has been carried on until today by the  senior Senator from Louisiana, Mr. Cassidy. It is a time for those of  us who choose to humble ourselves and call attention to ourselves at  the same time to have a little fun in a bipartisan manner and to recall  the days of old, before there was air conditioning and before we  worried so much about how we looked.   I thank Senator Cassidy for getting a bipartisan group together to  have a little fun and remember the days of old, when a lot of folks  wore seersucker suits.                Accomplishments of the Republican-led Congress    Mr. President, we ought to be smiling today because the economy is  doing so well. The economy is strong and getting stronger. We have 1  million more jobs in America than we had 6 months ago. Last month, we  added a quarter of a million jobs in just 1 month. We have a 3.8- percent unemployment rate--an excellent report, the lowest in 18 years.  So I am glad to rise this afternoon and say a word or two on the  occasion of the 500th day of the Trump administration and of a  Republican Congress. We seem to be doing things right. I hope the  American people are recognizing that.   The May jobs report was full of good news. Beyond the 3.8-percent  unemployment rate, which I have already mentioned, the number of long- term unemployed--those out of work for 27 weeks or longer--has dropped.  Wages are on the rise. These are markers of a strong, energized  economy.   Let me quote the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times. The Wall  Street Journal recently ran an editorial entitled, ``The Rising Jobs  Tide.'' It points out how much has changed for the better over the last  year and a half. There are 3 million more full-time workers than we had  when this administration began. More than 2.5 million jobs have been  added. More than 2 million of these jobs are occupied by Americans  between the ages of 25 and 34.   The editorial concludes: ``In the last year business confidence has  improved, investment is increasing and workers are reaping the  benefits.''   Those are American workers who are reaping the benefits, and I am  pleased to rise this afternoon and agree with the Wall Street Journal.   I also want to give a shout-out to the New York Times, which is  something I haven't made a habit of doing on the Senate floor. The New  York Times said that they have run out of words to describe how good  this economy is. There is widespread acknowledgement of this, and I  think it is a result of the things this Congress has been trying to do,  the things this administration has been trying to do and succeeding in  doing, putting policies in place that are designed to create jobs and  make it easier on job creators, and they are having a powerful impact.   I am proud of things we have done, like the historic tax cuts--lower  taxes. This has meant that middle-class families have more money to  live the lives they want to live. This has meant that job creators are  not losing out to foreign competition. This has meant that we have  ushered in bonuses for some 4 million Americans. Minimum wages are  going up from company to company. Energy bills are lower.   Speaking of energy, we are producing a lot more energy now, and I am  proud to have been part of that. I am proud to have been part of the  vote that allows us to explore energy in a very small part of Alaska  called the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, something our distinguished  colleague Senator Stevens stood for and worked for tirelessly when he  was alive and when he was a Member of this body.   Support for our troops and our veterans has increased. After years of  defense sequestration--which Secretary Mattis said harmed our national  security more than an enemy could have--we have ended that, and the  military is finally getting the money it needs to be prepared. This  means a modernized force. It means statutory recognition that we are  going to get to a 355-ship fleet that can respond to complex challenges  around the world.   Just recently we passed the VA MISSION Act, which allows us to  continue to improve options and healthcare choices for our veterans.   We rolled back one of the major problems that existed with ObamaCare.  We didn't get it all done, but we did roll back the individual  mandate--the law that required free Americans to buy a product or pay a  big tax whether they wanted to or not. We were able to do that as part  of the tax cut legislation, and I am proud that we took this penalty  off the backs of hard-working middle-class Americans.   We rolled back a ton of regulations. We have used the Congressional  Review Act and actually started doing that on January 20, 2017, the  first day of the Trump administration. We passed 16 Congressional  Review Act regulations and put them on the President's desk that first  day to repeal harmful, burdensome, well-intended but job-killing  regulations that had come forward in the last days of the Obama  administration.   We passed the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer  Protection Act to provide relief for our small banks, for our community  banks, so we are not treating them like some New York bank or some of  the largest banks in the country. We freed up the small banks to have a  little more ability to loan money to job creators, to small business  people seeking to borrow funds and expand their workforce, to allow  families to get a loan just a little bit easier with a little bit less  regulation so that they can lead the kinds of lives they have wanted  to.   We passed legislation to fight opioid abuse. We are not through in  that regard. We know we still have a problem. If it were easy, we would  have solved it a long time ago, but we are tackling that, and we are  accomplishing good things and getting good results.   This is a great economy. The New York Times says so. The Wall Street  Journal says so. I think Middle America says so when we are back at  home going from county to county, having our town meetings and speaking  to our constituents.   We are determined to bear down this summer. We have canceled the  August break, and I congratulate the leadership for doing that because  we have a lot of things yet to do.   We have a defense bill to pass. We are on it now, and we are going to  be on it hopefully with amendments and meaningful improvements next  week. Additionally, we are going to pass a farm bill. We are going to  pass an FAA reauthorization. We are going to pass legislation  strengthening our water infrastructure. For the first time in a long  time, our goal--our fervent belief--is that we can get back to the  practice of passing our spending bills in regular order and avoiding  this last-minute, end-of-the-year omnibus process. Nobody on either  side of the aisle likes that process, unless you are one of the one or  two people in the room writing those bills, which the President has  correctly denounced, and which the American people do not understand.    So we are going to get back to regular order, take these bills one or  two or three at a time and put them through the regular process like we  are supposed to do.   In addition to that, I hope we have an opportunity to continue  confirming conservative judges at the rate we have been. Over one- eighth of the circuit court of appeals is now comprised of new  conservative judges, appointed by President Trump and confirmed by the  Senate in the last year and a half.   So I am proud of this 500-day process. I am proud of our  accomplishments. I am proud to give this interim report and to say we  need to resolve to keep it up and build on this great record that has  given us the lowest unemployment rate in decades and the most Americans  working ever in the history of our Republic.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I have 2 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.
