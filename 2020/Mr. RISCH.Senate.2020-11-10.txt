POLICY JUSTIFICATION                        Australia--Javelin Missiles         The Government of Australia has requested to buy two       hundred (200) Javelin FGM-148E missiles with U.S. Government       technical assistance and other related elements of logistics       and program support. The total estimated cost is not to       exceed $46 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security objectives of the United States. Australia       is one of our most important allies in the Western Pacific.       The strategic location of this political and economic power       contributes significantly to ensuring peace and economic       stability in the region.        The Australian Defence Force (ADF) is seeking to fill a       short-term shortfall in its Javelin missile inventory in       order to maintain the appropriate level of readiness.       Australia will not have any difficulty absorbing these       missiles into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        These missiles will be provided from U.S. Army stocks.       There are no known offsets associated with this sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of U.S. Government or contractor representatives       to Australia.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 20-73       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The Javelin Weapon System is a medium-range, man       portable, shoulder-launched, fire-and-forget, anti-tank       system for infantry, scouts, and combat engineers. It may       also be mounted on a variety of platforms including vehicles,       aircraft and watercraft. The system weighs 49.5 pounds and       has a maximum range in excess of 2,500 meters. The system is       highly lethal against tanks and other systems with       conventional and reactive armors. The system possesses a       secondary capability against bunkers.        2. Javelin's key technical feature is the use of fire-and-      forget technology, which allows the gunner to fire and       immediately relocate or take cover. Additional special       features are the top attack and/or direct fire modes, an       advanced tandem warhead and imaging infrared seeker, target       lock-on before launch, and soft launch from enclosures or       covered fighting positions. The Javelin missile also has a       minimum smoke motor thus decreasing its detection on the       battlefield.        3. The Javelin Weapon System is comprised of two major       tactical components, which are a reusable Command Launch Unit       (CLU) and a round contained in a disposable launch tube       assembly. The CLU incorporates an integrated day-night sight       that provides a target engagement capability in adverse       weather and countermeasure environments. The CLU may also be       used in a stand-alone mode for battlefield surveillance and       target detection. The CLU's thermal sight is a second       generation Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) sensor.        4. The missile is autonomously guided to the target using       an imaging infrared seeker and adaptive correlation tracking       algorithms. This allows the gunner to take cover or reload       and engage another target after firing a missile. The missile       has an advanced tandem warhead and can be used in either the       top attack or direct fire modes (for target undercover). An       onboard flight computer guides the missile to the selected       target.        5. The Javelin Missile System hardware and the       documentation are UNCLASSIFIED.        6. If a technologically advanced adversary obtains       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures or       equivalent systems that might reduce weapon system       effectiveness or be used in the development of a system with       similar or advanced capabilities.        7. A determination has been made that Australia can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This       proposed sale is necessary to further the U.S. foreign policy       and national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        8. All defense articles and services listed on this       transmittal are authorized for release and export to the       Government of Australia.                            ____________________     Madam President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.

Transmittal No. 20-74       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(I) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The MQ-9B Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) is a weapons-      ready aircraft designed for Medium-Altitude Long-Endurance       (MALE) Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR),       Target Acquisition, and Strike Missions. The MQ-9B RPA is not       a USAF program of record but has close ties to, and builds       upon, the proven success of the MQ-9A Reaper. The MQ-9B is a       highly modular, easily configurable aircraft that contains       the necessary hard points, power, and data connections to       accommodate a variety of payloads and munitions to meet       multiple missions--including counter-land, counter-sea, and       anti-submarine strike operations. The system is designed to       be controlled by two operators within a Certifiable Ground       Control Station (CGCS). The CGCS is designed to emulate a       reconnaissance aircraft cockpit, giving users extensive means       to operate both the aircraft and sensors. The MQ-9B is able       to operate using a direct Line-of-Sight (LOS) datalink or       Beyond Line-of-Sight (BLOS) through satellite communications       (SA TCOM). The MQ-9B system can be deployed from a single       site that supports launch/recovery, mission control, and       maintenance. The system also supports remote-split operations       where launch/recovery and maintenance occur at a Forward       Operating Base and mission control is conducted from another       location or Main Operating Base (MOB).        2. The Ground Control Station (GCS) can be either fixed or       mobile. The fixed GCS is enclosed in a customer-specified       shelter. It incorporates workstations that allow operators to       control and monitor the aircraft, as well as record and       exploit downlinked payload data. The mobile GCS allows       operators to perform the same functions and is contained on a       mobile trailer. Workstations in either GCS can be tailored to       meet customer requirements.        3. The Embedded GPS-INS (EGI) with Selective Availability       Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) is a self-contained navigation       system that provides the following: acceleration, velocity,       position, attitude, platform azimuth, magnetic and true       heading, altitude, body angular rates, time tags and       coordinated universal time (UTC) synchronized time. SAASM       enables the GPS receiver access to the encrypted P(Y) signal       providing protection against active spoofing attacks.        4. The AN/DPX-7 is an Identification Friend or Foe (IFF)       Transponder used to identify and track aircraft, ships, and       some ground forces to reduce friendly fire incidents.        5. The MX-20 Multi-Spectral Targeting System is a multi-use       highly advanced EO/IR sensor that provides long-range       surveillance, high altitude, target acquisition, tracking,       range finding, and laser designation for all NATO and tri-      service laser guided munitions, enabling precision-strike       against a variety of land and maritime targets.        6. Sea Vue Maritime Multi-Role Patrol Radar is a synthetic       aperture X-band radar that provides small-target maritime       detection in high seas, maritime search (including submarine       periscopes and semi-submersibles), radar imaging of ocean       targets, and weather detection and avoidance.        7. The SAGE 750 Electronic Surveillance Measures (ESM)       System is a UK-produced digital electronic intelligence       (ELINT) sensor which analyzes the electromagnetic spectrum to       map the source of active emissions. Using highly accurate       Direction Finding (DF) antennas, SAGE builds target locations       and provides situational awareness, advance warning of       threats and the ability to cue other sensors.        8. The C-Band Line-of-Sight (LOS) Ground Data Terminals and       Ku-Band SA TCOM GA-ASI Transportable Earth Stations (GA TES)       provide command, control, and data acquisition for the MQ-98.        9. The Honeywell TPE-331-10-GD Turboprop Engine is used in       a variety of airborne platforms including the MQ-98.        10. The M6000 UHF/VHF Radio is a multi-band, portable, two-      way communication radio.        11. The KIV-77 Mode 5 crypto applique computer for IFF is       Type I certified by the National Security Agency and provides       information assurance for Mode 5 IFF equipment. The KIV- 77       is used to store the classified keys.        12. The AN/APQ-IOC Simple Key Loader is a handheld fill       device for securely receiving, storing, and transferring data       between cryptographic and communications equipment.        13. The highest level of classification of information       included in this potential sale is SECRET.        14. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures or       equivalent systems, which might reduce system effectiveness       or be used in the development of a system with similar or       advanced capabilities.        15. A determination has been made that the recipient can       provide substantially the same degree of protection for the       sensitive technology being released as the U.S. Government.       This sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign       policy and national security objectives outlined in the       Policy Justification.        16.

Transmittal No. 21-05       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The MQ-9B Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) is a weapons-      ready aircraft designed for Medium-Altitude Long-Endurance       (MALE) Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR),       Target Acquisition, and Strike Missions. The MQ-9B RPA is not       a U.S. Air Force program of record but has close ties to, and       builds upon, the proven success of the MQ-9A Reaper. The MQ-      9B is a highly modular, easily configurable aircraft that       contains the necessary hard points, power, and data       connections to accommodate a variety of payloads and       munitions to meet multiple missions, including counter-land,       counter-sea, and antisubmarine strike operations. The system       is designed to be controlled by two operators within a       Certifiable Ground Control Station (CGCS). The CGCS is       designed to emulate a reconnaissance aircraft cockpit, giving       users extensive means to operate both the aircraft and       sensors. The MQ-9B is able to operate using a direct Line-of-      Sight (LOS) datalink or Beyond Line-of-Sight (BLOS) through       satellite communications (SATCOM). The MQ-9B system can be       deployed from a single site that supports launch/recovery,       mission control, and maintenance. The system also supports       remote-split operations where launch/recovery and maintenance       occur at a Forward Operating Base (FOB) and mission control       is conducted from another location or Main Operating Base       (MOB).        2. The Ground Control Station (GCS) can be either fixed or       mobile. The fixed GCS is enclosed in a customer-specified       shelter. It incorporates workstations that allow operators to       control and monitor the aircraft, as well as record and       exploit downlinked payload data. The mobile GCS allows       operators to perform the same functions and is contained on a       mobile trailer. Workstations in either GCS can be tailored to       meet customer requirements.        3. The SAGE 750 Electronic Surveillance Measures (ESM)       System is a United Kingdom-produced digital electronic       intelligence (ELINT) sensor that analyzes the electromagnetic       spectrum to map the source of active emissions. Using highly       accurate Direction Finding (DF) antennas, SAGE builds target       locations and provides situational awareness, advance warning       of threats, and the ability to cue other sensors.        4. The Raytheon Multi-Spectral Targeting Systems-D (MTS-D)       EO/IR sensors is a multispectral Targeting System with Laser       Target Designator (LTD). A multi-use Electro Optical (EO)/      Infrared (IR) sensor provides long-range surveillance, high-      altitude target acquisition, tracking, range-finding, and       laser designation for all tri-service and NATO laser-guided       munitions, with capabilities up to and including high       definition color TV, high definition short-wave IR, medium-      wave IR, and long-wave IR sensors.

The KIV-77 is used to store the classified       keys.        16. The AN/APQ-1OC Simple Key Loader is a handheld fill       device for securely receiving, storing, and transferring data       between cryptographic and communications equipment.        17. The Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) is a guidance       set that converts existing unguided bombs (MK-82, MK-83, MK-      84, BLU-109, BLU-110, BLU-111, BLU-117, BLU-126 (Navy) or       BLU-129 warhead) into an accurate, adverse weather ``smart''       munition. The Guidance Set consists of a Tail Kit, which       contains the Inertial Navigation System (INS) and a Global       Positioning System (GPS), and a set of Aerosurfaces and an       umbilical Cover, which allows the JDAM to improve the       accuracy of unguided, general purpose bombs. The Guidance       Set, when combined with a warhead and appropriate fuze, forms       a JDAM Guided Bomb Unit (GBU). The JDAM Guidance Set gives       these bombs adverse weather capability with improved       accuracy. The JDAM weapon can be delivered from modest       standoff ranges at high or low altitudes against a variety of       land and surface targets during the day or night. After       release, JDAM autonomously guides to a target, using the       resident GPS-aided INS guidance system. The JDAM is capable       of receiving target coordinates via preplanned mission data       from the delivery aircraft, by onboard aircraft sensors       (i.e., FLIR, Radar, etc.) during captive carry, or from a       third-party source via manual or automated aircrew cockpit       entry.        a. The KMU-572 is the guidance set for a GBU-38 (500-pound)       JDAM.        18. The Laser JDAM (GBU-54) converts existing unguided       free-fall bombs into precision guided ``smart'' munitions by       adding a new tail section containing Inertial Navigation       System (INS) guidance/Global Positioning System (GPS)       guidance, as well as adds a semi-active laser seeker. This       allows the weapon to strike targets moving at up to 70 mph.       The LJDAM weapon consists of a DSU-38 sensor, a warhead-      specific JDAM guidance set installed on the bomb body, and a       fuze.        19. MK-82 Inert General Purpose (GP) bomb is a 500-pound,       free-fall, unguided, low-drag inert weapon used for       integration testing. There is no explosive fill.        20. GBU-12/58 Paveway II (PW-II) 500-pound (GBU-12) and       250-pound (GBU-58) are maneuverable, free-fall, laser-guided       bombs (LGBs) that guides to reflected laser energy from the       desired target. Employment of the LGB is the same as a normal       general purpose (GP) warhead, except the semi-active guidance       corrects for employment errors inherent in any delivery       system. Laser designation for the weapon can be provided by a       variety of laser target markers or designators from the air       or ground. The Paveway system consists of a laser guidance       kit, a computer control group (CCG), a warhead-specific Air       Foil Group (AFG) that attach to the nose and tail of MK-81       and MK-82 General Purpose (GP) bombs, and a fuze. The weapon       is primarily used for precision bombing against non-hardened       targets.        a. The MAU-169 or the MAU-209 are the CCG for the GBU-12       and GBU-58.        b. The MXU-650 is the AFG for the 500-pound GBU-12.        c. MXU-1006/B is the AFG for the 250-pound GBU-58.        21. AGM-114-R2 Hellfire II Semi-Active Laser (SAL) Missiles       are rail-launched guided missiles developed and produced by       Lockheed Martin. The guidance system employs a SAL seeker.       The SAL missile homes in on the laser energy reflected off a       target that has been illuminated by a laser designator. The       laser can be on either the launch platform or another       platform that can be separated from it by several kilometers.       The target sets are armor, bunkers, caves, enclosures, boats,       and enemy personnel. The AGM-114-R2 Hellfire II missiles use       pulse-coded laser illumination. The R2 variant includes a       Height-of-Burst (HOB)/proximity sensor. The AGM-114 R2       missiles each have a multi-purpose selectable warhead and       inertial measurement unit (IMU)-Aided Trajectories.        22. The GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb Increment 1 (SDB-1) is a       250-pound, GPS-aided inertial navigation system, small       autonomous, day or night, adverse weather, conventional, air-      to-ground precision glide weapon able to strike fixed and       stationary re-locatable non-hardened targets from standoff       ranges. It is intended to provide aircraft with an ability to       carry a high number of bombs. Aircraft are able to carry four       SDBs in place of one 2,000-pound bomb.        a. SDB I Guided Test Vehicle (GTV) is an SDB II       configuration used for land or sea range-based testing of the       SDB I weapon system. The GTV has common flight       characteristics of an SDB I All Up Round (AUR), but in place       of the multi-effects warhead is a Flight Termination,       Tracking, and Telemetry (FTTT) subassembly that mirrors the       AUR multi-effects warhead's size and mass properties, yet       provides safe flight termination, free flight tracking, and       telemetry of encrypted data from the GTV to the data       receivers. The SDB I GTV can have either inert or live fuses.       All other flight control, guidance, data-link, and seeker       functions are representative of the SDB I AUR.        23. The Joint Programmable Fuze (JPF) FMU-139 is a multi-      delay, multi-arm and proximity sensor compatible with general       purpose blast, frag, and hardened-target penetrator weapons.       The JPF settings are cockpit selectable in flight when used       numerous precision-guided weapons. It can interface with       numerous weapons including GBU-12, GBU-58, GBU-54, and GBU-      38.        24. The highest level of classification of defense       articles, components, and services included in this potential       sale is SECRET.        25. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        26. A determination has been made that the United Arab       Emirates can provide substantially the same degree of       protection for the sensitive technology being released as the       U.S. Government. This sale is necessary in furtherance of the       U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives outlined       in the Policy Justification.        27. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal are authorized for release and export to the       Government of the United Arab Emirates.                            ____________________     Madam President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.

Transmittal No. 21-03       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act, as           amended                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The AIM-120C-7/C-8 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air       Missile (AMRAAM) is a supersonic, air launched, aerial       intercept, guided missile featuring digital technology and       micro-miniature solid-state electronics. The potential sale       will include AMRAAM Guidance Sections. AMRAAM capabilities       include look-down/shoot-down, multiple launches against       multiple targets, resistance to electronic countermeasures,       and interception of high- and low-flying and maneuvering       targets. The AIM-120C-8 is a form, fit, function refresh of       the AIM-120C-7 and is the next generation to be produced.        2. The AMRAAM NDI-Airborne Instrumented Unit (AIU)       telemetry set replaces the missile's warhead, thus allowing       for secured telemetered test shots. The NDI-AIU telemetry set       is non-exportable and will remain under the control of the       U.S. Government or U.S. Defense Contractor.        3. The MK-82 General Purpose (GP) bomb is a 500 pound,       free-fall, unguided, low-drag weapon. The MK-82 is designed       for soft, fragment-sensitive targets and is not intended for       hard targets or penetrations. The explosive filling is       usually tritonal, though other compositions have sometimes       been used.        4. MK-82 Inert General Purpose (GP) bomb is a 500 pound,       free-fall, unguided, low-drag inert weapon used for       integration testing. There is no explosive fill.        5. The MK-83 General Purpose (GP) bomb is a 1,000 pound,       free-fall, unguided, low-drag weapon. The MK-83 is designed       for soft, fragment-sensitive targets and is not intended for       hard targets or penetrations. The explosive filling is       usually tritonal, though other compositions have sometimes       been used.        6. The MK-84 General Purpose (GP) bomb is a 2,000 pound,       free-fall, unguided, low-drag weapon. The MK-84 is designed       for soft, fragment sensitive targets and is not intended for       hard targets or penetrations. The explosive filling is       usually tritonal, though other compositions have sometimes       been used.        7. The GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb Increment 1 (SDB-1) is a       250-pound, GPS-aided inertial navigation system, small       autonomous, day or night, adverse weather, conventional, air-      to-ground precision glide weapon able to strike fixed and       stationary re-locatable non-hardened targets from standoff       ranges. It is intended to provide aircraft with an ability to       carry a high number of bombs. Aircraft are able to carry four       SDBs in place of one 2,000-pound bomb.        8. The Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) is a guidance       set which converts existing unguided bombs (MK-82, MK-83, MK-      84, BLU-109, BLU-110, BLU-111, BLU-117, BLU-126 (Navy) or       BLU-129 warhead) into an accurate, adverse weather ``smart''       munition. The Guidance Set consists of a Tail Kit,  [[Page S6648]]       which contains the Inertial Navigation System (INS) and a       Global Positioning System (GPS), a set of Aerosurfaces and an       umbilical cover, which allows the JDAM to improve the       accuracy of unguided, General Purpose bombs. The JDAM weapon       can be delivered from modest standoff ranges at high or low       altitudes against a variety of land and surface targets       during the day or night. JDAM is capable of receiving target       coordinates via preplanned mission data from the delivery       aircraft, by onboard aircraft sensors (i.e., FLIR, Radar,       etc.) during captive carry, or from a third-party source via       manual or automated aircrew cockpit entry. The Guidance Set,       when combined with a warhead and appropriate fuze, forms a       JDAM Guided Bomb Unit (GBU).        a. (U) The KMU-572F/B is the tailkit for a GBU-38 500LB       JDAM.        b. (U) The KMU-559B/B is the tailkit for a GBU-32 1000LB       JDAM.        c. (U) The KMU-556B/B is the tailkit for a GBU-31 2000LB       JDAM.        9. The Laser JDAM (GBU-54) converts existing unguided free-      fall bombs into precision-guided ``smart'' munitions by       adding a new tail section containing Inertial Navigation       System (INS) guidance/Global Positioning System (GPS)       guidance and adds a semi-active laser seeker. This allows the       weapon to strike targets moving at up to 70 mph. The LJDAM       weapon consists of a DSU-38 sensor, a JDAM guidance set       installed on the bomb body, and a fuze. The DSU-38 consists       of a laser spot tracker (same size and shape as a DSU-33       proximity fuze), a cable connecting the DSU-38 to the basic       JDAM guidance set, a cable cover, cable cover tie-down       straps, modified tail kit door and wiring harness, and       associated modified JDAM software that incorporates       navigation and guidance flight software to support both LJDAM       and standard JDAM missions.        10. The Joint Programmable Fuze (JPF) FMU-139 is a multi-      delay, multi-arm and proximity sensor compatible with general       purpose blast, frag and hardened-target penetrator weapons.       The JPF settings are cockpit selectable in flight when used       numerous precision-guided weapons. It can interface with the       following weapons: GBU-31, GBU-32, GBU-38, and GBU-54.        11. The AGM-154 JSOW is used by the U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine       Corps, and U.S. Air Force, and allows aircraft to attack       well-defended targets in day, night, and adverse weather       conditions. The AGM-154C carries a BROACH warhead. The BROACH       warhead incorporates an advanced multi stage warhead. The       JSOW uses the GPS Precise Positioning System (PPS), which       provides for a more accurate capability than the commercial       version of GPS.        12. The JSOW-C utilizes GPS/INS guidance and an uncooled       imaging infrared seeker for terminal guidance, Autonomous       Acquisition, and provides a precision targeting, 500- pound-      class tandem warhead that is the U.S. Navy's primary standoff       weapon against hardened targets.        13. The AGM-154E JSOW-ER adds an engine, and supporting       components, to the JSOW C Airframe. The JSOW-ER uses the 300-      pound Maverick Warhead due to its smaller size, thereby       creating room for fuel, but maintains the same penetration       capability as the JSOW C.        14. The AGM-88E Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile       (AARGM) weapon system is an air-to-ground missile intended       for Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) and Destruction       of Enemy Air Defenses (DEAD) missions. The AARGM provides       suppression or destruction of enemy RADAR and denies the       enemy the use of air defense systems, thereby improving the       survivability of tactical aircraft.        15. The highest level of classification of defense       articles, components, and services included in this potential       sale is SECRET.        16. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        17. A determination has been made that the UAE can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        18. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the Government of the United Arab Emirates.                            ____________________     Madam President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.

The EODAS provides       data directly to the pilot's helmet as well as the mission       system.        e. The Electronic Warfare (EW) system is a reprogrammable,       integrated system that provides radar warning and electronic       support measures (ESM), along with a fully integrated       countermeasures (CM) system. The EW system is the primary       subsystem used to enhance situational awareness, targeting       support and self-defense through the search, intercept,       location and identification of in-band emitters and to       automatically counter infrared (IR) and radio frequency (RF)       threats.        f. The Command, Control, Communications, Computers and       Intelligence/Communications, Navigation, and Identification       (C4I/CNI) system provides the pilot with unmatched       connectivity to flight members, coalition forces, and the       battlefield. It is an integrated subsystem designed to       provide a broad spectrum of secure, anti-jam voice and data       communications, precision radio navigation and landing       capability, self-identification, beyond visual range target       identification, and connectivity to off-board sources of       information. It also includes an inertial navigation and       global positioning system (GPS) for precise location       information. The functionality is tightly integrated within       the mission system to enhance efficiency.        g. The aircraft C4I/CNI system includes two data links, the       Multi-Function Advanced Data Link (MADL) and Link 16. The       MADL is designed specifically for the F-35 and allows for       stealthy communications between F-35s. Link 16 data link       equipment allows the F-35 to communicate with legacy aircraft       using widely-distributed J-series message protocols.        h. The F-35 Autonomic Logistics Global Sustainment (ALGS)       provides a fully integrated logistics management solution.       ALGS integrates a number of functional areas, including       supply chain management, repair, support equipment, engine       support, and training. The ALGS infrastructure employs a       state-of-the-art information system that provides real-time,       decision-worthy information for sustainment decisions by       flight line personnel. Prognostic health monitoring       technology is integrated with the air system and is crucial       to predictive maintenance of vital components.        i. The F-35 Operational Data Integrated Network (ODIN)       provides an intelligent information infrastructure that binds       all the key concepts of ALGS into an effective support       system. ODIN establishes the appropriate interfaces among the       F-35 Air Vehicle, the warfighter, the training system,       government information technology (IT) systems, and       supporting commercial enterprise systems. Additionally, ODIN       provides a comprehensive tool for data collection and       analysis, decision support and action tracking.        j. The F-35 Training System includes several training       devices to provide integrated training for pilots and       maintainers. The pilot training devices include a Full       Mission Simulator (FMS) and Mission Rehearsal Trainer (MRT).       The maintainer training devices include an Aircraft Systems       Maintenance Trainer (ASMT), Ejection System Maintenance       Trainer (ESMT), Outer Mold Line (OML) Lab, Flexible Linear       Shaped Charge (FLSC) Trainer, F135 Engine Module Trainer,       Weapons Loading Trainer (WLT), and other training devices.       The F-35 Training System can be integrated, where both pilots       and maintainers learn in the same Integrated Training Center       (ITC).        k. Other subsystems, features, and capabilities include the       F-35's low observable air frame, Integrated Core Processor       (ICP) Central Computer, Helmet Mounted Display System (HMDS),       Pilot Life Support System (PLSS), Mission Planning System       Environment (MPSE), and publications/maintenance manuals. The       HMDS provides a fully sunlight readable, bi-ocular display       presentation of aircraft information projected onto the       pilot's helmet visor. The use of a night vision camera       integrated into the helmet eliminates the need for separate       Night Vision Goggles. The PLSS provides a measure of Pilot       Chemical, Biological, and Radiological Protection through use       of an On-Board Oxygen Generating System (OBOGS) and an escape       system that provides additional protection to the pilot.       OBOGS takes the Power and Thermal Management System (PTMS)       air and enriches it by removing gases (mainly nitrogen) by       adsorption, thereby increasing the concentration of oxygen in       the product gas and supplying breathable air to the pilot.       The MPSE provides a mission planning, mission briefing, and a       maintenance/intelligence/tactical debriefing platform for the       F-35.        2. The Reprogramming Center is located in the United States       and provides F-35 customers a means to update F-35 electronic       warfare databases.        3. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        4. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        5. A determination has been made that the United Arab       Emirates can provide substantially the same degree of       protection for the sensitive technology being released as the       U.S. Government. This sale is necessary in furtherance of the       U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives outlined       in the Policy Justification.        6. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal are authorized for release and export to the       Government of the United Arab Emirates.                            ____________________     Madam President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.
