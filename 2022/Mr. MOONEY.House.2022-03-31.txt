 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Schweikert) for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, one of the latest partisan games being pushed by the  radical left is the call for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas to  recuse himself from certain cases or face impeachment.   These demands stem from an email and other digital private  communications of Justice Thomas' wife to and from government officials  at the time.   If it becomes the standard that an elected official or a judge or a  commissioner or other government appointees can be attacked because of  the views and political actions of a spouse, then everyone is fair  game.   How many members of the Democratic Caucus would like to be held  accountable for the politics or actions of their spouse? How many  governors, State legislators, or judges at any level would be able to  withstand an assault based on the beliefs of their husband or wife? No  good will come of this effort.   There are those who argue that the radical left wants such a toxic  environment. The feeling is that those who  [[Page H4057]]  wish to radically transform America know that they are facing a harsh  verdict from the American people come this November. These activist  partisans are willing to literally throw our country into a frenzy of  hate, suspicion, and personal vendetta in order to divert attention  from the failure of their policies.   I pray that the members of the Democratic Caucus making these  extremist demands are ignored and that statesmen can take the lead. But  if, once again, the Democrat leadership is so beholden to the extremist  fringe that they send us into such a fight, you will not succeed.   I thank the gentleman from Arizona for yielding me the time.
