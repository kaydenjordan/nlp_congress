 Madam Speaker, the Electoral Count Act of 1887  asserts that Congress may vote to disqualify electoral votes. It was  misused by the Democrats in 2016 and by Republicans in 2020, attempting  to interfere with the constitutionally required tally of electoral  votes. I believe both sides were wrong.   Congress has no such power, period. Think about it. Under our  Constitution, if no candidate receives a majority of electoral votes,  the election immediately passes to the House and Senate. If Congress  had the power to pass judgment on the validity of electoral votes, it  could simply invalidate enough to place the election in its own hands,  an obvious conflict of interest.   That is why the Constitution clearly mandates that the vote shall be  counted in the presence of the Congress. Disputes arising from the  conduct of elections are the sole province of the courts. Does anyone  seriously believe that a Congress of 535 intensely partisan politicians  is a safe repository for  [[Page H8043]]  the power to adjudicate the integrity of the vote? Well, neither did  the Founders.   This measure does narrow the grounds upon which the count can be  interfered with by the Congress, but it still allows Congress to  invalidate electoral votes. So it does not solve the problem, and it  creates new problems by allowing a State to delay its election for up  to 5 days after the rest of the Nation's vote is already known.   Can you imagine the chaos and suspicions that that would create? How  sad that such an important issue as the electoral count should be  handled in so clumsy and partisan a bill as this.
