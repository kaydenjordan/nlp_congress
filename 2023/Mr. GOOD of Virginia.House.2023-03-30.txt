 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my  constituent, Maneuver Training Center's Staff Sergeant Dan Abbott, who  was named Noncommissioned Officer of the Year at the Virginia Army  National Guard's 2023 Best Warrior Competition.   The Army National Guard's Best Warrior Competition is a physically  and mentally challenging 3-day competition that tests competitors on a  variety of skills. Held at Fort Barfoot, 10 Virginia National Guard  soldiers participated in this year's competition to demonstrate  commitment to the Army values that embody the warrior ethos.   Staff Sergeant Abbott, a former Active-Duty soldier who has been in  the Virginia National Guard for about 5 years, showcased his talent and  rose above the rest. He will now go on to face soldiers and  noncommissioned officers from Delaware, West Virginia, Pennsylvania,  Maryland, and the D.C. National Guard.  [[Page H1662]]    I congratulate Staff Sergeant Abbott on his outstanding  accomplishment, and I wish him great success as he continues to  represent the Commonwealth of Virginia in the next round of this  prestigious competition.                            ____________________
