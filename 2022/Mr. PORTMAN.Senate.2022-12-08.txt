 Mr. President, 12 years ago, I stood on this Senate  floor for my maiden speech. I was new to the Senate, but I had a sense  of what I thought was possible to achieve for my constituents in Ohio,  having served in the House for 12 years and in two Cabinet-level jobs  in the Bush 43 administration. In that speech, I talked about my  interest in solving problems and working across the aisle to tackle big  issues facing our country. That is what we have tried to do. We have  had some successes and some disappointments, but through it all, I have  always considered it a great honor to have been given the chance to  represent my neighbors, the people of Ohio.   My team and I have viewed it as a sacred trust to do all we could  while we had this temporary privilege. Our commitment was to move the  ball forward wherever possible for our great country and for the  families we represented. Through our legislative and oversight results,  I believe we have honored that pledge. It has been a team effort.   I have been blessed with an awesome staff--sitting behind me today-- some amazing Senate colleagues on both sides of the aisle, willing to  find common ground, friends in every corner of Ohio whose input helped  me to represent our diverse State, and most importantly, an  understanding family and a partner in all things in Jane Portman.   All of us get asked what inspired us to get into public service in  the first place. In my family, my mom Joan taught by her example that  serving others was our duty. We had no choice. And through their own  volunteer work, my brother and my sister have helped change lives, and  I respect that and respect all the caring and giving Ohioans who do  that. I chose to serve in a different way, which involved the rough and  tumble of politics--not for everybody but also a way to help others.   Another impetus for getting involved in politics was actually my  father, Bill Portman, even though, as a small business guy, he thought  I was absolutely crazy to get into this line of business. When I was a  kid, he gave up his safe job as a forklift truck salesman for a bigger  company to live out his own American dream and start his own business.  He took a big risk, gave up healthcare, gave up a retirement plan, and  five people--my mom was the bookkeeper--started Portman Equipment  Company, with lots of debt. They actually lost money the first few  years. But he never gave up on his dream and eventually, through hard  work and integrity, found his niche. My brother, my sister, and I all  worked at Portman Equipment Company in high school and in college. By  the time my dad retired and my brother took over the company, there  were almost 300 people working there.   Keeping that American dream alive and creating the conditions to  allow that next Bill Portman to take that risk, to build his or her  dream and in doing so help so many other families and help so many  communities, has really been my North Star. That is what has guided me.   Dad also played a special role in my decision to run for the U.S.  Senate. As you will recall, in the couple years before 2010, we had the  Great Recession. Our country went through some tough times. I had  stepped away from public service at that time. I was back in the  private sector, thinking I would probably not ever run again. Then my  friend and mentor Senator George Voinovich surprised all of you here in  the Senate, as well as his constituents in Ohio, with his decision to  retire, and Jane and I began thinking about it and traveling around,  talking to people. Across Ohio, people told me about the real-world  ramifications of the policy decisions being made here in Washington and  how it affected them.   I remember in early 2009 asking my dad if he would do it again. Would  he take that risk and start a business from scratch? His answer was  troubling. He said, you know, he just wasn't sure. He listed higher  taxes that were being talked about, more healthcare costs, more  regulations. He said: I just don't know if it would be worth it. That  conversation with my dad was part of what drove me to run for the  Senate. I believed that the country needed leadership to drive policy  in the direction of more economic growth and more opportunity, to help  more people achieve their American dream.   Not many people these days would say politics is an honorable  profession. A recent poll suggested only 20 percent of Americans  approve of the job Congress is doing. And I guess we all give people  reasons to be skeptical, especially when we seem too political and  partisan gridlock keeps us from solving  [[Page S7053]]  problems people care about, like energy prices or what is happening on  our southern border. But I know it doesn't have to be that way.  Politics at its best can be honorable. It is about finding common  ground to help people.    We all have our own views, and that is fine, and as elected leaders,  we certainly have a responsibility to represent our States and our  constituents. But I think sometimes we forget we were also hired to do  our best to find that common ground and to achieve results. That is  what we were hired to do.   When I need to be reminded about that, I think about my political  mentor George H. W. Bush, who gave me my first job in politics, first  on the campaign trail and then in his White House. To him, public  service was absolutely a noble calling, a way to serve, and he helped  young people like me see that by his example. In working for his son,  George W. Bush, I witnessed that same commitment to public service.   In my Senate office, as these folks behind me can recite, we have a  mission statement, and we developed it together. It says the following:         Our mission is to deliver bipartisan results through       effective servant leadership with integrity, selflessness,       and excellence so all Ohioans can reach their God-given       potential.    What is servant leadership? I think it begins with the respect for  constituents by listening to them and understanding their concerns and  then, whenever possible, delivering those results for them, from case  work to legislation.   During my time in the Senate, I am proud of what we have been able to  accomplish for Ohio and the country by trying to follow that formula. I  am told by my staff today that as of this week, over the past 12 years,  there are 195 bills that I have authored or coauthored that have been  signed into law. By definition, almost all are bipartisan and the  product of the back-and-forth that leads to that common ground.   Not all of these bills are monumental; I will say that. And my  constituents will never hear about the vast majority of them because  they aren't controversial and therefore the media doesn't cover it, but  they make a difference. As an example, a bill I wrote with Senator  Hassan is on the President's desk today, about early hearing  detection--not the most pressing issue to many people but to the Ohio  family whose child's hearing loss will be diagnosed early, it can be  life-changing.   These accomplishments are a testament to the willingness of Members  and staff on both sides of the aisle to find a way to achieve mutual  objectives by listening and respecting different points of view. By  doing that even during a time when there is so much distrust and  dysfunction, we have been able to achieve a lot together. Today, I want  to touch on a few of those areas. Don't worry, it is not going to be  195, but a few of them.   Thanks to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob  Menendez and Ranking Member Risch for working with me on a number of  bills, including the establishment of the Global Engagement Center with  Senator Murphy that is combatting the growing threat of disinformation  and propaganda.   Thanks to the leaders of the Finance Committee, Chairman Wyden and  Ranking Member Crapo, for working with me on so many bills, including  working this week with my friend Ben Cardin and me on our retirement  bill.   Senator Cardin, thanks for being my partner for over 20 years on  successfully expanding retirement savings and a bunch of other issues,  from hospice to Israel, to IRS reform, to affordable housing. I dragged  him into IRS reform; he didn't want to do it.   As the ranking member of the Homeland Security and Governmental  Affairs Committee, I would like to thank all my committee colleagues  and the chairman, Gary Peters. While we may hail from different  States--in fact, he hails from that State to the north, and as an Ohio  State fan, I have to make that point--we are friends, and we have been  able to accomplish a lot in the last couple of years, from helping  protect houses of worship, to essential postal reform, to combatting  cyber attacks. I have been proud of the work we have done at HSGAC,  where I have served for the last 12 years.   The bipartisan investigations I spearheaded as chair of the Permanent  Subcommittee on Investigations with Senator Carper led to the end of  websites like backpage.com that allowed the trafficking of women and  children online.   I also led efforts to ensure our Federal Government doesn't allow  human trafficking to occur with the influx of unaccompanied minors  crossing our U.S.-Mexican border. Our bipartisan oversight on the  safety of unaccompanied children crossing the border demonstrated that  Federal Agencies must implement reforms immediately to ensure the  safety and security of these vulnerable children.   Our 18-month bipartisan PSI investigation that detailed how drug  traffickers exploit vulnerabilities in our international mail system to  easily ship synthetic, illegal narcotics like fentanyl from China into  the United States through the Postal Service led to the successful  implementation of the STOP Act.   Through a bipartisan investigation, we also found that China has been  targeting and stealing U.S. taxpayer-funded scientific research and  intellectual property through its talent programs. Essentially,  American taxpayers have been unwittingly funding the rise of China's  military and economy over the past couple of decades, while Federal  Agencies have done little to stop it.   With Senator Carper, I introduced the Safeguarding American  Innovation Act to require the Federal Government to take decisive  action to safeguard our intellectual property, our inventions, our  research here in America. It has passed the Senate--thank you.   I am disappointed certain House Members have blocked it, and I urge  my colleagues to get it enacted in the next Congress.   Our investigations this year also revealed China's malign efforts to  target, influence, and undermine the U.S. Federal Reserve. We must do  more to safeguard our homeland from the threat of foreign adversaries,  especially China.   I appreciate Senator Heinrich for launching the bipartisan Senate  Artificial Intelligence Caucus with me to ensure thoughtful, bipartisan  policymaking on AI. Fifteen of our bills to ensure safe and coordinated  use of artificial intelligence have now become law.   Since 2015, when my bipartisan Federal Permitting Improvement Act was  signed into law as title 41 of the FAST Act, I have worked to update  our aging infrastructure and create good jobs, while expanding and  streamlining the permitting process.   Thanks to Senator Sinema and Senator Sullivan for their passion on  this issue and their leadership in passing the Federal Permitting  Reform and Jobs Act to make these key provisions of FAST-41 and the  permitting council permanent, which speeds up the permitting process  for some of the largest infrastructure projects, resulting, by the way,  on average, with a 45-percent time savings and major cost savings. We  should expand that.   I also want to thank the bipartisan group of Senators who worked with  me on the historic infrastructure bill, with a special thanks to my  lead democratic partner, Senator Sinema, along with Senators Collins,  Romney, Cassidy, Murkowski, Warner, Shaheen, Tester, and Manchin.   Every President and every Congress in modern times has talked about  the need to fix our aging infrastructure, but we worked from the middle  out to form a bipartisan coalition of 69 Members to go beyond the talk  and make some of these needed and historic improvements to our Nation's  roads and bridges, ports and rail, upgrade our Nation's broadband  system, and so much more.   The process to me was almost as important as the substance. We did it  by focusing on our key principles of core infrastructure only, no tax  hikes, and bipartisan consensus. I was proud to team up with each one  of you, and I thank you for your willingness to find that elusive  common ground and so do people in my hometown.   We have heard politicians talk about fixing the Brent Spence Bridge,  which connects Ohio to Senator McConnell's State of Kentucky. For over  30 years, we have been talking about it. It is at the confluence of two  major interstate highways and currently carries more than 160,000  vehicles a day, which is twice as many as it was ever designed to  carry.   It has no shoulders on the bridge because they have been eliminated  to  [[Page S7054]]  carry more traffic, which makes it unsafe, and it is still congested at  every rush hour. Local, State, and Federal stakeholders have never been  able to come up with a way to solve this problem. The bipartisan  infrastructure law finally paves the way to fix the Brent Spence  Bridge, which not only makes travel safer and easier for Ohioans but  improves the movement of goods throughout the Midwest and actually  strengthens our national economy.   There are so many people I would like to recognize--and apologies in  advance for those I will miss. Senator Blumenthal, thanks for working  with me on one of the greatest humanitarian and civil rights causes of  the 21st century: human trafficking. We started a caucus, and we have  enacted a number of bills to address trafficking, including ensuring  justice for victims of sex trafficking and holding internet sites  accountable to prevent the facilitation of trafficking, the one time  that Congress has been able to successfully eliminate the section 230  immunity.   Senator Whitehouse has worked with me to change the way addiction is  addressed in this country by offering the Comprehensive Addiction and  Recovery Act to provide a broad response to the opioid crisis. It  provides individuals with the evidence-based treatment and recovery  services they need.   I think looking at addiction as a disease is probably the most  important thing we did in that legislation, in addition to the  significant funding. I want to thank Senator Blunt, whom I see here,  for his role on the Appropriations Committee for funding the Federal  Government's addiction programs at record levels. Senator Capito has  been right there with him.   Senator Klobuchar and I worked to pass the STOP Act, effectively  keeping China from shipping fentanyl through the U.S. mail, and Senator  Capito and Senator Manchin have worked with me to pass important bills  on scheduling fentanyl analogs to make sure that it is illegal.   I have been deeply and personally engaged on the substance abuse  issue for over 25 years, when I started my own antidrug group in Ohio  that has become, over time, a model prevention coalition and enacted  the Drug-Free Communities Act that has helped spur the establishment of  about 2,000 community coalitions around the country. By the way, I  worked on that with Senator Chuck Grassley when I was in the House.   In fact, Chuck took me to Iowa with him to help set up an antidrug  coalition there. That was almost as interesting as going as his guest  to the Iowa State Fair when I was U.S. trade representative.   Senator Shaheen and I have worked over the years on so many foreign  policy issues, as well as energy efficiency. We introduced our first  energy efficiency bill in 2011 and gotten most of it signed into law in  the years since, helping reduce energy bills for families and  businesses and actually reduce emissions by simply using less energy.   And I thank my college classmate Senator Hoeven for his leadership on  our energy efficiency bill and his all-of-the-above energy approach  and, mostly, for helping me improve my Spanish by adding a North Dakota  accent. I also want to thank Senator Bennet for our successful efforts  on encouraging carbon capture and sequestration. Our legislation is  starting the work to do that.   I appreciate Senator Stabenow's partnership as my cochair on the  Great Lakes Task Force. Working with her and all members of the task  force, we have made a lot of progress fighting harmful algal blooms and  invasive species, and so many other issues important to our  constituents along the world's largest freshwater resource.   Thanks to Senator Kaine, as my cochair of the Career and Technical  Education Caucus, who worked with me to challenge Congress to do more  to address the Nation's skills gap and promote the JOBS Act, providing  individuals with the skills they need to get good-paying jobs. Those  skills are needed out there. We need to focus more on how we ensure we  are not just spending money to send young people to college but also  getting them the industry-recognized skills that they need.   Senators Coons, Burr, and Whitehouse, as cochairs of the  International Conservation Caucus, you have been great partners over  the years on our legislation to combat wildlife trafficking, conserve  forests, and develop strategies to protect some international  treasures, like the Okavango Delta in southern Africa.   I appreciate Senators Warner and King and former Senator Alexander  for working with me to pass the Restore Our Parks Act, which is finally  addressing the massive deferred maintenance backlog at our national  parks so that some of our Nation's most treasured landscapes,  memorials, and monuments can be enjoyed by visitors and generations to  come.   Because of the CHIPS and Science Act, a bipartisan legislation I  worked on closely with my colleagues Senators Young, Tillis, Sinema,  and Schumer, Intel recently broke ground on its semiconductor plant  outside of Columbus, the largest investment in the history of Ohio and  an investment we believe will grow over time.   With the CHIPS Act now law, we can reverse this trend of this  critical semiconductor manufacturing capability being sent overseas. It  is going to create thousands of high-paying jobs here but, most  importantly to me, help strengthen our national security.   These remarks would be incomplete without a reference to our work on  tax reform. As I mentioned when I decided to run for the Senate in  2009, Ohio was losing jobs and our economy was falling behind. My  campaign was based, in part, on a plan for jobs that focused on a  number of economic policies, including fixing our Tax Code, making it  competitive again for American workers and businesses.   In 2017, one of the highlights in the Senate for me was when I was  able to work with a small group of lawmakers--Pat Toomey, Tim Scott,  John Thune--to help deliver on this promise with the Tax Cuts and Jobs  Act, the first time Congress had passed comprehensive tax reform in 31  years.   It cut taxes for middle-class families, reformed our Business Tax  Code to create more jobs and higher wages for Ohio workers, and it  updated our International Code to encourage employers to actually bring  jobs and investment back here to America.   I wish it could have been more bipartisan, but, frankly, much of what  I led on the international side had absolute bipartisan roots, and I  believe it worked. Tax reform helped usher in a period of unprecedented  economic growth felt broadly. After tax reform and before the pandemic,  we had 19 straight months of wage gain of 19 percent or more, well  above inflation, and most of the wage gains, by the way, went to lower  income and middle-income workers.   We also had the lowest poverty rate since we started keeping track of  it back in the 1950s and the lowest unemployment rate ever for Blacks,  women, Hispanics. It was an opportunity economy.   Unfortunately, a lot of those gains have been washed away by the  pandemic in an avalanche of stimulus spending over the last 2 years  that has fed the demand side of the economy while supply has been  constricted by COVID but also by regulations, particularly in energy,  contributing to the highest inflation in 40 years.    I hope the new Senate will have an opportunity to reset and, working  with the House, make pro-growth economic policies a higher priority.   I want to thank so many of my colleagues who have worked with me over  the years to support Ukraine in its ongoing fight for freedom. This is  an issue near and dear to my heart and to Ohio. As some of you know, we  are the home of many Ukrainian Americans and other nationality groups  that are committed to the goal of a free and independent Europe.   I want to thank Dick Durbin, the cofounder and cochair with me of the  Ukraine Caucus and my Republican colleagues in the caucus who are so  passionate on Ukraine: Senators Graham, Wicker, Cramer, Cotton,  Barrasso, Risch, Burr, Murkowski, Sullivan, Cornyn, McConnell, Johnson,  Ernst, and others. And I want to thank all those who joined me on 10  trips to Ukraine since 2014, when Ukraine rose up and threw off a  corrupt Russian-backed government and turned to us, turned to the West.  This includes two recent sobering visits to Ukraine with Senators  Klobuchar and Coons.  [[Page S7055]]    In 2015, I authored a bill called the Ukraine Security Assistance  Initiative, which has become the key funding account we have used to  train and equip the Ukrainian Armed Forces. We need to continue to fund  this account and lead the free world, carrying the torch of freedom.   Since Russia's original occupation of Ukraine escalated into a full- scale war on February 24 of this year, I have now spoken on the Senate  floor 27 times--every week we have been in session--about the  unprovoked, illegal, and brutal invasion of Ukraine.   My most recent speech was last night so I won't go on, except to say  that we are at a critical juncture right now, and it is more important  than ever that we support Ukraine. So I am going to be fighting hard  for a continuation of aid to Ukraine before Christmas.   We just discussed so many examples of breaking through the partisan  gridlock and getting things done. Despite these achievements, I do  worry about the divisive political rhetoric in our country. It is  important we restore faith in our democratic institutions, both for our  own country's sake, and so we can continue to be that beacon of hope  and opportunity to the rest of the world.   We can rise above the cynicism and the dysfunction. We just talked a  lot about how that is happening and has happened over my last 12 years  in this body.   We certainly did it on infrastructure, as I have outlined, and we  have done it in so many other ways. I urge all of us to remember that  there is more that unites us than divides us. I hope that one of the  things we can agree on is the need to uphold this institution and what  it stands for.   I strongly believe that means preserving the legislative filibuster  that protects the rights of the minority in the Senate and is really  the only thing that forces us to work in a bipartisan way. The result,  when we find common ground, is better legislation that will stand the  test of time and not be changed every time there is a change in the  majority in this body.   Our country and this body face enormous challenges, whether it is  economy, record inflation, the national debt that is robbing future  generations, the absence of any real border security in our broken  immigration system, or the looming insolvency of our entitlement  programs. These issues won't be solved by one party running over the  other and imposing its will on the Senate and the country. It will only  be solved by us working together in good faith.   At the start of my remarks today, I said that serving the people of  Ohio is the greatest honor of my life. Over the past 12 years, I have  worked well with my colleague and friend from Ohio, Senator Sherrod  Brown, on issues important to our State.   Sherrod, we have canceled each other's votes out many times on the  floor of the Senate, but we have also figured out how to work together.  And I am proud of the work we have done on issues that are important to  Ohio, like the Great Lakes, trade enforcement, addiction, and important  judicial nominations like the district court judge we just confirmed  this afternoon.   Despite our differences, we made progress for Ohio together. I hope  you will have the same type of relationship, a good working  relationship, with my friend Senator-elect J.D. Vance. J.D. has an  impressive background of service in our military and in the private  sector. I know he wants to make a difference in the lives of Ohio  workers and families, and I look forward to watching him in action here  in the Senate.   I know what it is like to be in public service with young children so  I want to wish J.D., his wife Usha, and their three kids well. Jane and  I support you both.   Thanks to everyone who has served on Team Portman throughout my  career--the first Bush White House, the House of Representatives, the  USTR, the OMB, and here in the Senate. We are having an alumni event  tonight with a couple hundred of some of the best public servants ever  assembled, and Jane and I are looking forward to seeing you all there.  I have an amazing Senate staff who stuck with me to the bitter end.  Thank you, both in Ohio and in Washington, DC. Many of them are here in  the Chamber today.   I want to thank them for their hard work and their dedication to  getting things done. They worked really hard for the people of Ohio and  for our country and have enabled us to be so much more effective.  Nothing we accomplished would have been possible without you.   I want to thank everyone who works in the Senate and makes it  function well, whether it is the cloakroom staff, the doorkeepers, the  Capitol Police, the cafeteria workers, the subway drivers, all of them  in a very practical way. Democracy functions because of you, so thank  you. I hope many of you can join us at our thank-you reception for you  on Friday afternoon.   Special thanks to Leader McConnell. Mitch, I appreciate your  encouragement over the years. Your trust in me to take on a leadership  role on important assignments and for your commitment and devotion to  this institution and the health of our democracy.   None of this works without having a loving and supportive family. All  of you know that. So to my wife Jane and the three people in the world  I am most proud of--Jed, Will, and Sally--thank you for your  unconditional support and the sacrifices you made. I am looking forward  to being in Ohio full time, spending more time with family and friends,  the Golden Lamb--our family restaurant--and getting back to the private  sector. And, somehow, I hope to stay involved in the public policy  issues we have been talking about today.   Finally, thanks to my Senate colleagues who made coming to work every  day enjoyable and productive. Thanks for reaching out to me to work  together and accepting my offers to work with you. Relationships matter  in this place. I will miss my colleagues.   One consolation is that our retiring class consists of good friends  who I hope to cross paths with in the real world. Senators Blunt, Burr,  Inhofe, Leahy, and Toomey have all made impressive contributions in  their tenure here. I am thinking maybe we should start a post-Senate  support group.   And, come January, this place loses a great intellect and a great  friend--Ben Sasse.   And I think, Ben, you should hold the meetings at the University of  Florida, if it is OK.    OK. Done.   So to my colleagues, I have worked with every one of you in one way  or another. Thank you for that privilege, and Godspeed as you continue  to serve your constituents and continue to carry that torch of freedom  forward.   Thank you.   (Applause, Senators rising.)    Madam President, we have talked about more important  legislative measures, and I just want to say thank you to all of my  colleagues and to my colleague from Illinois who spoke and to the  others who were overly generous in their comments. I appreciate it. I  think my mom would have believed it, and my dad would have liked it.   Seriously, you can see why I will miss this place and why I believe  that these colleagues, who talked all about the need for us to find  that common ground and make a difference for our constituents, are  people I have enjoyed working with and look forward to staying in touch  with.   So this is a bittersweet moment. I am looking forward to getting back  to Ohio full time with family and friends, as I have said, and the  private sector. I have a deep respect for my colleagues, and I thank  them for being on the floor today even though the jet fumes can already  be smelled and people are already heading back for their weekends and  important meetings back home.   So thank you, Madam President.   I yield the floor.
