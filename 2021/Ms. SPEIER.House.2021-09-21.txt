 Mr. Speaker, to the members of the Rules Committee, I  appreciate the hard work that you have put into getting this bill to  the floor.   I am only going to speak about one issue in this particular NDAA,  something that I have been working on for 10 years.   This is a helmet that was given to me by sexual assault victims in  our military.   Since I started working on this issue, 200,000 soldiers, sailors,  marines, and airmen have been sexually assaulted in  [[Page H4569]]  the military, 20,000 a year. We have spent $2 billion on programs in  those 10 years that have yielded us nothing but more sexual assaults.   Finally, in this very bill, we are doing what we should have done 10  years ago. We are taking these cases out of the chain of command and  making the decisions by those who are professionals, who are lawyers,  who are trained, along with the investigators, so that we will have a  situation where sexual assault victims feel like they can come forward  and file their cases.   I have had too many servicemembers say to me that they were ready to  fight against the enemy that was outside the wire; they never thought  the enemy was going to be a fellow soldier.   I am grateful to all my Republican and Democratic colleagues who have  recognized, finally, it is time to put their safety first.                                time  1645     Madam Speaker, I am proud to speak in support of this  bill which passed out of our committee with overwhelming bipartisan  support.   This year's NDAA continues the committee's tradition of improving the  lives of servicemembers and their families by supporting a 2.7 percent  pay raise; increasing parental leave for new mothers and fathers,  including adoptive and foster parents; expanding financial assistance  for in-home child care; improving the legal representation for  exceptional family members; and demanding an independent review of  suicides.   Following the horrifying murder of Specialist Vanessa Guillen and a  ground swell of activism from survivors of military sexual trauma, H.R.  4350 also boldly confronts sexual assault and harassment in the  military, which has been one of my top priorities for a decade, by  removing the commander from decisions related to prosecution of special  victim crimes, improving sexual harassment investigations, and  continuing to improve military criminal investigative resources.   It also establishes standalone offenses for sexual harassment and  violent extremism under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.   These reforms will increase trust in the military justice system and  encourage survivors of sexual violence to come forward. The bill also  requires an independent review of whether to transfer additional  offenses such as murder that are out of the chain of command.   Where servicemembers serve, so do their families. That has been our  mantra on this subcommittee, which is why this bill ensures that the  military health system continues to have sufficient providers to meet  beneficiaries' healthcare needs.   H.R. 4350 also improves services covered under TRICARE, including  contraception, without copays.   Together, servicemembers and their families make sacrifices for our  Nation, and we must continue our commitment to them.   I want to thank the ranking member, Congressman   Mike Gallagher, the  extraordinary staff of the committee: Ilka Regino, David Giachetti,  Hannah Kaufman, Glen Diehl, and the fearless Staff Director Paul  Arcangeli, and also Josh Connolly and Brian Collins from my staff.   Thanks to Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Rogers for an  extraordinary NDAA.
