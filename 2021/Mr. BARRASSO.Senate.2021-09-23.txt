 Madam President, I come to add my voice to that of Mr.  Cruz, the Senator from Texas, about Joe Biden's surrender to Vladimir  Putin.   Energy is called the master resource for a reason. It powers our  country, powers our military, powers this Nation, powers the economy.  And yet Joe Biden, on his first day in office, seemed to take us from a  nation of energy dominance to energy dependence, canceling the Keystone  Pipeline and now approving this pipeline, Nord Stream 2.   I come to add my voice to all of those, and there are many who have  spoken out against the President in expressing our deep concerns about  this administration's unwillingness to fully sanction the Nord Stream 2  Pipeline and to allow it to move ahead.   I am sure Senator Cruz, as part of his discussion this afternoon,  will talk about the confirmation hearing of Tony Blinken to be  Secretary of State. We asked him specifically about the pipeline, and  he said he would stop it, no matter what. Even though it was down to  the last--I think he may have said--100 yards, they would stop it.   That is not what happened. We saw Joe Biden surrender.   For years, we have been sounding the alarm about this Russian trap.   This pipeline, who built it?   Gazprom.   Who are they?   They are the Russian state-owned natural gas monopoly.   We have all quoted and, in the past, have heard Senator McCain talk  about Russia, a country acting as a gas station or a gas station acting  as a country. I think one time he went on to say that Russia was a  Mafia-run gas company disguised as a country.   This dangerous pipeline is going to double the amount of Russian  natural gas going to Germany via the Baltic Sea. Completion of the Nord  Stream 2 Pipeline is going to further tighten its grip on European gas  supplies and extend the threatening influence because, as I said  before, energy is the master resource.   We know Russia uses energy to coerce and to manipulate. They use it  as a geopolitical weapon. They coerce and manipulate our allies and our  partners  [[Page S6645]]  in Europe. Many of our NATO allies--Germany, in particular--are  becoming dependent upon and addicted to Russian gas. Europe already  gets 40 to 45 percent of its gas imports from Russia. The new export  pipeline helps Russia undermine Europe's efforts to diversify energy  sources, suppliers, as well as the routes.   Nord Stream 2 makes Europe more energy dependent on Russia and, of  course, more prone to Russian influence. At the same time, it is going  to further fuel Russian aggression, Russian intimidation, and Russian  instability across Europe.   Putin is a powerful foe who aims to divide Europe and to destroy the  NATO alliance. He has been broadcasting those plans. This is not a  surprise. The Nord Stream 2 Pipeline would mean a massive money  transfer from our NATO allies straight into the Kremlin's coffers. This  means more resources to put toward Russia's destabilizing activities.   And we continue to see an increase in these destabilizing activities.  Russia occupies territory in Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova. Russia  launched a military buildup on Ukraine's border. Russia poisoned and  then imprisoned a political opposition leader. Russian hackers are  creating economic chaos by disrupting American supply chains.   Russia could use these cash reserves in what way? Well, a way to fund  aggression in Europe and around the world. And it is interesting that  Putin even funds environmental activists in Europe to shut down energy  where they would be exploring for natural gas and oil. He wants  environmental activists to protest any efforts for the European  countries to develop their own gas resources so he can hold them  hostage in this way as well.   Well, President Biden's weakness on Putin's pipeline is going to have  serious consequences, not just the financial ones for Russia and not  just those in Europe but worldwide. And for our security and for the  security of our allies, I believe we must stop this Nord Stream 2  Pipeline.   That is why Congress has overwhelmingly, this body, passed several  pieces of bipartisan legislation. You know, people say to me: Can't you  do anything in a bipartisan way in Congress anymore?   I would say: Well, we certainly did when it came to the Nord Stream 2  Pipeline. We passed bipartisan legislation imposing sanctions on this  very project.   Yet, this administration, the Biden administration--the surrendering  Biden administration--is unwilling to implement the laws that are on  the books. President Biden waived congressionally mandated sanctions on  Nord Stream 2 AG, which is the company overseeing the pipeline  construction. By using a national interest waiver, this administration  gave Russia the green light to speed ahead to completion of this  pipeline.   Look, there is strong opposition to President Biden's deliberate  failure to follow the law when it comes to this pipeline and the supply  of energy from Russia to Europe.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the  Record a letter dated March 3 of this year in which I led a group of 40  Senators in outlining our concerns.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                      March 3, 2021.      Hon. Joseph Biden,      President of the United States,      The White House, Washington, DC.        Dear President Biden: We write to express our deep concern       about the refusal of the Administration to impose sanctions       on entities involved in the Nord Stream II pipeline. With       construction on the project currently taking place, there is       publicly available information on vessels and companies       engaging in sanctionable activities. The failure of the       Administration to identify and impose new sanctions signals       its willingness to allow President Putin to gain a       stranglehold over Europe's gas supplies and increase its       geopolitical leverage. We call on the Administration to       correct its misguided actions by quickly and fully       implementing the sanctions mandated by U.S. law.        The Protecting Europe's Energy Security Act (PEESA), as       amended by the Protecting Europe's Energy Security       Clarification Act (PEESCA), mandates sanctions on the       companies and individuals involved in the Nord Stream II       pipeline. The law requires sanctions against entities       installing pipes, engaging in pipelaying activities. or       insuring or certifying that installation, those activities,       and other activities associated with the pipeline. As       construction is under way, time is of the essence. The United       States must act now to prevent the pipeline from being       completed.        For years, it has been the policy of the United States to       oppose the Nord Stream II pipeline, which would carry natural       gas from Russia across the Baltic Sea to Germany. The intent       of Congress is crystal clear. Congress overwhelmingly passed       several pieces of bipartisan legislation imposing sanctions       on this project including the Countering America's       Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), PEESA, and       PEESCA. The Administration cannot turn a blind eye to those       who violate our laws. We request the Administration utilize       all of the tools at its disposal to implement additional       sanctions immediately, especially the most recent round of       sanctions in PEESCA that both houses of Congress urgently and       repeatedly passed last year.        On February 19, 2021, the Administration submitted a       congressionally mandated report on entities actively       supporting, assisting, and working with those involved in the       Nord Stream II pipeline. The Administration made the       troubling decision to identify only the Russian pipelaying       vessel Fortuna and its owner KVT-RUS, both of which were       already sanctioned under the Trump Administration in January.       The report also listed 18 entities which have ended their       involvement in the project, due to the extensive diplomatic       efforts of the Trump Administration to wind down their       activities. This completely inadequate report undermines the       bipartisan efforts of Congress and previous Administrations       by not listing the other vessels involved in pipelaying and       pipelaying activities as well as companies providing       insurance and certification services.        We call on you to fix this error by immediately identifying       and sanctioning the additional entities without delay. While       sanctions are being quickly processed on individuals and       companies, we ask you to formally notify these entities of       the forthcoming sanctions and call on them to stop their work       on the Nord Stream II pipeline. In addition, PEESCA also       mandates consultation with our allies, which must be       conducted and concluded expeditiously.        As you have previously stated, the Nord Stream II pipeline       is a ``bad deal for Europe.'' This point has been clearly       demonstrated by Europe's growing opposition to the project.       On January 21, 2021, the European Parliament overwhelmingly       passed, by a vote of 581-50, a resolution calling on the       European Union to immediately stop the completion of the Nord       Stream II pipeline. Previously, on December 12, 2018, the       European Parliament passed a resolution describing the Nord       Stream II pipeline as a ``political project that poses a       threat to European energy security'' that should be       cancelled. It passed by a vote of 433-105.        The Nord Stream II pipeline makes American allies and       partners in Europe more susceptible to Moscow's coercion and       malign influence. It would reinforce Russia's near-monopoly       and control of natural gas in the region. In addition, the       project would weaken efforts to diversify Europe's energy       sources, suppliers and routes. The Nord Stream II pipeline       would also provide Russia an opportunity to damage the       economy of Ukraine and to further its aggressive actions in       the region.        We appreciate your statements as well as those made by       members of the Administration publicly opposing the Nord       Stream II pipeline. It is now time to act. It is critical       that the United States enforce our laws and hold those       entities accountable for assisting Russia in building this       dangerous pipeline.            Sincerely,          John Barrasso, James E. Risch, Ron Johnson, Ted Cruz,             Cynthia Lummis, James M. Inhofe, Steve Daines, Joni             Ernst, Kevin Cramer, Marco Rubio, John Hoeven, Tom             Cotton, Shelley Moore Capito, John Boozman, Cindy Hyde-            Smith, John Thune, Roger F.

Collins, Bill Hagerty, Mike             Braun, Mike Crapo, M. Michael Rounds, Jerry Moran, Bill             Cassidy, M.D., Tim Scott, John Cornyn, Dan Sullivan,             Mitt Romney, Deb Fischer, Todd Young, Rob Portman,             United States Senators.     Madam President, in this letter, signed by 40 Senators,  we called out the Biden administration for refusing to impose sanctions  on entities involved in the construction of this very pipeline.   It is a lengthy letter, and I am not going to read the whole thing,  but let me point out, the letter says this:         The failure of [this] Administration to identify and impose       new sanctions signals its willingness to allow President       Putin to gain a stranglehold over Europe's gas [supply] and       increase its geopolitical leverage. We call on the       Administration to correct its misguided actions by quickly       and fully implementing the sanctions mandated by U.S. law.    It has been over 6 months, and President Biden still refuses to  follow the law. Through his inaction, President Biden is gifting Russia  a new geopolitical weapon.  [[Page S6646]]    And one of the things I found most astonishing, in terms of this  administration taking us from energy dominance to energy dependence, is  what happened just last month. The Biden administration, seeing the  impact of rising energy costs and rising gasoline costs--people in  Wyoming paying more than $25 extra every time they fill their tank  compared to the day that President Biden came into office--he said: We  need to do something.   His National Security Advisor actually went to say: We need to ask  OPEC Plus to produce more oil and to produce more energy.   Well, who is OPEC Plus? Well, it is Saudi Arabia, and it is Russia.  In our Energy Committee, of which I am the ranking member, Senator  Murkowski, the Senator from Alaska, came to the committee and told  members of the committee that currently the United States is using more  energy produced from Russia than it is from her home State of Alaska.  What does that tell you about this administration and the commitment of  this administration to energy needs in this country--in our own  country?   It is very disturbing to see the President act in such a reckless way  regarding our Nation, our economy, and our energy security, and  continuing to give gifts like this to our enemies. It is much better to  sell energy to our friends than have to buy energy from our enemies,  but that is what appeared on the White House website, put there by the  National Security Advisor to the President just last month, asking  Saudi Arabia and OPEC Plus to produce more energy to help lower the  cost at the pump for people in the United States here at home.   Well, why do you think we have it, Mr. President? You killed the  Keystone XL Pipeline and put a longstanding moratorium now on gas  production on Federal lands, which continues. There still has not been  a lease sale since the day you signed that Executive order and the day  you came into office.   We need to force the President to act on this critical issue of the  Nord Stream 2 Pipeline. Yesterday--just yesterday--the U.S. House of  Representatives--the body down the hall, with Nancy Pelosi as the  Speaker of the House, the House of Representatives--passed an amendment  to the National Defense Authorization Act imposing new mandatory  sanctions on Nord Stream 2. It would repeal the national interest  waiver for sanctions under existing law. Look, this is an incredibly  important step, and I would look forward to it quickly becoming law.   Protecting this Russian trap that they have laid for the Germans and  for Europe--the noose around the neck, the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline--it  is in our national security interest to block that, but yet this  administration is not doing it, and I believe it is a grave mistake on  the part of this administration.   While President Biden has failed to do the right thing, there is  still time. The administration can reverse course and fully sanction  the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline. And if President Biden refuses, Congress is  prepared to take strong actions to protect the energy security of our  Nation and our allies.   And with that, I thank Senator Cruz for allowing me to join in  support of the comments that he is making. We have been wonderful  partners, and other Members on the floor, in a bipartisan way, with a  specific focus on what is happening with Russia and its efforts to  undermine the United States, to undermine NATO, and to try to go back  to, as they have said, put the band back together--reestablish the  former Soviet Union, which Vladimir Putin has stated is his goal all  along.   I yield the floor.
