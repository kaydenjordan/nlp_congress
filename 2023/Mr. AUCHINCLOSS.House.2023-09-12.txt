 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the  migrant crisis in my home State of Massachusetts.   Massachusetts is the only State with a right-to-shelter law that  guarantees every family with children a place to stay. According to  recent reporting in The New York Times, 80 cities and towns across the  Commonwealth have received migrants to date, with the number of  families living in emergency shelters and hotels statewide doubling in  the past year to nearly 6,300 last week.  [[Page H4260]]    As the great-grandson of Jews who fled the Russian pogroms, I take  seriously, like so many do, upholding the values this Nation was  founded upon, including providing a safe haven for those seeking  refuge. However, that promise is under threat now by our broken  immigration system.   Right now, Governor Healey and her administration are doing  everything they can to rise to the challenge, but without Federal  action to fix what was a Federal problem, States will continue to  operate with their hands tied behind their backs.   In addition to passing a disaster supplemental to provide FEMA with  additional resources for States, we should be having a serious  conversation in Washington about how to fix our immigration system to  provide safe and legal pathways to entry.   Last Congress, Democrats invited Republicans to the table in good  faith to make progress on issues like infrastructure. Now, Republicans  should do the same on immigration instead of demonizing those seeking a  better life for themselves and their families.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.
