 Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about the  FAA reauthorization bill. Before I do that, I would like to take a  moment to recognize a graduate of Rogers High School in Puyallup, WA.  SSG Ronald J. Shurer II, who received the Medal of Honor yesterday for  his selfless heroism in Afghanistan.   When he heard wounded members of his team were trapped on a hill, he  didn't hesitate. In the face of heavy enemy fire, Staff Sergeant Shurer  shielded three wounded teammates with his own body and helped them  reach safety.   I congratulate Staff Sergeant Shurer for his heroism and bravery and  his sacrifice, and I would like to congratulate him and his family on  his receiving this honor. We in Washington are very proud of Staff  Sergeant Shurer.
