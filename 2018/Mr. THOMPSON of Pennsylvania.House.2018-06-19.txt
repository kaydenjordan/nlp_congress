 Mr. Speaker, during the month of June,  we raise awareness for those suffering from post-traumatic stress  disorder.   After a trauma or a life-threatening event, it is common to have  reactions, such as upsetting memories, increased jumpiness, or trouble  sleeping. If these reactions do not go away or if they get worse, you  might suffer from PTSD.   There are organizations and resources that can help both individuals  and professionals discover ways to identify and to manage PTSD symptoms  and explore effective treatments.   PTSD is especially prevalent for those who have served in the  military, affecting nearly 30 percent of Vietnam veterans and up to 20  percent of veterans who served during the global war on terror.   A nonservicemember may be exposed to a single trauma--for example, a  car accident--that can also cause PTSD.   Mr. Speaker, before I came to Congress, I worked as a rehabilitation  therapist, and I have seen incredible strides that people with injuries  can make with access to appropriate rehabilitation.   I applaud all of the organizations that raise awareness about this  important issue during June. There is help and support for those who  have PTSD.
