 Madam Speaker, Mr. John Lewis has often been called the  conscience of the Congress.   He also led our Democratic Caucus during some of our toughest  moments. In 2017, there was a strong effort to repeal the Affordable  Care Act. We were in the minority. We were demoralized. Things seemed  hopeless.   It was in this darkest hour that the legendary John Lewis thundered;  channeling Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., he said, We may have all come on  different ships, but we are all in the same boat now. We have to stick  together. We have to stand up. We have to do what is right. Millions of  Americans are counting on us.   And as he thundered those words, chills ran down my spine, and a  moral righteousness took over me as he brought our entire caucus to our  feet. And we fought the good fight, though we lost the vote in the  House. But we still inspired the American people.   The effort to repeal ObamaCare ultimately failed in the Senate, and  Mr. John Lewis lit the spark with his words, his spirit, and his  courage.   Rest in power, Mr. Lewis.
