 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. McGovern for bringing this rule  up today, and I rise in support of the rule to bring up the Armenian  genocide resolution.   As Judy Chu said--and I just came back from Armenia at the same  time--we were at the genocide memorial in Yerevan. I was actually there  a few years ago, on the 100th anniversary of the genocide, with our two  Armenian Members of Congress, Anna Eshoo and Jackie Speier.   I have to say, it was unfortunate for us. We were proud to be there  for the 100th commemoration, but we still were very upset over the fact  that the United States had not recognized the Armenian genocide in  recent years. And, of course, this has been a goal of the Armenia  caucus and the Armenia diaspora for over 30 years that this day, this  historic day, would finally occur.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Speaker of the House of  Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, who has made this day possible.   This resolution is important. It commemorates the victims of the  Armenian genocide at the hands of the Ottoman Turks over 104 years  after it took place.   For too long, Congress has failed to recognize the indisputable fact  that the Ottoman Turks perpetrated the first genocide of the 20th  century. This crime against humanity would serve as the blueprint for  other genocides in the Nazi concentration camps and massacres in  Poland, Germany, and eastern Europe and, more recently, in Bosnia and  Rwanda.   Today, we will finally acknowledge what historians have documented  with clear evidence: that the Turkish campaign of slaughter and forced  displacement of millions of Armenians, Greeks, Assyrians, and other  religious minorities was, in fact, a genocide.   The passage of this resolution is an important step in raising  awareness and showing the world that we have a commitment to human  rights and the dignity of every human life.   In the words of George Santayana: ``Those who cannot remember the  past are condemned to repeat it.''   We stand today to show that the House of Representatives will not be  complicit in covering up past atrocities in the 20th century nor turn  our back when ethnic or religious minorities are threatened in the 21st  century.   We must also urge Turkey to come to terms with its own history and  look beyond the thinly veiled facade of denial that covered up one of  the most horrific crimes in world history.   We must urge Turkey to join the rest of the world in recognizing the  sanctity of human life, even if it is someone who doesn't look like  you, speaks a different language, or attends a different house of  worship.   Turkey has a long history of repressing ethnic minorities, including  the Kurds, whom they are killing as we speak. And it doesn't matter  whether they are Christians or Muslims; many of the Kurds are their  Muslim brethren.   I am also a strong supporter of the bipartisan Turkey sanctions bill  that will also be considered this week.   It is unfortunate that it took the abandonment of our allies in  northern Syria to get to this point, but I am pleased to see that we  are working across the aisle to finally push back against the bully  that is President Erdogan.   We cannot trust the Turkish, Russian, or Syrian Governments to uphold  peace and protect innocent lives in the region. We must stand up to  authoritarian leaders like Erdogan, Putin, and Assad to defend our  regional partners and innocent lives.   Again, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman for bringing up this  rule. I want to thank Chairman Schiff, the sponsor of this resolution;  Chairman Engel; the House leadership; and other members of the  congressional caucus for their support of strong American leadership  and for their work to finally get this passed.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Engel for all of his work on  this, and I, of course, thank all of the members of the Armenian  caucus. One of the reasons that we founded the Armenian caucus was the  recognition of the Armenian genocide.   But I also have to mention that, I think, as everyone knows, without  Speaker Pelosi, this would never have come to the floor today. It is,  ultimately, her decision to bring it to the floor, and I want to thank  her immensely.   Official recognition of the Armenian genocide is a powerful reminder  that we will not turn away when we know full well that crimes against  humanity have been perpetrated. We stand here today to pay tribute to  the victims of this horrific chapter of history, to the perseverance of  those who survived, and to the Americans of Armenian descent who  continue to strengthen our country.                                time  1515    It is our duty to honor that history with an honest, factual  statement recognizing the massacre of 1.5 million Armenians as the 20th  century's first genocide. This resolution cannot undo the horrors that  the victims endured or the pain that their descendants carry with them,  but we have an obligation to speak candidly about the past. That is  directly tied to our moral responsibilities of the present.   The United States must never accept crimes against humanity, and we  must do everything in our power to prevent and stop atrocities  unfolding in real time.   What is currently taking place in Syria--the killing of the Kurds at  the hands of the Turkish President Erdogan--is unacceptable, and it is  far past time for the Turkish Government to accept its responsibility  for the systematic extermination of Armenians in the past century and  to commit to protect the dignity of every human life in this century.   I encourage my colleagues to join in supporting this long overdue  recognition of the Armenian genocide. Mr. Speaker, your vote is not  only for the Armenians but to prevent genocide in the future.   Let us note that the Ottoman Turks did not succeed. The Armenians are  still here in the United States, in the Republic of Armenia, in  Artsakh, and the American people and their Representatives will  continue to be with you.
