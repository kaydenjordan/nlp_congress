 Mr. President, 3 years ago yesterday, Berta Caceres, an  indigenous rights activist in Honduras who had been a vocal opponent of  the construction of a hydroelectric dam that threatened the territory  of the Lenka people, was murdered in her home.   That cowardly crime, about which I have spoken many times, was the  culmination of years of harassment and threats against her life, and it  was by no means an isolated case. At the time, it was only the latest  of scores of assassinations of social activists who protested against  the confiscation of land, forced evictions, and infrastructure  development involving corrupt payoffs to circumvent environmental and  social safeguards, and against abuses by Honduran security forces.  Nobody has been punished for any of those other, similar, crimes.   I did not know Berta Caceres, but I knew of her. I remember when she  was awarded the prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize. I remember the  disgust and outrage I felt when I learned that she had been murdered.   I remember thinking that whoever would murder Berta Caceres, a  charismatic leader who was recognized not only in her native country  but around the world, must have been confident that they would never  see the inside of a jail cell, because in Honduras only a small  fraction of homicides, not to mention other violent crimes, ever  results in conviction. Impunity and the corruption that enables it is a  way of life there.   It was no surprise that in the days and weeks after Berta Caceres was  murdered, the Honduran police tried to cover it up. It was only because  of international pressure, including by the U.S. Embassy, that the  fraudulent ``investigation'' did not end there, as so often happens in  Honduras when the victim is not someone of notoriety.   Eventually, last November, after what seemed like interminable foot  dragging, a trial resulted in the conviction of seven of those  involved. That was a significant achievement, considering that absent  international pressure Berta Caceres's case would have faded from  memory like all the others. That trial also implicated top officials of  the hydroelectric company DESA, one of whom is still awaiting trial 3  years later.   I was a prosecutor before I became a Senator. I prosecuted many  murder cases. While premeditated murder is a horrific crime, it is  often relatively easy to prove. In Berta Caceres's case, there was a  lot of evidence. So to those who ask why, 3 years later, we are still  waiting for justice, I think the answer is obvious. There are powerful  forces within the Honduran Government who are beyond the reach of the  Honduran justice system, and the attorney general recognizes that.   So today, 3 years later, there are some who conceived of, or knew of,  the plan to murder Berta Caceres who have not been charged. The  question, 3 years later, is when will they be charged? When will they  be brought to justice?   Neither I nor the world have forgotten Berta Caceres. Our desire to  see justice done in her case is as strong today as it was 3 years ago  not only because of the importance it has for her family and her  community, but for the larger cause of justice in Honduras. Impunity is  a powerful, evil force, but I believe the whole truth about this crime  will eventually be known.  [[Page S1618]]    Beyond Berta Caceres's case, the central question is whether the  Honduran Government is serious about fighting the corruption that  permeates not only the justice system, but practically every crevice of  Honduran society and Government.   A government that is serious about fighting corruption would enact  the plea bargaining law that has languished for years, without which it  is extremely difficult to investigate and prosecute crimes involving  top public officials or corporate executives.   A government that is serious about fighting corruption would put an  abrupt end to legislation referred to as the ``impunity pact.'' That  legislation would bar the attorney general from bringing charges  against someone for stealing public funds until the Supreme Auditing  Tribunal, whose members are all loyal to the President, has  investigated and ruled on the alleged theft. It is a transparent  attempt to ensure that cases of public corruption are never prosecuted.   A government that is serious about fighting corruption would support  strengthening the Mission to Support the Fight against Corruption and  Impunity, not seek to ``renegotiate'' its mandate to eliminate or  substantially weaken its investigative authority.   The Honduran Government, which professes to be a partner of the  United States in fighting corruption, is not doing any of these things.  The inescapable truth is that it is not serious about fighting  corruption, which is apparent to anyone who is not easily fooled.   Until that changes and until all those involved in the murder of  Berta Caceres are brought to justice and until Hondurans who speak out  against corruption and impunity are no longer vilified and attacked,  the amount of assistance we provide to the Honduran Government will be  far less than it would otherwise be.                            ____________________
