 Mr. Speaker, before my time in Congress, I was a trial  lawyer. As a trial lawyer, I learned that,  [[Page H2529]]  where there is smoke, there is fire. Mr. Speaker, I am here to tell you  that there is a fire threatening our Republic.   Mr. Speaker, make no mistake about it: Russia attacked our country  when it tried to meddle in our elections. But we have a Commander in  Chief who will barely acknowledge this act, much less condemn it.   Mr. Speaker, we hear tough talk from the President when it comes to  Iran, North Korea, and China; but when Russia moves missiles in  violation of treaty obligations, when a Russian spy ship patrols just  outside our coastal waters, we hear crickets. As evidence mounts that  Russia is interfering with the democracies of Europe, we hear crickets.  Indeed, Mr. Speaker, this President sees no moral difference between  our democracy and the Putin regime.   Mr. Speaker, there is smoke; there is fire. Our Republic is being  threatened. We are the first responders, and we can only put this fire  out with the truth. We need to establish an independent commission to  investigate the Trump-Russian ties and find our way to the truth.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    I am opposed.    Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill,  which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted,  the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.   Mr. Speaker, my amendment is simple. It ensures that the EPA  continues to use the best available science to respond to threats to  public health, including black lung and asthma, caused by or  exacerbated by exposure to pollution or toxic chemicals.   This motion to recommit reverses harmful restrictions imposed by this  bill that make it almost impossible to base public protections on the  best available scientific information, much of which is private or  proprietary and cannot always be published.   In its current form, Mr. Speaker, this bill, the so-called Honest and  Open New EPA Science Treatment Act, seriously impedes the EPA's ability  to protect the American public from pollutants, toxins, and other  dangerous threats to their well-being.   The true intention of this bill is not to increase transparency in  policymaking but, rather, to bar scientists and civil servants from  enforcing the intent of bedrock protections in the Clean Air Act, the  Clean Water Act, and other important laws.   If this ``secret science'' bill passes in its current form, the EPA's  work will grind to a halt and countless Americans will suffer or even  die as a result. Hardworking miners, whose work and contributions have  been overly politicized in the debate to keep access to science, are  the greatest at risk. Generations of miners toil dutifully to support  their families, all the while exposing themselves to toxicity and  pollution that can leave them with lifelong debilitating diseases, such  as black lung and asthma.   Families who will struggle from the costs to treat these expensive  diseases and from loss of income due to days missed from work do not  need more obstruction or political football. They need access to the  best care available, which relies upon evidence-based science. They  deserve far better than what the majority is offering.   Mr. Speaker, I came to Congress with a mission to uphold the values  and principles of the great constituents living in Virginia's Fourth  Congressional District. I believe that includes advocating for the  health of all Americans. That means advocating for sound science and  reasonable policies. It means rejecting dangerous, shortsighted, and an  astonishingly hard-hearted piece of legislation that is currently  before you.   Mr. Speaker, science is the bedrock of sound medical and public  health decisionmaking. EPA's science-based decisionmaking process has  saved lives and led to the dramatic improvements in the quality of the  air we breathe, the water we drink, and the Earth we share.   All Americans have benefited from the research-based scientific  advice that scientists have provided the EPA, and that is why I urge my  colleagues to support my motion to recommit.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
