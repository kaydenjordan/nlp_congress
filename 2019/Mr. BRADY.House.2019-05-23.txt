 Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, for nearly 2 years, Republicans have been advocating  for policies that help our families and Main Street businesses save  more and save earlier for the future.   Following the historic rewrite of our Tax Code, Republicans knew the  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was only step one. We knew that we changed the  trajectory of our economy with our reforms.   Today in America, we are growing 50 percent faster than the Obama  administration projected. Wages are surging for blue-collar workers and  low-income workers for the first time in a decade, and our job market  continues to be the envy of the world.   These are all encouraging signs, and Republicans are committed to  building on this success for years to come, which is why last year, we  set out to change the culture in Washington, where we only do, it  seems, tax reform once a generation.   In Tax Reform 2.0, we passed three bills that offered permanent tax  relief for families and small businesses, sparked American innovation,  and went further and enhanced retirement and savings vehicles for our  workers and our local, mainstream businesses.   That effort, the Family Savings Act, was led by Representative   Mike  Kelly.   Those reforms passed on a bipartisan basis, and our retirement  proposals passed the U.S. House of Representatives not once but twice.   Unfortunately, time ran out on the calendar before we were able to  get these reforms to the President's desk. But I was greatly encouraged  earlier this year when Chairman Neal reached out to say he was  committed to getting retirement-focused legislation signed into law  this year. This area, retirement savings, is one that Chairman Neal has  worked on for much of his career.   Right away, he and I, and many members of our committee worked  together to develop the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement  Enhancement Act, the SECURE Act, we debate today.   The SECURE Act builds well on the work that Republicans have  championed throughout this Congress and the last. Our bipartisan  legislation makes it easier for Main Street businesses to offer  retirement plans for their workers by making it simpler, easing  administrative burdens, and cutting down on unnecessary and often  costly paperwork.   We make it easier for them to join together to pool their resources  to offer these plans. We offer local businesses the flexibility to  tailor retirement plans to best fit their workers, not necessarily what  Washington may need.   Additionally, our reforms help Americans not only save earlier in  their careers, but it helps families save longer, as well.   We know for a fact that people are choosing to work longer today than  in previous generations. Our Tax Code should reflect that, which is why  we make smart, needed changes to reflect today's workforce.    First, the age limit for contributing to IRAs is removed, as it  should be.   Second, we increase the minimum age for forcing people to spend their  savings from 70\1/2\ to 72 years of age. My hope is, someday, we can we  remove it completely. We want Americans to save throughout their  lifetime and use those savings when they need it most, not when  Washington needs it.   This legislation is prowork and, equally as important, our bill is  also profamily.   For the first time, we allow what we call the new baby savings  provision. We allow parents to access their own retirement accounts on  a penalty-free basis to use when welcoming a new child into their  homes, whether by birth or adoption. This works well for working  parents and stay-at-home parents, as well. It is allowed to be used for  the things you need, whether it is medical equipment, medical expenses,  or if you need to spend time at home with your new child in those  opening weeks. We know all that is so important.   The bill also expands 529 plans to make sure you can use, tax-free,  your savings for apprenticeships or to pay down college debt.   Our legislation lowers taxes for Gold Star families, ensuring that  children of our fallen heroes have the certainty they deserve. This  provision was first made public in 2014 in a draft that was widely  praised by Democrats and Republicans alike.  [[Page H4137]]    It was brought to us by the Joint Committee on Taxation to make it  simpler for families to file their kids' taxes and also to close some  tax loopholes for the wealthy. Unfortunately, over 5 years, with  scrutiny by both parties, tax experts, and the Joint Committee on  Taxation, we still did not see one unintended consequence.   In this bill, we worked together, Republicans and Democrats, to make  sure we honor our Gold Star families.   The time is right for these reforms. Workers' paychecks are rising;  inflation is low; and businesses are expanding. What better opportunity  to help folks save for the future?   Chairman Neal deserves a great deal of credit. The bill we brought to  the Rules Committee earlier this week cleared our committee nearly  unanimously. Members of the Progressive Caucus, Freedom Caucus, New  Democrats, Problem Solvers, and Republican Study Committee, we all  voted ``yes'' on these reforms.   This is a rare occurrence in Washington, and it speaks to what a  committee can accomplish when we work together on reforms to positively  impact our families and economy.   I have to admit, it is incredibly troubling that special interests-- in this case, teachers unions--forced changes on our bipartisan bill  for absolutely no good reason at the eleventh hour.   These special interest groups forced Democrats to block two  provisions.   One allows parents to use their educational savings tax-free for the  expenses of homeschooling. Nearly 2.5 million families use parent- centered, child-centered homeschooling as the best way for their  children to reach their potential. It is all types of Americans and  becoming more mainstream. It is Christians and Jews and Muslims. It is  all races. It is parents whose kids are exceptionally bright and  parents whose kids have learning disabilities and severe special needs.  That is why that was in the bill.   The second provision that was blocked would allow families with kids  in grades kindergarten through 12 to use savings for books, tutors, and  educational therapies for students who may need it, such as those with  learning disabilities. How many of us in this Chamber have kids with  special needs and learning disabilities, some with mental and physical  challenges? This would have allowed our parents to save tax-free and to  help their kids with the special tools they need to reach their full  potential.   I want to talk a little more about this in the future, but my bottom  line is that backdoor deals made in the dead of night without  bipartisan knowledge or support are not the way to do business.   Nonetheless, as we begin the debate on this bill, I am very  encouraged by the underlying bill we have in front of us. It will  greatly benefit our workers. It deserves strong support, and I am  asking my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support these  reforms.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly), who has helped lead many of these retirement  reforms.    Madam Speaker, I am proud to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Holding), a key member of the Ways  and Means Committee.    Madam Speaker, I am proud to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Smith), a member of the Ways and Means  Committee, who has been a champion for expanding education savings  accounts for Americans.    Madam Speaker, I am very proud to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Schweikert), a key member of our committee  who worked on this legislation.    Madam Speaker, I am proud to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Estes), one of our new members of the Ways  and Means Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Nebraska (Mr. Smith).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Walberg), who has worked on retirement and pension issues  for many years.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Missouri (Mrs. Wagner), a leader who has worked for working moms and  our veterans.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.   Madam Speaker, I want to recognize those who worked in a bipartisan  way to address the Gold Star issue: Representatives Bacon, Diaz-Balart,  Herrera Beutler, Holding, Marchant, Wagner, Waltz, and Wenstrup.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Madam Speaker, I am very proud to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), the leader for Republicans of  the U.S. House of Representatives.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    I reserve the balance of my time, Madam Speaker.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.   Madam Speaker, how sad it is that some are trying to make this a  partisan, petty measure.   The truth is, in 2014, in an original draft of tax reform, this  provision was included by the Joint Committee on Taxation to simplify  the Tax Code and to stop tax loopholes. That draft was praised by my  Democratic colleagues, by Mr. Neal, Mr. Kind, and Mr. Thompson.   In over 5 years, no one spotted this unintended consequence. When it  surfaced, Republicans and Democrats came together immediately and  resolved to not just fix it but to make it retroactive.   Why make this a petty, partisan issue? Our Gold Star parents deserve  better.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I am proud that, last session, Republicans and  Democrats came together to pass a retirement security bill not once but  twice because we knew how important this was. I was chairman, and I was  proud to help lead that effort.   This year, I am the proudest leader of the Republicans on the Ways  and Means Committee to work with Chairman Neal again to make it even  better to try to help families save.   But I am disappointed in the process after it left the committee,  through no fault of Chairman Neal's.   Just 2 months ago, we heard Democratic lawmakers sit in that seat and  say they will work to restore the people's faith that government works  in the public's interest. They said they will pass laws and make sure  our government acts in the best interests of the American people, not  entrenched special interests.   It is unfortunate that every word there was stomped on this week by  special interest groups that forced our Democratic friends to make  changes to a bill that would help children and parents with costs  associated with schools.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act allowed parents to save tax-free for  schools from kindergarten through 12th grade, and these bipartisan  reforms that were stripped from this bill would have allowed parents to  use their education savings dollars for homeschooling and additional  kindergarten through 12 expenses at public, private, and religious  schools.   This is money the families could have used for books, online  education material, tutoring, AP classes, university exams, and  educational therapies for students, including for kids with  disabilities.   Every parent blessed with a special needs child or one who struggles  to keep up in school knows the constant search to find the right  learning tools, the effective therapies, and the trained tutors to help  their challenged children learn.   Apparently, for our teachers' union, that was wrong. They moved  effectively to block the ability of parents to help their kids, whether  they are gifted, whether they have learning disabilities, whether they  need that tutor, or whether a child is severely challenged, mentally  and physically, and needs that help.   What do we have to fear from parents who want to help their kids and  use their own dollars for it?   What would our Nation be if denied the genius of Steven Spielberg who  overcame dyslexia as a child or CNN anchor Anderson Cooper whose  parents hired a special instructor to help him overcome his learning  disabilities?   Where we would be without business leaders like Steve Jobs, Charles  Schwab, Richard Branson, or Henry Ford, all with learning disabilities,  all who have made amazing contributions to our country?   Blocking these provisions is not proeducation, and there is no way it  is prochild.                                time  1030    It is beyond me how an education association can oppose parents using  their own savings to help their child reach their highest potential.  But I don't fault them. I fault the lawmakers who are beholden to them,  who removed these provisions.   This bill deserves support, and I will strongly support it, but I am  terribly disappointed.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
