 Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity  to speak on such an important issue.   I am here today to support the FAIR Act because of women like Kelli  Stein, who, earlier this year, wrote a public letter to the Senate  Finance Committee telling the story of her mother, June Lee.   In the letter, Kelli details how June was severely abused in a  nursing home. The letter describes how her mother was dropped several  times by staff members and sustained a broken shoulder. It took 5 days  before the injury was x-rayed.   Because staff failed to check on her enough, June developed bed  sores. She suffered countless urinary tract infections because the  nursing home staff would not take her to the bathroom enough.   Nursing home staff even taped the nurse call cord, the cord that she  needed to call for help, out of her reach so that they would not have  to attend to her.   Kelli recounts how ``throughout the entire time her mother was there,  it was a never-ending ordeal of preventable health problem after  preventable health problem, chipping away at her dignity as well as her  mental and physical health.''   Ultimately, the physical neglect caused her mental and physical  health to suffer, and it greatly diminished her quality of life.   But when June's family tried to hold the nursing home accountable,  they realized that they had unknowingly signed away their rights to  hold that nursing home corporation accountable for June's abuse and  neglect. They had been forced to sign an arbitration agreement as a  condition of June being admitted to the nursing home.   The FAIR Act would eliminate forced arbitration clauses in  employment, consumer, and civil rights cases and would allow consumers  and workers to agree to arbitration only after a dispute occurs.   This legislation protects older Americans who rely on the care of  nursing home staff by allowing families to hold nursing homes  accountable for the abuse or neglect of their loved ones.
