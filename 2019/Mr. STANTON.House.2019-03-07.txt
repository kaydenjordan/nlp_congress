 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address perhaps the most  important reform legislation to protect and strengthen our democracy in  a generation: H.R. 1, the For the People Act.   We have a responsibility, an obligation, to make sure that our  government always remains one of the people, by the people, and for the  people. But the truth is Congress has not done enough to protect the  voices of everyday Americans and to make sure that our government  institutions are working for them.   The American people know it, and, Mr. Speaker, I believe that is  exactly why they voted for new leadership in our people's House. They  know what is happening to our political system. The dark money, the  attack ads from secret, fly-by-night groups, the incredible influence  special interests seem to have over too many political leaders. They  see it every day when the system that used to work so well for the  middle class is now rigged against them.   So much of it is the result of the Supreme Court's Citizens United  decision. Consider the facts: From 2008 to 2016, the amount of outside  spending to influence our elections has increased tenfold, reaching an  astonishing $1.4 billion during our last presidential election.   These billions being spent to influence elections and politicians,  they aren't coming from everyday Americans, but are more likely coming  from Wall Street, Big Pharma, and other high-powered interests working  against the rest of us. We can do better and, with H.R. 1, we will do  better.   This transformative set of reforms will shine a light on dark money  and return power to the people. It puts disclosure front and center by  requiring political groups to disclose their large donors, bringing  dark money out of the shadows for good.   H.R. 1 recognizes a simple principle: The American people ought to  know who is writing big checks to their elected officials and  candidates for office.   By curbing the influence of special interests, we can lift the voices  of everyday Americans and we can better focus on the issues that matter  most, like quality jobs, affordable healthcare, clean air and water,  and strong infrastructure.   Mr. Speaker, history has its eyes on us today. Let us, once again,  resolve to make sure that our government remains one of the people, by  the people and, of course, for the people.                            ____________________
