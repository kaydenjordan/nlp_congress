 Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I rise to honor the life and legacy of Dr.  Shannon Kula, former Senator Barbara Mikulski's chief of staff and a  beloved member of the Maryland congressional team and Capitol Hill  community. Shannon passed away recently after a long and heroic fight  against breast cancer.   As Senator Mikulski remarked, ``Her vibrant, inspirational  personality made an impact on us all. She had such dedication, during  those long hours--always with a smile and encouraging word. Shannon was  a great friend, great advisor and brilliant strategist who took charge  of making things happen all while making everyone feel good while she  did it. She had a luminous spirit that blessed us all.''   We all know the role that our staff plays in the work and life of the  Senate. Shannon helped Senator Mikulski on so many of her  accomplishments--from the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, to guaranteeing  access to women's preventive healthcare to policies that support  military families--Shannon was by Senator Mikulski's side. She also  helped organize the bipartisan women Senators and played an important  role in helping elect more women to the U.S. Senate.   Shannon played an important role in developing and enacting policies  that improved people's lives. She also improved the lives of those who  had the good fortune to work with her. The friendships she developed  with the Mikulski staff and the wider Senate community were deep and  lasting. She led with grace and humor. She mentored younger staff. She  set a tone of civility and kindness, even in the rough and tumble world  of politics. She was a valued colleague to so many people and a leader  of what we in the delegation like to call ``Team Maryland.''   Shannon received B.A. degrees in political science and government and  in psychology from the University of Rochester. She was the first  person in her family to attend college. While Shannon was working in  the Senate, she finished her master's degree and doctorate at  Georgetown University, a truly remarkable accomplishment for anyone who  knows the long and unpredictable hours Senate staff routinely work.  After she left the Senate, she continued to serve, as director of the  University of Saint Joseph's Women's Leadership Center and when she ran  for a Congressional seat in her home State of Connecticut.   Shannon married her college sweetheart, Dr. Ron Clark, a U.S. Marine  who served 20 years in the Corps. Everyone who knew the couple  recognized what an incredible team they were. She was a loving aunt who  was very involved in the lives of her nieces and nephews, traveling the  world with them and encouraging them through their educations and  military service.  [[Page S4382]]    Shannon's death is a tragedy. But her life was a triumph. I join  Senator Mikulski and so many others in our Capitol community in  honoring her extraordinary life. May her memory be a blessing to her  family and friends; may her life be a continuing inspiration to all  who, like Shannon, strive to serve others.                            ____________________
