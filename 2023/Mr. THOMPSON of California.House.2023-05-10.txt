 Mr. Speaker, since we were last together  on the floor, gun violence has been unending. There were eight dead,  seven injured at a shopping mall in Allen, Texas; one dead, four  injured at a medical office in Atlanta, Georgia; six dead in Henryetta,  Oklahoma; and five dead in Cleveland, Texas. These are just the high- visibility mass shootings.   Gun violence is the leading cause of death for children and teenagers  and is costing our country $280 billion a year. Kids shouldn't worry  about being shot if their basketball rolls into a neighbor's yard or if  they knock on a door. Teenagers shouldn't worry about being shot if  they pull into the wrong driveway. Families shouldn't worry about being  shot if they go shopping.   Republican leadership must listen to the majority of Americans,  including Republicans and gun owners who support gun violence  prevention laws.   Mr. Speaker, I am calling on my Republican colleagues in the majority  to bring lifesaving gun violence prevention legislation to this House  floor for a vote as soon as we can.                            ____________________
