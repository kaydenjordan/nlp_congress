 BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  opposition to TrumpCare, the Republican plan to cut Medicare and  Medicaid, increase healthcare costs, and take health care away from  tens of millions of Americans, all while providing the largest transfer  of wealth from working families to our Nation's richest, and all of  this in the name of choice and freedom. But we all know that, under  this bill, that is just code for survival of the fittest, economic  Darwinism.   Mr. Speaker, let me bring this a little closer to home for me. Thanks  to TrumpCare, 36,700 of my constituents covered by the ACA's Medicaid  expansion now stand to lose this lifesaving coverage. Here is one of  them, constituent Maura McGrath, a 17-year-old with Down syndrome.   Maura's parents, Joe and Rita, know firsthand why Medicaid is so  important. Medicaid has been critical to keeping their daughter alive  and saving their family from bankruptcy. Even though Joe and Rita both  work, the cost of Maura's care is too expensive to afford on their own,  not to mention that Rita is a breast cancer survivor and Joe suffers  from Parkinson's disease. Medicaid provides the McGraths peace of mind  knowing Maura will receive the care that she needs and they aren't  alone to fend for themselves, given the tough hand they have been  dealt.   Mr. Speaker, for Maura and everyone in my district, say ``no'' to  TrumpCare.
