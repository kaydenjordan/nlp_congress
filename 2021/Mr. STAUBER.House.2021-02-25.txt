 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R.  803, a package of Democrat land-grab bills that were not marked up in  the Committee on Natural Resources and are opposed by several members  and the constituents they serve.   H.R. 803 is a 330-page partisan package containing 8 different bills.  Not one bill or one page was marked up or heard in committee this  Congress. Unfortunately, Democrats on the Committee on Natural  Resources have waived responsibility. There have been zero markups or  committee hearings this Congress.   Mr. Speaker, we have 8 new Republican members on our committee, and 3  on the Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources alone, a committee  which I lead. Our membership deserves to debate these bills and mark  them up. Let's have our new members hear from the stakeholders and make  decisions based on the evidence presented. We need to end this practice  of just giving away committee jurisdiction and jamming through  legislation.   H.R. 803 dovetails with the Biden/Harris agenda and puts America last  by outsourcing our supply of critical minerals and endangering our  national security. Our submarines and aircraft carriers are powered  with clean nuclear energy.    Mr. Speaker, nuclear power is a huge contributor to our  electric grid. By withdrawing areas from uranium and other mineral  development, it furthers our reliance on Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and  Russia--who I assure you, do not have the labor or environmental  standards that we demand in our country and who do not have our best  interests at heart.   Mr. Speaker, I oppose this legislation.
