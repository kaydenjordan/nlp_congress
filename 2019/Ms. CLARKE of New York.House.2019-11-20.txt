 Madam Speaker, pursuing the American Dream  has become a daunting task for millions of Americans in need of a place  they can call home. We must address affordable housing, as we are in  the midst of an acute crisis, and it is sweeping across America.   From my district in Brooklyn, New York, to Portland, Oregon, families  coast to coast are getting priced out of their communities and driven  into poverty and homelessness. My newly introduced bill, the Affordable  Housing and Area Median Income Fairness Act, will attack this crisis  head-on.   My bill addresses the clearly flawed model that has been used to  calculate area median incomes, which is the basis on which rental rates  are set. This outdated model made it harder for our families to afford  having a roof over their heads, meanwhile, lining the pockets of big  developers.   The Federal Government cannot--must not--continue to be complicit in  this travesty.   As cities grow and communities evolve, the ability to afford having a  roof over one's head should not be relegated only to those whose  incomes afford them luxury.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in this crusade  for human dignity: affordable housing for all Americans, access to  affordable housing.                            ____________________
