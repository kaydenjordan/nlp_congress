 Mr. Speaker, due to my attendance at a wildfire summit  with the President, to discuss aid for the devastating wildfires that  have recently swept through Oregon, I was unable to return for votes.  Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 183 and  ``yea'' on rollcall No. 184.                             personal explanation
