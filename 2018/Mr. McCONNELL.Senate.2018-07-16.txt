 Mr. President, it has been less than a week since the  President nominated Judge Brett Kavanaugh to serve as an Associate  Justice of the Supreme Court. Already, praise has poured in for his  legal abilities, professional accomplishments, and personal character.   Some of the most interesting testimony has come from the men and  women who may know better than anyone how Judge Kavanaugh approaches  his work--his law clerks. You can learn a lot about a leader by asking  the men and women who work for and with him. Thirty-four of his past  clerks sent an open letter to Chairman Grassley and Senator Feinstein  last week.   Their own political and legal views are quite diverse:         Our ranks include Republicans, Democrats, and Independents.       But we are united in this: our admiration and fondness for       Judge Kavanaugh run deep.    They describe his commitment to legal excellence:         We never once saw him take a shortcut, treat a case as       unimportant, or search for an easy answer. Instead, in each       case, large or small, he masters every detail and rereads       every precedent.    They also compliment the way Judge Kavanaugh conducts himself both  inside and outside the courtroom. They call him ``unfailingly warm and  gracious, grounded, and kind.'' They describe a ``fundamental  humility.''   A subset of those clerks wrote a second letter. It was from every one  of Judge Kavanaugh's female clerks whose current employments allowed  them to sign it.   These 18 women explain: ``We feel compelled to write separately to  convey our uniformly positive experiences with the Judge as a boss on  issues of gender and equality in the workplace.''   ``In our view,'' they write, ``the Judge has been one of the  strongest advocates in the Federal judiciary for women lawyers.''   They explain how Judge Kavanaugh seeks out the best and brightest,  how he goes above and beyond to advise and mentor all of his clerks.   Judge Kavanaugh's hiring reflects, in their words, ``rare gender  parity.'' Note  [[Page S4960]]  that I did not say ``equity'' but ``parity''--25 women clerks and 23  men. In 2014, in fact, all four of Judge Kavanaugh's clerks were  women--a first for a judge on the DC Circuit. There have been 84  percent of those 25 women who have gone on to Supreme Court clerkships,  thanks, in large part, to Judge Kavanaugh's guidance and support.   Here is how they conclude their letter:         As you likely know by now, Judge Kavanaugh has two       daughters, Margaret and Liza. If they decide to follow in       their dad's--and grandmother's--footsteps and become lawyers,       they will enter a legal profession that is fairer and more       equal because of Judge Kavanaugh.    We have also heard from Professor Amy Chua, who has served on Yale  Law School's clerkship committee for most of the last decade. During  that time, 10 Yale Law School graduates have clerked for Judge  Kavanaugh, 8 of whom are women.   She emailed them to ask about their experiences. As she explained in  the Wall Street Journal, they lauded his work ethic, his commitment to  excellence, his humility, and his decency, and ``to a person they  described his extraordinary mentorship.''   One woman said:         He's been an incredible mentor to me despite the fact that       I am a left-of-center woman. He always takes into account my       goals rather than giving me generic advice.    With respect to Judge Kavanaugh's approach to deciding cases,  Professor Chua pointed out that he ``actively seeks out clerks from  across the ideological spectrum who will question and disagree with  him'' because ``he wants to hear other perspectives before deciding a  case.''   ``Above all,'' she observed, Judge Kavanaugh ``believes in the law  and wants to figure out, without prejudging, what it requires.''   Again, we have already heard so many speak up to recommend this  impressive nominee.   In the weeks ahead, we will hear more, including from Judge Kavanaugh  himself, when our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee conduct  hearings on his nomination. Yet I wanted to call special attention  today to the warm words of those who have worked with and for Judge  Kavanaugh. They have seen firsthand just how rigorously he approaches  his work as a judge and how graciously he shares his time and his  talent with others. Judge Kavanaugh is certainly an impressive nominee.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  resume legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 436, S. Res.  386.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  committee-reported amendment be agreed to.    Mr. President, I know of no further debate on the  resolution.    I ask unanimous consent that the committee-reported  amendment to the preamble be agreed to, the preamble, as amended, be  agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  July 17; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed. I ask that following leader  remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session and resume  consideration of the Blew nomination, under the previous order, and  that at 11:45 a.m. all time be yielded back and the Senate then vote on  confirmation of the nomination with no intervening action or debate,  and that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table and the President be immediately notified of the  Senate's action; further, that following disposition of the Blew  nomination and notwithstanding rule XXII, the cloture motions filed on  Thursday, July 12 ripen; finally, that following the cloture vote on  the Quarles nomination, the Senate stand in recess until 2:15 p.m. to  allow for the weekly conference meetings.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the  [[Page S4969]]  previous order, following the remarks of Senators Brown and Sasse.
