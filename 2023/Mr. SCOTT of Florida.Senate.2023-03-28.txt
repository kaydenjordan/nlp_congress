 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    In September 2021, President Biden's misguided  and dangerous decisions in his botched withdrawal of U.S. forces from  Afghanistan led to America's most stunning, unforced, and humiliating  defeat in decades.   Due to President Biden's carelessness and failed leadership, 13 U.S.  servicemembers were lost; billions of dollars of U.S. military  equipment were left for the Taliban, and here is a picture of some of  it; and hundreds of American citizens were stranded behind enemy lines.   The world is now a more dangerous place. Our enemies, like Russia,  Communist China, and Iran, are emboldened, and the American people are  rightfully furious.   We must have accountability, and the best way to do that is  establishing a bipartisan, bicameral Joint Select Committee on  Afghanistan--similar to the Iran-Contra committees--to conduct a full  investigation and compile a thorough report on President Biden's  tragically failed withdrawal from Afghanistan.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.    I ask unanimous consent that the vote begin  now.
