               HONORING THE MEMORY OF STEVEN SPICKELMIER

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. Rutherford) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of the memory of 
Steven Spickelmier who passed away at the age of 77 after a long battle 
with COVID-19.
  Steve was a U.S. Navy and Air National Guard veteran, retiring as a 
master sergeant after 26 years of military service. His unmatched 
energy and positive impact on servicemen, veterans, and their families 
throughout northeast Florida displayed his incredible servant's heart.
  Among Steve's many local roles, he served as chairman of the Veterans 
Council of Duval County and chairman of the Support Committee at 
Jacksonville National Cemetery, Madam Speaker, where he championed the 
annual Wreaths Across America program and the Memorial Day service. He 
was president of the Air Force Sergeants Association, Chapter 559, and 
field operations director for Florida's Missing in America project.
  Steve attended Mandarin United Methodist Church and, among many other 
roles, he served as a church van driver for residents of a nearby 
retirement home to ensure all could worship together each Sunday.
  On behalf of the Fourth Congressional District of Florida, I offer 
condolences to all who knew and loved Steve, especially his wife 
Glenda, the love of his life, for over 33 years.


Congratulating Mr. Charles Darwin Magdaluyo, Duval County's Teacher of 
                                the Year

  Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Mr. 
Charles Darwin Magdaluyo for being named Duval County's Teacher of the 
Year. Charles received this honor for his work teaching ninth and 
twelfth grade human anatomy and physiology at Jean Ribault High School.
  Serving as a teacher for 7 years, Mr. Magdaluyo is dedicated to 
helping students understand and succeed, even in difficult 
circumstances. Charles works with students to overcome the challenges 
and struggles they face, helping them to grow as individuals and 
develop skills that will help them long after they graduate.
  On behalf of the Fourth Congressional District of Florida, I thank 
Charles for his dedication to educating the students of northeast 
Florida and for his commitment to the success of his students and peers 
alike.


  Congratulating Ms. Shelby Goodwin, Nassau County Teacher of the Year

  Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Ms. 
Shelby Goodwin for being named Nassau County Teacher of the Year. Ms. 
Goodwin received this honor for her work teaching AP language and AP 
literature at Yulee High School.
  Serving as a teacher for 6 years, Ms. Goodwin aims to help students 
learn lifelong lessons through an engaging classroom experience. Ms. 
Goodwin supports her students' development by working with them in 
class, coaching them in athletics, sponsoring student clubs, and co-
directing a musical theater production.
  On behalf of the Fourth Congressional District of Florida, I thank 
Ms. Goodwin for her dedication to educating the students of northeast 
Florida and for her commitment to the success of her students and peers 
alike.

                           PLANES FOR UKRAINE

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Green) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, and still I rise. And I rise today 
with a very simple message: Those who believe that if we leave the 
world alone, the world will leave us alone are entirely wrong.
  Madam Speaker, the world would find its way to our door as it has 
done so now with Ukraine.
  I had the honor of hearing the President of Ukraine speak this 
morning, and if there is something I came away with without question it 
is this: It is that this war is about more than Ukraine. It is about 
freedom-loving people wherever they may be. It is about people who will 
not tolerate seeing women and babies being killed live on television. 
It is about a belief that if you can do something to end an injustice, 
you have to do it.
  This is why I rise today to say, Madam Speaker, that if there is a 
vote for planes for Ukraine, I will vote to support planes for Ukraine. 
And I will do so because I believe that this is needed for their 
defense.
  While some would say: But the defense currently would not be planes 
because they don't have to fight planes--that they are using long-range 
projectiles to bomb Ukraine--my point is this: Let's not wait until the 
skies over Ukraine have been darkened with Russian planes before we 
send the help that they need.

  I don't mind the world knowing that we are part of this. I don't 
think we can allow a standard to be set such that in the future the 
precedent is if you send in planes you are escalating. I think if we 
send in planes, we are meeting the challenge that is necessary to 
defend Ukraine.
  Again, those who believe that if we leave the world alone it will 
leave us alone are entirely wrong. This is about liberty and justice 
for all; government of the people, by the people, and for the people of 
Ukraine and the rest of us as well. This is about freedom-loving people 
wherever they may be.
  If there is a vote for planes, then I will vote for planes for 
Ukraine.

                              THE ECONOMY

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. Cline) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, when I travel around the Sixth 
Congressional District of Virginia, folks regularly share their 
struggles with me in the face of President Biden's inflation crisis, 
economic crisis, and energy crisis.
  They tell me that their hearts sink when they check out at the 
grocery store and see the price on the screen tick well past what they 
used to pay to feed their families. They tell me they dread going to 
the gas station because every time they drive by, they see prices 
getting higher and higher. They pray their car doesn't break down 
because they can't afford to fix it or replace it given the rise in the 
cost of car parts.
  They worry about their kids hitting a growth spurt because new 
clothes are just getting too expensive. And they tell me the 
disappointment they felt when they let their kids know that the 
vacation they had been looking forward to had to be canceled or scaled 
back because the rising cost of flying and lodging made it nearly 
impossible.
  Madam Speaker, folks in rural parts of this country are struggling, 
and 40-year high inflation rates serve as a tax on all Americans. It is 
unacceptable that the soaring price of goods cost the average family 
$3,500 last year.
  If Members of Congress truly want to provide relief to their 
constituents, then they must rein in spending and cut taxes to get our 
country's economy back on track.


                         Cave Spring Basketball

  Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the Cave Spring High 
School boys' basketball team from Roanoke, Virginia, for winning this 
year's class 3 State championship. Following a near perfect season, the 
Cave Spring Knights were crowned sole State champions this year after 
being named co-winners with Lakeland in 2020 due to the COVID pandemic.
  From the moment last week's final tipped off against the Petersburg 
Crimson Wave, it was a great showing from both teams.
  After an impressive second-half comeback by Petersburg, Cave Spring 
was down by 2 with only 1 minute and 45 seconds left on the clock. A 
quick Knight's basket tied the game, and the Crimson Wave took 
possession as the seconds passed by. But a timely steal by Cave 
Spring's senior guard, Owyn Dawyot, gave the Knights one last chance.
  As Dawyot headed toward the basket, he was fouled sending him to the 
free-throw line with just 3 seconds left. After missing the first shot, 
the pressure was on, but he kept his cool and made the second shot for 
the final score of the game.
  The Knights prevailed, winning 76-75, marking the program's fifth 
State title and the second under Coach Jacob Gruse.
  Congratulations to Cave Spring on this hard-fought win. It was well-
earned.


        Recognizing Virginia's Lieutenant Governor Winsome Sears

  Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, as we celebrate Women's History Month, we 
recognize the list of women who have contributed to moving the United 
States forward over the past 244 years.
  I rise today to recognize one trailblazer in particular, Virginia's 
current Lieutenant Governor, Winsome Sears. Born in Kingston, Jamaica, 
Lieutenant Governor Sears moved to the United States at the age of 6 
and has since dedicated her life to serving others and her country.
  Outside of politics, she ran a homeless shelter, provided ministry to 
prisoners, and spent 3 years wearing our Nation's uniform in the Marine 
Corps. It was also an honor to serve with Lieutenant Governor Sears in 
the Virginia House of Delegates.
  Since entering public office, Lieutenant Governor Sears has served as 
a Presidential appointee to the United States Census Bureau, as a 
distinguished member of the Advisory Committee on Women Veterans to the 
United States Secretary of Veterans Affairs, as the vice president of 
the Virginia State Board of Education, and, as I mentioned, as a 
delegate in the Virginia General Assembly.
  Upon her swearing-in on January 15 of this year, she became the first 
female veteran to serve as Lieutenant Governor of Virginia and the 
first Black woman to hold statewide office in the Commonwealth.
  We applaud the Lieutenant Governor's lifelong accomplishments and 
thank her for her service to her community, her Commonwealth, and her 
country.

                          HONORING ROSA LUCAS

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Ruiz) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a local leader in 
public health, an exceptional community advocate, my constituent, and 
my friend, Rosa Lucas.
  I first met Rosa during my freshman year at UCLA in 1991 while I was 
working at a farmworker health clinic. Ever since, I have admired her 
integrity, humility, selflessness, and passion for justice.
  Rosa's story begins in Los Angeles, California, December 7, 1945. She 
spent her childhood in Beverly Hills before studying at UCLA-Berkeley 
and UCLA. In 1968, she graduated UCLA with her bachelor's in Spanish 
languages and literature. Shortly after, Rosa launched her career as a 
charge nurse of neurosurgical intensive care at the UCLA Health 
Sciences Center, eventually leading her to become a certified nurse 
practitioner in 1975.
  Ten years later, she settled in our desert and began her work in the 
Coachella Valley.
  Throughout her career, Rosa has worked to serve the poor, the 
marginalized, and the underserved. She has provided care to those most 
in need at rural and farmworker clinics like El Progreso del Desierto, 
Santa Rosa Del Valle Medical Group, Desert Hot Springs Arthritis and 
Medical Clinic, and the Borrego Springs Community Health Foundation. 
Now she works for Eisenhower Health Urgent Care Centers.
  Rosa truly embodies what it means to think globally and act locally. 
She has devoted her life to addressing health disparities in our valley 
and has made it her goal to expand access to healthcare for our most 
vulnerable.

[[Page H3749]]

  As a physician, I have seen her dedication to this mission firsthand. 
In the summer of 1996 during a summer fellowship as a medical student, 
Rosa taught me the well-child exam. I will never forget her passion to 
care for at-risk newborns, and I knew then that she would be a great 
partner in the fight for health and social justice.
  Sure enough, in 2007 when I returned home from medical school, we saw 
patients together and provided free medical care to the poorest 
farmworker communities with the Flying Doctors.
  Together, we joined the founding board of directors for a new 
nonprofit called Coachella Valley Volunteers in Medicine which is the 
only free clinic in the Coachella Valley that provides free healthcare 
to the medically underserved. In fact, we started the street medicine 
program and launched that in order to take care to the people and to 
the homeless under bridges, at the parks, and in the homeless camps. 
Wherever they find themselves, we took care to them, and she still does 
that.

                              {time}  1015

  In fact, Volunteers in Medicine was the first in the valley to 
implement the street medicine model during the pandemic. We took tests 
directly to our most vulnerable populations, including farmworkers and 
the homeless. This model later grew into a collaborative approach to 
vaccinating at-risk populations at work sites, schools, churches, and 
local trailer parks.
  On top of that, Rosa feeds the hungry. She battled food insecurity 
throughout the pandemic, partnering with local organizations to 
coordinate food delivery for the hungry and the food insecure, 
partnering with local promotora organizations.
  Rosa's compassion and incredible service have touched every corner of 
our communities. She has transformed care delivery in our desert and 
opened doors for many.
  As a member of the clinical faculty at CSU San Bernardino, Palm 
Desert, and the UCR School of Medicine, Rosa has helped shape a new 
generation of healthcare providers. She has inspired our communities' 
young people on the advisory boards for the Head Start programs at 
Desert Sands Unified School District and Coachella Valley Unified 
School District.
  For her outstanding service, Rosa has received numerous accolades, 
including the 2019 Senior Inspiration Award from Riverside County, and 
most recently, the 2021 Hometown Heroes Award from the city of 
Coachella.
  Rosa is relentless in her advocacy and never takes no for an answer 
when advocating for the medically underserved and her patients.
  Rosa has been an incredible adviser to me and has had a profound 
impact on the entire Coachella Valley. In fact, I respect Rosa because 
she delivers. She delivers her heart, she delivers her mind, and she 
delivers food. She delivers tests, she delivers vaccines, and she 
delivers healthcare with every inch of her soul and body. Rosa delivers 
herself for the people.
  We are all indebted to Rosa because she is the person who has led the 
charge for so many years and has been a consistent voice. When there 
was none, there was Rosa. When there was none, she provided care and 
delivery.
  On behalf of California's 36th Congressional District, I thank Rosa 
for her incredible service. I am so privileged to have her in my life, 
and I am honored to call her a friend.

                 HOLDING FEDERAL EMPLOYEES ACCOUNTABLE

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. Hice) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. HICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the 
American taxpayer to clarify that the Federal workforce exists to serve 
them, not the other way around.
  During the COVID pandemic, Americans faced uncertainties as 
businesses literally struggled to survive. While these Americans 
wondered whether or not they would receive the next paycheck, there was 
one group, Federal employees, who did not face these type of concerns. 
To the contrary, since President Biden took office, there has been a 
nonstop effort to ensure that Federal workers are treated like a 
protected, privileged class.
  Democrats like to talk about the need to rehabilitate Federal workers 
after the Trump administration's so-called war on civil servants. That 
is absolutely ridiculous. The Democrats' road to recovery apparently 
includes shielding government workers, workers whose positions exist to 
serve the American people. The Democrats want to shield government 
workers from accountability; from any concern of discipline; from the 
obligation to actually perform the duties that they were hired to do; 
and from their duty to serve the elected Representatives of the people.
  But guess what? Despite the claims of trauma during the Trump 
administration, Federal workers were happier during his time in office. 
Why? Simply because the Federal workers were held accountable.
  Let's face it: No one likes working in a situation where you can't do 
anything about poor performers, where you can't do anything regarding 
people who simply refuse to actually do their jobs. The consequences of 
that type of environment is that the actual conscientious workers have 
to pick up the slack, which only adds to their own workloads and 
creates an extremely toxic work environment.
  Nevertheless, Democrats want to continue the false narrative of an 
abused Federal workforce. They want to curry favor with the core union 
constituency by looking for as many ways as possible to increase pay 
and benefits, all under the name of making the Federal Government a 
model employer.
  But model employers hold their workforce accountable. Model employers 
put the customer first. In this case, that is the American taxpayer. We 
don't hear any of this from the Democrats, but you do from the 
Republicans.
  Today, along with a number of my Republican colleagues, I am 
introducing the Accountable Federal Employees Act, which codifies a 
suite of executive orders that President Trump issued, but, 
unfortunately, President Biden has repealed.
  This bill includes a number of commonsense provisions, such as making 
sure Federal employees actually do their jobs rather than spend time on 
union activities. It makes sure that poor performers are held 
accountable. That is something even Federal employees say is sorely 
lacking in the workplace. It creates a process to ensure collective 
bargaining agreements are negotiated in a timely manner and in a way 
that looks out for the best interests of the American taxpayer. It 
makes sure that Federal employees in policy-making roles actually work 
to help implement the policies of the people who were actually elected 
to office.
  This bill represents a platform of sanity and fairness in civil 
service policy and in the workforce of the Federal Government. Frankly, 
any serious effort to modernize the Federal workforce has to start with 
ensuring the best possible level of service for the American people. 
That is what this bill does. I urge my colleagues to join me in this 
effort.

                   MAKING HEALTHCARE MORE AFFORDABLE

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. Carter) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, I rise to celebrate our 
Nation's actions to make healthcare more affordable. Together, we 
provided more resources for the CDC and State and local health 
departments to ensure they are prepared and equipped, implementing 
lessons learned from the pandemic.
  We confronted our most urgent health crises while taking strides to 
reduce unacceptable health disparities. We invested in our veterans, 
focusing on the mental health needs of those who served our Nation.
  We strengthened biomedical research, providing more funding for the 
National Institutes of Health and establishing the Advanced Research 
Projects Agency for Health to cure the previously uncurable. We 
protected the safety of our food and medicine by funding the FDA.
  The pandemic taught us that no one is safe unless everyone is safe. 
That is why we increased funding for global health, to work to prevent 
the next pandemic.

[[Page H3750]]

  With this budget, Democrats are not only making healthcare more 
affordable for all Americans; we are building a healthier and safer 
Nation.


            Helping Working Families with the Cost of Living

  Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, I rise to highlight the 
significant investments we enacted to help working families with the 
cost of living.
  In a time of great uncertainty and change, people are living paycheck 
to paycheck or on fixed incomes. Many are struggling just to pay basic 
bills.
  Our investments represent a lifeline for working families. By 
increasing funding for childcare, public schools, and providing high-
quality job training, this bill gives more tools to help Americans 
succeed.
  Government must serve the people, not the biggest corporations. We 
provided resources to small businesses and entrepreneurs as they pursue 
the American Dream. We invested to connect communities to the internet 
and expand access to affordable housing and homeownership. We 
strengthened our core services and tackled the root causes of rising 
prices.
  One example is by providing $158 million to support the production 
and delivery of small- to medium-size manufacturers, helping detangle 
the supply chain and lower costs to consumers. We paid for it by 
cracking down on big corporations and the wealthiest who are not paying 
their fair share. This government funding legislation truly delivers 
for the people.

                       OUR SENIORS NEED HELP NOW

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Connecticut (Mr. Larson) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam Speaker, Martin Luther King famously 
said in a speech in Memphis that there is always a need to act, but 
especially, as he noted there at the time, with the fierce urgency of 
now.
  The fierce urgency of now, as it relates to Social Security, has been 
underscored by a global pandemic, a global pandemic that has hit the 
world and our country especially hard.
  More than 940,000 Americans have lost their lives. Of those who have 
perished, over 700,000 of them are over age 65. I bring this to the 
attention of the body because COVID has specifically underscored a 
problem that existed amongst our elderly before the outbreak of this 
international pandemic. Over 700,000 over the age of 65 have died. This 
is the same group that is worse hit by the effects of inflation.
  As you know, Madam Speaker, everybody who is on a fixed income and 
has to marshal their resources understands how inflation can be 
crippling. All the more reason that we need to provide relief, and 
relief is on the way. Relief is on the way with the Social Security 
2100: A Sacred Trust Act, currently in the process of being marked up 
in the Ways and Means Committee.
  Our seniors need our help now, as they struggle both with COVID and 
as they struggle being on a fixed income.
  The last time that the United States Congress did anything to enhance 
Social Security was more than 51 years ago. Richard Nixon was the 
President of the United States, and the cost of a gallon of milk was 72 
cents.
  A lot has transpired since then, but what hasn't taken place is 
Congress and its responsibility to make sure that Social Security keeps 
pace with the changes that are needed. The last time Congress did 
anything substantial with Social Security was 39 years ago, in 1983. It 
increased the solvency, but it did so by cutting benefits and taxing 
the elderly.
  Social Security 2100 seeks to enhance benefits, that hasn't been done 
in more than 50 years, and eliminate a burdensome tax on people who 
have to work after they have retired in order to make ends meet.
  I want to especially commend the Congressional Black Caucus and Mr. 
Clyburn for their efforts in this area, underscoring, again, and 
knowing what happens to people of color.
  As Mr. Clyburn so eloquently says: Not only is it people of color, 
but people in rural America. All across the South and all across this 
country, rural Americans are forced to live on fixed incomes that 
haven't been adjusted in more than 50 years. In the midst of COVID and 
this inflation, they are the ones who are hurt the most.
  Congress can no longer afford to kick the can down the road and, once 
again, not address the preeminent program that prevents the elderly 
from living in poverty and the preeminent program that prevents 
children from living in poverty. It is time for Congress to act. It is 
our responsibility to do so.
  As the chair of the Subcommittee on Social Security on the Ways and 
Means Committee, I am proud that Chairman Neal and our membership are 
moving this legislation forward and onto the floor. It wouldn't happen 
without the best efforts put forward by Members of the Congressional 
Black Caucus, and I commend Joyce Beatty for her efforts as well.

                               FARM BILL

  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Carter of Louisiana). The Chair 
recognizes the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Mann) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, in preparation for reauthorizing the farm bill 
in 2023, I rise today to deliver the fifth installment of my farm bill 
impact series where I am highlighting various aspects of the farm bill 
that deserve Congress' awareness and support.
  If America is going to thrive, the people who feed, fuel, and clothe 
America must thrive.
  The farm bill strengthens our country's national security because it 
strengthens our food security by supporting the tireless efforts of 
farmers, ranchers, and our agricultural producers.
  Agriculture is a risky business, and Mother Nature can be a tough 
business partner. Almost no other American industry faces such 
volatility from forces like pests, disease, wind, drought, and fires 
like the ones in Reno County, Kansas, and Paradise, Kansas, over the 
last few months.
  Natural disasters are make-or-break situations for the people who 
ensure that America remains the most food secure country in the world. 
That is why emergency programs within the farm bill are so critical.
  The Livestock Indemnity Program and the Emergency Assistance for 
Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-Raised Fish provide benefits to 
producers for livestock deaths caused by disease and adverse weather.
  A veterinarian from Ashland, Kansas, told me that during the Starbuck 
fire back in 2017, to which he was an emergency responder, Clark 
County, Kansas, alone lost 6,000 to 9,000 head of cattle right at the 
beginning of calving season.
  One producer suffered $1.8 million in cattle losses during this 
disaster. The Livestock Indemnity Program helped producers who lost 
cattle in this disaster put their livelihoods back together.
  However, LIP only covered cattle mortality at the time, not severely 
injured cattle. Rather than watch badly injured cattle get euthanized 
just to trigger LIP program payments, this veterinarian helped make 
changes to the program that are still in place today which provide 
better protection for producers and their livestock.
  These programs, and many more, are investments in the future of our 
country, and they must remain strong in the 2023 farm bill if America 
is going to remain food secure and self-determining as a Nation.
  Natural disasters, diseases, and weather emergencies, unfortunately, 
do happen, and America cannot afford to have these factors cripple the 
businesses of the men and women who keep us fed, fueled, and clothed.
  That is why we need to think carefully and critically about the 
degrees to which we support emergency programs within the 2023 farm 
bill.
  I will be back on the floor soon to deliver another installment of my 
farm bill impact series and highlight more programs and titles within 
the bill that Congress must understand and support to ensure that 
agriculture thrives in America.

               FUNDING FOR ESSENTIAL PROJECTS IN ILLINOIS

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Illinois (Ms. Underwood) for 5 minutes.

[[Page H3751]]

  

  Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate the bipartisan fiscal 
year 2022 appropriations bill becoming law, I am proud to have secured 
over $10 million to fund 10 projects in communities across northern 
Illinois.
  These essential projects will reduce wait times for mental 
healthcare, upgrade infrastructure to ensure clean water, make college 
more affordable and accessible, support foster youth and families, and 
strengthen local emergency response and community safety.
  Last summer, I visited many of the organizations that sponsor these 
projects to learn more about how these funds will impact Illinoisans. 
Independence Health & Therapy will receive $60,000 to expand tele-
psychiatry hours and reduce wait times for mental health services in 
McHenry County.
  The DeKalb County Regional Office of Education will receive $150,000 
to expand the work of the DeKalb County Kindergarten Readiness 
Collaborative and provide quality early learning opportunities to 
residents of Sandwich, Sycamore, and Hinckley.
  The Lake County Stormwater Management Commission will receive nearly 
$1.4 million to prevent impending dam failure of the Sylvan Lake Dam 
and protect nearly 500 homes from flooding and damage.
  The Kendall County CASA Program will receive $200,000 to establish a 
CASA clubhouse which will serve the growing foster youth population by 
providing a free, safe location for families to meet during court-
ordered visitation.
  McHenry County College will receive $825,000 to expand dual credit 
and dual degree programs, offering low-cost college credits to high 
schoolers across McHenry County.
  The Wauconda Fire Protection District will receive $36,000 to replace 
a 28-year-old natural gas emergency backup generator to power the fire 
station's emergency operations center, which provides essential 
services to the 40,000 residents in Lake and McHenry Counties.
  And over $7.5 million is being directed to critical water 
infrastructure projects to ensure safe, clean, and sustainable drinking 
water for residents of Joliet, Pingree Grove, and Richmond.
  From day one, I have worked hard to bring the voices of the 14th 
District to Congress. And as a member of the House Committee on 
Appropriations, I will continue to ensure that our communities' 
priorities are reflected within Federal funding.

  These projects will create jobs and improve the well-being of our 
communities, and I am so proud to deliver this $10.5 million investment 
to my constituents.
  This month, the House passed the bipartisan Honoring our PACT Act 
which would expand healthcare for 3.5 million veterans exposed to toxic 
substances during their service.
  As a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, and an original co-
sponsor of the bill, I am proud to champion this historic legislation.
  Simply put, the Honoring our PACT Act is a full accounting for the 
true cost of war. When our servicemembers signed up to defend our 
country and our freedoms, we made a promise to care for them when they 
returned home. For too long, we failed to keep that promise.
  By passing this bill, we are upholding our end of the pact and 
ensuring every veteran has access to the care they deserve.
  The Senate must pass this comprehensive toxic exposure legislation 
swiftly. Our veterans deserve nothing less.

   PROCEEDINGS OF ADDRESS BY PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY OF UKRAINE

  The following proceedings were held in the Capitol Visitor Center 
before the House convened for morning-hour debate:


          Address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine

  The SPEAKER. Good morning. Good morning, Mr. President. Good morning, 
Madam Ambassador, who is with us this morning, Madam Ambassador 
Markarova.
  Mr. President, it is my honor to present to you the Congress of the 
United States, which has great respect and admiration and appreciation 
for your courageous leadership.
  Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and distinct honor of 
presenting to you the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
  My colleagues, Slava Ukraini. Glory to Heroes.
  (Applause, the Members rising.)
  President ZELENSKYY (Speaking in Ukrainian). Thank you very much. 
Madam Speaker, Members of the Congress, ladies and gentlemen, 
Americans, friends, I am proud to greet you from Ukraine, from our 
capital city of Kyiv, a city that is under missile and airstrikes from 
Russian troops every day, but it doesn't give up. And we have not even 
thought about it for a second, just like many other cities and 
communities in our beautiful country which found themselves in the 
worst war since World War II.
  I have the honor to greet you on behalf of the Ukrainian people, 
brave and freedom-loving people who, for 8 years, have been resisting 
the Russian aggression; those who give their best sons and daughters to 
stop this full-scale Russian invasion.
  Right now, the destiny of our country is being decided, the destiny 
of our people, whether Ukrainians will be free, whether they will be 
able to preserve their democracy.
  Russia has attacked not just us, not just our land, not just our 
cities. It went on a brutal offensive against our values, basic human 
values.
  It threw tanks and planes against our freedom, against our right to 
live freely in our own country, choosing our own future; against our 
desire for happiness; against our national dreams, just like the same 
dreams you have, you, Americans, just like anyone else in the United 
States.
  I remember your national memorial at Mount Rushmore, the faces of 
your prominent Presidents, those who laid the foundation of the United 
States of America as it is today: democracy; independence; freedom; and 
care for everyone, for every person, for everyone who works diligently, 
who lives honestly, who respects the law. We in Ukraine want the same 
for our people. All that is a normal part of your own life.
  Ladies and gentlemen, friends, Americans: In your great history, you 
have pages that would allow you to understand Ukrainians. Understand us 
now, when we need you right now.
  Remember Pearl Harbor, the terrible morning of December 7, 1941, when 
your sky was black from the planes attacking you. Just remember it.
  Remember September 11, a terrible day in 2001 when evil tried to turn 
your cities and independent territories into battlefields, when 
innocent people were attacked from the air, yes. Just like nobody else 
expected it, you could not stop it.
  Our country experiences the same every day. Right now, at this 
moment, every night for 3 weeks now, in various Ukrainian cities: 
Odessa, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Zhytomyr, Vinnytsya, Mariupol, and 
Dnipro. Russia has turned the Ukrainian sky into a source of death for 
thousands of people.
  Russian troops have already fired nearly 1,000 missiles at Ukraine, 
countless bombs. They use drones to kill us with precision. This is a 
terror that Europe has not seen for 80 years, and we are asking for a 
reply, for an answer to this terror from the whole world.
  Is this a lot to ask for, to create a no-fly zone over Ukraine to 
save people? Is this too much to ask, a humanitarian no-fly zone, 
something that Russia would not be able to terrorize our free cities?
  If this is too much to ask, we offer an alternative. You know what 
kind of defense systems we need, S-300 and other similar systems. You 
know how much depends on the battlefield, on the ability to use 
aircraft, powerful, strong aviation to protect our people, our freedom, 
our land, aircraft that can help Ukraine help Europe. And you know that 
they exist, and you have them, but they are on Earth, not in the 
Ukrainian sky. They do not defend our people.

[[Page H3752]]

  ``I have a dream.'' These words are known to each of you. Today, I 
can say, I have a need. I need to protect our sky. I need your 
decision, your help, which means exactly the same, the same you feel 
when you hear the words, ``I have a dream.''
  Ladies and gentlemen, friends, Ukraine is grateful to the United 
States for its overwhelming support for everything that your government 
and your people have done for us: for weapons and ammunition; for 
training; for finances; for leadership in the free world, which helps 
us to pressure the aggressor economically.
  I am grateful to President Biden for his personal involvement, for 
his sincere commitment to the defense of Ukraine and democracy all over 
the world. I am grateful to you for the resolution which recognizes all 
those who commit crimes against Ukraine, against the Ukrainian people, 
as war criminals.
  However, now, it is true, in the darkest time for our country, for 
the whole Europe, I call on you to do more. New packages of sanctions 
are needed constantly, every week until the Russian military machine 
stops.
  Restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is 
based. We propose that the United States sanction all politicians in 
the Russian Federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties 
with those who are responsible for the aggression against Ukraine, from 
State Duma members to the last official who has the lack of morals to 
break the state terror.
  All American companies must leave Russia from their market. Leave 
their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood.

  Ladies and gentlemen, Members of Congress, please take the lead. If 
you have companies in your districts who finance the Russian military 
machine leaving business in Russia, you should put pressure. I am 
asking to make sure that the Russians do not receive a single penny 
that they use to destroy people in Ukraine, the destruction of our 
country, the destruction of Europe.
  All American ports should be closed for Russian goods. Peace is more 
important than income, and we have to defend this principle in the 
whole world.
  We already became part of the antiwar coalition, the big antiwar 
coalition that unites many countries, dozens of countries, those who 
reacted in principle to President Putin's decision to invade our 
country. But we need to move on and do more.
  We need to create new tools to respond quickly and stop the war, the 
full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, which began on February 24. And 
it would be fair if it ended in a day, in 24 hours, that evil would be 
punished immediately.
  Today, the world does not have such tools. The wars of the past have 
prompted our predecessors to create institutions that should protect us 
from war, but they, unfortunately, don't work. We see it; you see it. 
So, we need new ones, new institutions, new alliances, and we offer 
them.
  We propose to create an association. U24, United for Peace, a union 
of responsible countries that have the strength and consciousness to 
stop conflicts immediately, to provide all the necessary assistance in 
24 hours: if necessary, even weapons; if necessary, sanctions, 
humanitarian support, political support, finances, everything you need 
to keep the peace and quickly save the world to save lives.
  In addition, such an association, such a union, could provide 
assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters, man-made 
disasters, who fall victim to humanitarian crises or epidemics. 
Remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest thing 
just to give vaccines, vaccines against COVID, to save lives, to 
prevent new strains. The world spent months, years, doing things like 
that much faster to make sure there are no human losses, no victims.
  Ladies and gentlemen, Americans, if such an alliance would exist 
today--that is, U24--we would be able to save thousands of lives in our 
country, in many countries of the world, those who need peace, those 
who suffer inhumane destruction.
  I ask you to watch one video, a video of what the Russian troops did 
in our country, in our land. We have to stop it. We must prevent it, 
preemptively destroy every single aggressor who seeks to subjugate 
other nations. Please watch the video.
  (Video Presentation.)
  President ZELENSKYY. And in the end, to sum it up, today it is not 
enough to be the leader of the nation. Today it takes to be the leader 
of the world. Being the leader of the world means to be the leader of 
peace. Peace in your country doesn't depend anymore only on you and 
your people. It depends on those next to you and those who are strong.
  Strong doesn't mean big. Strong is brave and ready to fight for the 
lives of his citizens and citizens of the world; for human rights, for 
freedom, for the right to live decently and to die when your time comes 
and not when it is wanted by someone else, by your neighbor.
  Today, the Ukrainian people are defending not only Ukraine. We are 
fighting for the values of Europe and the world, sacrificing our lives 
in the name of the future.
  That is why, today, the American people are helping not just Ukraine 
but Europe and the world to keep the planet alive, to keep justice in 
history.
  Now, I am almost 45 years old. Today, my age stopped when the hearts 
of more than 100 children stopped beating.
  I see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths, and this is my 
main mission as the leader of my people, the great Ukrainians. And as 
the leader of my nation, I am addressing President Biden: You are the 
leader of the Nation, of your great Nation. I wish you to be the leader 
of the world. Being the leader of the world means to be the leader of 
peace. Thank you.
  Slava Ukraini. Glory to Ukraine.
  (Applause, the Members rising.)

                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret Grun Kibben, offered the 
following prayer:
  In You, O Lord our God, we take refuge. Give shelter to those who are 
pursued this day and deliver them. Rescue those whose cities are being 
torn apart, those men, women, and children who are being torn away from 
home and hearth, family and security.
  As we consider the adversities of the people around the globe, sights 
of which are in such contrast to anything we could have possibly 
imagined or considered, call us to arms.
  In addition to the policies we craft, the decisions we make, and the 
negotiations we attempt, we wield the most powerful weapon You have 
given every lawmaker and every citizen: our prayers.
  So, Lord, in Your mercy, hear our prayers. Rise up, O Lord, in Your 
anger. Lift Yourself up against the fury of the enemies. Exact Your 
judgment on those who conceive evil, who give birth to disillusionment. 
Let the evil of the wicked come to an end.
  Then by Your grace, establish the righteous. Provide deep resolve and 
faithfulness in the hearts of the persecuted that they would remain 
strong in You.
  Be their shield. Save the upright in heart and preserve the innocent 
from harm.
  O Lord most high, we depend on Your righteousness. And in the 
strength of Your name, we pray.
  Amen.

          CREATE A RESPECTFUL AND OPEN WORLD FOR NATURAL HAIR

  (Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the CROWN Act, 
Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair, H.R. 2116, which 
I urge this body to pass this Friday in the House.
  I stand in support for all the girls and women who need the freedom 
to be who God made them, to be their beautiful selves from the tips of 
their toes to every twist, wave, and coil of their beautiful hair.
  Fifty-three percent of Black mothers, whose daughters have 
experienced hair discrimination, say their daughters experienced the 
discrimination as early as 5 years old.
  Eighty-six percent of Black teens who have experienced hair 
discrimination state that they experienced it by the age of 12. Trauma 
means that teenage girls are missing a week of school per year due to 
their hair dissatisfaction.
  As a small girl, I remember after school telling my mother about a 
man joking about my perfectly coifed, round Afro. Her lioness reaction 
gave me the strength to endure microaggressions I received when I wore 
my hair in locs, then cornrows or braids as an adult.
  These biases continue to perpetuate unfair scrutiny, and I stand and 
ask you all to stand with me for my daughter and for others like her to 
be their most glorious selves.

                   PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY IS A WAR HERO

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, I was grateful to attend 
the joint session of Congress today to hear directly from the valiant 
Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He is a world hero for 
freedom and democracy.
  Courageous Ukrainians will always be cherished as they protect rule 
of law over rule by gun by authoritarians in a worldwide conflict.
  On Tuesday, President Zelenskyy clarified the war is not against 
Russian citizens. Putin is the mass murderer. President Zelenskyy 
called for Russian soldiers to surrender, and I have offered a 
bipartisan bill in Congress to reward Russian defectors with expedited 
refugee status to the United States, with up to $100,000 for Russian 
equipment turned over to Ukraine.
  In the congressional address today, President Zelenskyy cited Mount 
Rushmore for its busts of American Founders, and I have a bipartisan 
bill in Congress for a bust of President Zelenskyy to be placed in the 
U.S. Capitol, in the tradition of Churchill, Havel, and Kossuth.
  God bless Ukraine. God save Ukraine. Long live President Zelenskyy.

                     SALUTING THE PEOPLE OF UKRAINE

  (Ms. PELOSI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, this morning, Members of Congress, 
Democrats and Republicans, House and Senate, had the high privilege and 
distinct honor of hearing directly from the President of Ukraine, 
Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
  In the face of Russia's cruel and unprovoked invasion, the 
President's fearless, heroic leadership has rallied his Nation and 
inspired the entire world.
  Our Members were very moved by his powerful remarks today, as well as 
the heart-wrenching footage he shared showing Putin's inhumane terror, 
brutally committing war crimes against children.
  As President Zelenskyy said: ``Right now, the destiny of our country 
is being decided . . . Russia has attacked not just us, not just our 
land, not just our cities. It went on a brutal offensive against our 
values--basic human values.''
  Indeed, all are in awe of the extraordinary courage and determination 
of the Ukrainian people as they defend democracy, not only at home but 
democracy around the world.
  It is with great respect for the Ukrainian people, and in recognition 
of the grave threat that Russian aggression poses to the free world, 
that Congress secured $13.6 billion in humanitarian, security, and 
economic assistance for Ukraine in the government funding law that 
President Biden signed yesterday.
  But more needs to be done for the refugees and for the protection of 
the people. I hope that all of this can be done in a bipartisan way.
  So I join my colleague in saluting the people of Ukraine. Slava 
Ukraini. That means ``Glory to Ukraine.'' Glory to the heroes of 
Ukraine.
  Madam Speaker, and in coordination with the Administration and our 
Allies, we have taken strong, bipartisan action to cripple and isolate 
the Russian economy:
  Strangling its banks and taking on the oligarchs funding this war;
  Banning the import of oil and energy products into the United States, 
cutting off the lifeblood of the Russian economy;
  Taking first steps to remove Russia from the WTO; and
  Reauthorizing Global Magnitsky so we can impose further sanctions.
  This week, the House will take our latest, most intense action yet: 
revoking the privilege of permanent normal trade relations from Russia.
  It is my hope that, when it comes to the floor, this legislation 
receives overwhelming bipartisan support, worthy of the valor and 
heroism of the Ukrainian people.

     CONGRATULATING THE LUMPKIN COUNTY LADY INDIANS BASKETBALL TEAM

  (Mr. CLYDE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the 2022 
Georgia High School Association 3A State champions, the Lumpkin County 
Lady Indians girls' basketball team.
  After trailing behind in the third quarter, the Lady Indians defeated 
the Greater Atlanta Spartans girls' basketball team 51-47, winning 
their 28th consecutive game and securing their first championship title 
in school history.
  These talented young women, led by head coach David Dowse, fought 
till the very end, showing incredible athleticism, strength, and 
determination.
  Congratulations to the Lumpkin County Lady Indians girls' basketball 
team on a spectacular win and an exciting new title. Georgia's Ninth 
District is proud of them.

                      SUPPORTING STARBUCKS WORKERS

  (Mr. NORCROSS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, I am back once again to talk about the 
people who brought you the $8 cup of coffee, Starbucks.
  Since I last spoke on the floor, a couple things have changed. The 
$20 million man, Kevin Johnson, has resigned. I think that is a good 
thing. Now, Howard Schultz is back, the former CEO and chairman.
  But plenty hasn't changed. They still send those corporate 
representatives to the stores to intimidate the young workers. They 
subject the workers to

[[Page H3754]]

captive listening sessions. When that doesn't work, they fire their 
employees. Five hundred bucks an hour for an antiunion lawyer to go in 
and fire a $13-an-hour worker. Wow. After what they did in the 
pandemic, this is what we are seeing.
  Howard, do the right thing. Respect your workers. Give them a voice 
in the workplace. Let them vote on the union.

             NATIONAL SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTER DAY

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate National Small Business Development Center Day. SBDC Day 
unites nearly 1,000 Small Business Development Centers across the 
country and the hundreds of thousands of clients they serve.
  Pennsylvania is lucky to have 16 SBDCs across our Commonwealth, and 
they are ready to assist entrepreneurs and small business owners with 
the knowledge and tools needed to make smart decisions and prosper.
  The Pennsylvania SBDCs are a public-private partnership with the U.S. 
Small Business Administration, the Pennsylvania Department of Community 
and Economic Development, and 16 universities and colleges.
  Small Business Development Centers are there to provide resources for 
entrepreneurs of all ages and backgrounds, from underserved communities 
to veterans.
  Madam Speaker, I grew up working for my family's small sporting goods 
business. I know firsthand the drive, dedication, and determination it 
takes to succeed.
  If you are a small business owner, entrepreneur, or are looking to 
get started, be sure to check out a Small Business Development Center 
near you.

            ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN

  (Ms. BROWNLEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. BROWNLEY. Madam Speaker, last week marked the 1-year anniversary 
of the passage of the American Rescue Plan.
  The American Rescue Plan was the bold and necessary action we needed 
to take to put us on the path of economic recovery. This was the boost 
our country needed to get shots in arms, Americans back to work, and 
money back in the pockets of working families.
  Despite unprecedented challenges, the Biden administration has led 
our Nation to record economic growth, including the largest job 
creation in American history. In President Biden's first year, over 7.4 
million jobs were added to the economy. Also, growth is up, wages are 
up, and unemployment is down. But we know we still face inflationary 
times.
  President Biden and Democrats are also acting to fix supply chains 
and taking strong steps to boost competition, strengthen U.S. 
manufacturing, create good-paying jobs, and lower everyday costs. We 
are working towards building a better America and delivering for 
America's working families.

             BAN HAIR DISCRIMINATION THROUGH THE CROWN ACT

  (Ms. BROWN of Ohio asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of 
the CROWN Act. This long-overdue legislation would finally ban hair 
discrimination in schools, in the workplace, and in other public 
spaces.
  No worker should be denied employment because of their natural hair. 
No child should be sent home from school because they choose to wear 
protective hairstyles like Bantu knots or braids.
  Discrimination against Black hair has been and always will be a form 
of racism. Every person deserves to be their true, authentic self, and 
crowns of all types should be embraced.
  I was proud to wear braids on the day of my swearing-in, just as I am 
proud to wear braids as I speak on the House floor today.
  It is time to end hair discrimination in America. It is time to pass 
the CROWN Act.

 PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 963, FORCED ARBITRATION INJUSTICE 
   REPEAL ACT OF 2022, AND PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2116, 
   CREATING A RESPECTFUL AND OPEN WORLD FOR NATURAL HAIR ACT OF 2021

  Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam Speaker, by direction of the 
Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 979 and ask for its 
immediate consideration.
  The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:

                              H. Res. 979

       Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be

     minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary or their 
     respective designees; (2) the further amendment printed in 
     the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this 
     resolution, if offered by the Member designated in the 
     report, which shall be in order without intervention of any 
     point of order, shall be considered as read, shall be

       Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in

     ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary or 
     their respective designees; and (2) one motion to recommit.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from California is 
recognized for 1 hour.
  Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate 
only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Minnesota (Mrs. Fischbach), pending which I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded 
is for the purpose of debate only.


                             General Leave

  Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent 
that all Members be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their 
remarks.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentlewoman from California?
  There was no objection.
  Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam Speaker, the Rules Committee met on 
and reported a rule, House Resolution 979, providing for consideration 
of H.R. 963, the FAIR Act, under a structured rule. It provides 1 hour 
of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking 
member of the Committee on the Judiciary. It makes in order one 
amendment and provides one motion to recommit.
  The rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 2116, the CROWN Act, 
under a closed rule. The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided 
and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Committee on the 
Judiciary and provides one motion to recommit.
  Madam Speaker, the bills we discuss today have to do with fundamental 
American values.
  The first bill under this rule, the FAIR Act, simply restores the 
right of individuals to have their day in court.

[[Page H3755]]

It prevents the use of forced arbitration clauses in consumer and 
employment contracts.
  Most likely, all of us have signed a contract with a forced 
arbitration clause, and many may not even know it. How many Americans 
have read their cell phone contract? How many have read their credit 
card contract?
  Too many consumer contracts are written to protect the pockets of 
corporations, leaving consumers at the mercy of a system created by, 
paid by, and focused on minimizing liabilities of corporate companies.
  These documents are dozens of pages long, and most contain clauses 
that require arbitration in case of a legal dispute and prevent the 
consumer from going to court as an alternative. There is no negotiation 
or choice.
  Ask yourselves, if you saw something that you objected to in a 
contract for your cell phone, what option do you have to change it? The 
answer is no choice at all.
  That is why this is called forced arbitration, and these requirements 
game the system in favor of one party, large corporations. If there is 
a dispute, corporations get to pick the location of arbitration, and in 
many cases, it is out of State; pick the arbitrator; and pay for them. 
Yes, the impartial arbitrator, who depends on corporate contractors, is 
paid for by the corporation. And corporations get to shield the results 
from the public. Imagine that.
  The FAIR Act stops this harmful and abusive behavior. It bans forced 
arbitration clauses in employment, civil rights, and consumer disputes.
  Congress just passed legislation that changed this process for 
disputes involving sexual harassment. However, there are tens of 
millions of Americans who are still affected by forced arbitration in 
other contexts, and this legislation provides those same protections to 
them as well.
  Ensuring fairness under the law is at the center of the second bill 
being considered under this rule, the CROWN Act. This bill would ensure 
that discrimination based on race is not masked as discrimination about 
hairstyles.
  This is legislation that we passed by a voice vote last Congress with 
no objection from the other side. But this year, Republicans decided 
that something had changed--not with the legislation, but with their 
Conference--since they objected to the consideration of this bill under 
suspension.
  The CROWN Act simply clarifies what studies have shown, that 
oftentimes women, particularly Black women, are discriminated against 
based on their natural hair.
  Courts have rejected previous guidance finding that discrimination on 
the basis of hairstyle or hair texture is a violation of the Civil 
Rights Act. So, this legislation simply makes these protections clear, 
that you cannot discriminate on the basis of a person's hair texture or 
hairstyle if that style or texture is commonly associated with a 
particular race or national origin.
  I believe that both of these bills will help to make our legal system 
more fair for every single one of us. I urge passage of the rule and 
these bills.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I thank the Representative from 
California for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself 
such time as I may consume.
  Today, we are here to discuss H.R. 2116, which would clarify that it 
is a Federal crime to discriminate based on an individual's hair. But 
we are also here to discuss H.R. 963, the FAIR Act, which bans 
arbitration clauses in private contracts.
  H.R. 963 makes it clear: The intention is to remove arbitration as a 
legal tool for the American people while preserving arbitration with an 
exemption for labor unions. The belief is that the American people need 
Washington watching over their private contracts. I assure you, those 
in Minnesota's Seventh District do not need them.
  The bill purports to ban forced arbitration. This is misleading 
rhetoric. Forced or involuntary agreements are already illegal. So, 
what would this bill really do?
  It would insert the Federal Government into the private contracts of 
citizens and remove their ability to settle disputes outside of the 
courtroom through predispute arbitration agreements.
  This bill pretends to empower plaintiffs, but by voiding arbitration 
clauses in the context outlined in the bill, it would effectively end 
most arbitration entirely, even when that arbitration would benefit 
those most impacted.

  Because the bill fundamentally changes an arbitration clause from a 
mutual commitment to use an alternative dispute resolution method into 
a one-sided election for an injured party, contracts will be far less 
likely to include the option to arbitrate.
  If parties cannot agree in advance to arbitrate, the plaintiff may 
never have access to arbitration. These unintended consequences will 
have real-life implications, especially for those who lack deep pockets 
and do not have the possibility of a high-dollar settlement that some 
of the more affluent individuals do.
  Democrats are also ignoring how arbitration is generally a good way 
to resolve disputes. They seem to assume that all arbitration is 
secret, that arbitration automatically keeps individuals from going to 
the authorities or publicizing their experiences. But agreeing to 
resolve a case outside of court is different than agreeing to silence.
  That distinction matters here because much of the push for this bill 
comes from concern about secrecy rather than whether justice can be 
served in the arbitration context. And despite that emphasis, the bill 
does not actually address confidentiality or nondisclosure agreements.

  Additionally, arbitration is often less expensive and more efficient 
than litigation. It tends to be less adversarial, which allows parties 
to continue doing business together after the dispute is resolved. That 
is why so many Americans choose to enter into contracts with 
arbitration clauses in them.
  Voting for this rule is a vote for a bill empowering Washington to 
micromanage the business life of Americans. Voting for this rule is to 
take away freedoms from Americans. Congress should stand ready to 
improve the legal system, and we must make sure that whatever we do 
will actually be an improvement for the American people.
  I urge my colleagues to oppose the rule and the underlying bills.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as 
I may consume.
  Madam Speaker, I am going to share three stories from hardworking 
Americans.
  Connie Nagrampa, a California resident, started working as a 
franchisee for a marketing company. The company cheated her out of her 
investments, her life investments. When she tried to seek 
accountability, they forced her into arbitration.
  The company, conveniently enough for them, chose to move the 
arbitration process across the country to the city of Boston. A 
California resident was expected to fly herself and pay for all of her 
expenses to Boston to seek justice. It was too expensive, obviously, 
for somebody who has just lost her life savings. She lost the 
arbitration as a result, and the arbitrator said she had to pay more 
money to the company. Connie spent years attempting to overturn that 
unjust cause.
  Now let me tell you about a brave American Navy reservist, Lieutenant 
Commander Kevin Ziober, whose employer fired him the same day he was 
deployed to Afghanistan. This is blatantly illegal under Federal law. 
But because the employer had forced all of their employees to sign a 
forced arbitration clause, he was unable to make his claim in Federal 
court and get his job back.
  That is what they are defending.
  Let me tell you about another brave military servicemember, Charles 
Beard, whose rights under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, SCRA, 
were violated by his bank.
  SCRA is a bipartisan law which provides financial and legal 
protections to servicemembers and their families when they are on 
Active Duty. This is especially important given how vulnerable Active 
Duty servicemembers can be to predatory lending schemes, identity 
theft, or other unfair financial practices when they are deployed or on 
Active Duty.

[[Page H3756]]

  Mr. Beard is a former sergeant in the Army National Guard, now 100 
percent VA disabled. When he was on tour in Iraq, his wife at the time 
and their five children relied on one vehicle. One day the bank decided 
to repossess that vehicle. It was no longer convenient to keep that 
loan open for somebody risking their life for us, our country.
  This, too, was a violation of the Federal law SCRA because he was 
deployed. When he tried to hold the bank publicly accountable in court, 
he was forced into arbitration because of a forced arbitration clause 
buried in the fine print.
  These are just three stories of hardworking Americans. These are the 
stories of real people that we need to stand up for and protect.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment 
to the rule to provide for consideration of Congresswoman McMorris 
Rodgers' and Congressman Westerman's American Energy Independence from 
Russia Act.
  I ask unanimous consent to include the text of my amendment in the 
Record along with extraneous materials immediately prior to the vote on 
the previous question.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentlewoman from Minnesota?
  There was no objection.
  Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, while the majority is continuing their 
agenda of misguided woke policies, constituents in my district continue 
to send me photos of their energy bills and prices they are paying at 
the pump.
  Since President Biden took office, gasoline prices are up more than 
50 percent, natural gas is up more than 25 percent, and diesel fuel is 
up more than 47 percent. These price increases are on top of crippling, 
unprecedented inflation. They are attacks on Americans of every stripe, 
class, and creed.
  When adjusted for these factors, wages and salaries are actually 
below prepandemic levels. My constituents are pleading with the 
majority to focus on this issue rather than the idealism filled with 
Green New Deal pipe dreams.
  To further explain the amendment, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman 
from South Carolina (Mr. Duncan).
  Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the previous 
question so that we can amend the rule to immediately consider H.R. 
6858, the American Energy Independence from Russia Act.
  We are on the House floor today because House Democrats have decided 
to bring up yet another bill to benefit their special interests instead 
of dealing with the number one pocketbook issue facing the American 
people. That is energy affordability and reliability.
  The world is at the brink of war, and Americans are suffering from 
higher prices not only at the gas pump, but in every part of American 
life because when energy becomes more expensive, everything else does 
as well.
  Recent news reports show that Democrat Members of this body are 
asking the President to declare a climate emergency and halt energy 
production on Federal lands entirely.
  The Transportation Secretary--this is hard to believe--tells 
Americans to stop complaining about high gas prices and buy electric 
vehicles that cost nearly twice as much as the median wage in this 
country. He might as well have yelled, ``Let them eat cake.''

  Energy security is national security and increasing our energy 
security should be the number one priority in Congress today instead of 
finding new ways to enrich trial lawyers.
  Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers' bill, the American Energy 
Independence from Russia Act, of which I am an original cosponsor, is a 
critical step we must take to reverse President Biden's anti-American 
energy policies that have emboldened Vladimir Putin to invade Ukraine. 
As he fought to keep American energy in the ground, our reliance on 
foreign oil grew, and here we are, more reliant on foreign sources 
today.
  Last year, I stood on the floor of this House and talked about the 
flawed decision by President Joe Biden to lift sanctions on the Nord 
Stream 2 pipeline, further tying European nations to Russian sources of 
energy; primarily natural gas, which burns dirtier than American gas.
  In addition, given the resources we have here in the United States, 
we should never buy oil and gas from Russia. That puts American 
consumer dollars right in the pocket of one of the richest men in the 
world, Vladimir Putin. He is laughing all the way to the bank and now, 
sadly, all the way to Ukraine.
  Russian oil imports reached an 11-year high last year in the United 
States, which cost American consumers $17.5 billion.
  The McMorris Rodgers' bill would immediately approve the Keystone XL 
pipeline, remove all restrictions on LNG exports, restart oil and gas 
leasing on Federal lands and waters, and require the Biden 
administration to submit to this Congress an energy security plan to 
reduce energy and gas prices for all Americans.
  Despite President Biden's deflection, this isn't Putin's price hike. 
Gas prices were already up 55 percent from the day Biden took office, 
and this was before Russia invaded Ukraine.
  If you Democrats are going to keep telling lies about American energy 
using TikTok actors to push these lies, I am going to keep telling the 
truth about what policies are failing American families.
  This attack on American energy started during President Biden's 
campaign for President. Putin watched as Biden vowed to eliminate 
fossil fuel production in the U.S. during the 2019 Presidential debate, 
canceled the Keystone XL pipeline on his first day in office, and 
halted all new oil and gas leases on Federal lands.
  Biden's war on American energy knows no limits. This does not have to 
be our reality, folks. The President and the Democrat majority could 
take immediate steps both to strengthen our energy security and reduce 
prices at the pump for American families.
  And hear this: America, the United States, has led the world in 
emissions reductions. You all don't want to acknowledge that. The 
President has completely sold out the environmental left, whose Green 
New Deal policies have caused consumers to pay an average of nearly 
$4.50 per gallon at the pump, the highest cost in United States 
history, and still these costs are rising.
  Further, many of these environmental NGOs pushing the Green New Deal 
policies are funded by Vladimir Putin himself to ensure our dependence 
on Russian energy and kill American energy development.
  The United States is blessed with abundant natural resources, but we 
are cursed with liberal politicians who refuse to allow Americans to 
benefit from them. They also refuse to let our allies benefit. There 
are currently six, Madam Speaker, six LNG export terminal permit 
requests at the Department of Energy. Zero have been approved. Even 
during President Obama's time, more LNG export terminals were approved.
  If Democrats really were interested in cutting Putin's leverage, they 
would be focused on increasing U.S. exports to Europe because European 
nations have 40 percent of Europe's energy supply coming from Russia. 
The reality is, they would rather sell their Green New Deal ideology 
while lining the pockets of tyrants in the Kremlin, Iran, and 
Venezuela. American consumers are paying these tyrants.
  Europe and the rest of the world needs American energy leadership at 
this time. Drill more. Export now. Cut off that money pipeline to 
Vladimir Putin.
  Let's flip the switch and vote on the American Energy Independence 
from Russia Act to unleash American energy production and security.
  Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question so the 
House can immediately consider this important bill.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their remarks 
to the Chair.
  Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as 
I may consume.
  Today, we are supposed to be debating two very important bills to 
help Americans continue to thrive in this great country, but instead my 
colleagues across the aisle want to debate

[[Page H3757]]

about something that they know is incorrect.
  There are over 9,000 approved drilling permits the oil industry is 
not using. And the truth is that changes in domestic energy policy 
often take years to impact global energy markets. They know that.
  But instead, what is happening here is oil companies are using 
Putin's war as an excuse to jack up prices at the pump even more, and 
then they argue for looser regulations, cheaper drilling, and more 
pollution.
  Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a March 4, 2022, opinion 
article from The Guardian written by House Natural Resources Committee 
Chairman Raul Grijalva entitled ``Oil and Gas Lobbyists are Using 
Ukraine to Push for a Drilling Free-for-All in the U.S.''

                   [From the Guardian, Mar. 4, 2022]

  Oil and Gas Lobbyists Are Using Ukraine To Push for a Drilling Free-
                           for-All in the US

                         (By Raul M. Grijalva)

       Last week, we all watched in horror as Vladimir Putin 
     launched a deadly, catastrophic attack on Ukraine, violating 
     international treaties across the board. Most of us swiftly 
     condemned his actions and pledged support for the Ukrainian 
     people whose country, homes and lives are under attack.
       But the fossil-fuel industry had a different take. They saw 
     an opportunity--and a shameless one at that--to turn violence 
     and bloodshed into an oil and gas propaganda-generating 
     scheme. Within hours, industry-led talking points were oozing 
     into press releases, social media and opinion pieces, telling 
     us the key to ending this crisis is to immediately hand US 
     public lands and waters over to fossil-fuel companies and 
     quickly loosen the regulatory strings.
       Our top priority must be ending Putin's hostilities, but as 
     chair of the US House committee on natural resources, I feel 
     duty-bound to set the record straight. We can't let the 
     fossil-fuel industry scare us into a domestic drilling free-
     for-all that is neither economically warranted nor 
     environmentally sound.
       Despite industry's claims to the contrary, President Biden 
     has not hobbled US oil and gas development. In fact, much to 
     my deep disappointment and protest, this administration 
     actually approved more US drilling permits per month in 2021 
     than President Trump did during each of the first three years 
     of his presidency. Before the pandemic, oil and gas 
     production from public lands and waters reached an all-time 
     high, and the current administration has done little to 
     change that trajectory over the last 13 months.
       Fossil-fuel companies and their backers in Congress also 
     profess that more drilling on public lands and waters would 
     lower gas prices for Americans. But if that's true, why 
     hasn't record oil extraction from both federal and non-
     federal lands over the last decade done anything to 
     consistently lower, or at least stabilize, prices at the 
     pump?
       The fact is that crude oil is a volatile global commodity. 
     Worldwide supply, demand, and unpredictable events--like 
     wars--influence the price of gas, not the current 
     administration's decision to approve a few new leases or 
     permits.
       Even if we take industry's claims at face value, nothing is 
     keeping fossil-fuel companies from more drilling on public 
     lands right now. The oil industry already controls at least 
     26m acres of public land and is sitting on more than 9,000 
     approved drilling permits they're not using.
       They have a similarly gratuitous surplus offshore, where 
     nearly 75% of their active federal oil and gas leases, 
     covering over 8m acres, have yet to produce a single drop. 
     Any new leases issued today wouldn't produce anything of 
     value for years, or even decades in some cases.
       If industry did start to ramp up production from federal 
     leases, the overall increase to the total US supply would 
     likely be marginal. In 2020, public lands and waters only 
     accounted for 22% and 11% of oil and gas production, 
     respectively. The vast majority of oil and gas resources are 
     beneath state and private lands--not public lands or federal 
     waters.
       With the facts laid bare, we see the fossil-fuel industry's 
     crocodile tears for what they are--the same old demands for 
     cheaper leases and looser regulations they've been peddling 
     for decades. These pleas have nothing to do with countering 
     Putin's invasion or stabilizing gas prices, and everything to 
     do with making oil and gas development as easy and profitable 
     as possible.
       The US is the world's top oil and gas producer. Doubling 
     down on fossil fuels is a false solution that only 
     perpetuates the problems that got us here in the first place.
       And quite frankly, we can't afford to maintain the status 
     quo. In its newest report the Intergovernmental Panel on 
     Climate Change (IPCC) issued its most dire warning yet on the 
     rapidly accelerating climate crisis. If we fail to enact 
     major mitigation efforts, like curbing fossil-fuel 
     development, both quickly and substantially, we will ``miss a 
     brief and rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a 
     livable and sustainable future for all''.
       Fortunately, there is a path forward that simultaneously 
     cuts the lifeline to fossil-fuel despots like Putin, 
     stabilizes energy prices here at home, and creates a safer, 
     more sustainable planet. We must wean ourselves off our oil 
     and gas dependence and make transformational investments in 
     cleaner renewable energy technologies, like those in the 
     Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Build Back Better Act and 
     the Competes Act, and we must do it now.
       The fossil-fuel industry has had hold of the microphone for 
     far too long. It's time we let the facts speak for 
     themselves.
  Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam Speaker, if my colleagues were so 
concerned about oil prices or the welfare and security of humanity in 
the crisis that is happening in Ukraine, maybe they should have stepped 
up and inquired about the five meetings that the previous 
administration held in secret without staff, only a translator, with 
Vladimir Putin.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

                              {time}  1245

  Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, under the Trump administration, the 
U.S. became a net exporter of petroleum for the first time since 1958.
  Under President Biden's leadership, starting with the revocation of 
the Keystone XL pipeline, the U.S. is back to being a net importer of 
petroleum and is expected to continue through this year. This is 
unacceptable, and our constituents are paying dearly for it.
  Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from South Dakota 
(Mr. Johnson).
  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Madam Speaker, I oppose the previous 
question so that we can, instead, consider the American Energy 
Independence from Russia Act.
  In recent weeks, we have all seen Europe struggle to navigate its 
dependence on Russian energy. It is terrible to be beholden to, to be 
dependent on an adversary. And so, like so many of my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle, I pushed to ban Russian energy imports into 
this country, and I am grateful that we have done that.
  But rather than look to other countries to fill that gap, we should 
be looking here at home. The resources that we need for energy security 
are already located right here. Now, yes, of course, renewables will 
play an important role, but so will North American oil and gas.
  The President made a terrible decision on day one to cancel the 
Keystone XL project. But this bill will move us back in the right 
direction by, once again, allowing the permitting and the leasing of 
oil, gas, and mineral development on Federal lands and waters.
  Developing a plan for that energy security, which this bill would 
also do, to better utilize North American oil and gas, it would reduce 
prices; it would increase energy security; and it would increase 
national security as a result.
  Now, of course my colleague on the other side of the aisle is right. 
Passing this bill would not reduce energy prices overnight. But the 
reality is, the second best time to plant a tree is today. The second 
best time to make this kind of an investment in energy security would 
be right now.
  We did miss too much time. We lost too much time during the first 
year of the Biden administration, but we can get it right now. And 
doing that doesn't just bear security benefits, it is also cleaner.
  Giving the world an opportunity to displace dirty Russian oil with 23 
percent cleaner North American oil would save the equivalent of 100 
million cars' worth of emissions. We can do that. Our stuff is cleaner.
  And so, Madam Speaker, we know that we can build a cleaner, a better, 
a safer energy future, and we can do it by focusing right here at home, 
and that is what H.R. 6858 would do.
  Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, every action the Biden administration 
has taken since Keystone's cancelation has increased our foreign 
dependency on oil. June 2021, 5 months after canceling Keystone, the 
Biden administration suspends leasing of ANWR. Three months later, the 
White House calls on OPEC to boost oil production. Two months after 
that, the Biden administration stopped efforts to modernize the NEPA 
permitting process for domestic extraction.
  Every action this majority has taken is directly responsible for the 
prices

[[Page H3758]]

consumers are seeing today. Fortunately, the solution to this problem 
is very simple.
  Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. 
Johnson).
  Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Madam Speaker, for my colleagues to continue to 
advance this narrative that there are some 9,000 permits out there 
waiting to be drilled demonstrates the naivete of the oil and gas 
industry and it is just, frankly, disingenuous.
  And to make the statement that Vladimir Putin is responsible for the 
skyrocketing cost of gasoline, what a joke. Gasoline was going up 
before Russia ever invaded Ukraine because of President Biden's 
policies.
  Madam Speaker, I rise to oppose the previous question so we can 
immediately consider H.R. 6858, the American Energy Independence from 
Russia Act. I was proud to work on this legislation with Ranking Member 
Rodgers and the Energy and Commerce Committee.
  Madam Speaker, we all saw it today, President Zelenskyy pleading with 
the United States and the West to do more to punish Russia for these 
atrocities and halt Putin's assault on innocent Ukrainians.
  It is obvious that the United States and Europe need to do more. But 
sadly, more, much more, could have been done before this invasion, and 
I believe it could have all been avoided.
  Madam Speaker, you will hear a lot today that energy security is 
national security. Well, ain't that the truth.
  Our European allies, after years of rushing to green, weather-
dependent, unreliable energy, and shutting down their own energy 
resources, have come to learn this the hard way. Their green priorities 
led them to greater and greater dependence on Russia, to the point that 
they could do virtually nothing as Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine.
  Let's not make the same mistake here in America. We can't make our 
energy supply and the energy supply of our allies dependent on some of 
the worst people in the world.
  This legislation would put us on a better path. It would restart the 
Keystone XL pipeline; reopen our Federal lands and waters to access our 
abundant natural resources; and it also includes a provision, 
legislation that I authored, to cut the red tape and unleash American 
liquefied natural gas exports, which our allies in Europe are currently 
clamoring for; ultimately, to get out from under the boot of Putin's 
energy dominance.
  There is still time to make things right, Madam Speaker, so I am 
urging this Chamber to consider H.R. 6858 immediately.
  Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the 
balance of my time.
  Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, the prices American consumers are 
paying at the pump is directly affected by how much oil is produced 
domestically. Canceling American oil production jobs, while seeking it 
from dictators, is not only nonsensical, but it also is against our 
national interest.
  I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gooden).
  Mr. GOODEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise to oppose the previous 
question so we can immediately consider legislation to force President 
Biden to restore our energy independence.
  The United States was the largest producer of oil and gas in the 
world under President Trump. In less than a year, President Biden has 
destroyed our energy sector, created the highest gas prices in American 
history, and crippled our economy in the process.
  There is no logic to this administration's refusal to unleash our 
full energy potential. It is time to ask if this administration is 
holding the reins of power, or if radical environmentalist groups are 
calling the shots at the White House.
  For 2 years, I have been demanding an investigation into foreign 
funding of these environmental organizations. Vladimir Putin has a long 
history of spreading misinformation and using activist groups to deter 
domestic energy production. In just 10 years, the European Union went 
from producing more natural gas than Russia to relying on them for 40 
percent of their natural gas consumption. Russian dark money is to 
blame, and we have to prevent the same thing from happening here at 
home.
  Russia will use every tool at their disposal to undermine our 
national security. And by listening to these radical groups, the Biden 
administration has allowed them to succeed.
  Madam Speaker, we are relying on foreign adversaries and 
authoritarian regimes when we have the resources here at home to bring 
down gas prices and help our allies in Europe. Instead of calling 
Venezuela and Iran, the President should be calling Texas.
  Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the 
balance of my time.
  Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Madam Speaker, how long will the House continue to attack the basic 
freedoms of the American people? It is not for Congress in Washington 
or some bureaucrat to tell the American people what they can and cannot 
do when revolving disputes. That is, frankly, none of their business.
  If they want to agree to an arbitration clause before a dispute 
arises, that is for the American people to decide and not Washington, 
who think they know better than the American people.
  It is not our job to micromanage the lives of our constituents. It is 
our job to safeguard their freedom.
  We need to consider the unintended consequences of this legislation. 
There are many policies in this well-intentioned bill, but if it 
becomes law, contracts will be far less likely to include the option to 
arbitrate. This may not be an issue for people with deeper pockets and 
the ability to hire attorneys, but it will be a concern for those who 
do not have the option of a high-dollar settlement.
  We must also keep in mind that sometimes arbitration is the best way 
to solve disputes. This is just one of the many aspects of this bill 
that needs to be reconsidered before we can move forward.
  I oppose this bill, and encourage my colleagues to do the same. 
Everyone has the best intentions.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam Speaker, the rule allows for 
consideration of these two bills, which will ensure that we are 
providing better protections for consumers and employees.
  The FAIR Act stops large corporations from gaming the system in their 
favor, and allows consumers the opportunity to have their day in court.
  And the CROWN Act ensures that we do not allow discrimination in any 
way, shape, or form. These are commonsense bills that help the American 
people.
  The material previously referred to by Mrs. Fischbach is as follows:

                   Amendment to House Resolution 979

       At the end of the resolution, add the following:
       Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the 
     House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the 
     bill (H.R. 6858) to strengthen United States energy security, 
     encourage domestic production of crude oil, petroleum 
     products, and natural gas, and for other purposes. All points 
     of order against consideration of the bill are waived. The 
     bill shall be considered as read. All points of order against 
     provisions in the bill are waived. The previous question 
     shall be considered as ordered on the bill and on any 
     amendment thereto to final passage without intervening motion 
     except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled 
     by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on 
     Energy and Commerce; and (2) one motion to recommit.
       Sec. 4. Clause l(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the 
     consideration of H.R. 6858.

  Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on 
the rule and the previous question. I yield back the balance of my 
time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous 
question.
  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it.
  Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered.
  Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question 
are postponed.

  (Ms. SPANBERGER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker, I stand here to recognize the 
incredible achievement of Midlothian resident Keira D'Amato.
  Earlier this year, Keira broke the American record for the women's 
marathon, winning the Chevron Houston Marathon with a 2-hour, 19-
minute, and 12-second finish. For those of you keeping score, that is 
24 seconds faster than the previous record set back in 2006.
  This new record demonstrates Keira's remarkable resiliency, it shows 
her undeniable passion, and it highlights her proven ability to 
overcome injuries and adversity.
  As a mother of two, Keira is not just a winner, she is an ambassador 
for her

sport. Her enthusiasm is already inspiring the next generation of 
Virginia marathon runners.
  Today, on behalf of Virginia's Seventh District, I want to 
congratulate Keira for making Chesterfield County, central Virginia, 
and our entire Commonwealth proud. We are honored to be the home of a 
true American champion.

                      HONORING ROY AND WILMA BROWN

  (Mr. ROSE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, today, I rise to honor Roy and Wilma Brown, 
who celebrated their 80th wedding anniversary this Monday.
  Married on March 14, 1942, at the Cumberland County Courthouse, Roy 
and Wilma have remained at each other's side ever since.
  Through the ups and downs of raising five children on a family farm 
in middle Tennessee, in the early days with no running water or 
electricity, the Browns have been no stranger to hardship but have 
always leaned on the Lord. On their 69th anniversary, Wilma said: ``God 
has blessed us so much, and we are so thankful.''
  Madam Speaker, today, I thank Roy and Wilma Brown for serving as a 
reminder to all of us, both young and old, of the power and longevity 
of true love. May both Roy and Wilma have a blessed 80th anniversary, 
and may this day serve as an inspiration for generations to come.

                        INCREASING EtO AWARENESS

  (Ms. NEWMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. NEWMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today for Matt Haller. Matt Haller 
was an Illinois resident who passed away in 2019 from stomach cancer 
that is believed to have been linked to the local EtO sterilization 
plant near his home.
  These same EtO cancerous chemicals are used today to sterilize an 
assortment of foods in the United States. While the chemical is clearly 
banned for food sterilization in other countries around the globe, it 
continues to be used in America for everyday food products like spices, 
dried herbs, dried vegetables, and much more. Food sterilized with EtO 
does not even require food labeling in the U.S.
  I am introducing the Matt Haller EtO Awareness Act to finally change 
that. This commonsense legislation would provide Americans the right to 
know if food has been treated by known carcinogenic substances through 
accurate labeling.
  Let's increase transparency around EtO, let's bring awareness to 
cases like Matt Haller's, and let's pass this bill.

                         HONORING JASMINE MORAN

  (Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the 
remarkable life of Mrs. Jasmine Moran, an admirable Oklahoma Fifth 
District philanthropist.
  After surviving World War II in England, she uprooted her life to 
move to Seminole after meeting her husband, an oil man from Oklahoma.
  Inspired by a children's museum in Michigan, Mrs. Moran decided to 
start her own in Seminole in hopes of reigniting the city. Eventually, 
her idea came to life, and she created a world-class children's museum 
that attracts 70,000 visitors a year.
  But she didn't stop there. Almost single-handedly, Mrs. Moran created 
an animal shelter that adopts out 75 animals a month.
  Mrs. Moran's generosity, resilience, and commitment to the betterment 
of her community and everyone around her is truly inspiring.
  Though she will be deeply missed, there is no doubt that through her 
selfless endeavors, her legacy will live on forever. Mrs. Moran's story 
and the way she lived her life should stand as an inspiration to all 
Oklahomans.

                RELIEF FOR VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to indicate that finally 
we have passed and signed into law the Violence Against Women Act.
  After years of introducing it and passing it in the United States 
House of Representatives, we came together, and today at the White 
House, relief has been given to the millions of victims of domestic 
violence, rape, and sexual assault.
  We provided the opportunity for enhanced police efforts for trying to 
stop the most dangerous calls of police officers: domestic violence; 
dealing with cultural groups that respond to this in a different way; 
and once and for all, stopping the dastardly act of raping Indian women 
and escaping prosecution. Now we allow the courts on Indian 
reservations to be able to bring people to justice.
  We have provided a place for abused persons to live. We have given 
more money to area shelters, like the Houston Area Women's Shelter, and 
we responded to the advocates across America.
  I am glad to have written and authored H.R. 1620. I thank all of 
those who ultimately brought that bill to law. Now, the President has 
done what he has always wanted to do, to have the Violence Against 
Women Act reauthorized.

                  STOP THE ASSAULT ON AMERICAN ENERGY

  (Mr. CARL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. CARL. Madam Speaker, over the past few weeks, we have made it 
very clear how important it is for the United States to produce its own 
energy rather than rely on other countries for our supplies.
  The President and his allies have made things very clear that this is 
the thing that they want to do, shutting down American energy 
production, but the reality truly is that we can produce energy cleaner 
and more efficiently than any other nation on the planet.
  This administration decided to shut down American pipelines and shut 
down American energy production, which has done nothing but drive up 
the energy costs while threatening our national security and 
strengthening our adversaries around the globe. We simply cannot allow 
this to continue.
  President Trump's hard work to increase energy production and his 
leadership actually made us energy independent instead of energy 
dependent during his time.
  America has the resources and the ability to meet our supply needs, 
and I encourage the President to end his assault on American energy.

                BRING BACK AMERICAN ENERGY INDEPENDENCE

  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. Jacobs of California). Under the 
Speaker's announced policy of January 4, 2021, the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. Johnson) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of 
the minority leader.


                             General Leave

  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous material on the subject of my 
Special Order.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Louisiana?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, we have another crisis, yet 
another crisis, created by the policy choices of this White House.
  The national average price for a gallon of gas reached $4.32 on 
Sunday; and, yes, that is the highest price in U.S. history.
  Last Thursday, we also learned that U.S. inflation soared 7.9 percent 
over the past 12 months. That is the largest spike in consumer prices 
in 40 years.
  Now, the Washington Democrats' blame game is in full swing. Just to 
get this straight, at first, according to Democrats, they said 
inflation ``wasn't happening.'' Then inflation was ``merely 
transitory,'' they tried to convince us. Then inflation somehow only 
hurt

[[Page H3764]]

rich folks; that was the only line of reasoning.
  But Washington Democrats' latest fiction might be their greatest yet: 
That the past year of steady, unrelenting price increases for gas and 
consumer goods is actually Vladimir Putin's fault.
  Yes, that is right, Madam Speaker, Vladimir Putin. He didn't kill the 
Keystone pipeline. Joe Biden did. Vladimir Putin didn't ban drilling 
for oil on Federal lands. Joe Biden did that. Vladimir Putin didn't 
pass trillions upon trillions in unnecessary government spending in a 
single year. Joe Biden and the Washington Democrats did that.
  Madam Speaker, what is so hard about just being honest with the 
American people? President Biden should accept responsibility for the 
past year of rising prices and pledge to correct course. He had better, 
or we are in for more and more pain.
  The President should do everything in his power to make it easier, 
not harder, for America to produce more oil and gas. This would lower 
prices for the American people. It would make our country and Europe 
less dependent on foreign energy. But instead, President Biden says he 
actually ``can't do much right now'' about the skyrocketing gas prices.
  The Democratic Caucus leader said the issue of gas prices ``hasn't 
come up'' during his party's caucus meetings. Really? You haven't made 
time to discuss any solutions to the number one issue facing Americans 
right now?
  Now that the Biden administration and Congressional Democrats know 
they are in a tight spot, here is the thing: They are trying to 
convince the American people that an American President can't control 
gas prices in the United States but Russians can. Good luck with that.
  I thank my colleagues for being here tonight for my Special Order 
hour this evening.
  Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. 
Meuser).

                              {time}  1730

  Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, we have a very, very serious energy crisis 
here on our home shores. As fuel continues to rise, the Biden 
administration continues to point fingers at anybody but themselves--
they have done it many times before--for this self-inflicted crisis.
  There are statements such as this is Putin's fault. The fact is, 
though, that the numbers truly tell a different story, and they do, in 
fact, tell the truth.
  This situation cannot be denied by many of our colleagues here in the 
House, that we are issuing virtual propaganda about the realities of a 
national crisis.
  On January 20 of last year, a gallon of gas cost $2.39. After a year 
with the Biden administration, and with much of the House leadership 
supporting, we shut down the Keystone pipeline; paused leases for 
energy development; failed to approve even one permit for drilling, not 
one; imposed new regulations on the energy industry; threatened higher 
taxes on energy companies; and, yes, actually warned banks and 
financial institutions not to make investments in our domestic energy 
industries.
  Yet, what is coming from the White House, and many in this House, is 
to blame Putin for the gas prices. It is just horrible propaganda.
  Last week, the President actually told the American people that he 
``can't do much right now'' to lower gas prices. Yes, you can. Yes, it 
can be done.
  Meanwhile, they are looking at Iran, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, and, up 
until recently, Russia. So why don't we look at central Pennsylvania, 
west Texas, New Mexico, Louisiana?
  Create American energy and American jobs. We need to reverse the 
policies that have depressed production, throttled back investment, and 
led to higher gas prices at the pump and for heating people's homes 
nationwide.
  Madam Speaker, energy security is national security. I think we have 
all heard that. It has never been more important to be reminded of it 
than today. We must reverse these damaging policies now and safeguard 
our Nation's security for today and tomorrow.
  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, from energy States like 
ours--Pennsylvania, Louisiana, and the others--we have been saying this 
for a long, long time: Energy security is national security. Now, 
everybody recognizes it.
  Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Tiffany), 
another gentleman who knows quite a bit about this issue.
  Mr. TIFFANY. Madam Speaker, 2 weeks ago, we were here and heard about 
how President Biden was going to use every tool at his disposal, every 
tool, to combat skyrocketing energy costs.
  Now, this is the same administration that told us the border was 
secure. That was about a year ago, a little less than a year ago. The 
border was secure. And we just saw in the last month, once again, 
record numbers of people coming in illegally to our country across the 
southern border.
  Of course, as the gentleman from Louisiana just said, inflation was 
``transitory,'' and we are starting to hear that his chief economic 
adviser is saying maybe it is not so transitory. We are seeing record 
numbers now, this month, in regard to inflation.
  Well, it all started January 20, 2021, with the shutdown of the 
Keystone pipeline and all the other actions that were taken to limit 
production here in America.
  We saw what is turning out to be a foreign policy disaster, the okay 
of the Nord Stream pipeline that is delivering natural gas to Western 
Europe, something the previous administration would never do.
  This is all part of the green fantasy here in America that has become 
America's nightmare.
  Back home in my district, it is $2.85 a gallon to heat your home with 
propane right now. Propane is used by about a third of the homeowners 
in the district that I live in. They paid $1.50 in August 2021. They 
paid $0.80 a gallon in August 2020. That is what they are facing.
  President Biden came to my district right after the State of the 
Union speech, came to Superior, Wisconsin. Once again, we were anxious 
to hear how he is going to use every tool, every tool possible, to 
provide energy for America.
  But we didn't hear a thing about rerouting the pipeline through 
northern Wisconsin that is held up because a permit is not issued by 
the Governor of Wisconsin and his Department of Natural Resources.
  We didn't hear a single thing about Line 5 that goes through the 
Straits of Mackinac--the Governor of Michigan shut down that permit 
last year--a major throughput to Canada and the entire Midwest.
  We didn't hear a word about rebuilding the refinery in Superior, 
which we hope is complete soon. He was there on an infrastructure tour. 
That refinery produces all kinds of asphalt. Don't you think that would 
be a really good time--infrastructure, asphalt--to talk about 
rebuilding that refinery?
  Finally, he didn't say a thing about a natural gas plant that is 
proposed for Superior, Wisconsin, nearly a billion-dollar investment to 
produce clean electricity with natural gas.
  We didn't hear a word about producing more fertilizer for those 
farmers to grow our crops. We didn't hear a word about that.
  This President does not understand security. Job security, thousands 
of jobs--two of the major pipeline manufacturers in the United States 
are right in Wisconsin. We didn't hear a thing about economic security, 
the inflation that is, in part, a result of these increased energy 
costs. We didn't hear a thing about national security, and that is what 
is at stake.
  The Biden administration has let us down on all three fronts, job 
security, economic security, and national security.
  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for his 
remarks.
  Madam Speaker, when we think about energy States, of course, we 
probably think about Texas first. I am delighted to yield to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin), who represents that State so well.

  Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague and friend across the 
Sabine River from me, Mr. Johnson, for having this Special Order.
  President Biden and the Democrats hate the facts because the facts 
are not

[[Page H3765]]

on their side. If we are being honest, the facts haven't been on their 
side for a very long time. Nevertheless, they continue perpetuating the 
lie that domestic energy is somehow bad, and foreign energy is somehow 
good.
  So, join me. Let's take a look at the facts here. The refineries, 
petrochemical plants, and American businesses in and around my 
district, the 36th Congressional District of the State of Texas, are 
unmatched worldwide.
  For years, they have showcased what our country does best, and that 
is producing superior, high-quality petroleum products by leading in 
technological innovation.
  The best and brightest Americans are constantly discovering new ways 
to enhance safety, lower emissions, and provide the world with 
affordable and reliable energy.
  But the left, the leftist Democrats, they don't seem to care. They 
would rather lambaste the American public for not buying a $60,000-plus 
electric vehicle. In fact, they would rather help tyrants and communist 
countries become energy powerhouses than to spend even one cent 
supporting U.S. oil and gas jobs, American ingenuity, or our state-of-
the-art facilities.
  And in the name of what, eliminating greenhouse gases? Give me a 
break.
  Here is a reality check. When we increase our dependency on foreign 
nations for our energy needs, we increase our carbon footprint. Simple.
  America makes the cleanest energy on the planet--fact. Foreign oil 
and gas are not produced using the stringent environmental regulations 
that we have here in America, not to mention foreign oil must travel 
farther on less safe and less environmentally friendly modes of 
transportation to get that product here.
  If Biden and my Democrat colleagues want to talk about cleaner 
energy, they must first accept the fact that we, America, lead in 
reducing harmful pollution worldwide.
  Americans are sick of suffering from Biden's anti-oil and gas agenda 
that supports dirtier energy, funds corrupt governments, kills their 
jobs, weakens our national security, and raises the cost of everything.
  I spent $125 filling up my Ford F-150 pickup truck this past Monday, 
just as an example.
  But here is the bottom line: If Biden and the left honestly believe 
that foreign energy is the best option, then they really do not care 
about the environment or the security of our own Nation, the United 
States of America.
  Acknowledge the facts. Put America first. Unleash our energy sector. 
Help the environment. End our dangerous dependence on foreign 
adversaries.
  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, I thank Dr. Babin. That is 
Texas strong, as we expected.
  Madam Speaker, one of the strongest Republican delegations in our 
Congress comes from another State, Tennessee. I am delighted to yield 
to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Rose), one of the hardest working 
men in Congress.
  Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding time 
tonight.
  Madam Speaker, despite what President Biden and congressional 
Democrats have to say, higher prices at the fuel pump are not because 
of a Putin price increase.
  The price of a gallon of gas increased from $2.31 a gallon since 
President Biden's inauguration to $3.48 the week before Putin's 
invasion of Ukraine. That is a 50 percent increase before the invasion 
of Ukraine even began.
  But make no mistake, the Biden administration is doing everything 
they can to blame the increase on Russia's invasion of Ukraine. They 
have turned to their allies in the mainstream media to carry their 
talking points.
  But I urge all Americans not to let the headlines or TikTok 
influencers fool you. This is a crisis caused by President Biden and 
congressional Democrats' anti-energy policies, not Putin's invasion of 
Ukraine.
  Unfortunately, we all knew this was coming when President Biden said 
on the campaign trail that he would ``transition away from the oil 
industry.''
  During his first days in office, President Biden declared war against 
American energy. He moved his plan into action by canceling the 
Keystone pipeline and other projects, imposing new regulations on the 
oil and gas industry, and stalling new leases on oil and gas projects 
on Federal lands.
  If the President has a legitimate plan to lower energy prices and 
fight inflation, we, the American people, would love to see it.
  But until we do, I can only guess the President's plan is what he has 
done since taking office: spend trillions of dollars and hope Americans 
purchase expensive electric vehicles. That is not a plan. It is a pipe 
dream.
  The truth is that this is not the America President Biden inherited. 
Under President Trump, America was energy independent, even a net oil 
exporter. Inflation was well under control. Gas was less than $2.50 a 
gallon, and our enemies were our enemies, not potential trade partners.
  But the price of a gallon of gas, along with inflation, has increased 
every single month since President Biden was inaugurated. The resulting 
harm to our country has been mostly self-inflicted and largely driven 
by Democrats' massive deficit spending and by the fact that the 
President has declared war on the U.S. oil and gas industry from his 
first day in office.
  Every step he has taken to hinder the oil and gas industry diminishes 
capitalism, the very engine of our economy and our relatively high 
standard of living.
  Whether it is in our schools or with our healthcare decisions, 
President Biden's administration wants you to do what they say instead 
of trusting what has made us the most prosperous country in the history 
of the world.

  Republicans in Congress stand ready to implement policies to make 
America energy independent again. It is time for the President to 
reverse the war against American energy and recognize that the solution 
to his energy crisis exists right under our feet. Still, the President 
refuses to pull his head out of the sand to tap into it.
  He will stop at nothing to satisfy his leftwing base, even if it is 
at the expense of everyday, hardworking Americans, who I am proud to 
represent in middle Tennessee.
  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, a lot of comments there from 
the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Rose), and we will stay on that theme 
for the great State of Tennessee.
  Madam Speaker, I am happy to yield Mr. Burchett, another gentleman 
from that great State, for more common sense.
  Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I greatly appreciate Chairman Johnson 
for heading this up day after day.
  I just wonder, have the Democrats been to the gas pumps lately? I 
used to love to go to the gas pumps and talk to folks to see what was 
going on. Now, honestly, I am afraid to even make eye contact with 
somebody because they are going to light you up, Madam Speaker.
  I know we see a lot of these little, cute stickers. That is not my 
thing. I don't want to cause any vandalism with our President pointing 
at the pump saying, ``I did that,'' but the truth is, he did do this.
  If they would listen to what is going on, they would know that 
America is ticked, and they should be. The national gas average today 
is $4.30 a gallon. The average a year ago was $2.87.
  In 2020, gasoline or oil was around $17 a barrel, and today, I 
believe it has dropped to $95. I heard someone from the White House 
earlier bragging about how oil has dropped. I mean, that is the 
Washington way, to not talk about how it was at $17 a couple of years 
ago, but talk about how it has dropped from over $110 down to $95.
  Madam Speaker, we need to turn the spigots back on. We need to get 
back into the oil business. The oil and gas companies, we have been 
told that they have the permits, and then they boast about that, that 
they are not drilling because of it.

                              {time}  1745

  The truth is, Madam Speaker, not enough pipelines have been permitted 
to move the product. If they get it, there is nowhere for it to go. 
There is no storage capacity. There is no way to move the product. The 
pipelines have to be completed, and that is part of the master plan 
here.
  As has been stated by Members on this floor and other times, I have 
heard, $7 a gallon and electric vehicles are in. That is no way to 
drive innovation, Madam Speaker. Innovation is

[[Page H3766]]

driven through creativity, through capitalism, not by crooked 
politicians and evil folks trying to change the American agenda.
  Electric cars are not affordable yet. Over $50,000 a car. That is 
ridiculous. You have got over eight adapters on the plugs. It takes 
several hours to charge. I don't know if you have ever driven across 
country or not with a family but stopping 8 hours at a truck stop is 
not my idea of a vacation.
  Renewables aren't reliable sources for our power grids. Democrats 
seem to double down, though, on these crazy woke environmental agenda 
issues. It just creates higher energy bills for Americans, Madam 
Speaker, and increases costs for business. That is why everything is 
up.
  If you look at the price of fuel, I filled up my daughter's Dodge 
diesel the other day, and it cost me over $100. Why are we doing this 
to ourselves? We can turn the spigots back on. We can put Americans 
back to work. We can increase our economy. We can show the world that 
we are leaders.
  As the Ukrainian President stated so eloquently this morning, our 
President needs to lead the world. It is a shame when a country that 
small has to call on a power as great as America and tell its leaders 
to lead once again. Until things change, though, Madam Speaker, Biden's 
economy is a bust.
  I appreciate Chairman Johnson and his truculent behavior. He has 
raised this from more than lackluster, and I want to praise him for 
that.
  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, I appreciate my friend. He 
has been a faithful participant in the Special Order hours, getting the 
message to the American people, and it is so important right now.
  Madam Speaker, I yield next to the gentleman from California (Mr. 
LaMalfa), another gentleman who has been very faithful to deliver this 
message to the American people week in and week out.
  Mr. LaMALFA. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Louisiana (Mr. 
Johnson) for faithfully helping us get the message out, facilitating 
that because what is really important is that we are talking to the 
American public about this situation that we don't have to be in.
  Indeed, we have seen with the fairly new Biden administration that 
inflation has risen tremendously. Now, I don't get pleasure out of 
bagging on the President or anybody else in this, but we just have to 
go to the core of the issue. The policies that have been put into place 
have harmed the U.S. economy, harmed regular families.
  The cost of fuel has been an especially noticeable part of this. In 
my home State of California, we always enjoy--enjoy--extra costs 
because of the way things are done there. If it is $4 for a gallon of 
gas in the rest of the country, it is $5.50 in my home State because of 
the dumb things we do out there.
  So this recent surge, indeed, is affecting everybody, but it is an 
even greater burden on rural residents that have to drive longer 
distances. Maybe their jobs in agriculture or timber or mining are more 
based on the usage of fuel and other inputs that are fuel related. So 
that means that there are fewer exports of things that are produced in 
rural America, fewer services, there is going to be less employment as 
a result of this, too, because of the high cost of everything.
  We are talking to some truckers. We are seeing there is a point where 
they can't deliver anymore because they can't afford the fuel and that 
will be soon. Imagine that, when you go to the retail level, and you 
can't get the normal things off the shelf you are used to. We are 
already seeing that. There are fewer food choices, fewer choices. You 
are waiting longer for parts to come to repair vehicles or do anything 
else.
  When rural residents, especially, have to drive longer to do 
anything, whether it is to take kids to school, get to health services, 
pick up goods they need to do their job, it is just that much greater 
of a burden at these prices.
  Take law enforcement, for example. Now, cops, especially rural ones, 
they have got a lot of driving to do to cover those rural areas, and 
their costs are going through the roof. That means counties, small 
cities are bearing a greater burden just to try and keep patrols out 
there. So that is indeed a detrimental effect on basic public safety.
  Farmers, too. We are getting ready to plant our crop on our farm 
here. I don't even want to know what the fuel price is to top off my 
tanks, but I have to because it is so high. That is going to be passed 
on to the shelves for people to buy food all across the country or the 
farmer is going to go out of business if he can't get the price he 
needs to at the store.
  Rural jobs are extremely important for our economy. They are 
producing things that people eat, the fiber they use to make clothes 
that people wear, the wood and paper products we use for our homes and 
our business.
  It is really, really high time we take action and produce energy in 
this country because we can, we should, and we can affect the world 
market and make it where Russia is not making a killing off their 
energy because it is a supply-and-demand issue. If we fill the 
marketplace with low-cost energy, it will bring all this back in line. 
We will be in a better position as a Nation to help our colleagues, our 
neighbors in the western part of Europe, and cripple Putin's ability to 
make a killing off what he is doing.
  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for his 
comments. There are so many consequences to these bad policy choices, 
and I appreciate his illuminating many of those tonight.

  Madam Speaker, I yield next to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. 
Clyde), another faithful messenger for the truth in America.
  Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, while the devastating war in Ukraine is 
heartbreaking, we cannot turn a blind eye to the crises that President 
Biden has created here at home, especially when the American people are 
paying for his failed policies.
  Last week, inflation hit another new, 40-year high of 7.9 percent in 
February, continuing to impose a hidden tax on every solitary American.
  Prices at the pump, utility bills, and costs in the grocery store 
checkout line just keep getting worse.
  Yet, instead of reversing his disastrous policies and reducing 
government spending in order to alleviate the pain inflicted on 
Americans' wallets, President Biden pivots to offer deceptive excuses.
  First, we were told inflation was just transitory, that is it, but 
when price hikes continued, the new spin comically became that 
inflation is a good thing.
  A good thing, really? Struggling Americans would beg to differ, Mr. 
President.
  When that messaging failed, the talking points quickly evolved to 
blame higher prices on corporate greed. It appears the Biden 
administration enjoys pointing fingers at others instead of admitting 
the truth.
  Now, in light of Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine, the Biden 
administration's convenient scapegoat is Russian President Vladimir 
Putin, disingenuously labeling the ongoing inflation as Putin's price 
hike.
  Make no mistake, inflation was skyrocketing long before Putin's 
troops set one foot into Ukraine. These are most certainly President 
Biden's price hikes. He is responsible, and no amount of dishonesty can 
hide the truth from the American people.
  In fact, Americans simply can't afford to buy any more of Biden's 
deceptive excuses. Instead of playing the blame game while workers, 
families, and small businesses suffer, the Biden administration and 
congressional Democrats must reverse course on their wasteful spending 
and failed economic policies. We must return to the America-first 
principles that truly helped the American people thrive.
  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend. He has a 
way of putting it so clearly, and I am grateful for his voice. It is so 
consistent.
  Madam Speaker, I yield next to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. C. 
Scott Franklin), who came to Congress after 26 years of distinguished 
service as a naval aviator and knows of what he speaks.
  Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. Madam Speaker, I always appreciate 
my colleague from Louisiana's leadership on these important issues and 
I appreciate the time he is yielding me.
  Madam Speaker, as my colleagues have shared, the Biden administration

[[Page H3767]]

has been defined by a series of self-inflicted crises. These include 
failed leadership on the world stage, runaway inflation, and a 
deliberate failure to secure our borders. In fact, you could say they 
are having a record year, record high inflation, record violent crime, 
record gas prices, record numbers of illegal immigrants, seizures of 
illegal drugs all at our southern border. The common denominator in 
each of these disasters is the President himself.
  The President listened to the State Department over the 
recommendation of his generals, which led to last year's disastrous 
withdrawal from Afghanistan.
  He shut down American energy production, which led to skyrocketing 
gas prices long before Russia invaded Ukraine.
  He catered to the radicals, flooding our economy with trillions in 
free money, and that has created the rampant inflation that we are 
experiencing today.
  On the border, his reversal of President Trump's policies has led to 
nearly two million migrants pouring across our southern border since he 
took office. That is more than the population of 15 of our States. 
Think about that, the equivalent of creating a State or two every 
single year with the number of people crossing the border.
  These disasters were completely self-inflicted, and American families 
are paying the price.
  Despite our political differences, I take no joy in watching this 
administration fail. When our President fails, America fails.
  Madam Speaker, the American people need and deserve a true leader. If 
the President is incapable of leading, he has a duty to surround 
himself with smart people willing to give him good counsel in the best 
interests of our Nation. Listen to the smart ones and not those with a 
track record of failure, and then act on it.
  The President should focus on American energy independence, which 
will bring down gas prices here at home and help our allies abroad. He 
should not be talking to a Venezuelan dictator when we have reliable, 
affordable energy right here at home. He also needs to stop the out-of-
control spending and reinstate tough border policies to protect our 
communities.
  For the sake of our country, this administration must stop 
administrating and implementing the worst ideas of the D.C. political 
class and lead decisively.
  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as 
I may consume.
  Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Florida for bringing that 
wisdom to the floor tonight. There has been a theme here this evening 
with all of my colleagues who have participated in this Special Order 
hour. We have an energy crisis, the latest crisis that has beset the 
American people because of terrible policy choices from this White 
House and the Democrats in Congress. It is just plain and simple, those 
are the objective facts.
  It seems like almost a decade ago now, but just a little over a year 
ago, if you rewind to the Trump years, you can recall, and everyone 
will know again more objective truth, objective facts, how well we were 
doing in all of these areas.
  President Biden came in and did exactly the opposite. I mean, when 
President Trump took office, he came in--I remember very vividly the 
first time he came and spoke with the House Republicans in our 
conference, and he told us, among the first commitments he made to us--
I mean, this is January of 2017. He was just taking office. We had just 
begun that Congress, and he came and spoke to us and said, ``I don't 
want to talk about energy independence anymore. I want to talk about 
energy dominance.'' Dominance, he said.

  Of course, from an energy State like mine in Louisiana, the Louisiana 
delegation was delighted to hear that because we know what it means not 
only for our State's economy but for the stability, the security of our 
entire country.
  I will tell you what, more objective fact, President Trump delivered 
on that promise. In a very short period of time, we became not only 
energy independent again, but energy dominant, just as he said. We 
became a net exporter. All boats were rising. The economy was doing 
well. In fact, we had the best economic numbers in the history of the 
world, not just the history of the United States. Prior to COVID, we 
had the best economy because of the policy choices that were made. We 
advanced those policies through the Congress; President Trump led on 
them, and his administration did a fantastic job. Because of that, our 
energy stability, our energy security, all of that was well in place.
  And then President Biden comes in, and he does instinctively, I 
guess, exactly the opposite. Again, in very short order, he reversed 
all of those great trends. As has been articulated so many times 
tonight, among the first executive orders he issued--I mean immediately 
upon taking office in January 2020--was an executive order that killed 
the Keystone pipeline. There were more than 42,000 jobs related to that 
project just killed overnight; as well as all the energy independence 
and energy dominance that that would have meant for us.
  And then he issues the moratorium on Federal production on Federal 
lands. Well, that killed a State like Louisiana. Not just on the land, 
but right offshore as well. Of course, that is a big part of our 
economy and in the other energy States. It was just devastating.
  At the same time, while he is killing the Keystone pipeline, he is 
ending Federal production on Federal lands, he green lights the Nord 
Stream 2 pipeline. That was Putin's project. So he empowers Russia, he 
fuels the war machine for Putin because, of course, he can supply oil 
all over Western Europe, and that filled his coffers.
  Listen, it was mentioned tonight these stickers that are on the gas 
pumps all over the country, these ``I did that'' stickers that have 
President Biden's picture. It is funny. We don't support vandalism, 
right? But, I mean, I see them all over Louisiana, and it is 
devastating.

                              {time}  1800

  President Biden is pointing to the sticker shock, the cost that it is 
taking everyone to fill their tanks, and it is exactly right. That is 
very telling. A picture is worth 1,000 words. He is responsible. These 
are the results of policy choices.
  And as Mr. Franklin of Florida said a few moments ago, these problems 
are completely self-inflicted. And because of that, let's always 
remember, they can be easily reversed. The President could just do the 
opposite of what he has done since he took office; reverse course and 
fix this dilemma for the American people.
  But you know what? He won't do that. I don't know if it is because he 
is beholden to the radical left environmentalist agenda, the climate 
agenda, or if he has some sort of ulterior motive. I am not sure.
  But I will tell you what: My constituents are asking that question 
openly right now, and millions upon millions of the American people who 
are suffering because of these policies are beginning to ask that as 
well.
  Madam Speaker, I am delighted to yield to the gentlewoman from 
California (Mrs. Steel), who has a few more things to say about this 
issue.
  Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, I am sorry I am just a little late 
because, actually, the Education and Labor Committee, we are doing 
markups right now.
  I rise to address the ongoing energy crisis and the impact it is 
having on families in Orange County. The picture you see here is a 
snapshot of what gas prices looked like for my constituents in the past 
week. But I heard--actually, this is in Orange County.
  Last week, same time--this isn't my district, but in Sacramento that 
we have actually hit over $9 per gallon. These prices have increased 30 
percent in the last year.
  Gas prices in Orange County, and across the country, are rising every 
single day. One reason for these skyrocketing costs is policies enacted 
by this administration that have weakened our energy independence and 
made us dependent on foreign oil.
  With the President taking the necessary step of banning Russian oil, 
it is even more important that we return to our former energy 
independence. We cannot turn from one foreign dictator to another to 
meet our energy needs. We have the resources right here to bring down 
costs and produce the cleanest energy on Earth.

[[Page H3768]]

  I urge all my colleagues to join me in pursuing policies to secure 
our energy independence.
  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, I am so grateful the 
gentlewoman came to participate. We know she is very busy. It has been 
a long day in the Education and Labor Committee. We are grateful she is 
doing that great work.
  Madam Speaker, I know that the time is winding up for our Special 
Order hour. There was a lot going on on Capitol Hill today. I am 
grateful to my Republican colleagues for coming in and participating 
and helping to share this very, very important message with the 
American people.
  There is a lot of spin going on in the country right now, from TikTok 
influencers, to media types who are engaging in the spin for the White 
House at their request, and the American people see through it. They 
are making and being made to make difficult choices for their families.
  Hardworking Americans are suffering right now because of these policy 
choices. There is crisis after crisis after crisis everywhere we look 
because of, frankly put, poor leadership in the White House.
  I believe that we will have a change in all of this come November in 
the next election cycle, and with the presidential election that will 
follow 2 years later. And it can't happen soon enough because the White 
House has shown no intention, no indication that they will reverse 
policies, as they should, as we mentioned a moment ago could be easily 
done to alleviate the pain for all these Americans. But for whatever 
reason, they will not do it.
  Madam Speaker, I will wind down this evening. I want to thank my 
colleagues for being here, participating in this really important 
Special Order hour, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from 
engaging in personalities toward the President.

                         WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of 
January 4, 2021, the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Lois Frankel) is 
recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.


                             General Leave

  Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent 
that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their 
remarks and include extraneous material on the subject of my Special 
Order.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentlewoman from Florida?
  There was no objection.
  Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. Madam Speaker, this month is Women's 
History Month. I think you are making history, Madam Speaker, today, 
one of the youngest women ever to be elected from California and, 
actually, in the country. Women are making history.
  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to be here. Hopefully, we are going to 
have a few more speakers here today, but I do want to start.
  I am going to take a page out of the book of our great First Lady, 
Jill Biden. I attended a ceremony over at the White House where she and 
the President celebrated Women's History Month. And she started out 
with a salute, I think, to--if you could think of anybody who you want 
to give a shout out to, she gave it to her own mother. And I am going 
to start with that too because, you know, most of our mothers, they are 
not very famous, and it is not like they made history.
  But the fact of the matter is, moms are probably the most influential 
people in the world. In fact, if you ever go to an event where someone 
is being honored, who is the first person they thank? It is their 
mother.
  So I am going to start this Women's History Month with my remarks by 
thanking my mother, Dorothy Frankel--and let me just say this--who has 
inspired me in every way, and now, at 96 years old, with--I would say 
with a mind better than mine--maybe that is not saying much, but with 
her full faculties and the energy to live.
  I want to say thank you, mom, like all the other moms who give us the 
unconditional love and the support, whether the sun is shining or the 
rain is raining.
  So today, I think we have some other people here. Before I continue 
my remarks, I want to yield to a very special friend.
  We talk about making history. I am going to yield to one of the most 
dynamic Members of the House of Representatives. She is from Texas. She 
has got her hands full. I mean, I will tell you what: I don't know 
whether it is more difficult today being from Texas or from Florida, I 
think our Governors are in some kind of contest with each other. But I 
am going to yield to the amazing gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson 
Lee).
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, let me thank the gentlewoman from 
Florida for, first of all, all of her leadership in leading the Women's 
Caucus for a very sizable period of time; and to give us the 
opportunity to speak about women today; and to remind us that we really 
started out with a very important woman, and that is, of course, our 
mothers.
  So why don't I, as well, acknowledge, Ivalita Jackson, who served her 
community; but, more importantly, her profession, and she was proud of 
that, in nursing. And at the time, she was a vocational nurse, and she 
wore the uniform with pride.
  She was a mother with pride. She was a wife with pride. She was 
really our rock, and she did things that showed her sacrifice. She 
loved her profession. She loved nursing. She was our at-home doctor, 
probably the doctor for the neighborhood.
  But in order to ensure that she was home during the day, she made 
sure she took the night shift. And the night shift in a hospital is a 
challenging shift.
  We can see all of the great and wonderful things that nursing has 
generated, the heroes of today, the sheroes of today, as we went 
through 2 years of the pandemic. But my mother was a shero many, many 
decades ago.
  And I came to love the uniform, came to love those white sparking 
shoes that she wore so proudly, came to love and honor her sacrifice; 
and how much she gave to her family, her job, her profession, her 
church.
  Ivalita Jackson is one to be honored; along with her mother, my 
grandmother, Vannie Bennett; my other grandmother, Olive Jackson; and 
then my aunt, Valerie Bennett, Vickie and Audrey, all wonderful women, 
and Sybil.
  So today, I come to join my colleagues to be able to talk about women 
and to celebrate, as the President did in Women's History Month, just 
24 hours ago; but then to celebrate again, as I mentioned, now, in law, 
now the law, and that is the Violence Against Women Act, that almost a 
decade, it seems--even though we went back as far as 2013, that would 
have been 8 years--it seems that I have been doing this for a decade.
  But I remember standing next to Vice President Joe Biden on the 
reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which was in 1996. I 
call the image, me in short stature and Joe Biden, tall stature, but 
yet, one of great compassion.
  And I loved hearing him speak today, how culturally out of step men 
were, or the community was, or the Nation was, in trying to understand 
why he would be engaged in fighting against domestic violence. I 
remember him today saying, they asked me whether or not he had come 
from a family of domestic violence, or he had abused his wife or he had 
known someone in his family who had experienced that. And he looked at 
them incredulously and said no.
  It is something to care about. Domestic violence kills. Sexual 
assault can kill. Rape kills, and it destroys lives. From very little 
girls and very little children, boys or girls, to adulthood.
  We loved him for saying that. And out of that passion came the first 
Violence Against Women Act centered around domestic violence. Then it 
grew to focus on the wide breadth of sexual assault in this Nation.
  In speaking to the head of the major chiefs at the White House, she 
reaffirmed the fact, as a chief of police of a major city, that 
domestic violence calls are the most deadly for law enforcement 
officers, and don't end well, in many instances, for our families.

  It is appropriate in this month of women's history, that we also have 
a

[[Page H3769]]

curative response by putting into law, after so many years of trying, 
introducing over and over again this legislation, and finally, H.R. 
1620 became law as the Senate passed that bill with an enhancement of 
what we had included, which was the work dealing with Native Americans, 
the work dealing with providing for housing, the amount of money, $1 
billion, to cover the many new issues dealing with women, dealing with 
cultural organizations, different women from different ethnicities, 
language; we were responding to the needs that they have, religious 
groups. We have cultural training for young men and boys.
  We wanted to make sure that we did not, in any way, undermine what 
the President had dreamed about when he first introduced this 
legislation, I believe, in 1994.
  So I wanted this to be part of Women's History Month because it was a 
long journey. And let me thank all of the advocates who, year after 
year, month after month, day after day, second after second, minute 
after minute, hour after hour, met with all of us to try to work to 
enhance and to be assured of the best kind of legislation that we could 
secure.
  Today was a celebratory day. But I really focus on it for saving 
lives. And I just imagine, somewhere in America today is a woman being 
abused, a woman suffering. And we now have a law that her State and 
Federal Government law enforcement can maybe intervene, and her days of 
being abused will be ended.

                              {time}  1815

  I do want to also acknowledge, as I move toward the historic women, 
the kind of work women do. I want to make sure that we talk about 
daycare owners.
  This is The Gingerbread School, and I thank the owner for taking the 
children of mothers who work day-in and day-out, hourly wages, night 
shifts. I remember my mom, as I said, working night shifts.
  She is there for them. These are the kind of women in Women's History 
Month that deserve honor and respect, and I thank her for it.
  Madam Speaker, then I acknowledge the fact that women are in the 
medical profession. We used to take them for granted. There are a 
rising number of women becoming doctors. We did not take them for 
granted in the horrors of the pandemic of COVID-19 because we were 
desperate for those who were testing when the vaccines came or 
vaccinating. But most importantly, it was those nurses at our bedside, 
for those on ventilators, those in hallways, those who were suffering.
  COVID-19 was devastating and deadly, and it was the nurses and the 
medical professionals, the many women who provided the kind of support 
that maybe got us through.
  I thank those late-night shifts. I thank those tears, those 
collapsing on sidewalks outside of hospitals saying, ``How much more 
can I take?'' They took more, and they kept going on and on and on.
  I pay tribute to the millions of medical professionals who are women. 
I support all of them, but I particularly support those who are women.
  Madam Speaker, today, we had a hearing in the Budget Committee on the 
question of how the pandemic impacted women, and I want to make one 
point about that. It was unanimity. Certainly, it was recognized by one 
of our witnesses that the idea of childcare being only 7 percent of 
your income under the Build Back Better Act would be transformative; 
that childcare keeps women out of the workforce, but most importantly, 
it takes 25 or 50 percent, even, of their income. Remember, they still 
are the lowest paid.
  We realize, in this Women's History Month, there are many things that 
we need to do to improve the lives of women. With that in mind, I now 
cite some of the women who should be honored who have done great 
things.
  First, I do acknowledge the paycheck fairness bill that we did this 
year; the child tax credit, driven by women, joined by great men, but 
driven by women and really saving the lives of families all over 
America.
  Madam Speaker, I acknowledge Vice President Kamala Harris--
historically, the first woman of color to serve in the highest offices 
of the land as Vice President of the United States, a woman of Indian 
descent and African descent.
  It is important to take note of the fact that an estimated 10 million 
people in this country, as I spoke earlier, experienced domestic 
violence, and that is why, again, we celebrate this month with the 
passing of that bill.
  But I just want to give a roll call of the many pioneering women who 
should be recognized today:
  Shirley Chisholm; Barbara Jordan; and as well those early pioneers, 
Harriet Tubman, who led the Underground Railroad and slaves to freedom; 
Sojourner Truth, an abolitionist as well a suffragette who said the 
words, ``Ain't I a Woman''; Rosa Parks, who refused to get up so that 
she could sit so that others might walk and others might run toward 
justice.
  Astronaut Mae C. Jemison, my dear friend, a Houston resident, the 
first African-American woman to go into space.
  Mathematicians like Katherine G. Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary 
Jackson, those mathematicians who helped NASA in the early days by 
pencil and hand, calculating major calculations needed for space 
exploration.
  Authors Maya Angelou, Toni Morrison, and Gwendolyn Brooks, all 
enormous authors with enormous missions and all fighters for justice.
  All of these persons, in their own way, provided a pathway for women.
  I am very pleased to have brought the first African-American statue 
into the United States Congress--designed and sculpted by a woman, and 
as well raised the dollars to bring her here. She now sits in 
Emancipation Hall, and her next journey is going to be in the rotunda 
or Statuary Hall, where she belongs with the other suffragettes.
  We know that Shirley Chisholm was the first Black woman to ever serve 
in the United States House of Representatives and the first woman to 
ever run for President of the United States.
  Madam Speaker, I want to take note of my hometown heroes, such as 
Nellye Joyce Punch, Ramona Toliver, Beulah Shepard, Christia Adair. 
These are women who have since gone on, but they were pioneers in their 
time, fighting for what was right.
  I remember Beulah Shepard saying, ``It just takes one vote.''
  Nellye Joyce Punch led on hunger and trying to stamp out hunger, as 
she was a great teacher.
  Ramona Toliver was an activist in Frenchtown in the Fifth Ward and 
always fought to ensure that the people of that community were 
responded to and not ignored.
  Madam Speaker, I think it is important to realize that as we honor 
women, we must recognize they find themselves in many different 
careers. Coming from Houston, I want to acknowledge Sally Christian 
Ride, the first woman sent into space; Eileen Marie Collin, the first 
space shuttle pilot; and, of course, numbers of other unsung heroes in 
the space program.
  I mentioned Vice President Kamala D. Harris, and I want to emphasize, 
as I close my remarks, that we have yet another journey to take. That 
is the final confirmation after hearings of the next person to ascend 
to the Supreme Court, and that is a Justice Brown Jackson, who by all 
accounts is an outstanding--without question--legal scholar and jurist. 
I hope for her, in this time of newness and difference, that she will 
be greeted by those who will look to her credentials, her firstness, 
and, of course, the constant excellence that she has shown.

  Women have always been challenged as to whether or not they could do 
the job. I leave you with the names of Golda Meir of Israel, Indira 
Gandhi of India, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia, Margaret Thatcher of 
Great Britain, Angela Merkel of Germany, and Portia Simpson-Miller of 
Jamaica, among many others.
  I know that there are millions of women who we have left out, but 
today, we come to celebrate under the leadership of Lois Frankel, as 
well as the Democratic Women's Caucus, to be able to once and for all 
put a mark in this Congressional Record to say that we paused to say 
thank you to women, that we paused to say thank you to the new and many 
Members of the United States House of Representatives who have grown 
and grown, Members who happen to be women.
  The few women who were here when I came in 1995, we have 
exponentially

[[Page H3770]]

grown in excellence, and we have brought a new face, a new perspective. 
I remember those days, sitting lonely on the Committee on the Judiciary 
with Pat Schroeder as, day after day, our friends on the other side of 
the aisle brought up partial-birth abortion. Over and over again, Pat 
and I tried to explain that these are decisions that are health 
decisions that should be left to the mother, her faith leader, and her 
doctor.
  It is sad that the State of Texas has failed to remember such and 
continues to abuse women in that State as it relates to choice and the 
ability to seek a lawful abortion as they may desire with their church, 
their doctor, and themselves.
  Madam Speaker, the last point that I want to make, that mothers have 
to deal with, are the horrible actions of Governor Abbott dealing with 
transgender children. I want to say on this floor today that this is 
part of women's history because it was the parents but the mothers 
leading to protect their children from the abuse of this governmental 
agency, suggesting that you could not have trans medical care, trans-
affirming medical care; that you, as a mother, could not protect your 
child.
  Thank you to the mothers who have stood up. Thank you to the court 
that indicated that you, Governor Abbott, are wrong yesterday, wrong 
today, and wrong tomorrow.
  These are our precious children. These are precious lives. These are 
precious families. These are precious mothers.
  My tribute to women today includes my tribute to the fighters that 
have always stood up for what is right, what is conscience, and what is 
just, either in fighting for democracy; fighting against the terror of 
January 6; fighting for women's rights in the Violence Against Women 
Act; fighting against abuse; fighting to stamp out hunger; fighting to 
stamp out anger; and fighting in Ukraine to be able to stand against a 
despot called Putin, who is violent and is a war criminal killing 
children.
  The mothers in my State who are standing for their trans children, I 
offer them my greatest respect and dignity as we salute Women's History 
Month.
  Ms. FRANKEL. Madam Speaker, this Representative is going to go down 
in history as one of the most articulate fighters for justice we have 
ever seen. I give her a special congratulations for all the work she 
did on the Violence Against Women Act that was celebrated today.
  Madam Speaker, I recognize another historic woman who is very 
prolific. I will highlight just a couple of things.
  She brought to this venue the #MeToo movement. She has been the 
champion in changing military law to protect people from sexual 
violence. And she is my co-chair of the Women's Caucus. And I could go 
on and on.
  Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from the State of 
California (Ms. Speier).
  Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida and 
my friend and co-lead on the Democratic Women's Caucus. I must say, she 
is always the shining light when it comes to finding purpose and the 
opportunity for women to succeed. She has proven herself over and over 
again as we have seen our numbers of women grow here in the Congress of 
the United States.
  To my good friend Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, today was a great 
day of celebration as VAWA was reauthorized. I know you concurred with 
me when President Biden said, Why don't we make this permanent? That is 
precisely what we should be doing. But somehow, it is a law that has to 
be reauthorized every 5 years. It used to be almost something that we 
did in a bipartisan fashion, and reauthorization was almost automatic. 
But recently, that wasn't the case.
  So to Congresswoman Jackson Lee, thank you for the very complete and 
comprehensive review of women in America that you just provided us.
  As we celebrate national Women's History Month, we were all asked to 
talk about someone that we wanted to pay special attention to. I 
decided that I was going to speak about a particular group of women who 
represent what the essence of womanhood is, which is that they are 
tenacious, that they are courageous, that they are gritty, and that 
they will go wherever they need to go to achieve their goal.
  There was what was called the Night of Terror in November 1917. 
During that whole period of time, women would march every day here in 
Washington, D.C., thousands of them. For the first time, they went and 
picketed outside the White House. It had never been done before. They 
chained themselves to the cyclone fence at the White House.
  On this night in November 1917, there were 35 of these women who were 
arrested. They were beaten, and they were spat upon. They had rotten 
eggs thrown in their faces. The food they were given in jail was so bad 
that many of them went on a hunger strike, and then they had tubes put 
in their noses to force-feed them. One woman was struck between the 
eyes and lost one of her eyes.
  What were they doing this for? So women could get the right to vote 
in the United States.

                              {time}  1830

  Because up until that time women were, for all intents and purposes, 
chattel. There were people like George Bernard Shaw who said: If women 
got the right to vote there would be a crushing tax on bachelors in 
America. Another one from the Seneca Falls Review that said: If women 
got the right to vote they would become thin-lipped, fat-handed, and 
flat-chested. Oh, my God.
  Those were the kinds of thoughts that somehow women did not have the 
mental capacity to vote because in their skull they only had puppies 
and chocolate and babies that were in their brains; that somehow that 
was the kind of political cartoon that was represented.
  Certainly, women who were menopausal couldn't vote because they were 
near extinction. Women who were pregnant or having children couldn't 
vote because they were lactating. You name it, they came up with it. 
Having said all that, there were true sheroes of that generation.
  Madam Speaker, I want to speak tonight about a different group of 
women who are fighting for the lives of their countrymen and -women, 
and that is the strength of the Ukrainian women.
  Here is a Ukrainian woman. Here is someone bloodied by Putin's weapon 
systems: she is still standing; she is still alive. We can't say that 
about all the women in Ukraine. The world looked on in absolute horror 
as images of injured and murdered Ukrainian women and children have 
spread around the globe.
  When the hospital in Mariupol was bombed, we saw pregnant women 
holding their bellies, climbing down stairs. Then we saw a stretcher of 
a women on a towel--it looked like it was a colorful towel that she 
brought with her to the hospital. The photo of this pregnant woman who 
was rushed out of the maternity hospital in Mariupol last week made my 
blood run cold. The news yesterday that she and her baby had died 
outraged me.
  She was taken to another hospital in Mariupol and when she realized 
she was losing her baby, medics said that she cried out: Kill me now. 
Her pelvis was crushed. Her hip detached. The baby was delivered by C-
section, but showed no signs of life. She died shortly thereafter.
  That is an imprint on my mind that will never leave me and should 
never leave any of us because what is happening to women in Ukraine is 
sinful, it is immoral. It is in fact a crime against humanity.
  Putin's forces also killed Tetiana, her son Mykyta, 18, and her 
daughter Alisa, 9, as they tried to flee Kyiv with a church volunteer. 
She worked for a Silicon Valley software company and was married to her 
husband of 23 years. He said, ``I have lost everyone and lost the 
meaning of life.''
  Women in Russia are suffering, too, and they are showing lots of 
guts. They are speaking out against Putin. Here you see a woman, her 
name is Marina Ovsyannikova. She ran on to the live TV set on a Russian 
TV station, the most-watched news program in all of Russia, to protest 
the war. Her sign, which is written both in English and in Russian, 
reads: No war. Stop the war. Don't believe the propaganda, they are 
lying to you.
  After she was taken into custody, she was questioned for 14 hours. 
She wasn't

[[Page H3771]]

allowed to sleep, to access her family, her lawyers, and she refused to 
recant her message. Somewhere in Russia right now is Marina, another 
courageous woman who is speaking truth to power. Russian mothers are 
angrily demanding Putin to be held accountable for using their sons, as 
many as 6,000 of whom have already been killed in Ukraine, using them 
as cannon fodder for his egotistical legacy project.
  I am also in awe of the brave Ukrainian women literally leading the 
fight to protect their country. Nearly 22 percent of Ukraine's armed 
forces are female--22 percent. Here you see them in their camouflage. 
The 22 percent is one of the highest percentages of females serving in 
the military in the world. In the United States it is only something 
like 18 percent. And more women are joining the fight every day.
  Even women members of Ukraine's parliament have taken up arms to 
defend their homeland. I think about that and I think how many of us 
women parliamentarians in Congress would do the same? It is a good 
opportunity for us to do some soul-searching.
  We must have the backs of all Ukrainian women. I am proud that the 
United States has imposed unprecedented sanctions and export controls 
on the Russian economy. Just last week we stood on this floor and 
passed the bipartisan $13 billion aid package for Ukraine to assist the 
military and provide for the humanitarian needs.
  Today, the President announced another package of weapons that are 
going to be sent to Ukraine, including Javelins and switchblades and 
body armor and helmets and drones, all in an effort to try and provide 
more protection for the people of Ukraine.
  We must hold Putin accountable for the immeasurable death and 
suffering he has wrought. In doing so, I hope we can show a fraction of 
the grit and perseverance of the Ukrainian people, and especially the 
women of Ukraine.
  Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Speier. 
I will tell you what, it is really hard to follow those remarks. I 
think all of us--all Americans--really all people around the world who 
have been following the brutality of Putin's war, our hearts are 
breaking. I thank the gentlewoman for highlighting the special plight 
of the women.
  As I said, it is almost hard to talk about anything after that, but I 
do want to say this. For about 200 years women have been fighting for 
rights, for rights that White men and then eventually Black men had, 
but we are still fighting for them.
  I was just thinking back to my own childhood--and probably your 
childhood, too. They had limits on how many girls could get into law 
school or medical school; there were no sport scholarships available. 
If you were a married woman, you could only get credit in your 
husband's name. Abortion was illegal. Equal pay was not even a concept. 
We did finally get the right to vote after women were arrested and 
chained themselves to the White House.

  So if you look back in history, we have been fighting very hard to 
get our rights. I want to thank Representative Jackson Lee, she has 
highlighted some of the victories over the years and some of the women 
who led the way, whether it was with Title IX or Roe v. Wade, or the 
bill that was just celebrated today by the President, the Equal Pay 
Act, the Paycheck Fairness Act. A lot has been done, but, wait, they 
are all in jeopardy.
  It is just shocking that after all these years of fighting, every one 
of these rights are in jeopardy, including the right to vote, which is 
why--and I know my colleagues here would agree--we must have an equal 
rights amendment. We must have inscribed in the U.S. Constitution 
equality for men and women that cannot be changed at the whim of a 
political body.
  Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson 
Lee).
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, allow me to again express my 
appreciation to the growth and bounty of the Women's Democratic Caucus. 
It is amazing, the coming together of now generational women, freshmen 
classes, sophomore classes, and some of us who have had the privilege 
of serving for a period of time. What an amazing power base that you 
and we have created.
  Madam Speaker, I thank Lois Frankel for her leadership. I thank 
Brenda Lawrence and Jackie Speier for the way they have guarded and 
guided this privilege with this power. I do think it is important to 
put in the Record her singular work. She will not say singular work, 
but we were all glad to join her.
  Obviously, this particular young soldier came out of the breadth and 
depth of Houston and out of Texas--but to be able to honor the life of 
a young woman that simply wanted all her life to join the United States 
Army. Jackie Speier had been working on the issue of sexual assault in 
the military, along with our good friend, Senator Gillibrand, and the 
lack of justice that we were seeing all the time. This had been going 
on for a very long time.
  It is important in this Women's History Month to say that we together 
made history with your legislation that responded to the heinous crime 
of the killing of Officer Guillen, a precious young women, who, growing 
up as a little girl wanted to be in the United States military.
  I think this is the point that should be made. Only in this recent 
time can young girls want to grow up to be generals, astronauts, 
presidents, scientists, and others. As Ms. Frankel and Ms. Speier 
indicated, the abuse that was laid upon women for even thinking about 
equality or justice or voting. And then, of course, I must say that 
African American women found themselves at the lowest wrung of the 
ladder and suffered the continuing lingering history of slavery, the 
rape that was put upon them, the tending to whatever child was born, 
and then, of course, tending to the fields.
  Here we are today with a little bright light--and I am going to say 
little bright light because Ms. Frankel laid out all the things we need 
to do: the ERA, and we hope to get this new Justice.
  I wanted to take a moment just to respond and build upon this vile 
war criminal who seems to have Ukraine--God bless the soldiers, the 
men, the men that stayed behind to fight, but the toll has been so 
brutal on the women of Ukraine.
  Even in the last 24 hours, women are leaving safe places in Poland 
and Romania and they are coming back to Ukraine demanding that they 
fight, that they stand with the people of Ukraine for the democracy 
that they love. The death toll is brutal. The way they are dying is 
brutal. To be running with your child thinking you are protecting them. 
And to have the greatest moment of your life, the birth of a new baby, 
and you die and the baby dies, and your whole innards are crushed.
  Besides the women that are left behind in pools of blood--then the 
women who are escaping with their children who have nothing. This has 
been found around the world in Sudan when we were fighting against 
genocide. The victims were women who were trying to hold on to families 
in Rwanda. Places in South and Central America; the missing Mexican 
women that we have been working on for years.

                              {time}  1845

  My previous Member from California had led us in this fight, and we 
are still fighting. In the United States missing girls and human 
trafficking is a scourge today, and the dominant population of human 
trafficking are girls and girls who were tending to their daily duties 
of going to high school and, all of a sudden, they walked away, and 
they are in human trafficking, or they are being trafficked.
  So we have a lot to fight. We have a lot to put on the Record today 
and this month. We have got a lot of grandmothers to thank, a lot of 
moms to thank, and a lot of firsts to thank. We have got a lot of poets 
who have described our lives and a lot of writers who have described 
our lives. We have got a lot of children who simply say thank you.
  I guess I don't want to leave the podium.
  I must thank the teachers because if ever people were elevated to 
know how much you appreciate women, this 2-year, 3-year period of the 
pandemic really laid it out. You were either sacrificing as a mother 
because you were wearing 25 hats, Madam Speaker, and a lot of them 
dealing with homeschooling and trying to make do. You were a nurse; you 
were a teacher. You were simply in the fight.

[[Page H3772]]

  Madam Speaker, you were a doctor, you were a hospital administrator, 
you were an EMS, you were a fire person, a police person, and you were 
in here dealing with just the pit of COVID-19 and what it was doing to 
our families. You could have been in the funeral home business as a 
woman, and you were dealing with these circumstances.
  So let me just give a big thank you in this month, and I hope that if 
I have not called your name, I am giving a big, overall thank you to 
all of you women. We recognize all of our gentlemen. But today, all of 
you have stood in the gap during a time in America's history that no 
one ever expected.
  So I say thank you to Congresswoman Frankel, to Congresswoman Speier, 
and to all the women. We count them as being on the floor today to be 
able to honor Women's History Month and then, of course, International 
Women's History Month to be able to say thank you to all of them.
  I must say thank you to the Pakistani women. I was at the Pakistani 
Embassy last night. I don't want to leave the floor without saying I 
met a lot of Pakistani Americans who were there celebrating Women's 
History Month and to honor Pakistani-American women.
  First, I would like to thank the Democratic Women's Caucus for 
hosting this Special Order to celebrate Women's History Month.
  During Women's History Month, we celebrate the generations of 
trailblazing women who, in the face of daily hardship and systemic 
discrimination, have paved a path toward gender justice.
  It also serves as a global call to action, calling on us to advance 
the rights and dignities of women at home, at work and in all aspects 
of life.
  Women have always led the effort to create a more fair, more 
resilient, more prosperous, and more equal America.
  It brings me great pride that in 2022, women are not only working 
tirelessly to meet the needs of this unique moment, women are taking 
the lead.
  With Vice President Kamala Harris making history for our nation, with 
more women than ever before serving in Congress and taking on 
leadership roles in the President's cabinet, with the first Black woman 
nominated to the Supreme Court, with women leading some of America's 
largest and most innovative businesses, and with women continuing to 
break ground as scientists and researchers, America is stronger because 
of women.
  I am proud that House Democrats are leading efforts to expand on 
opportunities for women and to combat gender discrimination.
  In addition to our work to close the gender wage gap by passing the 
Paycheck Fairness Act, a major part of that effort includes addressing 
the challenges posed to American women by the COVID-19 pandemic.
  It is important to recognize that the burden of caring for children, 
the elderly, and the sick still falls to women unevenly in our society, 
and the pandemic forced many women to sacrifice their careers to care 
for loved ones.
  Last year, Democrats and President Biden enacted the American Rescue 
Plan, which extended the expanded Child Tax Credit to help families 
make ends meet and help women stay in the workforce and return to their 
jobs.
  It is now year 3 of the Coronavirus pandemic, which means that women 
have been leading the COVID-19 response, combatting the virus in 
America and around the world.
  During Women's History Month, we honor the female frontline health 
care workers.
  From health care to home care, restaurants to grocery stores, women 
workers, low-paid workers, and women of color are on the front lines of 
the COVID-19 pandemic.
  According to a U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics survey, nearly 80% of 
healthcare workers and 83% of workers who provide social assistance, 
including child care and emergency services, are women.
  Additionally, women-dominated occupations, such as nurses, flight 
attendants, and personal care aides, are among the most vulnerable to 
getting sick and spreading it to others.
  Women are also in the position to suffer the most in an economic 
recession.
  Women are the most economically vulnerable, comprising nearly 60% of 
workers in low-wage occupations.
  Low-paid women workers have very little in the way of savings, which 
means it is much harder for them to weather economic shocks, especially 
when they are likely to be supporting a number of dependents.
  Just this week, my bill, VAWA, was reauthorized as part of the 
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, which President Joe Biden signed 
into law.
  We must continue to do more to ensure that law enforcement has all 
the tools it needs to protect Americans from domestic violence, 
stalking, and sexual assault and that survivors have the resources to 
heal.
  VAWA is life-saving legislation.
  This legislation was enacted in response to the prevalence of 
domestic and sexual violence, and the significant impact of such 
violence on the lives of women.
  Statistics have revealed that these forms of violence impact us all.
  In the United States, an estimated 10 million people experience 
domestic violence every year, and more than 15 million children are 
exposed to this violence annually.
  According to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, about 
20 people per minute are physically abused by an intimate partner.
  About 1 in 4 women and 1 in 9 men experience severe intimate partner 
physical violence, sexual violence, and/or partner stalking with 
injury.
  Today, in Texas, 35.10 percent of women and 34.5 percent of men are 
subjected to domestic violence.
  As we celebrate Women's History Month, let us reflect on the women 
who shaped our history and on those today who are leading our nation 
forward.
  We must work toward a future with equal access to economic 
opportunities, health care, and safety for all Americans.
  It brings me great pride to say that more than 120 women House 
Members proudly follow in her footsteps--including a record number of 
committee and subcommittee chairs, myself included.
  Driven by these women's devoted service and guided by their 
leadership, the Democratic House continues to lead the way in building 
a more just future--whether strengthening the rights of women in the 
workplace through the Paycheck Fairness Act and Pregnant Workers 
Fairness Act, defending reproductive health freedoms with the Women's 
Health Protection Act or advancing the Build Back Better Act's historic 
investments in maternal care, paid family and medical leave, childcare 
and more.
  Last month we celebrated the contributions of African Americans to 
the history of our great nation, and paid tribute to trailblazers, 
pioneers, heroes, and leaders like U.S. Congresswoman Barbara Jordan; 
U.S. Congressman Mickey Leland; Mae C. Jemison; activists, 
intellectuals, authors, and artists like Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks, 
Maya Angelou, Toni Morrison, and Gwendolyn Brooks, to name just a few 
of the countless number of well-known and unsung heroes whose 
contributions have helped our nation become a more perfect union.
  The history of the United States has been marked by the great 
contributions of African American activists, leaders, writers, and 
artists.
  As a Member of Congress, I know that I stand on the shoulders of 
giants whose struggles and triumphs made it possible for me to stand 
here today and continue the fight for equality, justice, and progress 
for all, regardless of race, religion, gender or sexual orientation.
  Women's History Month is also a time to remember many pioneering 
women like U.S. Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm; activists Harriet 
Tubman and Rosa Parks; astronaut Mae C. Jemison; mathematicians like 
Katherine G. Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson; authors Maya 
Angelou, Toni Morrison, and Gwendolyn Brooks; all of whom have each in 
their own way, whether through courageous activism, cultural or 
intellectual contributions, or artistic creativity, forged social and 
political change, and forever changed our great Nation for the better.
  Shirley Chisholm became the first African American woman elected to 
Congress, when she was elected to represent the New York's Twelfth 
Congressional District in 1968 running on the slogan, ``Fighting 
Shirley Chisholm: Unbought and Unbossed.''
  She reflected that spirit well during her 14 years in Congress.
  Before Shirley Chisolm, no black woman had ever served in the U.S. 
House of Representatives or the U.S. Senate but following in her 
footsteps are 51 black women Members of Congress, two black women U.S. 
Senators, including the president of that body and Vice-President of 
the United States; 23 Hispanic members; and 15 Asian-Pacific members, 
along with the first woman Speaker of the House, and mayors of several 
of the largest cities in the nation, including the District of 
Columbia, Chicago, San Francisco, Atlanta, New Orleans, Baltimore, 
Hartford, Minneapolis, San Antonio, and St. Louis.
  Shirley Chisolm had an understanding that during those turbulent 
times the nation required a determined leader to represent the voice of 
so many Americans who felt dismay at their treatment.
  She took an extremely active role in changing the way women were to 
be judged from that point on.
  She remarked that, ``Women in this country must become 
revolutionaries. We must refuse to accept the old, the traditional 
roles and stereotypes.''

[[Page H3773]]

  This is a sentiment that I myself take to heart, women in this nation 
are now told they have a right to determine the kind of life they want 
to lead; Shirley Chisholm was at the core of this movement.
  This past August 26, 2021, we commemorated the 101st anniversary of 
the ratification of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution which 
granted women the right to vote.
  This momentous achievement did not come easy or without struggle, for 
as the great abolitionist and orator, Fredrick Douglas stated: ``If 
there is no struggle, there is no progress . . . . Power concedes 
nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will.''
  The fight for women's suffrage was waged over a 72-year period, 
beginning in Seneca Falls, New York at the Seneca Falls Convention in 
1848, and exemplifies the prophetic and timeless saying of Margaret 
Mead that one should:
  ``Never doubt the ability of handful of committed persons to change 
the world. It is the only thing that ever has.''
  The Seneca Falls Conference was organized by Lucretia Mott, with 
others including Mary McClintock and Sojourner Truth, who went on to 
establish herself not only as a great advocate for women's suffrage but 
also as a great abolitionist.
  Among the courageous suffragists who spearheaded the movement were 
Alice Paul, who fearlessly executed the National Women's Party 
picketing protests, and conceived the hunger-strike in prison; Carrie 
Chapman Catt, who devised the ``winning plan'' at the Atlantic City 
Convention; and Ida B. Wells-Barnett, whose political activism and 
criticism of the suffrage leadership for excluding black women led to a 
more inclusive and effective movement.
  In 1916, four years before the ratification of the 19th Amendment, 
Jeannette Rankin was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from 
Montana, the first woman elected to federal office in American history.
  A little over a century later, a record number of women serve in the 
House of Representatives, comprising 23.4% of the chamber's voting 
members, and presided over by Nancy Pelosi, the first and only woman 
elected Speaker of the House.
  In the 117th Congress, about 37% of women are women of color, and 
since 1964, more than 70 women of color have been elected to Congress.
  Although there remains much work to do to ensure that women enjoy 
full blessings of liberty and equality, that should not detract from 
the achievements and contributions to the greatness of our country made 
by American women, including Sally Kristen Ride, the first woman sent 
into space; Eileen Marie Collins, the first woman space shuttle pilot; 
Grace Murray Hopper, an American computer scientist and United States 
Navy rear admiral; and Katherine Johnson, one of the unsung heroes of 
the NASA Space Program, whose mathematical calculations helped the 
United States win the Space Race.
  Nor should we forget that the current Vice-President of the United 
States is Kamala D. Harris, Vice President Harris is the first woman, 
the first Black American, and the first South Asian American to be 
elected as Vice President.
  Similarly, we should remember that just five short years ago, Hillary 
Clinton shattered one glass ceiling when she became the first woman 
nominated as the presidential candidate of a major political party and 
came within 80,000 votes of winning the presidency and thus shattering 
the ultimate glass ceiling.
  American women will break this ceiling in the not distant future, 
drawing inspiration from trailblazers in other nations such as Golda 
Meir of Israel, Indira Ghandi of India, Ellen Sirleaf of Liberia, 
Margaret Thatcher of Great Britain, Angela Merkel of Germany, and 
Portia Simpson-Miller of Jamaica, among many others.
  In my home city of Houston, there are numerous men and women who are 
great because they have heeded the counsel of Dr. King who said:
  ``Everybody can be great because anybody can serve. You only need a 
heart full of grace. A soul generated by love.''
  One barrier left to fall, however, is one of the most important, and 
that is membership on the Supreme Court of the United States.
  For most of our national history, presidents and senators have turned 
a deaf ear to Abigail Adams' plea to her husband ``to remember the 
ladies and be more generous and favorable to them than your 
ancestors.''
  Since Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's 1981 appointment, only a small 
handful of women have been nominated to the High Court during this 
time, despite the fact that women constitute a majority of the general 
population, 37% of all attorneys in America, a number that will soon 
exceed the majority since a substantial majority (54%) of all law 
students in America are women.
  With Associate Justice Stephen Breyer's retirement announcement, 
President Biden and the U.S. Senate, now have been presented and should 
move quickly to capitalize on this opportunity to begin to rectify the 
High Court's gender and racial imbalance and to diversify its 
composition by confirming a member of the most underrepresented, 
disadvantaged, marginalized, longest suffering, and most patient 
demographic in America: black women.
  Longer than any other racial or ethnic group, black women have been 
subjected to the coercive powers of the law while being excluded from 
the opportunities to make the laws citizens are to live under.
  President Biden has made a nomination for the ages in selecting U.S. 
Circuit Court Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to serve as U.S. Supreme 
Court Associate Justice.
  Not only does Judge Jackson possess one of the finest legal minds of 
her generation, her commitment to equal justice, the rule of law, and 
Constitution is unsurpassed.
  Judge Jackson will be a great Justice and a role model to women and 
girls everywhere, especially little black girls, that in America all 
things are possible with hard work and determination.
  With this nomination, we are taking a massive step towards having a 
government whose institutions, including and especially the Supreme 
Court, are comprised of persons that look like the American people.
  I applaud President Biden for making this historic nomination and 
urge the Senate to conduct a fair, impartial, and expeditious 
confirmation proceeding and confirm Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson--who 
has already been confirmed on a bipartisan basis three times.
  As we celebrated Black History Month and now Women's History Month, 
let us pay tribute to those who have come before us, and pay forward to 
future generations by addressing what is the number one issue for 
African American families, and all American families today: preserving 
the American promise of equal opportunity for all.
  And it is crucial that as we reflect on how far women have come, we 
also not lose sight of how far we have to go and what must be done to 
achieve true gender and racial equality so every girl everywhere can 
pursue her dreams and realize her potential.
  As we progress through Women's History Month, let us summon the 
extraordinary courage and resilience of the many women who came before 
us.
  Democrats will never relent as we carry on the fight for full 
equality--not only for our nation's daughters, but for women and girls 
all over the world.
  As the legendary Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm said, ``If they don't 
give you a seat at the table, bring a folding chair.''
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees 
on the Judiciary, on Homeland Security, and on the Budget, and the 
Congressional Women's Caucus, I am pleased to join this Women's Caucus 
Special Order with my colleagues, to discuss the bravery of Ukrainian 
women and girls in the face of Russia's war against Ukraine.
  I thank the Co-Chairs of the CWC, Representatives Dean and Gonzalez-
Colon, for their leadership of the Bipartisan Congressional Women's 
Caucus.
  Firstly, I would like to commend all Ukrainians for their outstanding 
bravery. It is truly inspirational for Americans, and for people around 
the world. America stands with you.
  Russia's launch of a premeditated war against Ukraine is an attack on 
democracy and a grave violation of international law, global peace, and 
security.
  The fighting has sparked massive displacement and has forced over two 
million Ukrainians to flee their homes to neighboring states and has 
put women and girls at heightened risk of violence.
  Although many people have fled, millions have stayed behind to help 
fight the Russian invaders and defend Ukrainian sovereignty.
  Thousands of Ukrainian women have taken up arms and are playing a 
vital role in Ukraine's national defense. Today they make up 22.8% of 
the Ukrainian army, not including the thousands who have volunteered as 
civilian soldiers.
  Life in the military is not easy for women. While women have been 
serving in the Ukrainian military since the annexation of Crimea in 
2014, they did not win the right to officially fight alongside their 
male counterparts until 2017.
  When Russian-backed forces seized part of the Donbas region and 
conflict ensued in 2014, thousands of women volunteered to help the 
Ukrainian military. They served as assault troops, medics, and snipers.
  But the sacrifices made by these women went largely unrecognized. 
Official documents issued by the Ukrainian military, listed these 
soldiers as seamstresses, cooks, and janitors.
  The women who volunteered ``often found themselves outside legal 
protection,'' according to the Invisible Battalion, an advocacy group 
for Ukrainian servicewomen, that studied women's roles in the war 
against Russia.

[[Page H3774]]

  Although these women have not always been adequately supported by 
their government because of soviet era laws forbidding them from 
enlisting, they have persisted.
  In 2017 a group of women veterans got together and lobbied for their 
rights, which brought about a much-needed change in the culture in the 
Ukrainian military.
  Just last year the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense determined that 
female soldiers marching in a military parade celebrating independence 
from the Soviet Union would wear high heels, not boots.
  Regardless of the numerous hurdles and mockeries Ukrainian women have 
faced and continue to face today, there are thousands who are putting 
their lives at risk to protect and defend their homeland.
  Among them have been a 79-year-old woman who recently learned how to 
fire a gun, a former beauty queen Anastasia Lenna, who represented 
Ukraine at the 2015 Miss Grand International pageant--and Kristina, a 
former wedding singer.
  Kristina was living in Italy last summer when tensions between 
Ukraine and Russia rose. While knowing the security risks, Kristina 
returned to her country to become a soldier.
  She told a VICE news reporter that ``The risk of saying goodbye to 
life is always there, [and she is] not afraid of death; [she] is afraid 
to [become a slave].'' Words that will forever stick with me.
  Women's History Month is a celebration of women's contributions to 
history, culture and society, and there is no better example of this 
than those women fighting in Ukraine today.
  So, on this day, March 9, 2022, I would like to publicly commend the 
women fighting in Ukraine for their boundless courage and bravery. The 
world stands with you and will continue to fight alongside you to put 
an end to Putin's cruel parade.
  Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. Madam Speaker, I would just say that it 
is a joy to be on the floor with Representative Jackson Lee. I thank 
the gentlewoman very, very much. She makes my job very easy.
  Madam Speaker, I yield again to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
Speier).
  Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I thank the leader of our caucus, Ms. 
Frankel.
  Madam Speaker, I am just going to close with some expectations. I am 
leaving Congress this year, and I want to convey to you, Madam Speaker, 
to the leadership of the Democratic Women's Caucus, and to all of my 
colleagues how important I think that you are as guardians of 
womanhood. Our job is never done.
  So while we may celebrate these small victories from time to time, 
the ERA is not part of our Constitution. Of the 193 countries in the 
world, 165 have the ERA in their Constitutions. The United States does 
not. It is 24 little words. Thirty-eight States have passed it. We have 
this deadline that we have struck from the legislation in the House. 
The Senate has not taken it up.
  Femicide is a huge problem in Latin America. The Democratic Women's 
Caucus will have a presentation this Friday on that. The 5,000 missing 
Native-American women in this country that really we had no cognizance 
of until we had a Native-American woman in the Congress to talk about 
it.
  Finally, a new issue--probably not a new issue--is one that has just 
percolated to the surface, and that is female inmates in Federal 
prisons who are raped by the wardens, the chaplains, and the guards. 
Congresswoman Bass, Congressman Swalwell, and I went to the Federal 
correctional institution in Dublin this week.
  Now, at that one prison, the warden had raped inmates, the chaplain 
had raped inmates, and two of the guards that we know of had raped 
inmates.
  It is profound that we change the culture in these prisons to prevent 
that from happening and from the training of guards and leadership at 
those facilities to treat these women with a certain amount of dignity 
that you would just provide to another human being.
  What we heard about the kinds of things that are said about them--
they are called hos and called just horrible things that make us 
realize that we still have a lot of work to do.
  So as I conclude, let me just say, Madam Speaker, that we are the 
guardians of womanhood for the future, and I will look on with fondness 
and great appreciation.
  Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. I thank the gentlewoman for her 
leadership. She will be missed. I know she will go on to bigger and 
better things. She has made her mark in the history of this country for 
sure.
  I want to thank my colleagues, Sheila Jackson Lee and Jackie Speier, 
for coming to the floor. They gave us a great education tonight, and I 
appreciate that.
  I will conclude, Madam Speaker, the way I started, which is I thank 
all those millions and millions of unknown women who lift us up every 
day, who dry our tears, and who share our happiness with that 
unconditional love, and those are our mothers who are probably, as I 
said, the most influential part of the history of the world.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

                          ____________________

                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED

  Cheryl L. Johnson, Clerk of the House, reported and found truly

                                Ukraine

  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, moments ago, speaking through a video 
feed from Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed 
Members of both the House and the Senate as the war in Ukraine enters 
its 21st awful day.
  It is one of the highest honors of any Congress to welcome remarks by 
a foreign head of state, but it is unheard of to hear from a leader 
fighting for his life, fighting for his country's future, and fighting 
to preserve the very idea of democracy.
  I cannot remember the last time a foreign leader united a room full 
of Members from both sides so quickly and so intensely. He spoke not 
just to American ears but to America's very soul. In one sense, his 
speech was reminiscent of the stirring feeling all of us had in the 
aftermath of 9/11: equal parts resolve and unity and determination to 
save democracy from an hour of darkness.
  As we have said from the start of the war, the Senate, the Congress, 
and the American people stand unequivocally behind the people of 
Ukraine. America will continue to strengthen our NATO allies and 
reassure our friends in Europe that we will remain a steady ally. It is 
why, last week, Congress approved nearly $14 billion for food, shelter, 
money for Javelins and Stingers and anti-aircraft weapons and refugee 
help. Every last penny that the United States sends to Ukraine is money 
well spent.
  This morning, it is reported that President Biden will also announce 
another $800 million in military assistance. This means even more anti-
tank, anti-aircraft missiles and other weapons that have been the most 
effective on the battlefield for the Ukrainians.
  Last night, the Senate also unanimously passed legislation supporting 
investigations by the International Criminal Court into potential war 
crimes by Putin and his regime. I thank Senator Graham and the many, 
many others who backed this bill. The Senate also confirmed the 
Ambassador-at-Large for Global Criminal Justice, our lead advocate in 
making sure this investigation is robust and it is swift.
  These steps are all necessary. Over the last 2 weeks, we have seen 
Putin attack the largest nuclear plant in Europe, attack the Chernobyl 
containment site, attack a children's hospital, and attack designated 
humanitarian convoys. Putin, so far, is not winning militarily so now 
this evil man is trying to win by massacring civilians; massacring 
babies; parents, the elderly; and targeting apartments, just as he did 
in Syria, just as he did in Chechnya. If this doesn't equal a war 
crime, I don't know what does.
  If it wasn't clear before, it should be clear now that President 
Putin and his

[[Page S1194]]

band of cronies are not going to stop. But in his monomaniacal hubris, 
Putin has severely--severely--underestimated the Ukrainian people. 
Every time an innocent Ukrainian is killed, the resolve of the people 
grows stronger, and we stand with them. I join my colleagues in one 
voice to say this: ``Slava Ukraini,'' glory to Ukraine.
  And, Mr. President, just seeing the video that the President showed 
us is heartbreaking and strengthens our resolve. Putin, by being such a 
villain, by being such a brutal, evil man, is not going to deter the 
Ukrainians, for sure, and not the American people from helping Ukraine. 
It strengthens our resolve when we see how vicious, how brutal he is.

                                 Costs

  Mr. President, now, on another issue, this morning I want to 
highlight two steps Senate Democrats are taking to maintain our laser 
focus on lowering costs for American families.
  First, today the Senate Finance Committee is holding a hearing 
examining one of the most vexing issues facing Americans everywhere: 
the alarming rise in prescription drug costs. Few things are as 
frustrating and debilitating as going to the pharmacy and seeing the 
price on your receipt go up and up and up for essential medications.
  For families struggling to make ends meet, drug costs present a 
harrowing Sophie's choice. Do I buy groceries and diapers and take care 
of my kids, or do I pay for my medications? It is a decision no 
American should make, but millions have to make it every day.
  Insulin is a particularly flummoxing example. According to some 
sources, a 40-day supply can now climb north of $600 a month. For 
millions of Americans who rely on insulin to manage their diabetes, 
this is a crisis that should compel the Senate to act. I expect that we 
will consider next steps soon on proposals already presented to my 
colleagues.
  And besides rising prescription drug costs, Senate Democrats are 
zeroing in on the alarming state of energy prices. In the coming weeks, 
I expect that Congress will be calling on CEOs from the oil and gas 
companies to testify on the alarming spike in energy prices.
  Over the past few weeks, as war in Ukraine began, the price of a 
barrel of oil rose precipitously. That immediately translated to oil 
and gas companies raising the price for Americans at the pump. But 
something is happening that Americans shouldn't overlook. Over the past 
few days, oil prices have actually been decreasing, but the price of 
gas at the pump has not.
  Some of the economists call this stickiness. When the costs go up, 
the price to the consumer goes up; when the costs go down, the price to 
the consumer stays high. Stickiness does not come close to describing 
the outrage that Americans feel about this.
  The last time that the price of a barrel of oil was at $96, gas was 
$3.62 a gallon. Oil prices have now come down to $96 again. Yet the 
price of gas continues to rise. It is now at $4.31. The bewildering 
incongruity between falling oil prices and rising gas prices smacks of 
price-gouging and is deeply damaging to working Americans.
  The Senate is going to get answers, and that is why we will be 
calling on the CEOs of major oil companies to come testify before the 
Congress.
  Meanwhile, as Americans pay more at the pump, the biggest oil 
companies in America are making a killing. Twenty-five of the top oil 
and gas companies reported a combined $205 billion in profits. That is 
an astounding figure, blowing prepandemic figures out of the water. But 
instead of lowering gas prices, oil companies are using these soaring 
profits to reward their shareholders through stock buybacks. It is 
outrageous to me. Stock buybacks--they benefit the CEOs because they 
can tell the shareholders, ``See, the price went up.'' But it is not 
because they sold more product, became more efficient, hired more 
workers, used productivity. It is simply decreasing the number of 
shares so the price goes up. That, to me, is so wrong. It is one of the 
disturbing signs of American capitalism.
  These disturbing trends demand answers, and the CEOs of large oil and 
gas companies should be advised they will have to provide answers 
before the Senate very soon: Why stock buybacks instead of lowering 
prices or increasing productivity or moving to green energy, which we 
know we all have to do?
  And finally, in conclusion, another issue on prices. The Senate will 
also take action on the bottlenecks and supply chain crisis crippling 
our shipping lines. Senator Cantwell and the Commerce Committee will be 
holding a markup on March 22 on bipartisan legislation introduced by 
Senators Klobuchar and Thune that will target this issue--one of the 
many, many ways that Democrats are continuing our focus on lowering 
costs for American families.
  So these are some concrete steps we are taking. We are going to hear 
about many more as Democrats focus keenly--laser-like--on the higher 
costs for the American people, which we know must, must come down.
  I yield the floor.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaine). Without objection, it is so 
ordered.

                                Ukraine

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this morning, Members of Congress 
received an update on the situation in Ukraine directly from President 
Zelenskyy. His presentation was powerful and heart-wrenching. It 
reinforced our sympathy, our outrage, and our resolve.
  President Zelenskyy's courage and leadership have earned the 
attention and the admiration of the entire free world. He has marshaled 
Ukraine's brave and defiant resistance against Russian invasion. He has 
steeled the resolve of his people beyond what anybody expected and 
offered the entire world a master class in leadership.
  This morning, President Zelenskyy didn't mince words about what 
Ukraine needs urgently to keep up the fight: more lethal capabilities 
and heavier sanctions against Russia and especially the air defense 
systems that we should have helped Ukraine get weeks ago. His people 
face a long and difficult road ahead, and the entire world knows what 
they are up against.
  The scale of Russia's aggression wasn't just foreseeable; it was 
foreseen. For 30 years, every step toward democracy and sovereignty in 
Eastern Europe has tempted the wrath of revanchist autocrats like 
Putin. That is why I have asked the Biden administration early and 
often to demonstrate America's commitment to our allies and partners 
most squarely in Russia's crosshairs.
  Last June, 8 months before the Russian invasion, I urged the 
President to ``provide serious, lethal support to Ukraine and other 
vulnerable states on the front lines of Putin's aggressions''--8 months 
ago. In December, I specifically called on President Biden to deploy 
extra U.S. forces to reinforce NATO's eastern flank--last December. I 
urged his administration to expedite and expand shipments of lethal aid 
like anti-aircraft and anti-tank weapons. But, as we know, a security 
assistance package for Ukraine sat down at the White House for months 
before being approved. Once approved, efforts to transfer the weapons 
moved at the speed of bureaucracy. And the President waited until 
February to order U.S. personnel to the frontlines.
  The Biden administration had over a year to get this right. They had 
a year to translate rhetorical support for NATO into leading real, 
collective defense. But they took 5 months to even nominate an 
ambassador to the alliance.
  On the campaign trail, President Biden called Putin a ``KGB thug.'' 
He was right about that. But after 1 week in office, he announced an 
agreement with the Kremlin to extend the New START treaty for up to 5 
years, reducing our leverage to get a better deal that caps Putin's 
nuclear ambitions.
  As the threats to Ukraine gathered, whenever an opportunity to act 
has presented itself, the Biden administration has hesitated until 
political pressure became overwhelming or balked outright.
  Since Russia's invasion began, the administration has publicly shot 
down efforts from a NATO ally to get working aircraft to Ukrainian 
pilots. Last

[[Page S1195]]

Monday, the White House scuttled a bipartisan congressional bill to end 
normal trade relations with Russia, only to make a public show on 
Friday of calling for exactly the same action.
  At every step of the way--every step of the way--the self-deterred 
White House has insisted its hesitation and restraint was aimed at 
avoiding escalation, but at every step, Putin has escalated.
  Now, 3 weeks into Putin's invasion, the reality on the ground is 
evolving. It is harder now than it would have been a few months ago to 
keep the pipeline of weapons and supplies and intelligence for 
Ukraine's brave resistance open. Russia's air offensive in particular 
is hitting a deadlier, more aggressive stride. But, as I have been 
saying literally for months, it is not too late for the Biden 
administration to do the right thing. So here is what President Biden 
should be doing right now:
  No. 1, he should use the money and authorities we have just provided 
him to expand the scope of our lethal aid to Ukraine to include more 
effective, longer range air defense capabilities. That means working 
with NATO allies with urgency to get Ukrainian pilots more aircraft and 
munitions and facilitating the transfer of weapons Ukraine's forces are 
most familiar with, like air defense systems from countries with 
stockpiles of Soviet legacy systems. President Zelenskyy specifically 
pleaded for these air defense systems this morning--this morning.
  No. 2, President Biden should deploy more U.S. forces to reinforce 
NATO's eastern flank and use the new drawdown and loan guarantee 
authorities to help harden the defenses of our frontline allies and 
partners. Many of these partners are generously helping Ukraine, and we 
should help them backfill their inventories with more modern American 
capabilities that will improve NATO's interoperability and bolster 
deterrence at the same time.

  No. 3, on a trip to Europe next week, President Biden should go 
beyond Brussels. He should go to countries like Poland, Romania, or 
Lithuania to meet with NATO eastern flank allies. He should look beyond 
NATO to deepen our diplomatic security cooperation with important 
American partners like Finland and Sweden.
  Finally, if President Biden wants the United States to lead our 
allies by example and to keep pace with adversaries like Russia and 
China, the place to start is with robust investments in our own defense 
capabilities. The coming year's appropriations process is an 
opportunity to finally--finally--show we are serious.
  Vladimir Putin has proven to the world that he is willing to stoop 
low in pursuit of power, and he has shown us exactly--exactly--how he 
responds to weakness. We cannot afford to stay behind the curve. 
America must lead and lead with strength.
  A few minutes ago, President Zelenskyy reminded us that the United 
States is, indeed, the leader of the free world, so it is time we acted 
like it.

                              The Economy

  Mr. President, on another matter, last week marked 1 year since 
Democrats rammed $2 trillion of runaway liberal spending through the 
Senate on a party-line vote. Working families were certainly not 
celebrating this particular anniversary; they were too busy contending 
with the worst inflation in modern American history, unleashed in large 
part by that very bill.
  Democrats' policies have conjured up the worst inflation in 40 years. 
Consumer prices rose 0.8 percent in the month of February alone. Annual 
inflation hit 7.9 percent. It is still getting worse. We just learned 
yesterday that the Producer Price Index, which measures inflation 
upstream at the wholesale level, is up 10 percent--10 percent--since 
last year.
  This is hammering American families. Experts estimate that inflation 
alone is costing the average household more than $296 every single 
month--the equivalent of an extra $300 monthly bill courtesy of 
Democratic policies. No wonder almost 60 percent of Americans say 
inflation is causing them personal financial pain and the Democrats' 
approval ratings on the economy are way underwater. Even with a literal 
land war in Europe, the Democrats' inflation is so painful that 
inflation and not Ukraine still tops the American people's biggest list 
of concerns.
  From the gas pump to the grocery store, to clothes, diapers, and baby 
formula, to furniture and home essentials, to car repairs and car 
replacements, Democrats' policies have put working families on a 
treadmill where they have to run faster and faster every month just to 
stay in place. Rent prices are spiking faster than they have since 
1991. Grocery prices are soaring faster than they have since 1981. New 
cars and truck prices are climbing at their fastest rates ever. Forget 
about getting ahead and saving--households are lucky if they are even 
able to tread water.
  Lately, Democrats have launched a shameless campaign to blame 12 
months of inflation not on 12 months of their bad policies but instead 
on the last 3 weeks' crisis in Europe. The White House informs us that 
``Putin's price hike'' is the culprit. Of course, that is utter 
nonsense. Even liberal experts are rejecting their shameless spin.
  A former top economist for President Obama directly responded to the 
Biden administration's attempt to shift the blame. He said:

       Well--

  This is what he said--

       Well, no. These are February numbers and only include [a] 
     small Russia effect. This is Biden's inflation and he needs 
     to own it.

  The White House spin has not even persuaded former Democratic 
officials.
  Here is another quote:

       This is Biden's inflation and he needs to own it.

  Working Americans understand it just as well as the experts. 
Everybody knows where the buck stops. One retired mechanic who lives in 
Los Angeles recently explained to a reporter that he is facing $6 
gasoline and rising food prices. He is a registered Democrat, but he 
knows where this inflation came from. Here is how he described it.
  He said:

       Uncle Joe has put us on a diet. I like to have a steak once 
     or twice a month. I can't do it now.

  This is exactly what Republicans said would happen when Democrats 
dumped trillions of dollars into printing and spending on a partisan 
basis last year. Even top liberal economists said Democrats' reckless 
spending spree would bring about inflationary pressures like we have 
not seen for a generation.
  Ah, but Democrats didn't listen. They pushed ahead, and, for 12 
months and counting, working families have been paying a heavy price.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.
  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Republican leader referred to the 
American Rescue Plan, which did not receive a single Republican vote in 
support. He referred to it as runaway Federal spending.
  What did we buy with the American Rescue Plan?
  We bought vaccines, and we bought an administration and management of 
delivering those vaccines to the American people in the midst of a 
pandemic that was claiming American lives every day.
  Runaway Federal spending--how much stronger would this Nation be if 
we were still in the depths of this pandemic?
  We are emerging from it, thank God. But it wasn't for lack of effort 
on our part on this side of the aisle.
  Yes, we spent the money. We administered the shots, and people across 
America are now protected from hospitalizations and death because of 
it. No apologies here to my colleague from Kentucky. It was money well 
spent, not just for that--and that was the number one public health 
purpose--but, secondly, to keep businesses afloat so they can reopen 
their doors as the pandemic ebbed.
  That investment in the capital of America, in the businesses of 
America, paid off for business owners who otherwise would have lost 
their life savings and family investments and for their workers who 
finally returned to work.
  I think it helped the small businesses, and I think it helped the 
families. The child tax credit, which cut in half child poverty in 
America--that child tax credit, according to the Senator from Kentucky, 
was runaway Federal spending. Tell that to the family who lives 
paycheck to paycheck and tries to provide the basics in life for their 
children. No apologies here for the American Rescue Plan.

[[Page S1196]]

  And when you ask the American people, ``What about this inflation,'' 
it is a problem. Of course, it is. We see it as they do. And we see it 
all across the world. Inflation isn't confined to the United States. It 
is reflected in a world that is emerging from COVID-19, where 
economies--local economies--were strangled and choked and restricted. 
Now, they are expanding. People are expanding their needs and spending 
on that side of it. If the supply doesn't keep up with it, then 
inflation results. We have a battle ahead of us and many plans here to 
try to address it with a number of items to reduce the cost of living 
for families.

                                Ukraine

  Mr. President, the second item I would like to mention refers to a 
moving, historic presentation this morning by the President of Ukraine 
to a joint session of Congress.
  He did it virtually by remote because he is literally in Kyiv, 
risking his life every single day for his nation.
  Volodymyr Zelenskyy may have started his life as a standup comedian, 
but at this moment in life, he is a standup President of Ukraine, who 
is confronting the monster of Moscow who has unleashed this invasion on 
his country. He begged us to continue to help, and we will.
  Last week, we added almost $14 billion to the effort to support the 
Ukrainian defense and resistance. We need to do that and more.
  Many of the suggestions by the Republican Senator are consistent with 
that goal, and I would endorse it. But I want to leave it to President 
Biden to make the critical decisions as our Commander in Chief who is 
really tasked with America's national security as his highest priority.

  I take exception to this notion that Joe Biden didn't understand the 
timing of this crisis. He understood it better than anyone. He knew 
that if he pushed too far and too fast, two things might occur: first, 
that the Russians would move because we had precipitated it with an 
action we had taken. He was hoping, as we all did, that this could be 
ended bloodlessly and that an innocent people would be saved from what 
we see, the devastation that is happening in Ukraine today. So he was 
careful to make those moves in a way that Putin couldn't use them as an 
excuse for starting the invasion.
  Second, and more important, he needed to move at a pace consistent 
with building the NATO alliance. President Joe Biden succeeded in that 
effort. The NATO alliance today is stronger than it has ever been. 
Don't believe the last President of the United States had anything to 
do with that, just the opposite was true.
  Joe Biden picked up that alliance from the mat and brought them up to 
fighting trim, to be ready, if needed, to ``defend every square inch,'' 
as he says, ``of NATO territory.'' That timing was crucial. And 
decisions which seem so easy and obvious in America were much more 
complex on the continent of Europe. Joe Biden knew that, and he paced 
himself accordingly. And because of that today, we have the strongest 
alliance in the face of Vladimir Putin that he has ever seen and that 
we have ever seen.
  The last point I want to make to this, you could not watch the 
graphic video presented by President Zelenskyy without breaking your 
heart. Every parent and grandparent in America watching that video saw 
a member of his family, a child, a lifeless corpse because of a man 
named Vladimir Putin and what he is doing to that poor country. 
Unprovoked, he has invaded them and kills innocent people every single 
day.
  Last night, unanimously, the Senate decided, as they should, that the 
conduct of Vladimir Putin was nothing short of a war crime. I can't 
think of any other way to describe it and certainly never excuse it.
  Zelenskyy touched our hearts too. His people are fighting a valiant 
effort, and the United States and allies and countries that share our 
values stand behind him and will continue to.


         Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization Act of 2022

  Mr. President, I am honored to join my colleagues Senators Murkowski 
and Ernst and, of course, my friend and colleague Senator Feinstein to 
celebrate the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, more 
commonly known as VAWA. Yesterday, President Biden signed it into law. 
This is a monumental achievement for the survivors of domestic sexual 
violence and those who stand by them.
  It is an achievement that wouldn't have been possible without 
bipartisan cooperation. It, literally, would not have been possible. I 
have been proud to work with my three colleagues whom I mentioned.
  With this strengthened version of VAWA, we have helped to ensure that 
every survivor in America, no matter where they live, will be able to 
reach for a lifeline in a moment of crisis. We have expanded and 
authorized services for rural survivors, survivors who need culturally 
specific services, and LGBTQ survivors. We have reauthorized programs 
that ensure survivors and their families can access housing, 
healthcare, and essential support services. We have improved rape 
prevention and education, as well as services and protections for young 
survivors. We have enhanced critical protections for Native American 
women and children who experience violence at the hands of non-Native 
perpetrators.
  It doesn't include everything we had hoped for. That is the nature of 
legislation and compromise. I wish there had been stronger protections 
for housing and economic assistance, but we had to find an agreement, 
and we did.
  The bill contains several important provisions to help boost 
enforcement of our gun laws. I wish it would have finally closed the 
so-called ``boyfriend loophole,'' but that was beyond our reach in this 
effort.
  The lack of those provisions could not attract enough bipartisan 
support in the Senate to pass on their own. They will be saved for 
another day.
  For nearly 30 years, VAWA has transformed the way we address domestic 
and sexual violence in America and saved countless lives. At a moment 
when nearly one in three women--one in three--have experienced some 
form of physical or sexual violence, a crisis that has grown worse 
during the pandemic, VAWA is going to help save lives.
  Let me tell you a story. My office received a letter from a woman 
named Kesha, who works with Connections for Abused Women and their 
Children in Chicago. Kesha told me that VAWA provides funding for 
domestic violence services at Chicago's Haymarket Center, an amazing 
agency I know full well.
  She shared the story of Cassandra, who was receiving treatment at the 
Center for Substance Abuse and disclosed to a counselor that she was 
the victim of abusive treatment. Her counselor referred her to VAWA, 
and that program gave her an opportunity to ``open up about the 
emotional, financial, and physical abuse she had suffered for years at 
the hands of [an] abusive husband.''
  Kesha wrote:

       After weeks of domestic violence psychoeducation, a 
     supportive network encouraging her, and her own personal 
     resilience, Cassandra decided that if she wanted to remain in 
     recovery and not relapse, [she had to find a new home, away 
     from her abuser.] With the help of her domestic violence 
     counselor, Cassandra was able to break free and transition 
     into temporary housing.

  She has been able to gain financial independence and find a job. She 
has remained on her path to recovery, a success story, and a reminder 
that VAWA doesn't just help save lives, it gives survivors the power to 
rebuild their own lives.
  VAWA also provides funding for educational programming, and it has 
done it so well.
  I want to thank Senator Feinstein, Senator Ernst, and Senator 
Murkowski for their partnership and tireless leadership in getting this 
bill addressed, introduced, and across the finish line.
  I want to thank their staff: Jessica Jensen, Senator Feinstein's 
chief counsel, as well as Nick Xenakis, her former chief counsel; Corey 
Becker and Kristina Sesek, Senator Ernst's legislative director and 
general counsel; and Anna Dietderich, Senator Murkowski's legislative 
assistant.
  On my Judiciary Committee staff, I would like to give thanks 
especially to Stephanie Trifone and Nicole McClain Walton and Chastidy 
Burns.
  I want to thank the other members of the committees of jurisdiction 
and their staffs, along with Ranking Member Murkowski and the minority 
staff on the Indian Affairs Committee,

[[Page S1197]]

chaired by Brian Schatz. They have done an extraordinarily good job, a 
bipartisan job, when it comes to Native Americans.
  Chair Murray and the staff of the HELP Committee, Chair Brown and the 
staff of the Banking Committee, Chair Wyden and the staff of the 
Finance Committee were part of this victory.
  As you can see, this was a multicommittee team effort on both sides 
of the aisle, and that is the only reason we can stand here today and 
say we will continue to give hope to those who are struggling with 
domestic violence and abuse.
  I ask unanimous consent that Senators Ernst, Murkowski, and Feinstein 
be permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each prior to the cloture 
vote on the Corely nomination.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  The Senator from Iowa.
  Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues Senator 
Durbin, Senator Feinstein, and Senator Murkowski for joining me on the 
floor this morning to talk about a very important topic and one that we 
can finally celebrate, which is the passage and the signing of the 
Violence Against Women Act.
  Nine years--it has been 9 years since the Violence Against Women Act 
was reauthorized, but, finally, the Senate reauthorized and modernized 
this very important bill.
  Last week, the Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization Act of 2022 
passed the House and the Senate, and yesterday, at long last, it was 
signed into law.
  I have been a proud champion of this bill over the last 3 years. And 
while no bill is perfect, I am extremely grateful for the bipartisan 
work to get it over the finish line.
  This bill is personal. Many of you know my story. I am the one out of 
three women who has experienced some form of physical violence by an 
intimate partner.
  Similarly, one in four men have had the same experience. This means 
nearly 20 people per minute, more than 10 million women and men in the 
United States every single year have suffered this horrific personal 
abuse.
  I am not a victim. I am a survivor. It took me a long time to say 
those words out loud. And my hope is that with this bill some women 
will never have to, and those who do will have the necessary support 
and resources in a moment of crisis to cope with and ultimately 
overcome their trauma.
  The reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act is a bright 
light in our current troubling reality.
  The bill includes so many critical resources, especially in our rural 
communities, that have been drastically overlooked.
  Specifically, the bill doubles the support for both the rural 
domestic violence assistance program and the Rape Prevention and 
Education Program, both of which are of great importance to my home 
State of Iowa.
  And my sincere hope is that the resources contained in this new law 
will finally help truly move the needle on domestic violence around the 
country and that some of our Nation's most vulnerable will have access 
to the support that they so desperately need.
  To my colleagues, thank you, especially to Senators Feinstein, 
Durbin, and Murkowski for your diligent work on domestic violence-
related issues over the years.
  I also want to thank Republican Senators Cornyn, Collins, Capito, 
Portman, Cramer, Tillis, Moran, Burr, and Blunt for supporting this 
vital bill at introduction.
  The negotiations were, at times--my colleagues will recognize this--
very tough, and there were several doubts along the way as to whether 
the bill would actually ever happen. But with a little bit of tenacity 
and good-faith negotiating, we got there.
  To those who work every day around this great country to help 
domestic violence survivors, including our law enforcement officers who 
are answering those domestic violence calls, thank you.
  While working at a victim's shelter answering the hotline in college, 
I heard the heartbreaking stories of abuse. I understand this is your 
daily reality. Please know your work is not going unnoticed and is 
making a difference in the lives of those around you.
  To all of the advocates, I greatly appreciate and respect your 
passion for the causes you support. Your persistence made this bill 
possible, and it made this bill better.
  While the end result isn't perfect, it modernizes the resources 
necessary to meet the evolving needs of our survivors.
  This bill is proof that bipartisanship is not dead and Congress can 
tackle these tough issues.
  Finally, for my fellow Americans who can say they are survivors, for 
those who have not come to terms with their abuse and for those who 
feel trapped in their situation and for those who have lost their 
battle, please know that you are not and will never be forgotten. The 
Violence Against Women Act is for you.
  Today, I join my fellow survivors, my colleagues, and our strong and 
wonderful advocates across this country in celebrating VAWA's 
reauthorization and its modernization.
  Thank you to my dear colleagues for their wonderful work in helping 
us get this over the finish line.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.
  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I so appreciate the leadership, the 
heart of Senator Ernst and the ability to work with my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle--Senator Durbin, Senator Feinstein--in this 
effort towards reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.
  Thanks to the very open, very inclusive, and, really, a very 
transparent process that we followed, the bipartisan support that was 
built with this, we were able to include the VAWA reauthorization in 
the Omnibus appropriations bill that passed the Senate last week with 
68 votes.
  That wasn't necessarily the path that we had set on. But we had work 
to do, again, with extraordinary leadership from Senator Ernst, Senator 
Durbin, Senator Feinstein, myself, who have been working on this for 
years, but trying to build that collaborative effort, that negotiated 
effort that would result in not a partisan bill but a bill that is 
designed to help those survivors, designed to help the most vulnerable 
at their time of need.
  So there is great thanks that is due this afternoon as we recognize 
the dedication, the leadership of, again, the cosponsors, the Members 
that led this, but we all know we are backed by incredible men and 
women who work very hard to get these initiatives built and across the 
finish line.
  Senator Durbin has named many of the staffs and general counsels, our 
legislative assistants that made this happen.
  I also want to recognize all those who were named, in addition to 
those who are working on the Senate Indian Affairs Committee to help us 
with that Tribal title. It was a collaborative effort that was really, 
really tireless.
  And I want to acknowledge Senator Ernst particularly. She worked 
tirelessly over these last 3 years, working to ensure that women and 
their safety--and, really, all those who are most vulnerable--their 
safety is put first.
  But to Senator Feinstein, Senator Durbin--invaluable partners putting 
the politics aside, saying: We have to figure out how we are going to 
make this happen, and they did so.
  But we and our staff can't do near the job that needs to be done 
without the advocacy and, again, this passionate grassroots advocacy 
that we have all felt.
  I want to recognize women like Tami Jerue from the Alaskan Native 
Women's Resource Center; Michelle Demmert, Brenda Stanfield from the 
Alaska Network on Domestic Violence. There were so many who urged us 
along--in fact, so many who have flown 4,000 miles to come from Alaska 
to be at a ceremony at the White House in recognition of this.
  So Senator Ernst has said how personal this issue of domestic 
violence is, and it is for so many. Half the women--half the women--in 
the State of Alaska have experienced intimate partner, sexual violence, 
or both.
  The advocates know, I know, we know how imperative it is for Congress 
to take action to reauthorize and to modernize this almost three-
decades-old law.

[[Page S1198]]

  Again, we don't want to talk about statistics because these are 
people--these are friends, these are mothers, daughters--but the 
statistics are just so in your face.
  Alaska Native women suffer the highest rate of forcible sexual 
assault and have reported rates of domestic violence up to 10 times 
higher than the national average.
  In so many of the Native villages in my State in rural Alaska, they 
have no law enforcement presence; so trying to prevent violence, trying 
to protect or ensure justice for survivors is hard.
  And so I really am very, very thankful for the work that Senator 
Schatz committed to within the Senate Indian Affairs Committee to put 
together a strong Tribal title in VAWA that would continue to empower 
Tribal courts to help combat this major public safety issue affecting 
Native people and children.
  We have got a pretty complex jurisdictional landscape as the result 
of our Native Claims Settlement Act, and the last time that VAWA was 
reauthorized in 2013, Alaska was effectively left out. But today, we 
have an Alaska solution to this jurisdictional maze. We call it the 
Alaska Public Safety Empowerment pilot project that was included in the 
Tribal title, and it is the product of years of work with Tribal 
advocates, with the Department of Justice--some pretty smart lawyers 
out there--and then good, strong work in the committee.
  And what this pilot program will do is supplement the work that the 
State of Alaska is doing with regard to public safety. It doesn't 
create Indian Country in the State, it doesn't take away any 
jurisdiction, but it will empower a limited number of Alaska Tribes to 
exercise this special criminal jurisdiction over defendants who commit 
certain crimes that we outline in the law that occur in Native villages 
in the State.
  Tribes selected to participate are going to have to meet specific 
criteria that are set by the Department of Justice. They will have to 
include a Tribal justice system that can adequately safeguard the right 
of all defendants.
  So I am optimistic. I believe that our Alaska Tribes are up to this 
job. They are going to be good partners with the State, and they will 
make a difference. They will make a difference, and they will provide 
hope to so many in these communities that have felt without hope.
  We are celebrating, again, passage of this law--the reauthorization, 
the modernization. But for so many who have shown the bravery, the 
strength, the resilience in the wake of unspeakable trauma--we know 
that so many, again, of our friends have endured domestic violence, 
dating violence, sexual assault, stalking. Many have survived, but so 
many have not.
  These women have endured physical, mental, emotional abuse. The 
impacts don't necessarily fade away because the calendar moves on; but 
on their journeys to recovery and healing, many have developed an 
extraordinary inner strength to stand up and be advocates for 
themselves and others, and they have spoken about their abuse, they 
have sought the changes to VAWA to prevent the future tragedies and 
hold perpetrators accountable, and we have heard them and their pleas 
to improve access to essential support services, whether healthcare, 
safe housing for victims--but we have also heard the cries of parents 
and loved ones who lost those that they love so very much.
  I am thinking of Butch and Cindy Moore right now. Butch and Cindy are 
from Wasilla. They have spent--I swear, they have spent every moment of 
their lives since they lost their beautiful daughter Bree, 20 years 
old. They have been advocating for prevention efforts to ensure that no 
parent experiences the loss of their child to teen dating violence.
  Butch and Cindy have said:

       As parents who have experienced the devastation of losing 
     our daughter, Bree Moore, to dating violence, we know 
     prevention is the key to keeping future generations safe from 
     interpersonal violence.

  I know that Butch and Cindy are looking at this day and feeling that, 
again, there is some hope. There is some hope.
  This is a legislative win, but I think it is also a victory--a 
victory for women everywhere--and we mark its passage in memory of both 
those that we have lost and those that have survived.
  This is the day where we recognize that this Congress can act in a 
bipartisan manner to address the crisis of violence in our communities 
by passing this reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, 
which is now law, now helping to protect women in Alaska and across the 
country, and we thank all who helped us get here.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.
  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today also in recognition of 
the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2022.
  I am delighted President Biden signed it into law yesterday as part 
of the omnibus spending bill.
  It is important to know that this bill reauthorizes critical programs 
that help respond to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual 
assault, and stalking. It is long overdue, but today, this bill will 
become law.
  Last month, I introduced this reauthorization bill alongside Senators 
Ernst, Durbin--both of whom are on the floor today--Murkowski, who is 
also here today, and additional cosponsors.
  A number of advocates joined us, including Angelina Jolie, to speak 
about the importance of the legislation.
  The bill we introduced and the bill we are passing today has really 
strong bipartisan support, including that of 11 Republican cosponsors.
  In addition to reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act through 
2027, the law includes bringing it up to date, and that is important. 
It means that existing programs will be able to do an even better job 
protecting and supporting survivors of domestic violence, dating 
violence, sexual assault, and stalking.
  It is the result of a truly bipartisan effort, and I want to thank 
Senators Ernst, Durbin--both are on the floor--particularly Senator 
Murkowski, for working with me to prepare this important piece of 
legislation. I am very appreciative of the partnership because the law 
will become a reality. We also had help from a number of our Senate 
colleagues on both side of the aisle who made important contributions 
to the effort.
  This act plays a critical role supporting law enforcement in their 
efforts to stop these perpetrators before it is too late. It 
reauthorizes important programs and provides the necessary updates to 
strengthen them.
  So what does it do?
  First, it enhances and expands services for survivors, including 
survivors in rural communities, LGBT survivors, survivors with 
disabilities, and survivors who experience abuse later in life. Older 
people get a lot of violence.
  It strengthens the criminal justice response to domestic violence, 
including by improving the Justice Department's STOP grant program and 
strengthening the ability of Tribal courts to address instances of 
domestic violence on Tribal lands.
  It also establishes a pilot program that focuses on addressing 
domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking 
through community-based, victim-initiated efforts to seek 
accountability.
  And the law invests in prevention education efforts that will improve 
the healthcare system's response to sexual violence--we hope.
  And these changes can have a real impact. Here is one example: The 
International Association of Forensic Nurses reports that only one in 
four U.S. hospitals has a sexual assault forensic nurse on duty--not a 
special place but even one nurse on duty. Our bipartisan law remedies 
this problem by providing additional funding and training to increase 
access to forensic nurses, particularly in rural areas, where, 
strangely enough, a lot of this violence takes place.
  Through this bipartisan law, we will make significant improvements to 
our Nation's response to domestic violence, but I want to caution 
everybody, it isn't perfect.
  I really regret that certain provisions were unable to be included in 
this bill. In particular, I had hoped we could include a provision to 
close the boyfriend loophole. Most people don't know that while 
individuals convicted of domestic violence against a spouse are 
prevented from purchasing a firearm, that is not the case for those 
convicted of domestic violence against a dating partner.

[[Page S1199]]

We tried to get that part passed, and it is very disappointing that 
there was not sufficient bipartisan support for this provision to close 
what will remain a dangerous loophole.
  So, clearly, we still have work to do. There are those of us who 
follow these assaults carefully and make a determination where this 
bill works and where it might need improvement, and I have just 
suggested one. So we will watch those figures carefully.
  I would like to thank the many advocates who provided valuable input 
and support. This bill was written in close consultation with the 
people who are on the frontlines helping survivors of domestic violence 
every day.
  For nearly 30 years, the Violence Against Women Act has played a 
vital role in the Federal response to domestic violence, dating 
violence, sexual assault, and stalking. As Katie Ray-Jones, the CEO of 
the National Domestic Violence Hotline, noted, the Violence Against 
Women Act provides services with ``a variety of options to meet their 
evolving and complex needs for services and support.'' For example, 
according to the National Network to End Domestic Violence, in a single 
day in 2020, there were 76,525 survivors, in 1 day 75,000 women were 
affected by domestic violence who received assistance thanks to 
programs funded and supported by the Violence Against Women Act.
  So despite the progress made over the last three decades, sexual, 
emotional, and physical abuse are still painful realities for far too 
many Americans. We need to say this over and over again. We need to 
change minds and change actions.
  More than one in three women and more than one in four men will 
experience rape, physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner 
in their lifetime. According to the National Coalition Against Domestic 
Violence in my home State of California, approximately 35 percent of 
California women and 31 percent of California men will experience 
violence from intimate partners in their lifetimes. That is an amazing 
figure, if you think about it.
  In conclusion, let me end with this: All too often, these instances 
of domestic violence have fatal consequences. Every day, people are 
killed by a current or former intimate partner. This law is long 
overdue.
  And I want to thank the Members who have spoken on the floor and all 
those who voted for this law. We are glad to get it signed into law and 
hope to put an end to some of this.

                              BOLIVAR Act

  Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, as the Federal Government 
rightfully continues to levy devastating sanctions on Russia and punish 
Putin and his thugs for their horrific and unlawful invasion of 
Ukraine, we cannot, as the Biden administration has signaled it will, 
choose to empower one dictator so we can punish another.
  Nicoles Maduro is the illegitimate, ruthless dictator in Venezuela. I 
traveled to the Colombia-Venezuela border and saw the suffering of the 
Venezuelan people at the hand of Maduro's regime. I met with Venezuelan 
refugees and got updates from Colombian officials on just how bad 
Venezuelans were being treated by Maduro's tyranny.
  Venezuelan children walk for hours through dense forests, across 
rivers, and over terrorist-controlled territory just to get to a school 
in Colombia for an education and a meal. Mothers with young children 
came to Cucuta to get the only meal they would eat for 3 days. I met a 
pregnant woman who was forced to sleep on the streets of Venezuela 
because she was homeless. Think about that. I am a father and a 
grandfather. Imagine having to look at your 3-year-old child or 
grandchild in the eyes and tell them that they are not going to eat 
today because there is no food.
  The pain, the hunger, the devastation--I cannot believe any human 
being would do this to young children. It was heartbreaking, and it was 
evil. And there is one man responsible for it: Nicoles Maduro.
  Since my visit, things have only gotten worse. In what is one of the 
worst humanitarian crises in Latin American history, more than 6 
million Venezuelans have fled Maduro's oppression in Venezuela since 
2014.
  In 2020, a factfinding mission for the United Nations determined that 
Maduro's regime has engaged in crimes against humanity, including 
unlawful executions, enforced disappearances, arbitrary detentions, and 
torture. The regime has imprisoned hundreds of its political opponents 
and forced countless more into exile. They have used the guise of the 
COVID-19 pandemic to further crack down on journalists and dissenters.
  We know that what has been happening at the direction of Nicolas 
Maduro in Venezuela is horrific. That is why, in 2019, the previous 
administration signed an Executive order issuing a complete economic 
embargo on Venezuela.
  We can all agree that the United States should not be bolstering such 
a disgusting socialist regime, and we cannot forget that any lifting of 
sanctions or show of appeasement toward Maduro's Venezuela will only 
further the suffering there and help its evil allies, like Russia, 
Cuba, communist China, and Iran, which actively support Maduro's 
abuses. So I and many others were deeply disturbed last week when we 
learned that President Biden secretly sent a team to Venezuela--
secretly sent a team to Venezuela--and began negotiations on the 
potential purchase of Venezuelan oil and the easing of sanctions.
  High gas prices caused by President Biden's war on American energy 
and Putin's invasion of Ukraine doesn't mean we can turn a blind eye to 
Maduro's genocide and oppression. We know that funds going to Maduro 
are used for terrorism in our hemisphere, and we know that Venezuela 
and Russia are aligned. If we support one, we support the other. That 
is why, just days after the American team left, the Russian Foreign 
Minister traveled to meet with the Venezuelan Vice President.

  Now, I am glad the administration finally made the decision to stop 
buying Russian oil--I think it came too late--but I am glad the Biden 
administration reluctantly agreed not to purchase oil from Venezuela. 
We shouldn't be supporting Maduro or Putin. It would be foolish if we 
made the mistake of supporting one dictator so we could punish another 
dictator. Maduro has decided to be our enemy, and so is Putin. Neither 
of them deserves our money.
  The Biden administration needs to realize that our enemies are not 
the world's only source of oil and natural gas. America has huge 
supplies of oil and natural gas, and we would have access to those 
resources right now if the Biden administration hadn't spent the past 
year relentlessly trying to destroy the U.S. oil industry.
  On day 1, Biden killed the Keystone Pipeline, and 10,000--10,000--
jobs alongside it were lost. Then he cut off new drilling contracts on 
public lands. The Biden EPA has added one ridiculous regulation after 
another to make it more expensive and harder for American oil 
manufacturers to do business. We went from being nearly energy 
independent and a net exporter in 2019 to begging cartels and ruthless 
dictators for oil. This is not American leadership, and it is not 
American independence.
  It is long past time for the administration to admit that its 
ridiculous Green New Deal policies put our security at risk and hurt 
American families. Prices at the pump are at an alltime high across the 
Nation.
  We should be solving this problem with our own resources and with our 
own workers, not with Maduro and his thugs. That is why I have 
introduced the Banning Operations and Leases with the Illegitimate 
Venezuelan Authoritarian Regime Act, or the BOLIVAR Act. This bill 
would prohibit Federal Agencies from doing business with the oppressive 
Maduro regime. We can't stand by and let Maduro continue to commit 
genocide against his people, and we have to do everything possible to 
restrict the money Maduro uses to hold on to power and destabilize the 
region.
  When I was Governor of Florida, I signed a bill that prevented State 
agencies from investing in companies doing business with the Government 
of Venezuela.
  In 2019, my amendment to cut off funds to the Maduro regime was 
included in the National Defense Authorization Act.
  In March of last year, my colleagues on the Homeland Security and 
Governmental Affairs Committee agreed with me, and we unanimously 
passed the BOLIVAR Act through our committee.
  I am thankful for Senators Jacky Rosen, Marco Rubio, and Thom Tillis, 
who have cosponsored this legislation and helped bring this legislation 
this far. I also want to thank Congressman   Michael Waltz for 
introducing the companion bipartisan bill in the House of 
Representatives.
  But we didn't introduce the bill only to have the Biden 
administration begin working with Maduro's thugs and bolstering the 
corrupt Venezuelan oil industry. We are trying to stop that, and no one 
should want to be on the side of Maduro's genocide.
  I am grateful for the bipartisan support this bill has received, and 
I hope that the entire Senate will take a stand to support the fight 
for freedom and the people of Venezuela.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.

                        Supreme Court Nomination

  Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of a few 
Federal judge nominees from the State of California.
  In recognizing that, right now, many Americans are certainly 
following the news and the potential news of the Federal judiciary and 
are focusing on a nominee for the U.S. Supreme Court. As a member of 
the Judiciary Committee, I certainly look forward to hearing more from 
Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson next week as we conduct her confirmation 
hearing.
  The choices for the Supreme Court are certainly critical for the 
future of our democracy, but the fact of the matter is--and the 
Presiding Officer knows I like numbers and knows I like data. So the 
important data point here is that it is only a tiny percentage of cases 
in our Federal court system that actually reach the U.S. Supreme Court. 
In fact, more than 90 percent of the Federal cases are decided at the 
district court level. That means the vast majority of people who 
interface with the Federal judiciary will only ever meet a district 
court judge, sitting on the other side of the bench, whether

[[Page S1201]]

they are witnesses to a crime, whether they are parties to a lawsuit or 
defendants in a criminal case.
  That is one of the primary reasons I have worked so closely with the 
Biden administration in helping to identify and recommend and support 
talented nominees for California's district courts.
  Today, I rise to highlight three nominees to serve as Federal judges 
whose confirmation processes we are beginning today.

                 Nomination of Ruth Bermudez Montenegro

  Mr. President, Judge Ruth Montenegro is nominated to serve on the 
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California.
  She is a proud daughter of Mexican immigrants who came to this 
country with only elementary school educations--just like my parents. 
Judge Montenegro understood early on--because of her parents' 
experience and their journey--the value of getting a good education and 
of public service, starting at a very young age. She was born and 
raised in the Imperial Valley, where she returned after graduating from 
UCLA Law School.
  Like so many of us, you are trying to fulfill your parents' dreams, 
so you go on to college and get a good education. You graduate and have 
options all over and choose to come home to make a difference.
  Judge Montenegro built a career in representing public agencies. She 
could have made a lot of money in the private sector. She chose to 
represent public agencies, ranging from the Imperial Valley Housing 
Authority to the El Centro Elementary School District. She has served 
for nearly 10 years now as a State superior court and Federal 
magistrate judge.
  Judge Montenegro's extensive judicial experience and lifelong 
dedication to her community, I have no doubt, will strengthen the 
Southern District's bench.

                    Nomination of Fred W. Slaughter

  Mr. President, next, I would like to highlight Judge Fred Slaughter, 
who is nominated to serve on the U.S. District Court for the Central 
District of California.
  Judge Slaughter received his undergraduate and his law degree from 
UCLA, going on to a distinguished career as a prosecutor. For more than 
a decade, he served as an assistant U.S. attorney in Arizona, Oregon, 
and California, where he oversaw and tried hundreds of cases, including 
cases involving human trafficking, bank robberies, and the prosecuting 
of members of White supremacist groups.
  Judge Slaughter has spent the past 8 years serving in the Orange 
County Superior Court. There, he is known for his compassion and 
leadership in juvenile justice. Judge Slaughter's long career 
demonstrates his legal excellence as well as his commitment to

                 Nomination of Jacqueline Scott Corley

  Mr. President, finally, Judge Jacqueline Corley is nominated to serve 
for the Northern District of California.
  She is a native of Long Beach. She earned her bachelor's degree from 
UC Berkeley and her J.D. from Harvard Law School.
  Judge Corley's nontraditional path to the bench displays her 
commitment to public service. After spending some time in private 
practice, she spent more than 10 years as a career law clerk for the 
Northern District of California. Based on her outstanding work in that 
role and the expertise that she built in private practice prior, Judge 
Corley was selected to serve as a magistrate judge for the Northern 
District. She has served there for the past decade and is known for her 
mentorship of current law clerks.
  I celebrate each of these highly qualified nominees who will help 
Californians access justice throughout our State. When people enter a 
Federal court, they should feel confident in the promise of equal 
justice--equal justice that I know these three nominees will help 
deliver. The oversight and judgment of a thoughtful and fair judge is 
paramount.

  Our democracy depends on the public's faith in the judiciary. That is 
why I am committed to building a bench of judges who will better 
reflect and understand the districts, the States, and the country that 
they serve. I am proud to take another step toward that goal by 
supporting the confirmations of these three judges, and I urge all of 
our colleagues to do the same.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.

               One-Year Anniversary of Georgia Shootings

  Mr. WARNOCK. Mr. President, I rise today to reflect on a dark day in 
Georgia's recent history.
  One year ago today, a hateful act of violence shook Metropolitan 
Atlanta and reverberated across our State, our country, and indeed the 
world. In the span of just a few hours, our sense of safety and 
sanctuary was pierced by bullets of hate and fear. Eight precious 
people lost their lives--eight people who were loved by their families, 
their friends, their children; eight people with their own successes 
and struggles, hopes, and dreams.
  We speak their names: Soon Chung Park, Hyun Jung Grant, Suncha Kim, 
Yong Ae Yue, Delaina Ashley Yaun Gonzalez, Paul Andre Michels, Xiaojie 
Tan, Daoyou Feng.
  My heart aches for these Georgians and their families for whom I am 
sure the wounds are still fresh. They were the victims of 
unconscionable, senseless hate.
  As a pastor, I believe in the sacred worth of every human being--that 
we are a strange admixture of dust and divinity, of sod and sky, of 
beauty and possibility.
  So I will ask now for all of my colleagues and everyone who can to 
join me in taking a moment of silence to remember these eight Georgians 
and to pray, each in our own way, for their families.
  (Moment of silence.)
  Thank you.

                    Violence Against Asian Americans

  Mr. President, importantly, I must mention that this unspeakable 
violence was visited largely upon Georgia's Asian-American community 
and especially on women of Asian descent. Unfortunately, this hateful 
act that horrified Atlanta is not isolated; it is part of a larger 
trend.
  Last year, anti-Asian hate crimes increased 339 percent. Think about 
that--in 1 year, a 339-percent increase in anti-Asian hate crimes. It 
is a sobering statistic, and it should remind all of us of our shared 
duty in our democracy to stay committed to peace, an active peace, that 
recognizes that we are in this together.
  It was Martin Niemoller, the pastor during Hitler's Third Reich, who 
said:

       First they came for the Communists, and I did not speak . . 
     . because I was not a Communist.
       Then they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak . . 
     . because I was not a Socialist.
       Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak 
     . . . because I was not a Trade Unionist.
       Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak . . . 
     because I was not a Jew.
       Then they came for me, and there was no one left to speak. 
     . . .

  So this is a tragedy, in a real sense, visited upon all of us.
  As a student of history and a voice for our State and the Senate, I 
know Georgians understand all too well how hate and misplaced anger can 
hurt our communities and how certain parts of our community are so 
easily scapegoated and lose their sense of sanctuary. And then when 
that happens, all of us lose a piece of ourselves. So I want to say to 
my AAPI sisters, brothers, and neighbors that I see you, and, more 
importantly, I will continue to stand with you against hate and 
violence wherever it rears its ugly head.

  That is why I cosponsored and fought to pass the COVID-19 Hate Crimes 
Act and to get it signed into law, directing more resources to ensure 
our communities have what they need to seek justice whenever and 
wherever hate and crime rear their ugly heads.
  I am especially proud that my colleagues worked with me to include a 
provision in this legislation that names and acknowledges the pain and 
experiences of Georgia's AAPI community specifically and makes sure we 
never forget the names attached to the lives and the families we lost 
in the horrific shootings in Atlanta 1 year ago today.
  And that is why I am pushing here in the Senate to confirm a U.S. 
attorney for the northern district of our State, a post that is 
integral to helping Georgians stop crime and pursue justice.
  The terrible act of violence and hate we witnessed on March 16, 2021, 
ought

[[Page S1202]]

to remind us all that we all have a stake in each other's well-being.
  Georgia's greatest son, that great American, Dr. Martin Luther King, 
Jr., said it best: We are tied in a single garment of destiny, caught 
up in ``an inescapable network of mutuality.'' ``Whatever affects one 
directly, affects all indirectly.'' ``I cannot be all that I ought to 
be until you are all that you ought to be, and you cannot be all that 
you ought to be until I am all that I ought to be.''
  And so let us continue working together to stop Asian hate, to stop 
the scapegoating, and to create what Dr. King called the beloved 
community--a community where everybody, no matter their skin color, 
ethnicity, sexual orientation, or religious background, can live a life 
of fulfillment and joy without fear of facing hate.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Rosen). The Senator from Oklahoma.

                            Border Security

  Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, there are a lot of things going on in 
the world right now--a lot. What is happening in Ukraine; Russian 
aggression; continuing talk about the continual challenges of communist 
China; dealing with COVID-19 and its effects still worldwide, still 
here in the United States; still lots of people very frustrated on 
transportation mandates--on the masks, I should say; other vaccine 
mandates that are still out there; we have a 7--almost 8--percent now 
inflation rate that is in the country; cost of living is going up; all 
the energy issues--there are so many things that we are dealing with 
around this body of late.
  I want to bring something to the middle of this conversation that I 
don't want us to forget about because the media seemed to have pushed 
it all to the back burner. And I have even had people recently catch me 
and say, Apparently, things are going much better on our southern 
border because I don't hear about it anymore. Well, it has not gotten 
better. And I want to bring a couple of issues and one in particular 
that I am very concerned about of where things are going right now, on 
our enforcement on the southern border.
  This chart walks through the last 10 years of illegal crossings that 
had been actually apprehended, engaged--the new term is ``encountered'' 
that the Biden administration is using. This is over the last 10 years, 
and this is quarter by quarter of what has actually occurred.
  You will see the rise and fall over multiple times. You will see 
spikes that have happened. But right there, that spot, is when 
President Biden was elected. That is that date. His election is there, 
and this is what has occurred since that time period.
  Instead of seeing a big dropoff just in the last couple of months, we 
have only seen it go down, but not even close to the highest peaks in 
the past.
  To give you a point of reference on that, since January of 2021, we 
have had 2,355,000 people whom we have ``encountered'' on the southwest 
border--folks who have illegally crossed our border. These are not just 
record numbers; these are alltime high numbers--nothing even close to 
the number of people who are illegally crossing the border.
  Now, this is on the southern border. And there are two facts I want 
to be able to add to this, the first of which is what is happening 
inside the country: That would be ICE removals.
  This is since 2015, the ICE removals that have been done every year 
during the Obama administration, during the Trump administration, and 
then during the first year of the Biden administration. So not only do 
we have 2.3 million people who have illegally come to our border and 
crossed it that we have encountered, but it is an alltime low of actual 
deportations that are happening right now as well.
  So not only on our southern border are we seeing record numbers of 
high coming in inside the country, it is record-low numbers actually 
being deported out.
  This is by design. This is not accidental. The policies that have 
been put in place on our southern border were put in place to encourage 
people, quite frankly, to be able to cross the border, knowing full 
well that when you get inside, you won't actually be deported.
  There is only one policy that is set out there that has been in the 
middle of this that has changed the dynamic at all, and it is a policy 
most Americans never even heard of. It is called title 42 expulsions. 
Quite frankly, probably most of the folks in this room have never heard 
of title 42 expulsions. It is a new term, so I want to be able to walk 
through it a little bit.
  Starting in March of 2020--just 2 years ago--when COVID started to 
accelerate worldwide, the Surgeon General made a recommendation through 
the CDC, through HHS, to the President to be able to say we have a 
worldwide pandemic that is occurring. Here is title 42 of the Public 
Health Service Act. It says:

       Whenever the Surgeon General determines that by reason of 
     the existence of any communicable disease in a foreign 
     country, there is serious danger of the introduction of such 
     disease into the United States, and that . . . danger is so 
     increased by the introduction of persons or property from 
     [that] country that a suspension of the right to introduce 
     such persons and property is required in the interest of the 
     public health, the Surgeon General, in accordance with 
     regulations approved by the President, shall have the power 
     to prohibit . . . the introduction of persons and property 
     from such countries or places [that they] shall designate . . 
     . to [avoid] such danger.

  In March of 2020, the Trump administration said: We have got a 
concern dealing with individuals crossing our border illegally. They 
are coming from all over the world. There is COVID all over the world. 
There are some authorities that you go through that you can actually 
say some of these folks can be turned around immediately.
  The Surgeon General, HHS, and the President agreed that we are going 
to turn people around at the border immediately. So the Trump 
administration did that.
  And, by the way, right there is President Biden's inauguration. His 
HHS also agreed with this same policy of title 42 to say: We have a 
serious risk from COVID, so we should also turn people around in 
numbers at the border and send them back home.
  This is the number under the Biden administration of individuals who 
have been turned around.
  Let me give you a perspective. Of the 2.3 million people who have 
been encountered at our border since the beginning of the Biden 
administration, 56 percent of those folks have been literally turned 
around at the border and told, You cannot enter under title 42 
authority--56 percent of the people. So 44 percent of the people have 
been allowed to be able to come into our country.
  Let me set this in context because I am throwing a lot of numbers out 
at everybody. I want you to remember all the news reports from last 
year, all of the overcrowding in the Donna, TX, facility that we saw, 
all of the people crammed underneath the bridge in the Rio Grande 
Valley, all of those folks who piled across the border in massive 
numbers that we saw coming into the United States--that represented 
only 44 percent of the people illegally crossing our border because 
they were allowed in.
  I bring this up because as of right now, we have heard that DHS, the 
President, and HHS are considering canceling title 42. If that occurs, 
we won't have 1 million people illegally crossing our border and 
released into the United States; within months, we will have 2 million. 
And all that you saw last summer of the flood of people--that 44 
percent--imagine what that looks like more than doubled this summer.
  The conversation is we are getting toward the backside of COVID. 
Ironically enough, while the President just extended the transportation 
requirement for masks--again--while the President just asked for 
billions of dollars of additional money because we need vaccines 
worldwide to be able to distribute more vaccines worldwide to be able 
to fight COVID, while we are still dealing with all the additional 
surge rise and falls in other countries--in fact, just within the last 
couple of days, China has gone back into lockdown based on new COVID 
cases in China--while all of that is occurring worldwide, apparently, 
the President is looking to cancel title 42.
  And when I have asked what will replace that policy, the answer has 
come back to me: We are not sure yet. That tells me nothing is actually 
the plan to replace this. That is a problem.

[[Page S1203]]

  What happens when title 42 goes away? An extra million people come 
into the country illegally, remembering that when all of those folks 
come into the country, apparently, the Biden administration also has no 
plan to deport them.
  Where are we right now with the number of people that have illegally 
crossed our border, and where are they from? Let me give you a quick 
map.
  This is a map of all the countries in the past year--just in the past 
year--who have illegally crossed our border. In the white there is the 
United States. In the red are the countries that we have seen people 
illegally cross our border. If you want to squint at that map, let me 
just give you shorthand for it. It is every country in the world.
  Last year, we had individuals from literally every country in the 
world illegally cross our southern border. Yes, that includes China; 
that includes North Korea; that includes Iran. It includes them all.
  Interestingly enough, just in the last--well, not the last 3 months 
but the last 4 months that we have had records on it--that would be 
October, November, December, and January--just in those last 4 months 
that we have those records, we have 6,400 Russian citizens who 
illegally crossed our southern border. Just in the last 4 months we 
have records, there were 6,400 Russian citizens.
  We have people from all over the world who are illegally crossing our 
southern border because people know, if you get across the border, you 
are in. When title 42 goes away, this accelerates even more. It is an 
open invitation because 56 percent of the people were turned around, 44 
percent of the people were released into the country--by the way, that 
is over a million so far--that goes away. Then they all get in.
  What happens at that point? Those individuals are told that they can 
make a request for asylum, even though our statistics show 91 percent 
of the people who request asylum are actually coming for economic 
reasons, not actually true asylum--91 percent.
  Those individuals are released into the country. They are told to be 
able to sign up for a hearing date, and they can do their hearing 
anywhere they want in the United States. They are given a hearing date, 
currently, 6 years in the future--6 years. So they will be traveling in 
our country anywhere they want to go for the next 6 years waiting on 
their hearing.
  By the way, if they don't show up for their hearing, apparently there 
is no plan to be able to actually go get them, if they don't show up 
for their hearing, because, right now, ICE is not removing people. So 
they are just released, and when they are released into the country, 
they can immediately text friends back home and say: I am in. Here is 
what I said. Here is where I crossed. Here is the cartel member whom I 
paid on the southern border to be able to get me through. I am in. 
Follow my same path; you will have the same result.
  What can be done about this? Well, let me just highlight a couple of 
things, and then I want to talk about this more.
  First things first--don't end title 42. We still have a worldwide 
pandemic. Until there is a plan of what is actually going to occur next 
on our southern border, don't end title 42.
  This is the time for the President and Ali Mayorkas and all the 
leadership to put up a pause and to say: The chaos that happened last 
year was only 44 percent of the people crossing our southern border. We 
do not have, physically, the capability to be able to handle that many 
people. Do not cancel title 42.
  The second thing is the ``Remain in Mexico'' policy. The ``Remain in 
Mexico'' policy that actually started under President Trump, President 
Biden set aside, and Federal courts stepped back in and told this 
administration: You have to put back in place the ``Remain in Mexico'' 
policy. So they chose to do it.
  I have talked to this body before about what they did. The Biden 
administration said: OK. We will follow the court order. We will 
reinstate the ``Remain in Mexico'' policy.
  They have reinstated that policy the last 3 months. They have put up 
three different facilities. Actually, now there are four total 
facilities. I visited one of them in Brownsville, TX. That facility has 
six courtrooms. Each courtroom is set up to handle 22 people at a time, 
plus their attorneys, plus all the ancillary services. Six of those 
they have got set up. They have individual meeting spaces set up for 
120 people to meet individually with their attorney. So 120 rooms, 6 
courtrooms that are all set up, and all the ancillary everything around 
it as well, and we have now got 4 different locations for that.
  Of the half a million people who have illegally crossed our border in 
the time that they have set up the new MPP courtrooms--of the half a 
million people who have crossed illegally during that time period, so 
far, the Biden administration has pulled out 1,569 of them to evaluate 
if they would go into the ``Remain in Mexico'' policy. Of those, 893 
they actually put in the system. Of those, they have actually had 494 
of those who at some point came back and said: We have changed our 
mind. We talked to attorneys. We have a new way to be able to get out 
of it.
  We are trying to get the actual number of people who have actually 
gone through the ``Remain in Mexico'' policy and who have actually 
qualified for it, while we have 4 different locations, each of them 
with 6 courtrooms, 120 meeting spaces. But what we are finding is, 
really, a handful of people actually have ``qualified'' for the 
``Remain in Mexico'' policy out of half a million people during that 
time period.
  The simple answer is that the Biden administration is spending 
millions and millions of taxpayer dollars setting up the MPP Program 
that the court has required them to do, but they have made so many 
exceptions to it, no one actually qualifies. So they are trying to 
please the court by saying ``We are following your order,'' waste 
American tax dollars, while we continue to see record numbers of people 
crossing the border. That is a waste.
  If we are going to stop this, keep title 42 in place until you have a 
response to what you are going to do instead. Actually run the MPP 
Program as the court has instructed you to do rather than playing games 
with American tax dollars and with the system here.
  I would also encourage you to put the ``Safe Third Country'' policy 
back in place. The previous administration had actually created a 
relationship with multiple other countries so that as individuals 
traveled through other countries to get to the United States, they 
could make asylum requests in those locations, because we understand--
because we know the law in this body--the law is very clear on the 
international standards on this.
  If you are going to request asylum, you go to the next safe country, 
and you request asylum. If they are traveling through five countries or 
they are traveling literally across the globe to get to the United 
States from everywhere else so they can request asylum, that is not 
asylum; that is economic opportunity.
  By the way, don't blame them for coming to the greatest country in 
the world to get economic opportunity--except that is not asylum, and 
we all know it. So why don't we actually treat it exactly as we all see 
it?
  If you would like to come to the greatest country in the world, 
wonderful. Go through the legal process of that. We allow a million 
people a year to legally become citizens of the United States, going 
through the legal process. Do that. But for the billions of people who 
wake up every day wishing they were in the United States, I don't blame 
you. But we welcome people when they come through legally in this 
process, and we do with open arms welcome people who come through 
legally.
  There are ways to be able to address this, but my first concern today 
is to be able to speak to this administration and to be able to say: 
The title 42 piece is essential to maintain. Do not let go of this 
until you have a solution to what is happening at the border, or the 
chaos at the border will be even worse this summer than it was last 
summer, and it is on you for not enforcing the border.
  I want to keep this conversation going in the days ahead, but as of 
now, I yield the floor.

                             Sunshine Week

  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I come to the floor today to celebrate 
what we say annually is Sunshine

[[Page S1204]]

Week, a very important week in our system of self-government. For the 
last 17 years, advocacy groups, good-government watchdogs, media 
organizations, and many Members of this body have joined forces to 
observe the importance of transparency in government and freedom of 
information. As a longtime champion for open, accessible government, I 
speak today in support of what we all ought to consider enduring 
principles.
  Sunshine Week coincides each year with March 16. That is the day one 
of our Nation's Founding Fathers and fourth President of the United 
States James Madison was born. Madison is widely known as the father of 
the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. From his writings, 
particularly in the Federalist Papers, you might say he was the 
architect who framed our system of checks and balances. Madison 
believed all powers of the government are derived of, by, and for the 
people, and that is what brings me to the floor today.
  The public has a right to know what their government is doing and how 
it is spending tax dollars. There are very few things in government 
that should be kept secret: national security, so we don't tell our 
enemies what we are going to do; the privacy of American citizens; and 
some intelligence-gathering information. I will bet that is 1 percent 
of everything the government is involved in. Yet there are some people 
who think that a lot more ought to be classified or secret, et cetera, 
et cetera.
  So we have the Freedom of Information Act that is to protect the 
public's right to know. Through Freedom of Information Act requests, 
everyday Americans can ask a Federal Agency for information. 
Unfortunately, now--and it is a growing problem--Federal Agencies seem 
to have the unstated goal of releasing as little information as 
possible to the public.
  Agencies rely on exemptions to FOIA, the Freedom of Information Act, 
to withhold information. A 2021 Government Accountability Office study 
found this: that Federal Agencies use FOIA exemptions to avoid 
disclosing documents. That problem has doubled between 2012 and 2019.
  Most Americans may not be familiar with the section of the code that 
we call the (b)(3) FOIA exemption, and, of course, they don't have to 
be aware of this, but they should know that it is the most used 
justification by the Federal Government to withhold information from 
the public.
  The increase in the use of this FOIA exemption to withhold 
information from the public is unacceptable to me, and it ought to be 
unacceptable to anybody who believes that we should not have secrecy in 
government.
  In another recent report, the Government Accountability Office found 
that FOIA request backlogs increased by nearly 20 percent in just the 1 
year of 2019 to 2020. In fact, backlogged FOIA requests are up 97 
percent since 2012. Sixteen Federal Agencies had more than 1,000 
backlogged FOIA requests. They account for 94 percent of backlogged 
requests across the entire government.
  Federal Agencies ought to do better--must do better--and we must all 
work to ensure that they are responding appropriately and within a 
reasonable time for FOIA requests.
  Congressional oversight is part of our constitutional assignment: to 
protect the power of the purse and ensure laws are faithfully enforced.
  Finally, we must acknowledge the important role that citizens play 
who bravely come forward, often at great professional risk, to report 
wrongdoing in our efforts to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. I have 
often said that whistleblowers are the best line of defense against 
government waste. No one shines a brighter light on waste, fraud, and 
abuse than whistleblowers. And why might that be? Because they are down 
in the bowels of the government where maybe the heads of the Agencies 
don't know something wrong is going on, and they are able to point it 
out--the whistleblowers are.
  That is why I introduced legislation this Congress to strengthen the 
False Claims Act. I got the False Claims Act passed in 1986. Since 
then, that act has helped government recover $70 billion in fraud.
  Last year, I asked the Department of Veterans Affairs about 
allegations that VA employees leaked potentially market-sensitive 
information, and then do you know what they did? They retaliated 
against these whistleblowers. Nearly 1 year later, I haven't received 
any answers, and I assume I am not going to receive any answers because 
it is an embarrassment to the VA.
  As a cofounder and cochairman of the Whistleblower Protection Caucus, 
I lead efforts from Capitol Hill to strengthen protections and raise 
awareness for what often is an uphill battle for whistleblowers.
  I want you to know how I feel whistleblowers are treated by their 
very own government, how they are treated just because they want the 
government to do what the government is supposed to be doing under the 
laws, and they want the money spent the way Congress intends for the 
money to be spent. These whistleblowers who point out that wrongdoing 
are treated by the bureaucracy like skunks at a picnic.
  This U.S. Senator will continue shining spotlight on waste, fraud, 
and abuse at the Pentagon, and I am going to do it elsewhere, as well. 
I will continue advocating for whistleblowers with every tool at my 
disposal.
  And as an Iowa farmer, I know why farmers make hay when the sun 
shines, and that is a good lesson for good government. Sunshine helps 
hold government accountable to the people.
  Let me repeat that again: Transparency brings accountability.


                 EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022

  Madam President, I have another point I would like to make. We were 
able to pass something with the Omnibus appropriations bill that I have 
been working on in a bipartisan way for years. It was a program that 
was abused, and we finally got together--Senator Leahy and I--to 
finally win what we have been trying to do for years.
  So I am here to speak about reforms to the EB-5 investor visa program 
that were included in last week's Omnibus bill. I also addressed this 
issue before the vote, but I would like to follow up on that statement 
with some brief remarks about how important this is after years of 
fighting to get it done.
  First, this wouldn't have been done without working with my friend 
and colleague Senator Leahy. So I thank him. He worked with me for 
several years on reforming this EB-5 program. Senator Leahy, as well as 
his staff, have put in a great deal of time and work on a number of 
legislative efforts to reform the EB-5 program. I appreciate the 
partnership that we had on this issue for those many years.
  As I mentioned in my previous statement on the day the bill passed, 
Congress originally authorized the EB-5 Regional Center Program in 1992 
as a pilot program and as an outgrowth of the EB-5 investor visa that 
was created by Congress 2 years before that, in 1990.
  When the EB-5 visa and regional center programs were established, 
Congress intended for them to spur investment in, No. 1, rural areas, 
and, No. 2, in economically depressed areas. I emphasize rural and 
economically depressed areas because this whole program, over a period 
of the next 20 years, evolved into a program far removed from the 
original goals. Senator Leahy and I recognized that 5 or 6 years ago. 
But to get around all of the interest groups that have something to do 
with the EB-5 program, and particularly those who are enriching 
themselves from it, it is hard to get changes made here in the Congress 
of the United States.
  Thank God we were fortunate not to get the EB-5 program extended from 
year to year because that is what happened for 4 or 5 years as we were 
working on these reforms. You just extended it and let the fraud and 
abuse of the law go on. But, finally, about a year ago, we kept that 
program from being extended year to year and forced people to sit down 
and talk to us in a responsible way to get to where we are today.
  It is unfortunate that the EB-5 Regional Center Program, in 
particular, has been plagued with all this fraud and abuse. Rampant and 
abusive gerrymandering of the EB-5 program's targeted employment areas 
also undermined congressional intent that lower investment thresholds 
be a tool for channeling investment into areas that truly need it. 
Those are the rural areas and the economically depressed areas

[[Page S1205]]

of our country. Gerrymandering undermined the whole purpose of the 
program.
  Another problem that the reforms addressed was that EB-5 investment 
levels had not been adjusted by Congress since 1990, and they should 
have been adjusted for the inflation that has taken place since then, 
and our act does make some adjustment in that area. It doesn't quite 
make up for all the inflation we have had since 1990, but it is still 
better than if we had gone with those 1990 figures.
  The EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022, which was included in the 
Omnibus bill, will address a number of these issues. The bill, which 
Senator Leahy and I primarily authored, formally repeals the pilot 
program created by Congress in 1992 and codifies in its place a new 
Regional Center Program reflecting a number of reforms that we pursued 
for many years. These reforms will help to crack down on fraud and 
abuse that have plagued the program for far too many years.
  As I said in my previous statement, all EB-5 regional centers that 
had operated under the lapsed and repealed pilot program will be 
expected to seek a new regional center designation. In that process, 
they will have to certify compliance with all the relevant requirements 
and reforms laid out in our bill, now law, in order to receive such a 
designation.
  Additionally, for the first time since 1990, the bill statutorily 
raises EB-5 investment levels and mandates that they be adjusted for 
inflation every 5 years so we don't have what has happened in the last 
30 years using 1990 figures for investment.
  The legislation also codifies certain aspects of the 2019 EB-5 
Immigrant Investor Program modernization rule. Specifically, the bill 
codifies the 2019 rule's definition of a ``high unemployment'' targeted 
employment area and allows only the Department of Homeland Security to 
make such a designation.
  The so-called ``doughnut'' targeted employment area model from the 
2019 rule will significantly limit the number of census tracts that may 
be used to seek designation as a high unemployment area.

  This targeted employment area model, combined with exclusive 
authority of the Department of Homeland Security to make ``high 
unemployment'' targeted employment area designations, should then crack 
down on the targeted employment area gerrymandering, which 
gerrymandering has long deprived the rural and the economically 
distressed areas of the investment that Congress intended when Congress 
passed that legislation--now, I guess, 30 years ago.
  Listen to this next point. I want the Department of Homeland Security 
to pay attention to this. It is also my belief and expectation that the 
Department of Homeland Security should reserve ``high unemployment'' 
targeted employment area designations for census tracts that have 
experienced persistently high unemployment for a number of years rather 
than just brief spikes in unemployment due to temporary and 
extraordinary circumstances, such as what you could have because of the 
COVID-19 pandemic, as just one example.
  Finally, the legislation puts in place specific visa set-asides for 
rural area projects, high unemployment area projects, and 
infrastructure projects. The visa set-aside for infrastructure projects 
is limited to true public infrastructure projects; that is, in further 
explanation, those that benefit the public and the American people, not 
public-private partnerships or projects for private businesses.
  I will continue to monitor the implementation of this bill, as well 
as developments in the EB-5 program over coming months and years.
  This bill was titled the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022. It is 
the result of years of hard work, and I hope it brings real reform to a 
program badly in need of that reform. I am grateful that it was 
included in the Omnibus bill and was happy, after all of these years, 
to see meaningful reform of the EB-5 program finally signed into law.
  I yield the floor.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

                               Inflation

  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, on Thursday, the February inflation 
numbers were released, and the news wasn't pretty. Inflation for 
February was 7.9 percent, the highest inflation since January of 1982--
January of 1982, 40 years ago. We are in the grip of the worst 
inflation in 40 years.
  American families have been hit hard by this crisis as the price of 
everyday necessities has soared, and energy prices, particularly gas 
prices, are one of the top challenges facing Americans. Energy prices 
are up 25 percent on average from a year ago. Electricity is up 9 
percent. Propane, kerosene, and fire wood are up 19 percent. Utility 
gas services are up 23 percent, and prices at the pump for gasoline are 
up 38 percent.
  The national average for a gallon of gas was $4.31 on Tuesday, up 
from $2.86 a year ago. That is $1.45 more per gallon. That is a big 
problem for American families. That is a big problem for our entire 
economy.
  High energy prices don't just have an impact when Americans fill up 
their cars; they affect prices across the economy. High energy prices 
drive up the cost of operating a factory. They drive up the cost of raw 
materials, and they drive up the cost of getting goods to customers.
  President Biden would like to blame the inflation situation, 
particularly high energy prices, on Vladimir Putin. I don't need to 
tell anyone how ludicrous that is. Our inflation crisis has been going 
on for a year. Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine 3 weeks ago. I am afraid 
passing the buck to Putin doesn't hold water.
  Now, it is true that the uncertainty surrounding Putin's war and 
corresponding sanctions on Russia are partly to blame for the most 
recent spike in gas prices. But had gas prices been lower to start 
with, Americans wouldn't be feeling the sanctions-triggered bump to the 
extent that they are.
  Democrats' American Rescue Plan spending spree helped create our 
inflation crisis. Americans need to look no further than the White 
House when wondering how the United States, a recent net exporter of 
energy, is not on stronger footing to weather these tumultuous times.
  The President has pursued an energy agenda that has done next to 
nothing to help drive energy prices down and is, in fact, almost 
guaranteed to increase energy prices long term and increase our 
reliance on foreign sources of oil.
  From the moment he took office, the President sent a negative signal 
to energy producers by making it clear that his administration was not 
going to be embracing conventional energy production.
  He set the tone for his administration on day 1 by canceling the 
Keystone XL Pipeline--an environmentally responsible pipeline project 
that was already underway and that was to be paired with $1.7 billion 
in private investment and renewable energy to fully offset its 
operating emissions.
  He also almost immediately froze new oil and gas leases on Federal 
lands, sending a clear signal to oil and gas producers that his 
administration would be reluctant to work with them to increase 
American energy production.
  Now, President Biden has recently been touting the number of 
available permits for oil and gas development, which is positive as far 
as it goes, but new permits have dropped precipitously this year. And 
issuing permits alone isn't enough to get development going.
  The Biden administration has thrown up roadblock after roadblock to 
actual energy development. Companies are struggling to break through 
regulatory redtape to actually get oil and gas development up and 
running. For example, they have struggled to obtain right of way to 
build essential development infrastructure, like access roads to oil 
rig sites. They are also struggling to get timely pipeline permits to 
transport the oil and gas that they extract.
  Unfortunately, they know exactly how this administration feels about 
building pipelines. And the Biden administration is fully responsible 
for

[[Page S1206]]

these problems. The administration has the ability to immediately take 
action to expedite American oil and gas development by clearing away 
the redtape that companies are facing.
  It is refusing to do so. Instead, President Biden seems ready to 
increase our reliance on energy imports from despotic governments in 
volatile areas of the world. That is not acceptable. Energy 
independence, relying on homegrown production instead of foreign energy 
sources, is key for a number of reasons.
  For starters, energy security is national security. The more we rely 
on imports from other countries, the more that we are dependent on 
those countries. We have seen that during the current conflict in 
Ukraine. European companies like Germany have been unable to divest 
from Russian energy because they rely on that production.
  Without Russian energy, more than one country in Europe would face a 
dire energy shortage--as Putin is well aware. We don't want to give 
another country that much power over us.
  Energy independence, and the robust energy production that comes with 
it, also reduces the risk to Americans from price hikes in the global 
market. The more oil and gas the United States produces as a share of 
the global market, the more we are able to influence global supply, 
which is the leading driver of cost.
  The Biden administration has not been good for American energy 
independence. We have increased our reliance on foreign sources of 
energy during this administration, including our reliance on Russian 
energy production.
  And now that we have banned Russian energy imports, President Biden 
seems ready to replace Russian energy, not with increased American 
production but with oil and gas from human rights-challenged countries 
like Venezuela.
  I realize that President Biden and many Democrats would like to see 
the United States focus solely on alternative energy production, but 
the fact of the matter is that we are a long way from being able to 
rely exclusively on alternative energy technologies. Whether Democrats 
like it or not, our country is going to need oil and natural gas for 
quite a while yet, and all of Democrats' wishful thinking isn't going 
to change that.
  The answer is not to get that oil and natural gas from despots in 
volatile areas of the world but to get it from American energy 
production.
  President Biden and his administration may not be solely to blame for 
high gas prices, but they have the power. They have the power to help 
lower energy prices by unleashing American energy production--all of 
it, both alternative and conventional--and they are responsible for 
their failure to do so.
  We need an ``all of the above'' energy policy that embraces 
everything from oil and gas to hydroelectric and nuclear, to solar and 
wind. And when it comes to alternative energy production, we need to 
invest in all proven clean energy technologies, not just the 
administration's preferred technologies like electric vehicles. The 
administration has neglected important clean energy technologies like 
biofuels, which have demonstrated significant emissions reductions 
versus conventional gasoline.
  As a resident of a rural state, I would like to see the 
administration get serious about leveraging agriculture as an energy 
solution and work to expand biofuel production and consumption. This 
means not only setting robust blending targets and rejecting specious 
small refinery exemptions but approving advanced fuels from corn kernel 
fiber and restoring the year-round sale of E15.
  Last week, I led a letter to the President with the Democratic whip 
and colleagues from both parties urging the President to enable E15 to 
be sold during the upcoming travel season to provide Americans with a 
lower cost fuel that would help displace Russian oil.
  Yesterday, the President's Press Secretary said that ``E15 was on the 
menu.'' Well, it deserves real consideration. American drivers can't 
afford for the President not to take action. The President could get us 
on a path to lower energy prices today--today--by announcing that his 
administration will get serious about expediting American production of 
oil and natural gas. If he fails to do so, then he really will be 
responsible for the prices that Americans are facing at the pump and 
for the hit that our national security will take from our increasing 
reliance on foreign sources of energy.
  I hope the President will decide to unleash American production and 
put our Nation on a path to long-term energy independence.
  I yield the floor.

             Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar

  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today to seek unanimous consent 
to confirm four nominees to posts that are critical--critical--to our 
response to Putin's war against Ukraine.
  Through smoke and rubble and artillery fire, Ukrainians are leaving 
their homes with nothing more than a backpack, nothing more than their 
children in their hands.
  Over the past 20 days, Vladimir Putin's illegal and horrific assault 
on Ukraine has led more than 3 million refugees to flee into 
neighboring countries. Those who remain are suffering from a dire and 
deteriorating humanitarian situation.
  With Putin's army blocking aid convoys, millions of Ukrainians are 
facing lack of water, food, and heat. Meanwhile, Putin orders 
unprovoked, unjustified attacks on civilians--shelling apartment 
buildings, bombing maternity hospitals, and destroying kindergartens, 
committing atrocities throughout the country.
  The United States and the world have a duty to exact costs on Putin, 
to demand accountability for war crimes, and to provide aid for the 
millions of innocent Ukrainians who are suffering. If we want to rise 
to this challenge, if we want to respond to the mounting human 
suffering, one thing is clear: We need to have the people in place--the 
people the President has selected--to lead and carry out this work. 
Their leadership is critical in our response to the growing crisis in 
Ukraine and the looming refugee crisis across Eastern Europe. They will 
fight to defend human rights when they are violated. They will fight to 
defend democracy when it is attacked. They will make sure we maximize 
the pain and the price Putin pays for this heinous war.

                     Nomination of James C. O'Brien

  Mr. President, that is why we must confirm Jim O'Brien. He is the 
President's nominee for Coordinator for Sanctions. This is our most 
significant tool against Putin and his regime--sanctions. He is the 
President's nominee for Coordinator for Sanctions. Once confirmed, he 
will enhance the Biden administration's efforts with our allies and 
partners to impose devastating costs on Russia.
  To date, more than 30 nations have joined this cause. Countries have 
stepped up that we never would have expected. But the fight is not 
over. We have to keep up the pressure. We must keep up coordination. 
And we must ensure that we are implementing and enforcing sanctions in 
concert with dozens of countries around the globe.
  Now, I know my Republican colleagues agree that this must be a top 
priority. I have heard it on the Foreign Relations Committee: We need 
to do more sanctions. I have heard it on the Senate floor. I have heard 
it in the conversations with my colleagues: We need to do even more. I 
know they want our sanctions to be as effective as possible, so to 
them, I say: Confirm Jim O'Brien today.

                   Nomination of Julieta Valls Noyes

  Mr. President, now I can also give you 3 million reasons why we must 
confirm Julieta Valls Noyes, the nominee to be the Assistant Secretary 
for the Bureau for Population, Refugees, and Migration--because 3 
million people have already fled their homes in Ukraine; 3 million 
people have left a war-torn country with their dreams shattered, their 
children traumatized--3 million people who have no idea what the future 
holds. Even as I speak, that number has surely been surpassed.
  There is a reason we have the Population, Refugees, and Migration 
Bureau. There is a reason the President selects a qualified nominee to 
lead it. Ms. Noyes is that person. It is a travesty that Ms. Noyes's 
nomination has been languishing on the Senate floor for 148 days 
because of Republican holds.
  We need a Senate-confirmed leader in place to take charge of the U.S. 
response to the refugee crisis forming in Europe, as well as the crises 
that already exist around the world. We need someone to work alongside 
our European allies as they face the fastest growing refugee crisis in 
Europe since World War II. We need her confirmed today--not tomorrow, 
not next week, today.

                   Nomination of Erin Elizabeth McKee

  Mr. President, the humanitarian crisis inside Ukraine is worsening 
every day. We can all see it for ourselves. You can see the images of 
Mariupol, where more than 200,000 civilians remain under siege, cut off 
from food, fighting for their lives. You can see the frightened faces 
of children crossing the border into Poland, carrying only a teddy bear 
and a change of clothes. This is a trauma they will struggle with for 
the rest of their lives.
  So it baffles me that we would wait another hour, let alone another 
day, to

[[Page S1208]]

even think about confirming Ambassador Erin McKee as the Assistant 
Secretary for Europe and Eurasia at USAID. The minute she gets in the 
door, the minute we send her to USAID, she will get to work on behalf 
of the millions of Ukrainians who are suffering. She will make sure 
that we are meeting basic needs and that we are helping Ukraine's 
neighbors shoulder the burden of the crisis. Let her get to work. Let 
her help the people of Ukraine today.

                     Nomination of C.S. Eliot Kang

  Mr. President, finally, there is a danger that Putin will unleash a 
chemical weapons attack against Ukraine. The Bureau of International 
Security and Nonproliferation has a crucial role to play here, not just 
to prevent the spread of chemical weapons but to help safeguard all 
nuclear materials and facilities in Ukraine. To do this, the nominee to 
be Assistant Secretary for that Bureau--International Security and 
Nonproliferation--Dr. Eliot Kang, would work with the Ukrainian 
Government, our allies, and the International Atomic Energy Agency. But 
because of Republican delays, he has not yet been confirmed, despite 
the fact that he was nominated 328 days ago--328 days ago. Think about 
that. That was almost a year ago, and he has not yet been confirmed.
  Because we cannot wait, because the people of Ukraine cannot wait, I 
rise to seek unanimous consent for the confirmation of these four 
nominees. Each of them moved through the Foreign Relations Committee 
with bipartisan support. There is no reason for Republicans to block 
their confirmation. The situation in Ukraine is dire, and our national 
security demands it.
  Because of that, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate consider the 
following nominations en bloc: Calendar Nos. 462, 783, and 784; that 
the Senate vote on the nominations en bloc without intervening action 
or debate; that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid 
upon the table with no intervening action or debate; that any 
statements related to the nominations be printed in the Record; and 
that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?
  The Senator from Florida.
  Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, 
the Biden administration has failed to properly oversee the Pan 
American Health Organization, or PAHO. President Biden and Secretary 
Blinken know that PAHO has cooperated with the communist regime in Cuba 
to traffic doctors overseas, and they know that there are Cuban doctors 
who are trying to sue PAHO and hold their traffickers accountable.
  Here are the facts: In July 2013, the Cuban Ministry of Health signed 
an agreement with the Brazilian Ministry of Health to formalize an 
arrangement for Cuban doctors to provide medical services in Brazil. 
That agreement required the administration of former Brazilian 
President Dilma Rousseff to transmit a monthly payment through PAHO to 
the Cuban Ministry of Health for the medical services provided by each 
Cuban doctor serving in Brazil. It also prevented Cuban doctors from 
seeking employment in Brazil outside of the formal structure of the 
agreement.
  More than 20,000 Cuban medical professionals serving in Brazil under 
the Mais Medicos Program had their wages stolen by the Cuban Government 
and received only a small fraction of what they earned. Their family 
members were prohibited from accompanying them, and many had their 
passports confiscated.
  Cuban doctors were the only medical professionals participating in 
the Mais Medicos Program who had their salaries directly garnished by 
their government. Meanwhile, doctors from other countries serving in 
Brazil received the full wages for their medical services.
  Other Cuban doctors suffered similar abuses in Angola, Guatemala, 
Mexico, Qatar, and Venezuela. For example, in 2019, a group of Cuban 
doctors reported that they had been directed and often coerced to use 
their medical services to influence votes in favor of the Maduro 
regime, including by denying medical treatment to opposition supporters 
and by giving precise voting instructions to elderly patients.
  This gross program is a huge moneymaker for the communist ruling 
thugs in Cuba. In 2018 alone, they deposited more than $6.3 billion 
from exporting Cuban professionals to work overseas, and medical 
missions by Cuban doctors represent a majority of those profits.
  Since I came to the Senate in 2019, I have been fighting for these 
Cuban doctors and against human trafficking. I know my colleague from 
New Jersey has also voiced concerns about this issue in the past, but 
nothing has been done to hold PAHO accountable. PAHO is hiding behind 
legal immunity. President Biden has the power to lift their immunity, 
and I have requested this administration to do so multiple times, but 
they have shamefully declined.
  It is wrong. Victims of trafficking deserve to see their alleged 
abusers in court, and PAHO should never be able to hide behind claims 
of immunity to avoid accountability for their role in facilitating 
those abuses.
  I have informed Secretary Blinken that until substantial steps toward 
fulfilling this request are made, I will be blocking all relevant State 
Department nominees.
  Americans deserve qualified and competent people in positions of 
power who put American interests first. If this administration wants to 
appease dictators, like they have with the Castro and Diaz-Canal 
regimes, I am going to hold them accountable.
  Therefore, Madam President, I object.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Smith). Objection is heard.
  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I would like to ask the Senator from 
Florida, through the Chair, does the Assistant Administrator for Europe 
and Eurasia at USAID have anything to do with PAHO?
  Does the Assistant Secretary for International Security and 
Nonproliferation have anything to do with PAHO?
  I guess the Senator doesn't want to engage in a colloquy.
  Madam President, it is amazing to me. My colleagues who get up and 
applaud Zelenskyy, my colleagues who come to the Senate floor and talk 
about both the need to help Ukraine and the humanitarian realities that 
are compounding every day--and yet here we are with four pertinent, key 
positions that could help in regard to each and every one of those 
elements, and on some unrelated issue, not Ukraine, not even Europe, 
not about proliferation, not about humanitarian response, no, there is 
a wholesale objection.
  Now, if you wanted to pick your objection and target it, that might 
make sense, but I am deeply troubled that the junior Senator from 
Florida is once again obstructing the Senate's responsibility to 
provide advice and consent on Presidential nominations, not only 
preventing us from fulfilling our constitutional duties, but in this 
case, moreover, he is singlehandedly undermining the ability of the 
U.S. Government to respond fully to Russia's brutal invasion. In doing 
so, he seeks to singlehandedly damage our ability to ensure a 
coordinated international effort to sanction Putin, his cronies, 
sectors of the Russian Government.
  He is undercutting the U.S. Government's ability to support the 
Ukrainian people and our allies. He is undercutting our ability to 
provide and coordinate the humanitarian assistance for 3 million 
Ukrainians who have left and millions more who are inside the country 
and need help. It is mind-boggling--mind boggling. Get up, (applauds) 
and then come to the floor and object to the very things that can make 
it happen. Mind-boggling.
  Now, let me address the issue that the junior Senator from Florida 
has raised here today--the Cuban regime's trafficking of doctors and 
medical personnel. Simply put, the Diaz-Canel regime, like the Castro 
regime before it, does subject Cuban doctors to forced labor schemes 
abroad while pocketing the doctors' wages in profit-making schemes that 
generate billions of dollars annually.
  Now, I have been working on this issue since before my colleague ever 
held public office. I have engaged multiple administrations on this 
issue. I have actually authored legislation and resolutions on the 
subject. So my track record for standing up for Cuban doctors who are 
trafficked by the Cuban regime eclipses that of any other Member of 
Congress, period. But, my God, as passionate as I am about that issue--
no one would be more passionate

[[Page S1209]]

than me--it is not right to hold up everything we are trying to do on 
Ukraine.
  This is a global emergency. The fate of not only Ukraine but of 
democracy and its ability to achieve victory is under threat. And here 
we have objections to critical positions that can help us make sure 
that we win in that battle.

             Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar

  Madam President, let me try one other thing. I want to make in order 
the same request that I previously made with respect to Calendar No. 
788, Erin Elizabeth McKee, to be an Assistant Administrator of the 
United States Agency for International Development.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?
  The Senator from Kansas.
  Mr. MARSHALL. Madam President, I object.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.
  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, so here we go. The person who would be 
responsible for helping the humanitarian challenge in Ukraine and in 
the surrounding countries where 3 million people have fled to, we can't 
get her in position--can't get her into a position to do the job to 
help millions of Ukrainians who are fleeing.
  I don't understand how the party of Reagan, the party of freedom and 
democracy, the party of standing up to these people can actually create 
a set of circumstances where this is like helping Putin at the end of 
the day. It is like helping Putin at the end of the day.
  Now, while Senator Marshall didn't speak to it, I understand his 
concerns are about COVID origins. Well, there is nothing wrong with 
that. It has been a lively topic of discussion in many forums, 
including the Senate. But these things have nothing to do with what 
Ambassador McKee is nominated for: Assistant Administrator for Europe 
and Eurasia.
  All of us, including Senator Marshall, know that we need to do 
everything possible to support Ukrainians in their time of need. 
Blocking Ambassador McKee is self-defeating.
  It is also not clear to me what more USAID can do to satisfy Senator 
Marshall. I have inquired because I heard this was the issue. USAID has 
been engaged at the most senior levels in trying to be helpful and 
responsive to Senator Marshall. They offered him and his team 
briefings, and I understand that none of those offers have been 
accepted. They have also pointed Senator Marshall's office to a wealth 
of information on specific USAID projects of interest.
  So I would urge the Senator, instead of blocking nominees, to act on 
USAID's multiple briefing offers and engage them meaningfully. That 
would be more helpful to his ultimate goal--but not to be helping 
Putin, at the end of the day, by not being able to take care of the 
humanitarian needs of the Ukrainians.
  I have seen a lot over my course of 40 years in public service and 30 
years in the Congress. I just--this is mind-boggling. But more than 
that, it really undermines our national security. It really undermines 
our help with the Ukrainian people. And so I hope that some saner minds 
will prevail in the days ahead when I come back to the floor to try 
this once again.
  With that, I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.

                                Ukraine

  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I am joined on the floor today by my 
friend and colleague Senator Graham. We have the honor of coleading the 
U.S. congressional delegation to the Munich Security Conference, which 
for a great number of reasons, all well-deserved, is still called CODEL 
McCain. It is the only codel that is named for a Senator who is no 
longer with us, and it is out of respect for Senator McCain's long 
tradition of support for that conference, NATO, and the Atlantic 
alliance, more generally.
  This year, obviously things were very different. The Russians were on 
the border of Ukraine, and two things came out of this conference that 
I thought were important. One was an early flicker of hope within the 
delegation that the Ukrainians might actually pull this off. That was 
supported by none of our briefings. The entire national security 
establishment had presumed that it was only a matter of time until 
Ukraine fell. But Senator Graham and I and others were questioning each 
other during that trip: Is there really no chance?

  And the other thing was going after the kleptocrats and the oligarchs 
around Putin and making their lives miserable. And there was just a 
wonderful explosion of bipartisan support for that that has now 
manifested in funds, in laws, in pending bills, in lots of 
bipartisanship--and Senator Graham and I are going to have a bit of a 
colloquy about that with the Chair's permission.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I will say one thing, and then I will hand it over to 
Senator Graham.
  On March 8, I sent out over social media this sentiment:

       Keep alive in your heart the possibility that Ukraine could 
     actually win: columns stalled, defense fierce, casualties 
     high, morale low, deserters surrendering, food and fuel 
     snafu, population uncowed.

  Since then, we are hearing more and more. I will read four quotes, 
and the first is from the man we heard from this morning, the President 
of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who, in his speech to the people of 
Ukraine on March 14, didn't just talk about peace for Ukraine--
although, he did talk about peace for Ukraine, but he also talked about 
``our victory.'' Victory. It is an important word to keep in mind.
  He is not alone.
  GEN Wesley Clark, also on March 14, said:

       The battle for Ukraine is hanging in the balance. . . . If 
     we can get enough in there, they'll push the Russians out.

  Victory.

       It would be a tremendous win for the West.

  Anne Applebaum knows probably about as much about this area as 
anyone. She joined us on the Munich security delegation, and she also 
spoke afterward on the 15th of March about it. She said:

       [V]ictory in this conflict--

  Victory--

       [V]ictory . . . would provide an enormous, transformational 
     boost in confidence to the entire democratic world.

  Michael Kofman, the director of Russian studies at the Center for 
Naval Analyses has said the same thing: ``Are [the Ukrainians] in a 
position to win the war? Yes,'' he said.
  I will close with Francis Fukuyama. On the 10th of March, the author 
of ``The Origins of Political Order'' said the following things. I am 
quoting from a longer piece selectively.

       1. Russia is heading for outright defeat in Ukraine.
       2. The collapse of their position could be sudden and 
     catastrophic, rather than happening slowly through a war of 
     attrition. The army in the field will reach a point where it 
     can neither be supplied nor withdrawn, and morale will 
     vaporize.
       5. The Biden administration's decisions not to declare a 
     no-fly zone or help transfer Polish MiGs were both good ones; 
     they've kept their heads during a very emotional time. It is 
     much better to have the Ukrainians defeat the Russians on 
     their own, depriving Moscow of the excuse that NATO attacked 
     them.

  Finally, he said:

       A Russian defeat will make possible a ``new birth of 
     freedom,'' and get us out of our funk about the declining 
     state of global democracy. The spirit of 1989 will live on, 
     thanks to . . . brave Ukrainians.

  We are here together on the floor in bipartisan fashion to urge that 
in the press coverage and in our national security conversations about 
this, we keep open in our hearts and in our planning the possibility of 
victory for Ukraine.
  Senator Graham.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.
  Mr. GRAHAM. Well, thank you. All I can say is, Sheldon, thank you.
  John is no longer with us, but I think he is here in spirit at this 
moment. If Senator McCain were here, there would be 27 MiGs they would 
want to transfer because he would probably be in one, headed for 
Ukraine.
  The bottom line is, 20 days into this fight, we are all amazed at how 
bad the Russians are doing and how well the Ukrainians are doing. And I 
think what Senator Whitehouse is trying to remind us all of is that the 
outcome of Ukraine really does matter to the world at large.
  Senator McCain was known for his support of the transatlantic 
alliance, a

[[Page S1210]]

rules-based society, a values-based world, and Putin has put that in 
jeopardy.
  So let's look at it this way. If Putin wins, Sheldon, then the 
largest war criminal in the 21st century survives the dismemberment of 
a neighboring democracy, slaughter of the innocents on a mass scale. If 
he is still standing, I think China understands what to do with Taiwan 
more clearly; the Iranians are more bold when it comes to their nuclear 
ambitions; and the ripple effect in Asia and the Middle East will be 
felt if Putin wins.
  Now, if Putin loses and Ukraine wins--victory for Ukraine--I think it 
would be the biggest change for the good since World War II. What would 
it mean? It would mean that a murderous war criminal who tried to use 
force of arms to impose his will on his neighbor lost. It would mean 
that the good guys won and the bad guys lost, and China would have to 
think twice about Taiwan.
  How do we make sure victory for Ukraine is maximized? Only God knows 
how this ends, but here is what I think we can do in working together, 
with three lines of effort:
  Economic and military aid. We have had a very robust package leave 
the Congress. The President announced $800 million more in military aid 
today. We have a difference about the MiGs, but otherwise we are pretty 
much on the same sheet of music.
  Sanctions against Russia. The war is not against the Russian people. 
They are in many ways victims of Putin as much as anybody. 
Unfortunately, the only way we can bring this to a conclusion and have 
victory for Ukraine is to crush the Russian economy, so secondary 
sanctions need to be on the table. Then, if China comes to Putin's aid, 
they need to understand the consequences of that decision.
  So we are all in on sanctions, and secondary sanctions are now in 
play. The Ukrainian Ambassador asked me yesterday to broaden the 
sanctions to Russian officials in different regions that are part of 
Putin's war machine. President Zelenskyy asked for that today, too.
  My good friend Sheldon Whitehouse has been speaking about victory 
when nobody else hardly will, and I am here to say that victory for 
Ukraine is victory for America; it is victory for the rule of law; and 
it is victory for the post-World War II order that has led to historic 
prosperity.
  Three lines of effort: military assistance, including MiGs; economic 
aid--fuel, food, humanitarian airlift if that is feasible; crushing 
sanctions; labeling Putin the war criminal that he is; and letting 
every Russian military commander know that, if you pick his side and 
you carry out these war crimes against the Ukrainian people, we are 
coming after you.
  Senator Whitehouse and myself met with the British Foreign Secretary 
and Ambassador to create a joint effort, an intel cell, to collect 
information about Russian units engaged in war crimes in Ukraine and 
start putting the commander's name out for the world to understand so 
they will know that we are watching them.
  How does this end? The Russian people end the reign of terror in 
Putin. It is in their hands. I encourage them to do it.
  Finally, if there has been one voice on kleptocracy, it is Sheldon's. 
He has got it on climate change. He is determined to see that issue 
through to the end, but Senator Whitehouse was talking about 
kleptocracy long before the invasion. So we are introducing together 
the Asset Seizure for Ukraine Reconstruction Act, which is an effort by 
our government, joining with international partners, to get every yacht 
we can get, raid every bank account we can find, take the money away 
from the thieves, and give it back to the Ukrainian people and 
eventually to the Russian people.
  What Senator Whitehouse and I are trying to do in a bipartisan 
fashion is to make the war real to the oligarchs. Without the 
oligarchs, there is no Putin. It is time for them to enjoy the 
experience of having their assets that they stole taken away from them. 
``Enjoy'' is maybe not the right word. It is time for us to enjoy the 
sight of Russian oligarchs having their property taken that they 
achieved through thievery. It is time for us to start putting people in 
jail who engaged in the mass theft of the Russian people.
  Victory for Ukraine is possible, I think, if we are all in on 
sanctions, if we are all in on labeling, naming, and shaming people 
around Putin as war criminals in order to break their will, and if we 
begin to pour it on when it comes to regaining control of the skies.
  I am not for a NATO no-fly zone because I think that would put us in 
a situation with NATO and Russia that I am not comfortable with right 
now, but I am for Ukraine controlling their skies, a no-fly zone 
enforced by the Ukrainian military. That is why I want more anti-
aircraft systems and the MiGs.
  The bottom line here is that victory for Ukraine is possible because 
I think the Russian people and the Russian military are really not into 
this. I think the world is coalescing around the idea that if Putin 
wins, it is bad for us all. Now is the time. This is the most 
historically significant moment since the end of World War II for the 
continent of Europe and for freedom itself and for the rule of law.
  If we can pull this off, then those who come after us will be very 
pleased with our efforts. If we fail, future generations will wonder 
``What the hell were you doing?'' just like we all wonder how Hitler 
could have gotten so strong and nobody stopped him when they could 
have.
  Let it be said in this moment of history that Senator Whitehouse, 
Senator Graham, and many others, particularly the Ukrainian people, 
believe not only is victory for Ukraine possible, it is absolutely 
necessary.
  With that, I turn it back over to my colleague.
  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, in conclusion, let me just thank 
Senator Graham. He has been an extraordinary leader on the Munich 
Security delegation year after year, and I think he has a ``McCainian'' 
view of our foreign policy needs.
  I would close by saying, if there is a lesson from Ukraine, it is 
that oligarchs can throw out a dictator if you put pressure on them. So 
the kleptocracy initiative is important strategically in Ukraine, and 
it also puts in motion forces that can diminish kleptocracy and 
corruption around the world in a way that enhances our rule of law and 
national security.
  The press has tended to buy into the narrative of defeat but not 
entirely.
  Sudarsan Raghavan went to the front for the Washington Post, and he 
reported back this:

       To be sure, most military analysts and Western officials 
     still predict that Russian forces will eventually encircle 
     Kyiv and push into the capital, possibly aided by airstrikes. 
     While this could prove true, it's far from clear whether 
     Russia will prevail.

  That leaves open the important planning option of victory for 
Ukraine.
  Then, when bad news comes, sometimes it is just not the whole story. 
The BBC reported the bad news that Russian forces were already inside 
the city of Irpin. Well, there is a little bit more to the story than 
that.
  A Ukrainian army officer said that Ukrainian forces were waiting for 
civilians to evacuate Irpin before ``we start to clear the city of 
Russians.''

       They don't have enough provisions--food, water. They don't 
     have a lot of gasoline. They will get tired, and then we will 
     go and drive them out.

  Well, it appears that that counteroffensive is underway right now, as 
we speak.
  As I close, I think all of our hearts and prayers go to the Ukrainian 
troops, who are trying to drive those Russians out of Irpin and out of 
Ukraine.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.


 Remembering Brent Renaud, Pierre Zakrzewski, and Oleksandra Kuvshynova

  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, over the course of just 3 days, the world 
lost three talented, tenacious journalists to Vladimir Putin's war 
crimes and brutal invasion of Ukraine.
  Brent Renaud was a Peabody Award-winning documentary filmmaker who 
was working to tell the stories of Putin's war when he was fatally shot 
in the Kyiv suburb of Irpin on Sunday.
  Then, on Monday, two more journalists with FOX News lost their lives 
when their vehicle came under fire just outside of Kyiv. A cameraman 
and veteran war reporter, Pierre Zakrzewski, was killed. He had been 
reporting in Ukraine since February.

[[Page S1211]]

  We also lost Ukrainian journalist Oleksandra ``Sasha'' Kuvshynova, 
who was serving as a consultant for FOX's team in Ukraine. She was just 
24 years old.
  Their colleague, correspondent Benjamin Hall, was also injured, and 
he remains in the hospital.
  Journalists know they face danger when they report from war zones. 
They put themselves in harm's way to tell the world the true stories 
that we need to hear.
  Today, the Presiding Officer from Minnesota joined me and dozens and 
dozens of others to see the video, the pictures, and the photos of the 
war in Ukraine, which were shown to us by President Zelenskyy. Those 
pictures--many of them--were taken by very courageous journalists who 
risked their own lives. They bring us the unvarnished truth, unfiltered 
by government propaganda, at the times when we need it most. They are 
committed to basic ideals of truth, accuracy, and transparency--so 
committed that they put their lives on the line to make sure the world 
knows what is happening. Their commitment to these ideals only makes 
their deaths that much more tragic.
  Today, three families and so many colleagues are grieving for these 
three journalists, grieving losses that cannot be replaced. They 
shouldn't have to.
  This war was started by a man with no regard for the freedom of the 
press or basic human rights; a man who is a former KGB agent and has 
open contempt and hostility toward real reporters, toward real 
journalism, toward free speech; a man who presides over a regime 
wherein journalists are killed with impunity.
  According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 28 journalists 
have been killed in Russia since Putin came to power 20 years ago, and 
10 are currently in prison simply for telling the truth, for doing 
their jobs. According to Reporters Without Borders, Russia ranks 150 
out of 199 countries for press freedom. They are actually behind 
Afghanistan and South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
  Last October, the United States and 18 other countries issued a 
statement, warning of ``the Russian government's intensifying 
harassment of independent journalists and media outlets in Russia.''
  In 2020, the Russian Government began labeling many outside 
journalists as ``media foreign agents''--a term reminiscent of the 
worst of the Cold War.
  It is not just foreign journalists; Putin's government has applied 
the ``media foreign agent'' label to independent Russian outlets in the 
country or to those operating near the country's border--Russian 
reporters themselves. It goes against all of our values. It is the kind 
of authoritarianism that the Ukrainian people bravely fight every day 
now. They don't want their country to turn into a place where reporters 
fear for their lives, where journalists can't tell the public the 
truth. Journalists' entire job is to ask questions, to challenge 
powerful interests, to--shall we say--afflict the comfortable.

  Reporters put their safety and--as we saw with these three brave 
journalists in Ukraine--their lives on the line, whether it is covering 
floods and hurricanes in the United States or traveling the globe to 
bring us the stories of war zones.
  We depend on reporters in my State and around the world to bring us 
the stories that impact our day-to-day lives and tell the stories that 
might not otherwise be told. They are too often under attack overseas 
increasingly. We recently had a President of the United States who 
attacked journalists in almost every stop.
  As we all stand with the people of Ukraine, let's recommit ourselves 
to fighting just as hard as they are for our values, for freedom of the 
press, for free speech. These three journalists made the ultimate 
sacrifice to show the world the heroism of the Ukrainian people. We 
pray that they are the last who have to do that.
  We recognize that President Putin has been shocked by two things: 
shocked by the heroism of the Ukrainian people--those fighting back, 
those brave journalists, those freedom fighters, those mothers and 
fathers and children who have so courageously stood up against Russia; 
he is also shocked by the way President Biden so effectively has put 
together an international coalition, not just for the countries you 
would expect, but Germany, and Finland, and Sweden, and Switzerland--
countries that have rarely chosen sides and stepped up the way that all 
of our countries have.
  And while doing this, we send our sympathy and our gratitude to the 
families of Brent Renaud, to Pierre Zakrzewski, to Oleksandra 
Kuvshynova. They died doing the vital heroic work they love. We have a 
better understanding of this invasion, of the war crimes being 
committed, of how it is affecting people's lives. We have a better 
understanding because of journalists like them, and we thank them from 
the bottom of our hearts.

                        Remembering Fred Abdalla

  Madam President, I would like to remember an Ohio public servant whom 
we lost this year, longtime friend of mine, Jefferson County Sheriff--
Eastern Ohio, along the Pennsylvania-West Virginia line, along the Ohio 
River--Jefferson County Sheriff Fred Abdalla.
  He took office in January 1985. He served his community ever since 
for nearly four decades, in his sheriff's car, going up and down the 
river, going to Mingo Junction and Tiltonsville to Steubenville, to 
Wintersville--all over Jefferson County. He served that community.
  His colleagues and his neighbors called him tough but big-hearted. He 
was particularly passionate about solving crimes against children and 
seniors.
  His chief deputy, Susan Bell, worked with Sheriff Abdalla for 32 
years. She said:

       He and I had a lot of cases together. He laughed a lot. . . 
     . We cried a lot. . . . We worked as a team.

  His colleagues at the department posted a moving remembrance of 
Jefferson County Sheriff Fred Abdalla. They wrote:

       Although we miss you dearly, we will carry on as you've 
     taught us to do in the face of adversity. One of the last 
     ``working sheriffs,'' you were always involved and answered 
     calls with your staff. You led by example. [You] never 
     ordered a deputy to do something you would not do yourself.

  Our thoughts are with his family, with the people of Jefferson 
County. His passing is a real loss for my State, for all who knew him. 
His dedication to his community will not be forgotten.
  Rest in peace, Fred Abdalla.
  I yield the floor.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

                       Nomination of John H. Chun

  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I come to the floor this evening to 
support the nomination of John Chun, who is to serve as judge for the 
U.S. District Court of Western Washington, and I know that we will be 
voting later tonight on that nomination.
  I was proud to recommend to President Biden Judge Chun, who then was 
nominated by the President. My colleague Senator Murray and I know what 
a qualified individual he is to serve our country.
  He has spent his entire legal career practicing law in the Western 
District of Washington, making him deeply knowledgeable of the district 
that he will serve. He is well-prepared for the Western District and 
offers a unique perspective to the bench, having served as a superior 
court judge for 4 years before joining the court of appeals in 2018, as 
well as his tenure in private practice.
  Through his extensive courtroom experience as a former trial judge 
and current appellate judge, he has had much time as a trial litigator. 
He will be ready on day one to serve effectively on the Federal 
district court bench.
  Judge Chun has received profound support for his nomination to the 
U.S. district court. Not only did his nomination receive bipartisan 
support from the Senate Judiciary Committee; it also received support 
from the American Bar Association, which unanimously rated him ``well 
qualified'' to serve in this position.
  In addition to the endorsement from the National Asian Pacific 
American

[[Page S1212]]

Bar Association, Judge Chun's nomination has received praise from many 
organizations in our State, including the Washington Low Income Housing 
Alliance, the Vietnamese American Bar Association of Washington, the 
South Asian Bar Association of Washington, the Asian Bar Association of 
Washington, and the Korean American Coalition of Washington.
  As I am sure my colleagues can see, Judge Chun is immensely qualified 
to serve on this court. I urge them to join me and my colleague Senator 
Murray in supporting his nomination to serve as judge for the U.S. 
District Court of the Western District of the State of Washington.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.
  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I would ask unanimous consent to speak as 
if in morning business.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

                                Ukraine

  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise, as so many of us have of late, to 
talk about the invasion of Ukraine by Russia. This invasion, as we 
know, started on February 24, and it is now, I guess, in its 21st or 
22nd day.
  At the time of the invasion--I think it was the day after or 2 days 
after--I was reading in a newspaper the reference to one resident of 
Ukraine who said the following about the onset of the hostilities by 
Vladimir Putin and Russia:

       It was the worst sunrise in my life.

  I can't even begin to imagine what that individual in Ukraine or tens 
of thousands of families were feeling on that day, and hundreds of 
thousands throughout the country--millions, even.
  This attack, which is ongoing, was both unprovoked and unjustified. 
It is an attack on a sovereign nation by a murderous dictator who has 
no regard for human life and no regard for the rules-based 
international order. I think a lot of people knew that before the 
invasion, but now it is abundantly clear to the world what Vladimir 
Putin's intentions are and what his practices are when it comes to 
attacking a sovereign nation.
  The New York Times told us last Friday, March 11, about Putin. I am 
quoting here from the New York Times, and they made reference in this 
story to his actions in Syria, as well as Chechnya:

       [H]e has demonstrated in [the] past . . . a willingness not 
     only to bomb heavily populated areas indiscriminately but 
     also to use civilian casualties as leverage against his 
     enemies.

  ``[U]se civilian casualties as leverage''--that is the dictator that 
the people of Ukraine are dealing with right now. And I think it is 
clear from the reporting, and so many Americans have read the stories 
and have seen the coverage of the bombings. It is clear that he is 
bombing indiscriminately. It is clear that he and his army, his 
military, are targeting civilians.
  All you have to do is look at the list of locations. And the list 
would be hundreds if we read all of them, but here are just a couple 
examples. Maybe the most graphic in the last couple of days was the 
bombing of a maternity ward and that footage of a stretcher coming out 
of that rubble with a pregnant woman, who has since died, as did her 
child. That is an example of that kind of indiscriminate bombing.
  But in addition to a maternity ward, he has bombed a shoe factory, a 
psychiatric hospital, apartment buildings, cafes, homes, parking lots 
near a shopping center, bombing near a kindergarten, bombing of a 
mosque, bombing--we are told, the most recent number--34 medical 
facilities, damaged in Ukraine. And that number, of course, will grow. 
Most recently, just in the last day or so, a supermarket, and, I think, 
at least a 12-story residential tower.
  And then, just today, another reference to just one example of the 
brutality of Putin: 10 people killed waiting in line for bread in 
Ukraine. The adviser to the mayor of one of the most besieged cities, 
Mariupol, said the following. This adviser said:

       Humanity has not yet invented a word to describe what 
     Russia is doing to us.

  I think that says it all. There is no way to describe what is 
happening. The world has never seen this, in recent history. Maybe the 
closest example would be what happened in Syria, which, of course, was 
also paid for and led by the Russian military, Mr. Putin.
  Despite all that horror and all that bloodshed and all that is to 
follow, despite all of that grim reminder of the brutality of Mr. 
Putin, the Ukrainian people have inspired so many of us. When I say 
``us,'' I don't mean just voting Members of Congress or people 
throughout the country. They have inspired people the world over. I 
have never seen anything in my lifetime that equates to the inspiration 
that they have generated; their courage--the raw physical courage of 
the people, of the military, and all the contributions they are making 
to their country--their resolute determination to protect their 
freedom, to protect their families, to protect their nation, and, 
really, when you think about it in a larger sense, to protect democracy 
itself, because that is really very much on the line in Ukraine.

  The Ukrainian people's stubborn refusal to be intimidated by a 
ruthless autocrat and his military has inspired so many people every 
single day. I just saw another example this morning. Women who have 
left Ukraine with their children, to bring their children to safety, 
coming back into Ukraine to join the fight or, in some cases, I guess, 
to rejoin the fight--women putting their lives at risk for their 
country.
  This morning the Presiding Officer and all of us, the Members of 
Congress, had the honor to listen to President Zelenskyy's address to 
the Congress, and I know the Nation saw it as well. His address this 
morning was also inspiring, every bit as inspiring as that engendered 
by his people. But his address was also a call to action for us to do 
more. We have got to do more. And we have got to provide additional 
support.
  President Zelenskyy thanked our President, President Biden, and the 
American people for all the support that we have provided, especially 
in the last couple of weeks since the invasion began but also before 
that.
  And President Biden responded just 2 or 3 hours later when he 
announced even more military assistance or security assistance, which, 
if you add up just that part of the support, just since he took office, 
is now at about $2 billion. That doesn't include other support like 
humanitarian support.
  But here is just a quick list of what that security assistance is. I 
will just itemize a few. This isn't exhaustive, but it is just some 
examples: Stinger anti-aircraft systems--we provided many hundreds of 
them, and now we are providing a lot more than that--the Javelin anti-
armor systems that have had such success against the Russian military, 
Russian tanks; helicopters; patrol boats; grenade launchers; guns and 
ammunition; grenades; mortar and artillery rounds; secure 
communications; military medical equipment; on and on and on.
  And, as I mentioned, the President responded specifically today by 
announcing that the United States will add $800 million just on 
security assistance, bringing that total, as I said, to $2 billion 
since he began his administration. It was noteworthy that two of the 
component parts of that--the Stinger systems and the Javelins--both are 
being used with great skill by the Ukrainian fighters. The increase in 
those numbers is not just a few hundred. In both cases it is either 
doubling or tripling what we have already done. And we will do more. We 
will continue to do more.
  Congress has passed a spending bill just a couple of days ago, at the 
end of last week, and the President signed it this week, which allowed 
that $800 million to be available.
  So that is the good news: more money for weapons and other security 
assistance, more money for humanitarian support. That number is growing 
all the time because of the need that the Ukrainian people have.
  The sanctions--the crushing, unprecedented sanctions--that already 
are having effect. I had a briefing today just on that topic of the 
impact of the sanctions, and it is substantial, and it will only grow 
as time goes by. We will have more time later to talk about that. And, 
of course, the contribution, as well--all of these are contributions of 
not just our government but our people. The American people made these 
contributions of military assistance and humanitarian support and our

[[Page S1213]]

ability to impose sanctions with our allies, with our NATO partners.
  But at the same time, what gets lost sometimes in the discussion 
about Ukraine is the intelligence support we have provided--all kinds 
of offices throughout our intelligence community providing actionable 
intelligence or intelligence that the Ukrainians can use if they fight 
the battle, fight the war. That is probably incalculable in terms of 
the advantages given on the battlefield and beyond. So that bears 
emphasis as well.
  I think one area of positive development in the last couple of months 
is the unity, not just the unity of NATO, which has never been 
stronger, probably never stronger since the 1960s or even more so, but 
the unity here at home--unity in the Senate, unity in the House, unity 
throughout the country to support the people of Ukraine--the people but 
also to support the military.
  I have to say, though, as much as we have that unity with our NATO 
partners and here in the Congress, there are voices here in Washington 
and around the country that are not as unified. We know the voice of 
our former President and his continued approval of Putin's ``genius.''
  Why would you ever say that about a murderous dictator? He is not a 
genius. He is, I believe, a war criminal, but that kind of language and 
that kind of support for Putin, at least by way of laudatory words, has 
tarnished that unity, has undermined that unity here at home and around 
the world. But it is not enough to break that unity.
  I just hope that Republican Members of Congress, when someone in 
their party, especially a leader of their party or a Member of Congress 
or any other Republican official--I hope that when they say things 
about Vladimir Putin that are positive or in any way supportive that 
they would call it out and condemn it.
  When you are supporting the people of Ukraine at a time of war, you 
have to use every tool in your toolbox: military assistance, diplomacy, 
sanctions, humanitarian support, but also your words as leaders. And we 
should be condemning any American leader who supports or says positive 
things about Mr. Putin.
  I hope the Republican Members of Congress who have stood up and been 
very supportive of the Ukrainian people in this fight would also call 
out Members of their party and condemn such statements because that 
didn't happen in July of 2018, when the former President--in my 
judgment, this is my view of it--was genuflecting before Vladimir Putin 
on the world stage in Helsinki, Finland, in probably what I believe is 
maybe the worst day for an American President on the world stage ever 
when he took the side of Mr. Putin, a murderous dictator, over the 
determinations made by our intelligence community about the previous 
election. That was a low moment for America, for our democracy, and for 
our country.
  We now have, I think, very clearly a choice. It is not a choice of 
three or four options or five options. There are only two options here: 
You can choose Mr. Putin or choose Mr. Zelenskyy. You can choose a 
dictator who has no regard for human life and all of the enablers 
around him, or you can choose the President who is standing up for 
freedom, Mr. Zelenskyy, the President of Ukraine.
  It is really a simple choice. It is a choice between the incarnation 
of evil and the personification of freedom. That is the choice. There 
is not a third option here. Every American has to make this choice, but 
especially Members of Congress, elected officials. That is part of our 
job. You have to make a choice, and it is very simple.
  The good news is Republicans, Democrats, and Independents--House and 
Senate, the two branches of government--have made a choice, and the 
American people have made a choice. They made a choice for freedom to 
support that personification of freedom by supporting Mr. Zelenskyy and 
his government in this war, by supporting the Ukrainian people, who are 
literally putting their lives on the line for freedom itself.
  I will conclude with these thoughts. Like our Constitution that we 
turn to for both--not just guidance and inspiration, but we turn to, to 
remind ourselves of our duty, so, too, are the people of Ukraine 
turning to their Constitution for that guidance and that inspiration 
and that call to action.
  Here is what that Constitution says in pertinent part, and it sounds 
very familiar:

       The people are the bearers of sovereignty and the only 
     sources of power in Ukraine . . . To affirm and ensure human 
     rights and freedoms is the main duty of the State.

  That is what the Ukrainian Constitution says, a mandate that freedom 
must be the goal and the work of the State. Wow, are they doing that 
now. President Zelenskyy and his government and the people of Ukraine 
are standing up for freedom.
  When we are at our best here at home, we do the same. We have a great 
anthem for our Nation: ``O beautiful''--and you know the rest of that 
great anthem. One of the verses of that great anthem says:

       O beautiful for patriot dream that sees beyond the years.

  The dream of a patriot isn't just to stand up in the moment and 
fight, but that patriot is standing up for freedom, fighting and 
willing to put their lives on the line--or his or her life on the 
line--for freedom because they are seeing beyond the years. They are 
standing up for freedom, not just for themselves and their families and 
their nation, but for the future--for the future of that nation. That 
is what the people of Ukraine are doing right now, and that is why we 
have to continue to support them in that great fight.
  I think most Americans have already made the choice. We just have to 
back them up and stand for freedom--not to stand for the incarnation of 
evil, Mr. Putin and his government right now, but to stand for the 
personification of freedom. We saw that this morning with President

                           Transgender Youth

  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak out 
against the recent wave of hate attacks on transgender youth happening 
across our country.
  Over the last few months, we have seen extreme Republican lawmakers 
take unprecedented steps to go after trans children and their families. 
Not only are they spewing hateful rhetoric around gender identity--
making something personal and something a lot of Americans probably 
don't think about every day into a cruel political cudgel--but they are 
also using their political power and legal authority to target trans 
people, and trans kids, in particular.
  Last month, Texas Governor Greg Abbott made the decision to actively 
investigate and target parents of transgender kids and providers, 
making the totally false claim that gender-affirming care is child 
abuse. In Idaho, just across the border from my home State of 
Washington, lawmakers got dangerously close to passing legislation that 
would criminalize providers for giving kids the gender-affirming care 
they need. In Florida, there is a bill headed to the Governor's desk 
which aims to erase gay and trans kids, parents, and teachers from our 
schools by banning any discussion about gender identity or sexual 
orientation.
  While Democrats have been focused on getting our schools back open 
and helping students catch up after 2 really tough years, Republicans 
are targeting trans kids and gay students and taking incredibly 
important and personal decisions away from parents and families.
  Right now, it feels like far-right lawmakers are in a race to 
legislate the most extreme, most hateful bill they can think of, at the 
expense of trans kids. We all have a responsibility to stand up and 
make clear this is not right. Trans people are our friends; they are 
our neighbors; they are our families. Trans kids deserve to be just 
kids--to play sports, to go to school, to see a doctor, or to get 
healthcare. They should be able to get the same opportunities as any 
other child, to learn and grow and play and thrive free from fear and 
discrimination. And parents deserve to be able to make their own 
parenting decisions with their medical providers to do what is best for 
their kids' health. They should not have to worry about what a 
rightwing politician thinks is best for their kids. And they definitely 
shouldn't live in fear

[[Page S1214]]

that a State legislature is going to intervene in their parenting 
decisions and hurt their child.
  So we have to push back against these attacks on trans kids in every 
way that we can--in the courts, with legislation, through Executive 
action, and by speaking out and speaking up because I can tell you, 
having just talked to my constituents in Washington State, the hurt and 
fear the Governor of Texas has caused is not staying in Texas. What 
Greg Abbott said about trans kids has an effect on many States. I wish 
it didn't, but the truth is: All of those measures are not only really 
scary for trans families across the country, but they also embolden 
more hateful rhetoric and even violence against trans people; and it is 
harming trans kids' mental health no matter where they live.
  We have to be louder than Greg Abbott or whoever is taking aim at 
trans kids. We have to push for legislation like the Equality Act that 
would send a powerful message of support and fairness for trans and gay 
Americans. And we have to stand up for a future without this hateful 
hate, harm, and division that we are seeing and with a lot more 
compassion for each other. It is not too much to ask.

                       Nomination of John H. Chun

  Mr. President, I also rise today to urge my colleagues to join me 
this evening in voting to confirm Judge John Chun for a Federal 
district court judgeship in the Western District of Washington State.
  Judge Chun is a Pacific Northwest native. He is a father. He is the 
son of South Korean immigrants. He would be the first Asian-American 
man to serve on Washington State's Federal bench.
  He is patient and thoughtful, someone the people of Washington State 
can really count on to faithfully uphold the rule of law and treat 
litigants and all parties before him with grace and respect. Judge 
Chun's qualifications are superb, having served for 7 years now as a 
State court judge. His temperament and record of service demonstrate a 
real commitment to fairness and impartiality, whether through his 
service as a board member for the Washington Low Income Housing 
Alliance or his many pro bono commitments over the course of a very 
long career as both an attorney and a judge.
  For all these reasons and more, Judge Chun's service as Federal 
district court judge in my home State of Washington would surely help 
rebuild faith in our judicial system. I respectfully am here today to 
urge my colleagues to confirm Judge Chun.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.


                 Unanimous Consent Request--S. Res. 493

  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I come today to the floor with a very 
simple unanimous consent request.
  This is a resolution. It doesn't allocate any dollars, doesn't change 
any policy. It is just a statement of belief from the U.S. Senate. It 
is a statement to be able to say we hold certain things very important.
  I will talk through some of the resolution part of it--the resolve at 
the beginning of it--but it ends with a very simple statement. It ends 
with:

       Resolved, That the Senate--(1) recognizes and promotes the 
     importance of parental involvement in their child's 
     education; and (2) recognizes the necessity of school choices 
     as a tool to empower all parents with the freedom to choose 
     the best educational environment for their children and to 
     reject destructive ideologies promoted by many public 
     schools, such as Critical Race Theory.

  This comes from a basic conversation that happens in my State and, 
quite frankly, in States all around the country. Parents should be the 
primary decision-makers for their children--not only where they are 
educated so that they don't live in a certain neighborhood and they 
say, I am sorry, you live there so you have to go here.
  This is so the parents have the maximum amount of flexibility knowing 
one child may be a great fit for one school, and the younger child may 
be a better fit for a different school, whether that be a public school 
that allows flexibility within a district to be able to move place to 
place or, as it happens in my State, where you can even change district 
to district within public schools.
  If a parent maybe works in one area--one school district--but lives 
in another, that parent can choose to be able to have their child go 
into a different district. Though it is a public school setting, it 
gives them the flexibility and the choice to do that. Why? Because not 
every kid is the same and not every educational environment is the 
same.
  I would say in my State--and I would assume in other States as well--
not every school district is the same. It is important to us in our 
State that every school district is successful. There is no place that 
we don't want any child to be able to be successful.
  But we should all admit the facts: Not every school district is 
thriving. As we invest dollars and time and encourage great teaching in 
that district, that child who is in that district that is not being 
successful is trapped in a location that is currently not successful. 
Maybe they can be successful in 5 years from now when they work through 
the different issues they have, but that child doesn't have a second 
shot.
  If that child has no other opportunity to be able to choose and their 
parents are locked into that spot, we basically say, We will fix 
everything in this district in a few years, and that child is just not 
allowed to get an option out. I don't think that is helpful for that 
child and that parent at that time.
  Giving parents the ability to be able to make choices--whether public 
schools, charter schools, private schools--whatever may work best for 
their school and for their State and the policies their State has 
created seems like a smart thing to be able to do.
  Any kind of teaching that is within a school that actually promotes 
one kid as the oppressor and the other kid as the oppressed simply 
because of the color of their skin should not be taught in our schools. 
Why don't we teach every child is equal? Why don't we teach every child 
should have opportunity? Why don't we teach every family has the 
opportunity in this great country of ours; and where we have 
weaknesses, we work on our weaknesses? But we don't label a child as an 
oppressor or as oppressed based on the color of their skin--at least we 
used to not in America.
  But that is what is rising up with this critical race theory as it 
rises up from place to place. I have had many of my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle saying: That is not true. That is not being taught.
  Great. Let's make the resolution. Let's say that we as a Senate don't 
believe that this should be taught. Let's teach every child. Let's love 
every child.
  This resolution also affirms the rights of parents to be able to 
speak out--not in a violent way, not in a destructive way, but for 
parents to be able to speak out.
  Why is it that several months ago, the Department of Justice in our 
Nation starts a whole investigation on parents to be able to say: Are 
there parents who are actually maybe closet terrorists who are showing 
up at school board meetings, complaining about what is being taught, 
complaining about a mask mandate in their school, complaining about a 
vaccine mandate, complaining about critical race theory, or just saying 
``I don't like this particular curriculum''?
  That used to be the rights of parents, to engage, and now we hear: 
Really, parents don't know enough about these difficult things. Parents 
need to just sit down over there. We will take care of this as 
professionals.
  So, again, this resolution doesn't add additional funding. It doesn't 
change the structure of our schools. But it does say: We as the Senate 
believe in the power of the parent to be able to make the right choice 
for their children.
  So, with that, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent 
that the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions be 
discharged from further consideration and the Senate now proceed to my 
resolution, S. Res. 493. I further ask unanimous consent that the 
resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the 
motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?
  The Senator from Washington.
  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I got my 
start in national politics as a parent advocating for my kids' 
preschool program. I am a former preschool teacher. I am a former 
school board member. I

[[Page S1215]]

am now chair of the Senate Education Committee. I have worked across 
the aisle on fixing No Child Left Behind. I have also fought against 
efforts--many during the former administration with Betsy DeVos as 
Secretary of Education--because I felt they took us further from the 
goal of making sure that every student in our country, no matter who 
they are or where they live or how much money their parents make, can 
get an excellent public education and all the opportunity that comes 
with it.
  All this is to say that I could not care more deeply about making 
sure every child gets the chance to learn and succeed in life, and my 
belief that parents should be as involved as possible in their kids' 
education could not be more firmly or personally held. In fact, I can 
remember the times when, as a U.S. Senator with young kids at home 
myself, I would try to read all my memos at night and help with their 
homework. I wanted my own kids to have that support from me, just like 
I want every parent to be able to be on top of what is going on in 
their kids' school.
  I also know from talking to my own family and so many students and 
families across Washington State that these last two years have been 
some of the toughest, most overwhelming times for parents and kids that 
many of us can remember.
  Here in the Senate, our job is to recognize that and do everything we 
can to get things back on track, which is why Democrats acted quickly 
to pass the American Rescue Plan and give schools the resources they 
need so they could reopen and stay open safely.
  We also recognized that after 2 really disruptive years, many 
students would need extra help, so the American Rescue Plan is, as we 
speak right now, paying for afterschool programs and tutors and summer 
learning so students all across the country can catch up.
  I will remind you that this bill to help reopen schools safely and 
keep them open passed with zero Republican votes--not one. Not only 
that, Senate Republicans have come to the floor twice last month alone 
with ideas about snatching Federal funding away from our schools, and 
Republican leaders even rolled out a plan that would eliminate the 
Department of Education altogether. Could there be a clearer message 
about their priorities?
  At all times but especially after the last 2 years, there is no 
excuse for anything short of an all-hands-on-deck national effort to 
put students' education first, but, unfortunately, here is what we have 
got happening: Democrats acted to reopen our schools safely and keep 
them open. Congressional Republicans, down to the last one, voted no.
  Democrats believe that quality public education for every student is 
a good investment. The Republican Party keeps putting forward ideas to 
gut public education. Democrats want to lower student debt and the cost 
of tuition. Republicans are virtually nowhere to be seen on those 
issues. Democrats want students to learn. Republican legislatures 
across the country want to ban books.

  To sum it up, Democrats want every student to have the ability to get 
a great education. We are focused on that. We are serious about it, and 
we are working on it. Meanwhile, Republicans at all levels--and the 
resolution we are debating today is a case in point--want to use 
students and parents and schools as political pawns rather than 
focusing on making sure every single student in our country can get a 
high-quality education and be able to succeed.
  In fact, I just spoke this afternoon with trans kids and parents 
about what is going on in Texas and other parts of the country. These 
kids are brave, but they are scared. Their parents are worried about 
being investigated by the State just because a politician has decided 
he doesn't like how they are raising their kids.
  How are kids supposed to focus on learning when their safety is in 
question? How are their friends supposed to focus on learning when 
their classmates are dealing with something like this? Why are parents 
having to worry about whether they will get investigated for raising 
their kids according to their beliefs, their doctor's advice, and their 
kids' needs?
  When and if Senate Republicans are truly serious about focusing on 
getting American students the great education they need and deserve, we 
will know because Republicans and Democrats might be able to come 
together again and put students and parents and schools first. I know 
that is possible because I have worked with Republicans to make this 
happen.
  So today I would like to give my colleague an opportunity to take the 
first step in the right direction. In a moment, I will ask consent to 
pass a bill that would help our students.
  If we agree we want parents involved in their kids' education and if 
we agree that this is a moment when students, like so many Americans, 
are stressed and need us to have their backs, which I really hope we 
do, then let's send more counselors and nurses to our Nation's schools. 
Let's prioritize STEM education and advanced coursework and make them 
available to more of our K-12 students. Let's make students' mental 
health a top priority so they can focus on learning.
  So I will be asking unanimous consent on legislation that would help 
us all do this--importantly, in a way that seeks parents' input 
directly on what will matter most to their kids and their communities.
  If you are trying to get our schools back on track, this should be an 
easy yes vote because it will be a vote for students' education, 
parents' peace of mind, and actually doing something real about the 
tough challenges students and parents are facing.
  I hope my friend from Oklahoma will support it and that moving 
forward, Republicans will take education as seriously as they claim to 
and reverse course and join us in working to meet this moment for 
students' and parents' sake.
  At this time, I object to the Senator from Oklahoma's unanimous 
consent.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.
  Mrs. MURRAY. As if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent 
that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of the Murray 
bill, which is at the desk, a bill to appropriate funds for students' 
academic and mental health needs. Further, I ask unanimous consent that 
the bill be considered read a third time and passed and that the motion 
to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?
  The Senator from Oklahoma.
  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I 
appreciate the dialogue on education. A degree is an education. My mom 
is a lifelong educator. I spent my summers growing up in the school 
library, putting books in the Dewey Decimal System, putting the new 
piece of tape on the outside of it, and actually, back in the old days, 
filing a new card in the card catalog, which half the people listening 
to me right now have no idea what that is.
  I am passionate about education. I have two daughters, and I stay 
very engaged in the issue of education. So it is always interesting to 
me when my Democratic colleagues say: When Republicans get serious 
about education.
  It is always interesting. We will pass a bill, like what happened in 
the omnibus or what happened in any Education bill before, and there 
will be billions and billions of dollars in education, but the comment 
will always be ``Well, if you really loved kids, you would do just $1 
billion more, but because you don't love kids, you did $1 billion 
less.'' It is never enough on it.
  This resolution that I brought today was not about an extra $1.3 
billion in education to be able to hire more people; it was just about 
empowering parents.

  It is an interesting side by side to say what families need more is 
more employees at school, and what I am seeing is that we need more 
empowerment of parents.
  One costs $1.3 billion; the other one is just free. One says: Let's 
have folks at school know how to be able to take care of your kids 
best. The other one says: Well, let's make sure there are certain 
things, like critical race theory, that we don't teach at school to 
make sure every child is taught the same. And if that parent wants to 
teach that at home, they are welcome to teach that at home, but let's 
not impose that on every child. Let's not call some children oppressors 
because of the color of their skin.
  Why don't we do that?

[[Page S1216]]

  So the resolution I brought is not about a billion dollars; it is 
just a statement of support of parents, a statement of support of what 
parents want to be able to teach. It is not about more school 
employees; it is about stronger parents. That is what I think that we 
ought to continue to be able to address.
  This is not about who loves education more. Quite frankly, I know my 
colleague from Washington is passionate about kids and about education. 
She has lived it as a mom, as a leader in the Senate, and as someone I 
watched negotiate with Lamar Alexander some of the toughest education 
policy conversations. She is a remarkable legislator and is passionate 
about this.
  We have some disagreements on some of these issues. I am just 
passionate about doing whatever we can to be able to honor parents as 
often as we can and to tell them: No, you are not going to be 
investigated.
  She mentioned parents in Texas being worried about being 
investigated. I will tell you, parents in Oklahoma have said to me: I 
no longer go to school board meetings because I am afraid the FBI is 
going to be there and they are going to open a case on me. I have heard 
that the Attorney General is looking for parents who are problems 
across the country, and so I don't feel comfortable going to a school 
board meeting anymore because the U.S. Attorney General may open a file 
on me.
  Now, that is a real conversation with a parent at home.
  So let's find a way to be able to empower parents and do whatever we 
can. So I object.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.
  The Senator from Maryland.
  Mr. CARDIN. First, I would ask consent that I be able to complete my 
brief remarks before the vote starts.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

                   Nomination of Julie Rebecca Rubin

  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the 
confirmation of Baltimore City Circuit Court Judge Julie Rubin to be a 
U.S. district judge for the District of Maryland. I recommended Judge 
Rubin, along with Senator Van Hollen, to President Biden, and we 
strongly support her nomination.
  Judge Rubin has been nominated to fill the vacancy created when Judge 
Ellen Hollander, appointed by President Obama in 2011, announced her 
intentions to take senior status.
  President Biden nominated Judge Rubin for this position on December 3 
of last year, and the Judiciary Committee held her confirmation hearing 
on December 15. Judge Rubin was favorably reported by the Judiciary 
Committee on January 20 of this year by a bipartisan vote.
  She received a unanimous ``well qualified'' rating from the American 
Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, which is 
the organization's highest rating. The ABA assesses the nominee's 
professional competency, integrity, and judicial temperament.
  Shortly after the November 2020 Presidential elections, I worked with 
Senator Van Hollen to establish the judicial selection committee in 
Maryland. We used an open application process with public advertisement 
and communicated closely with State, local, and specialty bar 
associations in Maryland. In particular, we sought out highly qualified 
and diverse applicants. Our committee interviewed everyone who 
submitted an application, which involved several dozen interviews. 
Senator Van Hollen and I personally interviewed several finalists 
before recommending names to the White House.
  Born in Baltimore, Judge Rubin received her B.A. cum laude from Mount 
Holyoke College in 1995 and her J.D. from the University of Maryland 
School of Law in 1998.
  She worked at Astrachan Gunst, handling intellectual property and 
employment law matters in both Federal and State court.
  Judge Rubin was appointed by the Governor of Maryland in 2012 as a 
Baltimore City circuit judge and was elected in 2014 by the people of 
Baltimore to a 15-year term.
  The circuit court is the State trial court of general jurisdiction in 
Maryland, covering both civil and criminal cases, and is the exclusive 
court for jury trials, including felony trials--similar jurisdiction to 
what the Federal district court handles. So she has that experience.
  Judge Rubin brings tremendous experience to the courtroom as a 
sitting Baltimore City circuit judge for nearly a decade. She has 
handled a substantial and diverse caseload in our State court in 
Baltimore, having served in the civil, family, criminal, and general 
trial divisions, as well as serving on special assignments to the 
asbestos docket. She previously served as a supervisory judge of 
alternative dispute resolutions. She estimates that she has presided 
over about 1,000 criminal and civil cases that have gone to verdict or 
judgment, including both bench and jury trials.
  Judge Rubin is known as a judge's judge, in terms of her excellent 
temperament, work ethic, and congeniality with lawyers and litigants. 
She is known to be fair in judgment to all litigants. She was selected 
to serve as a faculty member of the Judicial College and tasked with 
instructing newly appointed Maryland trial judges on judicial ethics 
and best courtroom practices.
  Judge Rubin has continued to give back to the community as an adjunct 
legal professor at the Maryland Law School. She cochaired the Bench Bar 
Committee of the Bar Association of Baltimore City, served on the board 
of the Baltimore Metropolitan Chapter of the Simon E. Sobeloff Law 
Society, and assisted the CollegeBound Foundation and the Baltimore 
Education Scholarship Trust to help underprivileged or at-risk youth. 
She has served as chair of the board of trustees for the Bryn Mawr 
School in Baltimore. She has given back to our community and 
understands the challenges in our community.
  As a fellow graduate of the University of Maryland Francis King Carey 
Law School, I am confident that Judge Rubin will meet the highest 
standards of integrity, competence, and temperament. I know she will 
uphold the rule of law for all Marylanders for this lifetime 
appointment.
  Finally, let me say that I know that public service is a sacrifice, 
not only for the nominee but for their family. So I want to thank Judge 
Rubin's husband James and her entire family for sharing Judge Rubin 
with the people of Maryland.
  Judge Rubin's confirmation will build on the quality and diversity of 
the Maryland District Court bench. All 10 of the confirmed judges have 
been recommended by me to the President for appointment as a Senator 
from Maryland. I am proud of their qualifications and diversity.
  In Maryland, our Federal bench is 50 percent women, 50 percent men, 
40 percent people of color. We appointed the first African-American 
woman, the first person of Palestinian descent. We have a diversified, 
quality bench representing the people of Maryland and providing the 
justice the people of Maryland deserve.
  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the confirmation of Judge 
Julie Rubin to be a U.S. district judge for the District of Maryland.
  I yield the floor.

  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this vote took a long time. If the others

that we are on the second vote--hang close.

  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?
  Without objection, it is so ordered.

  Thank you.

                   CONFIRMATION OF SHALANDA D. YOUNG

  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to acknowledge the 
confirmation of Shalanda Young to be the Director of the Office of 
Management and Budget with a bipartisan vote of 61 to 36.
  Director Young has a depth of experience that cannot be matched to 
lead the Office of Management and Budget. A staff member on the House 
Appropriations Committee for 15 years--serving 4 of these years as the 
committee's staff director--Director Young has years of experience in 
crafting the budgets of the Federal agencies that the American people 
rely on.
  In 2019, Director Young was one of the few staff present in the room 
while then Chairman Shelby, Chairwoman Lowey, Ranking Member Granger, 
and I negotiated the end to the longest Federal Government shutdown in 
U.S. history. Her knowledge of Federal programs, understanding of the 
political process, and years of critical insight into the operations of 
the federal government were invaluable in our negotiations to reach a 
deal.
  I was glad to strongly support Director Young's nomination to be 
Deputy Director of OMB. After she was confirmed to that position, she 
began to serve as its Acting Director. It was in this role that she 
guided the Biden administration's budget priorities through the COVID 
pandemic, devastating natural disasters, a long sought after bipartisan 
infrastructure law, and now the response to President Putin's 
unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.
  As if she did not have enough on her plate, on October 31, 2021, she 
gave birth to a beautiful baby girl, Charlie. If juggling all of that 
did not prove she is more than qualified for the job, I am not sure 
what would.
  As the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I look 
forward to working with her and her team at OMB on the fiscal year 2023 
appropriations process. Director Young understands how to work across 
the aisle to get a deal done. I cannot think of someone I would rather 
work with in putting the appropriations process to work on behalf of 
the American people.

                      EB-5 REGIONAL CENTER PROGRAM

  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I have long been a supporter of the EB-5 
program, which has been a significant economic driver in Texas. This 
merit-based immigration program has created thousands of American jobs 
and brought billions of dollars in investment to urban and rural areas 
across Texas and the U.S.
  While it was unfortunate that the authorization for the EB-5 Regional 
Center program was allowed to lapse on June 30, 2021, I am pleased to 
have worked with my colleagues, Senators Chuck Grassley and Patrick 
Leahy, on the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act, which was included as part 
of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022.
  The EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act reauthorizes the regional center 
program through September 30, 2027, and implements meaningful reforms 
and integrity measures that will ensure the viability and security of 
the program for the coming years.
  This legislation provides the first multiyear authorization for the 
regional center program since 2015, so that regional centers, which 
have been in limbo for nearly 9 months, will have much-needed stability 
going forward. There is also a 60-day implementation period to allow 
USCIS to begin processing EB-5 petitions and applications that have 
been on hold since the lapse. Following that initial period, existing 
regional centers will be able to immediately get back to work driving 
investment into the U.S. and facilitating the creation of jobs across 
the country.

     Helicopter will provide the capability to perform anti-
     surface and anti-submarine warfare missions along with the 
     ability to perform secondary missions including vertical 
     replenishment, search and rescue, and communications relay 
     and will bolster the Spanish Navy's ability to support NATO 
     and remain interoperable with the U.S. and the NATO alliance. 
     Spain will have no difficulty absorbing these helicopters 
     into its armed forces.
       The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not 
     alter the basic military balance in the region.
       The principal contractor will be Lockheed Martin Rotary and 
     Mission Systems, Owego, NY. There are no known offset 
     agreements proposed in connection with this potential sale.
       Implementation of this proposed sale may require the 
     assignment of two (2) contractor representatives to Spain.
       There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness 
     as a result of this proposed sale.


                         Transmittal No. 22-09

     Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to 
         Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act

                           Annex Item No. vii

       (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:
       1. The MH-60R Multi-Mission Helicopter focuses primarily on 
     anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare missions. The MH-60R 
     carries several sensors and data links to enhance its ability 
     to work in a network centric battle group and as an extension 
     of its home ship/main operating base. The mission equipment 
     subsystem consists of the following sensors and subsystems: 
     an acoustics systems consisting of a dipping sonar and 
     sonobuoys, Multi-Mode Radar (MMR) with integral 
     Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) interrogator, Radios with 
     COMSEC, Electronic Support Measures (ESM), Integrated Self-
     Defense (ISD), and Multi-Spectral Targeting System (MTS). The 
     aircraft processes sensor data onboard, and transmits data 
     via Common Data Link (CDL) (also referred to as Hawklink). 
     The aircraft is night vision compatible. It can carry AGM-
     114A/B/K/N Hellfire missiles to engage surface and sub-
     surface targets.
       a. The AGM-114 Hellfire missile is an air-to-surface 
     missile with a multi-mission, multi-target, precision strike 
     capability. The Hellfire can be launched from multiple air 
     platforms and is the primary precision weapon for the United 
     States Army.
       b. Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System (APKWS) laser 
     guided rocket to counter the fast attack craft and fast 
     inshore attack craft threat.
       c. Communications security (COMSEC) devices contain 
     sensitive encryption algorithms and keying material.
       d. Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) (KIV-78) contains 
     embedded security devices containing sensitive encryption 
     algorithms and keying material.
       e. GPS/PPS/SAASM--Global Positioning System (GPS) provides 
     a space-based Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) that 
     has reliable location and time information in all weather and 
     at all times and anywhere on or near the earth when and where 
     there is an unobstructed line of sight to four or more GPS 
     satellites. Selective Availability/Anti-Spoofing Module 
     (SAASM) (AN/PSN-11) is used by military GPS receivers to 
     allow decryption of precision GPS coordinates. In addition, 
     the GPS Antenna System (GAS-1) provides protection from enemy 
     manipulation of the GPS system.
       f. Acoustics algorithms are used to process dipping sonar 
     and sonobuoy data for target tracking and for the Acoustics 
     Mission Planner (AMP), which is a tactical aid employed

[[Page S1222]]

     to optimize the deployment of sonobuoys and the dipping 
     sonar.
       g. The AN/APS-153 multi-mode radar with an integrated IFF 
     and Inverse Synthetic Aperture (ISAR) provides target 
     surveillance/detection capability.
       h. The AN/ALQ-210 (ESM) system identifies the location of 
     an emitter.
       i. The AN/AAS-44C(V) Multi-Spectral Targeting System (MTS) 
     operates in day/night and adverse weather conditions. Imagery 
     is provided by a Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) sensor, a 
     color/monochrome day television (DTV) camera, and a Low-Light 
     TV (LLTV).
       j. Ultra High Frequency/Very High Frequency (UHF/VHF) 
     Radios (ARC-210) contain embedded sensitive encryption 
     algorithms and keying material.
       k. Advanced Data Transfer System (ADTS) with Type 1 
     encryption for data at rest.
       l. Satellite Communications Demand Assigned Multiple Access 
     (SATCOM DAMA), which provides increased, interoperable 
     communications capabilities with U.S. forces.
       2. The highest level of classification of defense articles, 
     components, and services included in this potential sale is 
     SECRET.
       3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain 
     knowledge of the hardware and software elements, the 
     information could be used to develop countermeasures or 
     equivalent systems, which might reduce system effectiveness 
     or be used in the development of a system with similar or 
     advanced capabilities.
       4. A determination has been made that Spain can provide 
     substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive 
     technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale 
     is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and 
     national security objectives outlined in the Policy 
     Justification.
       5. All defense articles and services listed in this 
     transmittal have been authorized for release and export to 
     the Government of Spain.

                                UKRAINE

  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise to bring attention to the need 
to support the Ukrainian people in the face of Russia's invasion. Over 
the weekend, I took part in a Senate delegation to Poland alongside my 
colleagues Senator Rob Portman, Senator Richard Blumenthal, and Senator 
Roger Wicker. We met with Ukrainian refugees--women, children, 
grandparents--some who were carrying their whole lives on their backs.
  Three weeks ago, Ukrainians were thinking about their jobs, their 
plans, and their dreams. Now, so much of that is in shambles. Women 
have been figuring out how to get their older parents and young 
children to safety across the border while their brothers and husbands 
take up arms. The most heartbreaking conversations I had were with 
children who didn't know if they had a future.
  Seeing the cost of this invasion up close has only strengthened my 
resolve to stand with Ukraine, both with humanitarian aid for refugees 
and military support. With advanced weapons from the United States and 
allies, Ukraine's Territorial Defense has been more effective in 
stifling Russia's invasion than most imagined. Vladimir Putin thought 
he would be greeted with rose petals--instead it was Molotov cocktails. 
And 21 days later, Kyiv still stands.
  I was proud to join the bipartisan Senate majority in allocating 
$13.6 billion for aid to Ukraine, but more support is needed. Over the 
past few weeks, Russian aircraft have been behind brutal assaults on 
residential neighborhoods, religious institutions, and hospitals in 
Ukraine. Ukraine needs more air defense support. Drones, Stingers, and 
Javelins have proven to be highly effective in taking down Russian 
aircraft and tanks, so we must continue to provide that critical 
weaponry and more.
  In the face of this devastation, Poland has shown that it is a 
country with a big heart, taking in more than 1.7 million Ukrainian 
refugees. For perspective, Poland is a country of 38 million. Since 
they have opened their doors, the country's population has grown by 
over 4 percent. In Warsaw alone, the population has increased by 11 
percent. Poles are meeting refugees at the border and welcoming them 
into their communities--even into their own homes.
  The Polish people don't have to imagine what it is like to live 
through a full-scale invasion. Their history is marked by invasions by 
Prussia, the Habsburgs, the Nazis, and yes, Russia. Poland is also well 
aware of its 332-mile border with Ukraine. Last week, Russian missiles 
struck 15 miles from Poland's border. The Polish border guards I spoke 
with said they could literally feel the earth shake. As Putin's war 
inches westward, we must affirm our commitment to our NATO ally from a 
military and humanitarian standpoint.
  During our trip, Senator Portman, Senator Blumenthal, Senator Wicker, 
and I had the honor of meeting with the 82nd Airborne. They briefed us 
on everything that is being done to help Ukrainian refugees, as well as 
fighters on the front lines. I also met with Minnesota troops, and I 
was inspired by their character and determination. It was clear that 
they understood the patriotic value of their service. I pray for their 
safety as they continue their mission in the region.
  Across the Atlantic in Ukraine, we are all seeing how precious 
democracy truly is. Putin has shown his true colors. But you know what 
else? The people of Ukraine have shown their true colors--in bright 
blue and yellow--they are showing the world what true courage is all 
about. We must continue to stand with them in their fight.

             ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF KING SOOPERS SHOOTING

  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, on March 22, 2021, we suffered another 
horrific mass shooting in our State at the King Soopers grocery store 
in Boulder, CO. As we approach its 1-year anniversary, we honor the 10 
Coloradans whose lives were cut tragically short in this senseless act 
of gun violence. They leave behind children, spouses, parents, friends, 
and a Boulder community that will always carry the grief of their loss.
  They will never forget the 10 victims and neither should America. So 
today, we read their names into the Congressional Record.
  Denny Stong was 20 years old and a graduate of Fairview High School. 
He was an introverted, smart kid who loved history and model airplanes. 
He had been covering shifts at the King Soopers and took enormous pride 
in his role as an essential worker during the pandemic. He once posted 
on Facebook: ``I can't stay home . . . I am a grocery store worker.''
  Neven Stanisic was 23 years old. His dad said he was ``a really good 
boy, a good kid . . . a hard-working boy.'' His parents are refugees 
from Bosnia who left in the 1990s to escape the war. The reverend at 
their local church said, ``His family fled the war . . . They left 
everything to save their lives, and came here to have a new start.''
  Rikki Olds was 25 years old. She had been working as a manager at 
King Soopers for 6 years. Her family described her as a ``firecracker'' 
who lit up a room with her infectious giggle. Her aunt Lori said, ``She 
had a beautiful way of just being her . . . When you're down, she just 
wanted to cheer you up, just by being around.''
  Tralona Bartkowiak was 49 years old. She co-owned a clothing and 
accessories store with her sister and was a

[[Page S1223]]

frequent presence in the Boulder arts and music scene. She had a deep 
curiosity about the world that took her on travels from Nepal to Costa 
Rica. Her younger brother remembers her as ``a beam of light.''
  Teri Leiker was 51 years old. She was a huge fan of the Buffaloes at 
CU and was a regular face at the Pearl Street Stampede. A friend called 
Teri ``the most selfless, innocent, amazing person I have had the honor 
of meeting.''
  Suzanne Fountain was 59 years old. She worked for 15 years at Boulder 
Community Health. She loved gardening and was passionate about music 
and theater. A friend described her as ``the cream of the crop and a 
good person, a good soul.''
  Kevin Mahoney was 61 years old. He had worked in the hotel business 
but retired early to spend more time traveling, skiing, and visiting 
his daughter, Erika. After learning of her father's death, Erika wrote, 
``My dad represents all things Love. I'm so thankful he could walk me 
down the aisle last summer.''
  Lynn Murray was 62 years old, a mother of two, and a retired photo 
director for prominent national magazines. Her husband John said, ``I 
just want her to be remembered as this amazing, amazing comet spending 
62 years flying across the sky.''
  Jody Waters was 65 years old. She used to own a boutique clothing 
store named Applause on the Pearl Street Mall, where she remembered all 
her customers and their favorite brands. She was a mother of two and a 
grandmother who loved horses and hiking. A friend said when Jody walked 
into the room, ``She was a breath of fresh air, a light.''
  Finally, we honor Officer Eric Talley. He was 51 years old, a man of 
deep faith, and a devoted father of seven. After losing a close friend 
to a DUI, he joined the police academy at age 40 to give back to the 
community. In 2013, he made headlines when he helped rescue 11 
ducklings from a drainage ditch. Eric's father said he ``loved his kids 
and family more than anything.'' For their sake, he was hoping to stay 
off the frontlines by learning to become a drone operator. But when the 
bullets rang out, he rushed into action, saving countless lives at the 
cost of his own. Colorado owes Officer Talley a debt we will never be 
able to repay. He and the nine other victims represent the best of our 
State.
  As we honor the victims' lives, we stand with all who continue to 
grieve and the community as it continues to heal. We condemn the 
senseless gun violence, not only in Boulder last year, but in far too 
many American cities and towns every day. Until no American has to live 
in reasonable fear of being gunned down in a school, or a movie 
theater, or a grocery store, we have more work to do.

                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS

                                 ______
                                 

SENATE RESOLUTION 548--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE ON ENDING THE 
   ACCESS OF RUSSIAN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO SPECIALIZED FINANCIAL 
                           MESSAGING SERVICES

  Mrs. BLACKBURN (for herself and Mr. Blumenthal) submitted the 
following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, 
Housing, and Urban Affairs:

                              S. Res. 548

       Whereas providers of specialized financial messaging 
     services are a critical link to the international financial 
     system;
       Whereas the European Union, Japan, Canada, and other 
     partners of the United States are to be commended for 
     strengthening the multilateral sanctions regime against the 
     Russian Federation;
       Whereas, while the expulsion of selected Russian financial 
     institutions from specialized financial messaging services is 
     a first step, that expulsion alone is not sufficient to 
     address the scope and scale at which the Government of the 
     Russian Federation is waging war against Ukraine; and
       Whereas, once achieved, the complete loss of access by 
     Russian financial institutions to specialized financial 
     messaging services must be maintained: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That--
       (1) the Senate urges the President, in the strongest 
     possible terms, to immediately take all measures necessary to 
     remove all Russian financial institutions from access to 
     specialized financial messaging services, including by 
     working with allies and partners

[[Page S1227]]

     of the United States to execute that removal multilaterally;
       (2) it is the sense of the Senate that the Russian 
     financial institutions covered by paragraph (1) include--
       (A) Sberbank;
       (B) VTB;
       (C) Gazprombank.
       (D) VEB.RF;
       (E) The Russian Direct Investment Fund;
       (F) Credit Bank of Moscow;
       (G) Alfa Bank;
       (H) Rosselkhozbank;
       (I) FC Bank Otkritie;
       (J) Promsvyazbank;
       (K) Sovcombank;
       (L) Transkapitalbank;
       (M) Tinkoff Bank; and
       (N) any financial institution that is owned or controlled 
     by, or is a successor to, a financial institution specified 
     in any of subparagraphs (A) through (M); and
       (3) it is the sense of the Senate that any package of 
     sanctions imposed with respect to the Russian Federation is 
     strengthened by working in concert with allies and partners 
     of the United States.

  SENATE RESOLUTION 549--SUPPORTING THE TRANSFER OF AIRCRAFT AND AIR 
             DEFENSE SYSTEMS TO THE ARMED FORCES OF UKRAINE

  Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Ms. Ernst, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Cramer, Mr. 
Cassidy, Mr. Scott of Florida, Mr. Wicker, Mr. Romney, Mr. Tillis, and 
Mr. Lankford) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to 
the Committee on Foreign Relations:

                              S. Res. 549

       Whereas the people of Ukraine have shown great resolve in 
     combating the blind aggression of the Russian Federation 
     following the further invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 
     2022;
       Whereas the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation continue 
     to assault the people of Ukraine through indiscriminate 
     aerial attacks;
       Whereas the United States Department of Defense has stated 
     that the Russian Federation flies ``on average 200 sorties 
     per day'' in their campaign against Ukraine;
       Whereas Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has 
     continued to request that members of the North Atlantic 
     Treaty Organization and other countries around the globe 
     support the transfer of military aircraft and air defense 
     systems to the Armed Forces of Ukraine in order to protect 
     the people of Ukraine;
       Whereas the MiG-29 is the main fixed-wing aircraft in the 
     inventory of the Ukrainian Air Force, and it is critical that 
     the Ukrainian Air Force receive aircraft that mirror the 
     capability and operating standard of the MiG-29;
       Whereas additional MiG-29s are essential for the Ukrainian 
     Air Force to remain capable of contesting aircraft of the 
     Russian Federation;
       Whereas, on March 5, 2022, it was reported that the 
     Government of Poland would transfer MiG-29s to Ukraine in 
     exchange for aircraft from the United States;
       Whereas, on March 6, 2022, Secretary of State Antony 
     Blinken stated that the transfer of Polish MiG-29s to Ukraine 
     ``gets a green light [and that] we're talking with our Polish 
     friends right now about what we might be able to do to 
     backfill their needs. . .'';
       Whereas, on March 8, 2022, the Government of Poland stated 
     that Poland would ``deploy--immediately and free of charge--
     all of their M[i]G-29 jets. . .and place them at the disposal 
     of the Government of the United States'' and further stated 
     that ``other NATO Allies--owners of M[i]G-29 jets--[should] 
     act in the same vein'';
       Whereas, on March 9, 2022, the Pentagon stated that the 
     United States does ``not support the transfer of additional 
     fighter aircraft to the Ukrainian Air Force at this time, and 
     therefore have no desire to see them in our custody, either'' 
     and further stated that ``the transfer of combat aircraft 
     right now could be mistaken, by Mr. Putin and the Russians as 
     an escalatory step'';
       Whereas a failure to provide aircraft, such as MiG-29s, and 
     air defense systems to the Armed Forces of Ukraine would 
     embolden the Russian Federation and further endanger the 
     people of Ukraine;
       Whereas the Biden Administration should support the 
     transfer of aircraft, such as MiG-29s, and air defense 
     systems, including Stinger missiles and more advanced 
     surface-to-air missile systems, to Ukraine; and
       Whereas Congress urges the Biden Administration to meet the 
     air defense needs requested by President Zelensky, including 
     the transfer of aircraft, such as MiG-29s, and other air 
     defense systems: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) encourages the President of the United States to 
     support the transfer of aircraft, such as MiG-29s, and air 
     defense systems to Ukraine;
       (2) supports continued efforts by members of the North 
     Atlantic Treaty Organization and other countries around the 
     globe to identify additional aviation and air defense 
     capabilities to transfer to the Armed Forces of Ukraine; and
       (3) stands with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and 
     the people of Ukraine in their struggle against Russian 
     aggression.
