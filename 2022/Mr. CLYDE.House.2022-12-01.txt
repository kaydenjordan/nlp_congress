 Madam Speaker, over the weekend, the White House eased  sanctions on Venezuela's oil sector, permitting Chevron to resume oil  production in the communist regime. This policy follows an undeniable  pattern of the President putting our Nation last.   Joe Biden is more than happy to green-light drilling in Venezuela but  stalls drilling permits here in the United States. He is delighted to  beg foreign adversaries like Saudi Arabia to boost production but  refuses to unleash American energy. The President is determined to  advance Green New Deal policies but fails to help Americans struggling  to fill their gas tanks and heat their homes this winter.   Make no mistake: This is the America last administration. You see,  President Biden wants to totally control U.S. fossil fuel energy, and  he can do it more easily through manipulating imports of foreign oil  than he can over domestic production once it has begun. It is a  nefarious plan.   Thankfully, though, in just a few short weeks, House Republicans will  retake the majority and start advancing legislation to restore American  energy independence once and for all.                            ____________________
