 Mr. President, when it comes to bankrupting our  country, the Green New Deal puts all other ideas to shame. It calls for  rebuilding or retrofitting every building in America in the next 10  years, eliminating all fossil fuels in 10 years, eliminating nuclear  power, and working toward ending air travel. This Green New Deal is not  a serious policy idea; it is a unicorn.   Democrats failed to grasp something basic: Republicans and  Independents care about the environment. We want clean air, we want  clean water, and we want to take care of our environment and natural  resources. At the same time, we also care about our economy, jobs for  families in our States, and making sure that everyone in our country  has the opportunity to succeed. We believe that taking care of the  planet and working to create a better economy are objectives that can  and must be pursued at the exact same time.   You can't afford to take care of the environment if you don't have a  strong economy. The Green New Deal would destroy our economy. To  embrace this Green New Deal plan is to be an enemy of the American  economy and the American worker because when you stop and think about  it, the Green New Deal is, in reality, the green job killer.   Some will say: Why bother picking on this plan? It is not like it has  any chance of being enacted.   Here is the problem: A socialist from New York City with a massive  Twitter following introduced this nonserious plan, and every single  major Democrat running for President immediately embraced it. Let that  sink in for a moment.   Climate change is real and requires real solutions, but the  Democratic Party has accepted this economy-destroying new deal as a new  commandment to go alongside single-payer healthcare and higher taxes on  job creators.   For most Americans, this plan is a declaration of war on the economy,  our  [[Page S1824]]  way of life, and the standard of living for working class families  across our great country.   What does this mean for Florida? Well, it would mean the end of the  tourism industry; that is, 1.4 million jobs, massive job loss, and  unemployment.   As for me, I love and cherish the environment. It is what makes the  great State of Florida so great. What I don't love are naive plans that  would destroy Florida's economy.   During my time as Governor of Florida, we made record investments in  our environment, and we were able to do that only because Florida's  economy was booming and we had the resources to make these investments.  The Green New Deal would reverse every ounce of progress we have made.   The most incredible part of the Green New Deal plan is the statement  that they will provide ``economic security for all people of the United  States.'' No government can ever do that. To argue otherwise is a  disservice to all hard-working Americans and nothing more than phony  political posturing.   I look forward to a time when we don't have to argue about ridiculous  proposals being amplified in the media and can actually focus on real  solutions to protect our environment and build our economy.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I oppose amendment No. 193 to  S.J. Res. 7, as I believe it is an unnecessary measure that too broadly  narrows the President's role in international affairs. I would have  voted no if the amendment had been called for a rollcall vote.                            ____________________
