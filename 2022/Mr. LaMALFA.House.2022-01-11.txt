 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a great  American hero, World War II triple ace fighter pilot and a man I am  lucky to know and call a friend, Colonel Bud Anderson.   Colonel Anderson will be turning 100 on January 13, just a few days  from now.   Bud is a California native, born in Oakland, California, and he grew  up on a farm near Newcastle in Placer County in north California. He  learned to fly when he was only 19 years old and joined the U.S. Army  as an aviation cadet shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941.   Bud was decorated 25 times during his successful 30-year military  career. He is the highest scoring living U.S. fighter ace and the only  surviving U.S. triple ace.   Bud has certainly impacted me and my staff as a friend and as a  person in the community in Placer County with his leadership and his  all-around kindness as a person of such heroic status.   I met him over a decade ago and had a chance to do various events  with him, including a statue dedication for him. I watched him receive  the Congressional Gold Medal as an elite group of American fighter  aces. One of my favorite memories was with him at an air show when a P- 51 Mustang, which he flew in World War II in Europe, flew by. Really,  it is the sound of freedom.   Congratulations and happy birthday, Colonel Bud. God bless you.                            ____________________
