 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I just listened to Leader McConnell's  lengthy response to my letter proposing the outlines of a fair  impeachment trial in the Senate. Leader McConnell was apparently upset  that I sent him the letter on Sunday, saying the first step was for the  two leaders to meet and then discuss a resolution. Well, if we were  allowed to show a video here on the Senate floor of a Republican  leader's appearance on Sean Hannity's program last week, it would  expose the fallacy of his argument.   Leader McConnell, unfortunately, skipped his first step when he began  publicly talking about the rules of a Senate trial, telling Hannity  that he would be taking cues from the White House and his idea for how  to conduct a trial long before any conversation--which he still hasn't  had--with me. My letter was intended as a good-faith proposal to kick- start the discussions that Leader McConnell has so far delayed in  scheduling. I still expect we will sit down and discuss trial  parameters despite his public appearances on FOX News, but let me say  this: I listened to the leader's speech. I did not hear a single  argument as to why the witnesses I suggested should not give testimony.  Impeachment trials, like most trials, have witnesses. To have none  would be an aberration.   Why is the President so afraid of having these witnesses come  testify? What are they afraid the witnesses would say? I would like to  hear Leader McConnell come to the floor and give specific reasons why  the four witnesses we have asked for should not testify. I do not know  what they will say. They are President Trump appointees. They might  have something exculpatory to say about President Trump, or they might  not, but they are certainly the four key people who saw exactly what  was going on.   What is Leader McConnell afraid of? What is President Trump afraid  of? The truth? But the American people want the truth, and that is why  we have asked for witnesses and documents to get at the whole truth and  nothing but.   This week, the House of Representatives will vote on Articles of  Impeachment against the President of the United States. If these  articles pass the House, the Constitution dictates that the Senate  serve as a court of impeachment. Conducting an impeachment trial is a  tremendously weighty and solemn responsibility entrusted to us by our  Founders. If such a trial is to happen, Democrats strongly believe it  must be fair, and the American people must regard it as fair. A fair  trial is one that allows Senators to get all the relevant facts and  adjudicate the case impartially.   In the letter I sent to Leader McConnell, I proposed a very  reasonable structure for a fair trial. I have sent that same letter to  every one of my colleagues, Democrat and Republican. There is a grand  tradition in America, speedy and fair trials. We want both. The leader  seems obsessed with speedy and wants to throw fair out the window.   To simply repeat the arguments that were made in the House and  Senate, when there are witnesses and documents that could shed light on  what actually happened, why not have them? Let's hear a single word of  answer to that. We have heard none. In fact, the American people want  it as well. A poll today in the Washington Post/ABC says 72 percent of  Americans want to hear these witnesses; 64 percent of Republicans do.  The American people are fair. They don't want a coverup. They don't  want concealment. This is weighty stuff.   The House has put together a very, very strong case that the  President abused his power and wanted to let a foreign power interfere  in our elections. That goes to the heart of what our democracy is and  what the Founding Fathers warned against. Now, to not allow witnesses  to come forward who would be able to discuss what actually happened--if  we don't have them, the trial won't be fair. The four witnesses we  proposed have direct knowledge of why aid to Ukraine was delayed, and  the administration's request for Ukraine to conduct two investigations  for political reasons, they have direct knowledge of those facts.   We don't know, as I said, what kind of evidence they will present. It  may be incriminating. It may be exculpatory. It may influence how  Senators vote. It may not. But they certainly ought to be heard. By  virtue of their senior positions in the White House, each witness we  named was directly involved in the events that led to the charges made  by the House.   We have also proposed subpoenaing certain records, including emails  by certain key officials that are directly related to the charges  brought by the  [[Page S7063]]  House. I believe these documents are also of great importance to making  Senators have the information necessary to make a fully informed  decision, this terribly weighty decision.   The House has built a very strong case against the President. Maybe  that is why Leader McConnell doesn't seem to want witnesses--at least  not to agree to them now. Maybe that is why the President is afraid,  because the House case is so strong that they don't want witnesses who  might corroborate it.   The evidence the House put together includes public testimony given  under oath by numerous senior officials appointed by President Trump.  These are Trump appointees we are calling, not some partisan Democrat.   Some Republican Senators have said that while the charges are  serious, they haven't seen enough evidence to make a decision. That is  one of the reasons I proposed subpoenas for these witnesses and  documents--all directly relevant--from officials who have yet to  testify under oath during any stage of the House process.   Senators who oppose this plan will have to explain why less evidence  is better than more evidence. Let me say that again to every Senator in  this room, Democrat and Republican: Senators who oppose this plan will  have to explain why less evidence is better than more evidence, and  they are going to have to explain that position to a public that is  understandably skeptical when they see an administration suppressing  evidence and blocking senior officials from telling the truth about  what they know.   Let me repeat this Washington Post/ABC poll I read about in the paper  just this morning. Seventy-one percent of Americans believe the  President should allow his top aides to testify in a potential Senate  trial. Seventy-two percent of Independents and 64 percent of  Republicans--64 percent of Republicans--think President Trump should  allow his top aides to testify in a potential Senate trial--7 out of 10  Americans.   The American people have a wisdom, which seems to be lacking with  some of my colleagues, that a trial without witnesses is not a trial.  It is a rush to judgment. It is a sham trial.   The American people understand that a trial without relevant  documents is not a fair trial. Again, it is a desire not for sunlight  but for darkness to conceal facts that may well be very relevant.   The American people understand that if you are trying to conceal  evidence and block testimony, it is probably not because the evidence  is going to help your case. It is because you are trying to cover  something up.   President Trump: Are you worried about what these witnesses would  say? If you are not worried, let them come forward. And if you are  worried, we ought to hear from them.   Again, the Republican leader went on for 15, 20 minutes without  giving a single argument for why these witness shouldn't testify or  these documents shouldn't be produced--unless the President has  something to hide.   In the coming weeks, every Senator will have a choice: Do they want a  fair, honest trial that examines all the facts or do they want a trial  that doesn't let all of the facts come out?   We will have votes during this proceeding, should the House send it  to us--when they send it to us. After voting for it, we will have votes  on whether these people should testify and whether these documents  should be made public and part of the trial.   The American people will be watching. They will be watching. Who is  for an open and fair trial? Who is for hiding facts--relevant facts,  immediate facts? Who is for covering up?   I expect to discuss this proposal for a fair trial with Leader  McConnell, but each individual Senator will have both the power and the  responsibility to help shape what an impeachment trial looks like.   In Federalist 65, Alexander Hamilton wondered:         Where else than in the Senate could have been found a       tribunal sufficiently dignified, or sufficiently independent       [to serve as a court of impeachment]? What other body would       be likely to feel CONFIDENCE ENOUGH . . . to preserve unawed       and uninfluenced, the necessary impartiality?    My colleagues, Leader McConnell: Are you, in Alexander Hamilton's  words, unawed and uninfluenced to produce the necessary impartiality or  will you participate in a coverup?   Can we live up to Hamilton's fine words with dignity, independence,  and confidence to preserve the necessary impartiality to conduct a fair  trial? That question should weigh heavily upon every single Senator.                                appropriations    Before the week concludes, we must pass legislation to keep the  government open and provide appropriations for the following year.  Luckily, over the weekend, an agreement was reached between  appropriators--House and Senate, Democrat and Republican--that would  see us achieve that goal.   I am proud to report that the final appropriations agreements  includes several important Democratic priorities to help American  families.   Democrats have secured more than $425 million in election security  grants, nearly double the amount Senate Republicans reluctantly  supported in earlier legislation.   Democrats have secured an increase of $550 million in grants to help  offset the cost of childcare for low-income families.   Democrats have made progress on a number of fronts to combat climate  change: Record-level funding for clean energy and energy efficiency  programs; record-level funding to provide clean, electric buses; and  increased funding for climate change science and research.   For the first time in decades, Democrats have secured $25 million in  gun violence research at the CDC and NIH, breaking through what had  been a ridiculous ban on gun violence research.   Medical research, scientific research, environmental protection,  education, and housing programs will all see significant increases in  federal support.   Of course, we did not achieve everything we wanted. I am sorely  disappointed that we were unable to reach an agreement on more  resources to clean up PFAS contamination, a toxic chemical that has  plagued too many communities in my home State of New York and  communities across the country.   Senate Democrats have done a lot of hard work on this issue. Our  disappointment today will in no way diminish our resolve to force  Congress to take action on PFAS next year.                        national labor relations board    Yesterday, the term of National Labor Relations Board member Lauren  McFerran expired. For the first time in over 35 years, the Nation's  most important labor protection agency is now without a single  Democratic board member to defend labor rights.   For nearly eight decades, the NLRB has been the Nation's top agency  fighting for the protection of workers' rights, including the right to  form a union and collectively bargain for better wages, benefits, and  safer conditions. Over the past three years, as President Trump has  sought to undermine these protections, Democratic members of the Board  have been crucial in pushing back. The NLRB was designed to be  bipartisan, but I fear that with Ms. McFerran's departure, an all- Republican NLRB--without a strong pro-worker, pro-labor voice--will not  stand in the way of President Trump's dismantling of worker  protections, and may even help accelerate it.   The President has claimed to be a champion for working Americans, but  over the last 3 years, he has shown that he is anything but. From  opposing minimum wage increases to reversing rules that protect workers  on the job . . . to nominating people like Eugene Scalia to the  Department of Labor and Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, the  President has put powerful corporate interests before workers'  interests. Meanwhile, Senate Republicans have stonewalled Democratic  nominees to the NLRB. Working Americans will remember the record as  2020 fast approaches.                                    china    Last Friday, President Trump announced a temporary, partial trade  agreement with China. After 8 months of negotiations, it is stunning  how little this deal achieved for the United States at such a high cost  to American workers and businesses.   In exchange for a drastic reduction in our leverage, China has made  some short-term assurances to buy more agricultural products from us  without real commitments to end its most rapacious trade practices. It  appears that  [[Page S7064]]  President Trump has ordered a retreat while declaring victory.   I have been very open about praising President Trump's tough stance  on negotiating with China. To succeed in these high-stakes  negotiations, I have urged the President to stay tough and not settle  for photo ops or weak deals. I have said that he must be prepared to  walk away if China refuses to make significant, credible, and  enforceable concessions.   But under this new, temporary deal, President Trump is selling the  farm for a few magic soybeans. By USTR Lighthizer's admission, last  week's deal fails to make significant progress on ending China's worst  trade abuses, like intellectual property theft, forced technology  transfers, illegal dumping, and more. That is not nearly good enough.  And I worry that President Trump, by cutting this small, insubstantial  deal, has made the success of future, more difficult negotiations much  more doubtful.   I yield the floor.
