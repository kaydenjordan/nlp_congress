 Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Tennessee is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I regret that my good friend from Colorado  has offered this amendment. It was not voted on in either subcommittee  or in full committee. It should be rejected by this House, and rejected  overwhelmingly.   Why? We need to make sure that our missile defense works. This is not  a vote on whether we are for or against missile defense. I am strongly  for missile defense. I just want to make sure that it works. In the  National Defense Authorization Act of 2015, there is a strong section  in that act that requires that it work.   The gentleman's amendment is not supported by the Missile Defense  Agency, it is not supported by the Pentagon.   What it is is a vendor's dream, what it is is a defense contractor's  dream, because it would enable them to sell stuff to us, the American  taxpayer and to the citizens of this country, promising national  defense, but not proving it.   We need to fly it before we buy it. We need to test it before we  invest in it. We need to make sure that it works before we fork over  the dough.   If this loophole were to be established into law, allowing missiles  to be flown through this loophole, it would delight the defense  contractor industry. This is an amazing breach of what really, I think,  has been American law for 150 years.   Back during the Civil War, there was a law passed called the Lincoln  Law. And because so many Americans were outraged that the bullets sold  to the Union soldiers did not work and the cannonballs did not work and  the boots didn't last in the rain, they passed one of the toughest laws  ever passed by this Congress, to penalize defense contractors who sold  us stuff that did not work.   We need to make sure these missiles work. The gentleman is absolutely  correct. The threat from North Korea is real, the threat one day from  Iran could be real. We need to make sure these missiles work. And to  short-circuit, to obviate a testing requirement would be an appalling  thing for us to do.   This has been law since 2015. It is working, it works fine, the  Missile Defense Agency is all for it. Let's keep it. If it ain't broke,  don't fix it.   And to allow contractors to sell us stuff that is unproven, that is  not tested, that has not flown before we buy it, oh, my gosh, I  wouldn't want to be on that side of that transaction.   So the gentleman is an outstanding Member, he does great work. As I  say, this was not voted on in either subcommittee or full committee. It  would be a mistake for the full House to support this amendment at this  time.   So I would urge my colleagues to reject this amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, this Congress in 2015 passed this  requirement because it made sense.   Institutional memory can be short. The MDA is already exempt from  normal Pentagon acquisition processes. No one in this body should think  that MDA is subjected to the DOD 5000 regular acquisition rules.   What this amendment would do would be to short-circuit that process.  And which Member of this House in either party would want to admit to  the constituency that they represent that they voted to allow missiles  to be purchased by this country before we knew they would work?   The threat is real, and we need to be prepared for that threat and we  need defense missiles that work. Already the shot doctrine is several  to one. We have to shoot up four missiles and hope that we can stop the  one from coming over. We need things that actually work better than  that. We need to make sure this equipment that the U.S. taxpayer is  buying functions correctly.   We have already expedited the acquisition process for the MDA. Let's  not expedite it further. If our missile defenses don't work, we are all  in trouble. The Congress decided wisely and rightly in 2015.   The MDA, as I say, does not support this amendment. They have had  ample opportunity to come to us and say that they want more  flexibility, more freedom, they want things that work too. This House  should want things that work. So I urge my colleagues to support what  works and oppose this amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I know this amendment comes late in the  process and my colleagues are tired of hearing all these National  Defense Authorization Act amendments, but this one is really important.  Already the North Koreans threaten the United States. Other countries  could do so. We need to make sure that our missile defense works, and  our constituents will not accept excuses.   Now, as I say, defense contractors love this approach if they can  sell us something that is not proven to work, but this equipment must  work.                                time  1900    This Congress got it right in 2015. The MDA is on board with the  testing that they have to do. The process now works. Let's not change  it, and this amendment would change it for the worse. It would be a  defense contractor's dream.   Let's not cave in to the lobbyists, let's not give away the American  taxpayers' money, and let's make sure that the defense equipment we buy  works. By stopping this amendment, we will do so. This amendment would  be a giveaway to the defense contracting industry.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Tennessee has 15 seconds  remaining.    Mr. Chairman, Admiral Syring has been a great leader of  MDA. He did not request this change. Admiral Syring has done a great  job. Let's follow his lead, and let's reject this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Colorado  will be postponed.
