 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, as a proud Texan, I am proud to give my first remarks  on the floor of the United States House of Representatives today on the  important issue of border security, critical to my district and  critical to the State of Texas and our Nation.   Hundreds of thousands of people seek to come to this country, both  legally and illegally, each year. They are drawn to the hope of the  greatest free society the world has ever known. But we are in danger of  losing that which separates us from the other nations of the world, the  rule of law. Nowhere is that more pronounced than the chaos and the  lawlessness of our southern border.   Freedom cannot flourish in chaos. Prosperity cannot emerge from fear.  Yet, we have failed to secure our Nation because Members on both sides  of the aisle have buried their heads in the sand over the last several  decades, talking instead of doing. Americans are weary of our opinions  and ready to see us do the job we were sent here to do.   This isn't about numbers or statistics. It is about people. It is  about Jared Vargas, a vibrant young college student studying computer  science with dreams of working in the cybersecurity field. His life was  cut tragically short when he was brutally murdered by an illegal alien  in San Antonio last June.   Jared's mother, Lori; his twin brother; and his younger sister don't  care if I personally believe fences would be more effective than  drones, or vice versa. And they don't care if one of my colleagues  believes that 2,028 homicide charges against illegal aliens in 2018 is  not enough to justify a border wall. For them, one matters enough.   The Vargas family does care that Jared's murderer had been in ICE  custody twice and had been arrested for a DWI and released just a month  before he killed Jared.   This current debate before us has a face. It has a name. That name is  Jared. And his family wants justice for Jared.   But it is also about the little girl who, today, will be exploited by  drug cartels who know that sex trafficking can be more lucrative than  trafficking drugs.   It is about the young woman in Central America who saves money and  pays every last dime she has to someone who promises to take her to a  better life in America, only to be forced into a shipping container.  She wakes up in Greece to find that she has been sold into the  sex trade, and there is no one around her who speaks her language.    According to Doctors Without Borders, roughly one-third of women  making their way across the border are victims of sexual assault. I am  old enough to remember, as a Senate lawyer, when Senator Tom Coburn  spoke on the Senate floor in 2007 about rape trees. I find it  unacceptable that today, a decade later, the border is littered with  the clothes of new victims because we have failed to do anything as a  body, as a Congress.   In my visits to the border, one thing is clear: Dangerous cartels are  calling the shots. I was talking to a Border Patrol agent last summer.  He said:         I am down here at night. I am by myself. I have no cell, no       radio. I can't see the river  [[Page H590]]       through the thick cane. I can't drive along the river. And       the cartels have operational control of the border.    That is what we are sending our guys down on the river, in the Rio  Grande, to do to defend this Nation.   So it is time for us to put partisanship aside and secure our border.  Fences, cameras, radios, cell phones, more Border Patrol agents,  additional immigration judges, cleared cane, navigable roads along the  river, we need all these tools.   To be clear, that is what is in the President's plan. That is what we  are fighting to get. To be clear again, fences are a vital and  necessary part of that security.   It is absurd for anyone to argue that fences do not work, take your  pick of an example throughout history, from the walls around medieval  fortresses to the fencing around the White House and our military  installations today.   Ask a tort lawyer whether leaving your pool open, monitored by  drones, will save you from liability if a child falls in your pool.   The truth is, fences have worked since the dawn of time. Currently,  we have 46 miles of reinforced fencing along the San Diego sector of  the border. Before construction began in 1986, there were 630,000  arrests. Compare that to almost 32,000 arrests in 2016.   Fences work. Yet, 10 years ago, I heard members of the Senate  Judiciary Committee argue that fences don't work because migrants then  shifted from California to Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.   Only in Washington is that logic passable. Fences don't work because  they worked? That may have been the first time, though it won't be the  last, that I heard someone say fencing is a 1st or 3rd or 18th century  solution for a 21st century problem.   But in El Paso, in Yuma, in Tucson, in Israel, fencing was put in  place, and we have seen reductions of up to 90 percent or more in  illegal crossings.   This body has repeatedly authorized foreign assistance to our allies  to help them secure their borders. But, at the same time, the House is  crippled with inaction at securing our own.   We have repeatedly authorized fencing for the United States of  America, but we are here today trying to actually get it funded and get  it built. It is time to stop posturing about things that everybody in  America knows.   In Texas, let's stop talking. Let's go down to Brownsville. Let's  start building the fence where we need it and work our way up the  river.   To my colleague who was speaking early about, well, where is the  fence going to go? If we face an obstacle, let's discuss it. If a  rancher needs access to water, we consider leaving an opening, post a  guard, put up a camera, and then continue moving up the river.   Let's work together for one simple goal. The United States of America  should have operational control over its borders, not dangerous  cartels.   Many on both sides of the aisle like to pretend that we shouldn't  build a fence because it might be possible to go over or under it. Of  course, that is possible, but that is not a reason not to build a  fence.   The fundamental question is this: Are we more secure with agents and  drones, or are we more secure with agents, drones, and fences?   This is not a partisan issue; it is a humanitarian crisis. It is time  for us to stop bickering or hiding behind excuses and secure the border  now.   It is time for America to reclaim operational control of its border,  pay Federal workers who are doing their job, and make America secure  again.
