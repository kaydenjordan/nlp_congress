 Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to  discuss the threat of inflation on the future of America's economy.   In other places around the Capitol at this time, people are  discussing a new infrastructure bill. They are talking about a new 2022  budget. People talk about the importance of not raising taxes on the  poor. Earlier this year, they rejected a possible gas tax hike because  it would have fallen disproportionately on the poor. But there is no  surer way to penalize the poor of this country than to inflate the  currency.                                time  1830    Look at where we already are on other commodities: aluminum, lumber,  soybeans.   How are our young people going to buy that first house?   The cost of food, and even prepared food, is going up.   Why is that?   Take a look at the charts showing the amount of currency in banks. M1  currency, which is up by a factor of 5 times; not 5 percent, not 50  percent, but a factor of 5 times in the last year.   Look at M2, up 30 percent in the last year. Of course, the cost of  commodities is spiraling through the roof.   America is a wealthy country because our dollar has been the envy of  the world. But this Congress has not been acting like a Congress with  the world's reserve currency. This Congress is acting like the Congress  of a country such as Zimbabwe, and we all saw on TV what happened  there.   It is time for the people who are not only negotiating the  infrastructure bill, but negotiating the 2022 budget, to take into  account what they are doing to the poor of this country or the middle  class of this country as they inevitably stoke inflation.   Think of the people on almost fixed incomes, on Social Security.  Think of all of the people on pensions, who are locked in at $15,000 a  year, $20,000 a year, and think how their purchasing power will go down  if we continue along this path, including the bloated budget proposed  by President Biden himself.   We must rein in our spending. The poor and the middle class are the  ones paying the price. I beg the negotiators to stand up to the people  who think that printing hundreds of millions of dollars more in the  infrastructure bill or passing this bill with an excessively high  spending increase in the regular 2022 budget will not affect the  average guy. It is going to affect the average guy. It is going to  erode their savings. It will shrink the values of their pension or  Social Security. It will be a true disaster for middle class and poor  America.    Questions for Vice President Harris on Her Trip to the Southern Border     Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to,  first of all, applaud the fact that Vice President Harris is going to  the southern border. I don't know whether she has done this on her own  accord or with prodding from President Biden, but, either way, I am  glad she is going down there.   I have been to the border several times this year. I think it is very  difficult to learn all you should learn in one day. There are nine  sectors to the southern border, and what you learn in El Paso is very  different from what you learn in Yuma. It is very different from what  you learn in San Diego. It is very different from what you learn in  McAllen.   Nevertheless, I am glad she is going down there, and I would like to  make some suggestions for her, which we will forward to her as  questions she should be asking or things she should learn about the  southern border.   First of all, Madam Vice President, the Migrant Protection Protocols  caused the Mexican Government to hold asylum seekers on the south side  of the border. President Biden has since walked away from the protocol.  What effect did the nullification of this agreement with the Mexican  Government have on the number of people crossing the border? And what  effect will it have on the number of people from around the world who  will come here in the future?   Secondly, we also had Asylum Cooperative Agreements with Central  American countries that held people south not only of the Mexican  border, but south of Mexico. What effect did President Biden's ending  the Asylum Cooperative Agreements with Central American countries have  on the number of people entering southern Mexico? And what effect will  this have on people coming through Mexico from around the world?   Third, I want the Vice President to find out what type of drugs are  coming across the border. Has there been a change in the fraction of  marijuana versus fentanyl coming across the southern border? How lethal  is fentanyl?   Fourth, I hear horrific stories from the border guards as far as  women and girls being sexually assaulted on their journey through  Mexico. What percentage of women and girls are sexually assaulted as  they travel to enter the U.S. illegally?   Fifth, you will find when you get down there, Madam Vice President,  that families consist of adults and children, find out how many times a  family supposedly shows up and the Border Patrol suspects that the  children are not part of the family, and what happens when DNA tests  are given to children and the adults they are entering with?   Six, how much does it cost for the migrants to enter our country? And  by that, I mean how much are they having to pay the drug cartels? I  think you will find different numbers for the cost of a Mexican, a  Central American, a Brazilian, and Asian. But you should ask these  questions when you are on the southern border.   Seventh, got-aways are when people come in this country and have no  contact with the Border Patrol. As the Border Patrol must spend time  doing paperwork with the huge increase of unaccompanied children coming  here, has the number of got-aways, increased from this time last year  to now?   Eighth, I think you should look at some demonstrations with some  dogs. How effective are dogs in looking for fentanyl and other drugs,  and should we be purchasing more dogs in this budget?   Next, I ask you to look at the border wall which you will find is 30- feet high and 8 feet underground. Talk to the Border Patrol, talk to  ICE, talk to local law enforcement, and see what they think of that  wall and whether it would be worth expanding it or whether your  administration was right to just cut it off with equipment just sitting  in the open sun.   Next, Madam Vice President, you said you want to focus on the root  causes from countries whose citizens are coming here. I ask you to find  out what countries are sending its citizens here and which countries  have sent a significant amount of people. I think you are going to be  surprised that it is not just a matter of people coming here from  Mexico or Honduras. They are coming from around the world, but you  should report back on the number of countries you would have to improve  to prevent the demand from going up further to come here.    Next, in the opinion of the Border Patrol, have you and the  President's public comments during your campaign  [[Page H3130]]  and after the campaign had an impact on the number of people coming to  this country? I would ask members of the Border Patrol.   The twelfth question is: Have your comments, as well as the fact that  you have decided to take 13 weeks before you decided to go to the  border, had an effect on the morale of the Border Patrol? You and the  President have not visited the border, which I think is the biggest  crisis facing your administration since you were both sworn in. What do  they think about that, and what can you do to make up any dispiriting  of these brave people due to your inaction to this point?   Thirteen, and one of the scary things that I don't think we have  talked about: Ask the Border Patrol if they keep track of how many  people drown in the Rio Grande trying to come here every year, and how  many people dehydrate in the Arizona or New Mexico or Texas deserts as  they try to come here.   And, finally, look for what policies we can implement from Washington  to make your job of securing the border easier.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
