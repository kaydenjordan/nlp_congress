 Mr. President, thank you very much. I wanted to rise today  to talk about a matter that has come before the Senate in the bill that  we are considering, the United States Innovation and Competition Act. I  rise to talk about a particular amendment that I have been working on.  It is amendment No. 1853. Of course I urge the Senate to act quickly to  approve this amendment to protect our supply chains that are critical  to the national security of the United States.   I wanted to explain what the origin of this amendment has been. It  goes all the way back to the beginning of the pandemic, the worst  public health crisis in over 100 years in our Nation. At that time, as  so many Americans remember, we watched in horror as access to masks,  gloves, gowns, and even more sophisticated equipment, like ventilators  and other critical supplies--when all of that was necessary for  pandemic response, all of a sudden, it dried up.   The reason why we had such a shortage of supplies and personal  protective equipment and the like was that supply chains were delayed,  and those supply chains, of course, were originating in China, which we  know is a country where the government is run by the Chinese Communist  Party. That same ruling party and that government even tightened  restrictions on the exports of masks and other personal protective  equipment.   So we learned the hard way, the very hard way, just how dependent our  supply chains are on goods originating in China. We learned how  vulnerable we  [[Page S3483]]  all are, our Nation was and is, to the Chinese Government's whims,  really the whim of the Communist Party in China, because it is a fact  that they control the companies that produce and export the critical  supplies we depend upon.   This amendment, amendment 1853, which, by the way, is bipartisan in  ways that you don't see very much of in the Senate these days--three  Democrats and three Republicans coming together on this bipartisan  amendment. It is an effort to enhance our national security at its  core. That is what it is about, enhancing our national security, but  unfortunately corporate forces are blocking it. They are even blocking  a vote on it. They don't, apparently, want to see a vote on this bill,  and they also don't want to include it in an agreement between both  sides when the bill is about to be completed in a so-called managers'  package as part of the bill.   We just want to get it done because I am interested in and my five  cosponsors from both parties are interested in protecting U.S. national  security.   What we read today in a publication, POLITICO Pro, the morning trade  edition--I am just holding up a copy of it here, and I will just make  reference to it. I don't think we have to add all of it to the Record,  but here is the lead for POLITICO Pro this morning. The lead says this:         Trade groups representing some of the country's largest       corporations are staunchly opposing a Senate proposal that       would subject U.S. companies to a Federal review before they       can make certain investments in China or relocate critical       manufacturing capabilities there.    And then in the body of the report, when it gets down to reporting in  detail who is opposing this amendment and what they are saying, it says  that this amendment has ``riled up big business.''   ``Riled up big business.'' Just imagine that. Big corporations riled  up because a bipartisan group of Senators is coming together to protect  national security, and they are riled up. They don't seem to support us  in this.   Here is what one of the organizations that would go on the record--of  course, you have a lot of big corporations that are hiding behind trade  groups--trade associations, I should say. They don't have the guts to  stand up and oppose this. They are hiding behind organizations.   Here is one of the organizations, and I am quoting Anna Ashton, vice  president of government affairs at the U.S.-China Business Council.  Here is what they have to say:         We long have said that national security should not be       defined in a vague way.    ``Vague way.'' We are not vague in this. We are very clear. And then  she goes on to criticize it.   So what are we talking about here? We are talking about an effort to  protect U.S. national security not just in the context of the pandemic  but more broadly. We have had corporations for more than a generation  now offshoring work and business to China and other places. Because  they are seeking cheaper production and labor costs, these companies  have been moving production of manufactured goods overseas, often to  China. When you move your supply chain overseas, you are at the mercy  of the laws and regulations of the country you move to, and in this  case, you are at the mercy of the Chinese Communist Party.   Now, this isn't a big problem when offshoring goes to allied or  liberal democracies, allied or liberal democratic countries, but it  does become a problem when the offshoring goes to foreign adversaries  like China and Russia that don't play by the rules.    So how do we solve the problem? How do we ensure that the panic and  the powerlessness that we all experienced way back in the spring of  2020 and beyond--how do we make sure that doesn't happen again? How do  we make sure that the most powerful Nation in the world, the most  powerful Nation in human history, is not at the mercy of the Chinese  Communist Party or the Russian Federation or any other country--at  their mercy not just generally but at their mercy for something as  simple as personal protective equipment, gowns and gloves and masks?  How do we make sure we are never in that predicament again?   Well, one of the things we need to do is have a process to screen  outbound investment. We have had for the better part of 50 years a  screen for inbound investment, OK? We have a committee that has done  that since the midseventies. All we are doing here with this amendment  is putting in place an outbound investment screen so that outbound  investment screen will make sure that our national security interests  are not compromised.   We don't want to create further dependency on supply chains that are  located in the countries--where the country is a foreign adversary.   So this amendment 1853 is modeled after legislation that I authored a  few years ago, the National Critical Capabilities Defense Act, where we  have reintroduced a bipartisan bill with Senator Cornyn, the senior  Senator from Texas.   I mentioned earlier that this is three Democrats and three  Republicans on this amendment--Senator Cornyn, as I made reference to;  Senator Stabenow, Democrat from Michigan; Senator Rubio, Republican  Senator from Florida; Senator Kaine, Democrat from Virginia; and  Senator Tillis, Republican Senator from North Carolina. They have all  supported an amendment that would establish this process to screen  outbound investments and the offshoring of critical supply chains to  foreign adversaries like China and Russia to ensure the resiliency of  critical U.S. supply chains.   It would require that companies disclose before--before--they  offshore national critical capabilities to foreign adversary--foreign  adversaries, plural. So it is a commonsense approach to deal with a  problem that preexists the pandemic but came into sharp focus when we  were totally at the mercy of the Chinese Communist Party.   The review process is designed to identify vulnerabilities and to  provide a suite of recommendations to the President, and it emphasizes  remedial action such as support to domestic industries, like increased  research and development investment, utilization of manufacturing  institutes, among others.   The proposal encourages supply chain diversity, and the bill is  limited in scope, only covering foreign adversaries like China and  Russia. It is limited in its purview. It looks only at national  critical capacities.   The amendment establishes an interagency committee led by the U.S.  Trade Representative to oversee the review process for capacities that  are deemed ``critical'' to U.S. national security.   This committee would focus on outbound investment or offshoring of  these critical capacities, supply chains, domestic production, and  manufacturing to foreign adversaries. I would note the committee would  not--would not--review outbound investments to allied countries or any  country not on the affirmative list.   The amendment would also establish a process to conduct outgoing--I  am sorry--ongoing evaluation of critical supply chains. In short, the  amendment would ensure the United States can respond to the needs of  our Nation and those who may call upon us in times of crisis.   But here is the problem: This commonsense, bipartisan amendment, in a  town that doesn't do a lot of bipartisanship, is being opposed by  corporate interests. Powerful corporate interests are opposed to this  amendment and, in some cases, are actively working against it to shut  it down.   There has been a whisper campaign by corporate lobbyists to kill this  bipartisan amendment that protects our national security. They are  lobbying against an amendment--against an amendment--that will ensure  the United States has better visibility on supply chain vulnerabilities  so we can respond to the needs of our Nation and those who call upon us  in these times of crisis.   If a company wants to offshore semiconductors to China, we need to  know about it, and the President could block it if that activity is a  risk to national security. Yet business interests like the U.S. Chamber  of Commerce and the U.S.-China Business Council are organizing against  this commonsense proposal.   And, as I mentioned earlier, these groups of big corporations are  hiding behind their trade associations to do the work that they are  doing. They are fearmongering, and they are spreading  [[Page S3484]]  misinformation. This effort is not surprising because often you have  that in Washington. We have interests that come together, even in the  face of something that would help our national security.   Our Nation and workers pay dearly when companies prioritize their  bottom line over supply chain resiliency and security. When they  offshore jobs and technology to foreign adversaries like China, our  country pays for that, pays dearly.   I mentioned the U.S.-China Business Council and their opposition. The  association for businesses--that is what this is--the association for  businesses in China--businesses in China, and they are opposing.   So they have got a basic choice to make here, not just that  organization but any organization in any company. It is a real simple  choice. You can choose national security and a commonsense way to do  that, in a bipartisan amendment, or you can just choose profits in  places controlled by foreign adversaries. It is a real simple choice.  This is not complicated. They will try to make it complicated, but it  is not.   Let me start to address some of their arguments. I mentioned earlier  that the industry says that covered products are defined in a ``vague  way''--a ``vague way.'' That is what they say.   That is not true. We provide specifics on personal protective  equipment, medical equipment, goods that are critical to the  electricity grid or disaster preparedness, and we expect a robust  rulemaking process. Everyone knows that. When you pass a bill like this  or a policy like this, rulemaking follows. We specifically and clearly  state that rulemaking needs to provide specifics for firms to  understand what and when--what they need to disclose and when they need  to disclose it.   We limit review exclusively to foreign adversaries like China and  Russia. If a U.S. firm is offshoring critical capacities to a foreign  adversary, the U.S. Government should know about it.   But again, that only applies to outbound investment to foreign  adversaries. We are not talking about outbound investment to Germany.  We are not talking about outbound investment to Canada or Australia. We  are talking about China and Russia here.   So we took business comments, and we took edits from business groups  around the country. We tried to ensure it was specific to threats while  also providing flexibility for the administration to adapt and to  adjust.   So what is Big Business really opposing? They are opposing better  visibility on when they offshore these critical capacities to a, in  this case, Chinese Communist Party, a Communist country, that happens  to be a foreign adversary in so many areas of our bilateral  relationship. They are opposing better visibility on engagement with a  government that is involved in gross human rights abuses and forced  labor and oppression of its people.   The old expression ``Sunlight is the best disinfectant'' applies  here. Why would we allow a U.S. company to take an action that  compromises our national security and disaster preparedness? So we  engaged in good faith in taking reasonable comments from these big  business associations. Businesses offshoring critical capacities to  foreign adversaries should be everyone's concern, not just the concern  of six Senators in the Senate and some others who have spoken in favor   Big name-brand companies don't want their names attached to this  effort. That is why they are hiding behind their trade associations.  But I want to be clear with them and clear to those who are listening.  We know who you are; we know what companies are behind this; and we  know what you are doing.   I am going to continue to work to pass this amendment or, if it ends  up in a bill form, we are going to pass it because we are going to take  steps here in the U.S. Senate, in a bipartisan fashion, to protect U.S.  national security in this fashion. We are not going away.   So if these business groups think they are making progress today, we  are going to defeat you. So just get ready for it because we are going  to defeat you.   Now, I will hold some comments that I was going to make about some  others who are opposing this. I will limit my comments today.   I want to just conclude with this thought. A lot of Members of this  body talk really tough about China. They act tough with China. They  give a lot of speeches. You know, there is a lot of hot air about  China. They go on television and talk about it, but then sometimes when  it comes to taking on big interests, they cut and run. I would hope  that those three Republican Senators aren't the only Senators on their  side who are willing to stand up for this critical national security  issue.   Again, it is a real simple choice. It is national security or getting  profits at the mercy of a Chinese Communist Party. We are asking for a  vote on this amendment.   I yield the floor.
