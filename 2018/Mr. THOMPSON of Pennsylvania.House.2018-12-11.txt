 Mr. Speaker, yesterday I proudly signed  the farm bill conference committee report because, after years of hard  work, we are set to deliver a win for rural America. Quite frankly, it  is a win for all Americans who count daily on access to affordable,  high-quality, safe food.   We know that farm country is hurting. USDA recently announced that  net farm income for this year is dropping by 12 percent to levels we  have not seen since 2002. There is hope though. By passing the farm  bill conference report, we can give producers and their lenders  certainty. They will know what farm policy will be in place for the  next 5 years.   We also made modest adjustments to the Marketing Assistance Loan  program to help with cash flow after harvest and to providing marketing  for U.S. commodities.   There are also important enhancements to dairy policy included in the  conference report. Building upon investments made to the dairy safety  net as part of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, we are offering new  coverage levels for the first 5 million pounds of production, which  drastically reduces premiums on certain levels for larger producers.   These are just some of the many updates in the 2018 farm bill that  will set our American farmers on a better path for the next 5 years.   The 2018 farm bill strengthens the farm safety net, protects crop  insurance, maintains and preserves conservation funding, improves SNAP  program integrity and incentivizes work, and, importantly, provides  certainty to rural America.   This agreement reached between the House and the Senate strengthens  and maintains important programs like the Price Loss Coverage, the  Agriculture Risk Coverage, marketing loans, dairy margin coverage,  livestock disaster programs, and crop insurance.   As vice chairman of the committee, I know that a lot of work went  into building and negotiating a great bill for our farm families. I  would like to thank Chairman Mike Conaway and Ranking Member Collin  Peterson for their commitment to passing this bill in 2018.   This Congress, I proudly chaired the Nutrition Subcommittee. The  House bill included provisions to give many Americans the skills needed  to obtain a family-sustaining job.   While this conference report is a compromise, it does include  significant incremental victories that will improve the integrity of  the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, so it will be  more effective for those who truly need it. The Nutrition Subcommittee  hosted 21 hearings on SNAP and heard from more than 80 witnesses on how  to improve the program and work toward the ultimate goal of ending  hunger in America.   Mr. Speaker, make no mistake. The 2018 farm bill makes real  improvements to our Nation's largest antihunger program. These  provisions will only further enhance the program so it will be there  for the most vulnerable among us, the truly needy.   Now, I am hopeful that we can continue this conversation and soon  revisit numerous provisions from the House farm bill's nutrition title.  Specifically, there is so much more that can be done through SNAP to  help more Americans find good-paying, family-sustaining jobs--an  ultimate food security. That is the American way.   The farm bill conference report also helps improve our response to  natural disasters, including catastrophic wildfires that have ravaged  parts of the Nation. To help encourage new markets for domestic forest  products, the conference report invests in research  [[Page H10033]]  and development specifically for these new wood-based materials.                                time  1015    We put emphasis on connecting rural America through significant  improvements to broadband delivery. We are dedicating funding to rural  health projects to help Americans struggling with opioid addictions and  other substance abuse disorders.   This is just some of what is included in the conference report. There  is much more policy included that provides key wins for producers,  rural communities, and American consumers.   I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this conference report and  deliver much-needed certainty to rural America and all Americans who  are in need of affordable, high-quality, and safe food.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, one of our finest holiday  traditions will take place this Saturday: Wreaths Across America.   Many Americans can recall the iconic photograph of wreaths on the  tombstones at Arlington National Cemetery. Snow blankets the ground,  red ribbons adorn the wreaths that lay on the rows of tombstones as far  as the eye can see.   This annual tribute began in 1992 by a Maine wreath maker named  Morrill Worcester, who donated 5,000 wreaths to Arlington National  Cemetery in honor of our fallen heroes.   Today, Wreaths Across America has grown into a national organization.  A total of 1.2 million wreaths were placed on markers across the  country last year in more than 1,400 locations, with more than 200,000  at Arlington alone.   The mission is to remember, honor, and teach.   As we celebrate with our loved ones, let us remember all of our  military men and women, especially those we have lost in service to  this Nation.   Thank you to Morrill and to all the volunteers who honor their  memory.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank all of our troops serving at home and  overseas and wish them a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.                            ____________________
