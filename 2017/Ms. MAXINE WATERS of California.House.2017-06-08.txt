 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   H.R. 10 is being called the ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act by the American  public because this bill is truly the wrong choice for all of us.  Indeed, this is one of the worst bills I have seen in my time in  Congress.   This bill is a vehicle for Donald Trump's agenda to deregulate and  help out Wall Street. It destroys nearly all of the important policies  we put in place in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer  Protection Act to prevent another financial crisis and protect  consumers. This bill would create vast harm and lead us right back to  the bad old days.   We all remember the suffering that resulted from the Great Recession:  $13 trillion in household wealth was lost; 11 million people lost their  homes; the unemployment rate hit 10 percent. The impact was enormous  and felt by all. This bill would pave the way back to economic damage  of the same scale--or worse.   The ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act guts the highly successful Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau, which works to make sure that hardworking  Americans are not subjected to predatory practices in the financial  marketplace.   Since its creation, the Consumer Bureau has returned nearly $12  billion to more than 29 million consumers who have been ripped off by  financial institutions. This bill would foolishly put a stop to the  Consumer Bureau's good work and once again leave consumers vulnerable.   That is not all. Across the board, the ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act removes  essential Dodd-Frank protections for consumers, investors, and our  economy.                                time  1245    Despite what Republicans will tell you, banks large and small are  doing just fine since the passage of Dodd-Frank. Last year, they posted  record profits. Here is the bottom line: Donald Trump and Republicans  want to open the door to another economic catastrophe like the Great  Recession and return us to a financial system where reckless and  predatory practices harm our families and communities. We cannot allow  that to happen.   Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this  catastrophically bad bill.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, the Speaker and Mr.  Hensarling would have you think this is all about community banks being  hurt, but let me tell you what this is all about.   U.S. and foreign banks have paid more than $160 billion in penalties  to resolve cases brought against them by the Justice Department and  Federal regulatory agencies for cases involving collusion, fraud  against consumers, bribery, and other abuses.  [[Page H4718]]    There were 144 major cases of $100 million or more against 26 large  U.S. and foreign banks. Just look at this: Bank of America, $56  billion; J.P.Morgan, $28 billion; Citigroup, $15 billion; Wells Fargo-- and you know about Wells Fargo and what they did--$11 billion; Goldman  Sachs, $9 billion; Morgan Stanley, $5 billion. This is about rip-offs,  so this bill will prevent us from being able to assess these kinds of  penalties on those who are ripping off the American public.   Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr.  Clay), ranking member of the Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit  Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to  the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Perlmutter), ranking member of the  Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade Subcommittee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee), the vice ranking member of the  Committee on Financial Services.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to  the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez), who is the ranking  member of the Small Business Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Al Green), who is the ranking member of  the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to  the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore), who is the ranking member  of the Monetary Policy and Trade Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I have just got to  stop some of this misrepresentation.   Exempt from CFPB's supervision and enforcement, Wall Street reform-- that is Dodd-Frank--recognizes community banks and credit unions have a  small number of employees and a better consumer protection track  record; thus, they are carved out from the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau's supervision.                                time  1315    The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's supervision and  enforcement focuses on the largest banks that they won't talk about  here today and non-banks that compete with small banks and credit  unions.   Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Meeks), a senior member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. David Scott), one of our senior members of  the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to  the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott), the ranking member of the  Education and the Workforce Committee.    Mr. Chairman, the gentleman asked:  Who does not support this bill?   Let me tell him: advocates, experts, civil rights groups, labor  groups, veterans groups, pension plans, and company shareholders.   We also received a petition urging a ``no'' vote from more than  220,000 concerned Americans.   Let me just say that AARP hates this bill. That is who opposes this  bill.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Sherman), a senior member of the committee on Financial Services.                                time  1330     Mr. Chairman, continuing to remind  Mr. Duffy who opposes this bill, the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the  United States of America opposes this bill.   I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the  distinguished Democratic whip.    I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Massachusetts (Mr. Capuano), a senior member of the Financial  Services Committee.    Mr. Chairman, continuing to answer  Mr. Duffy about who opposes this bill, the Fleet Reserve Association,  which includes the Navy, the Marine Corps, and the Coast Guard.   With that, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  Lynch), a senior member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to  the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Delaney), a member of the Financial  Services Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty), a member of the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Chair, we have already debunked  what we have been told by the opposition about the oversight, CFPB's  supervision and enforcement. Of course, we have told you about that.  Let's take a moment to tell you that community banks have showed  strength in residential, commercial, industrial loans, and small- business lending. In fact, overall loan growth at community banks has  been faster than at bigger banks. In the fourth quarter of 2016,  lending was up 8.3 percent for community banks and 4.8 percent for  larger banks.   Mr. Chair, with that, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Illinois  (Mr. Foster), a member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to  how much time I have remaining?    Mr. Chairman, since it has been  asked about who opposes this bill, I wanted to make sure that we  include in our information to them the religious organizations. The  Congregation of St. Joseph, the Seventh Generation Interfaith Coalition  for Responsible Investment, the Dominican Sisters of Houston, the  Sisters of Mercy, the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility,  the Christian Brothers Investment Services, the National Association of  Evangelicals, the American Baptist Home Mission Society, and the Mercy  Investment Services all urge a ``no'' vote on this terrible bill.   Mr. Chairman, with that, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Heck), a senior member now--he has been there for a  while--of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Chairman, the Members on the  opposite side of the aisle have come here talking about what they are  doing for small banks and how they are against the big banks. Let me  tell you about a letter that was sent yesterday, June 7, from the  American Bankers Association. They said: ``We are pleased that this  legislation contains provisions that ABA and our member banks have long  supported.''   Who are their members? JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Bank  of America. Wall Street loves this bad bill.   I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison), a  senior progressive champion of the Financial Services Committee.                                time  1400     Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gonzalez), a new member of the Financial  Services Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to  the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Crist), a new member of the Financial  Services Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to  the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Kihuen), a new member of the Financial  Services Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to  the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Demings).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to  the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to  the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to  the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).
