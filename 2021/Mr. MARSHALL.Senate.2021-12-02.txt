 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 4868 and ask  that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, this amendment is simple. It prohibits  moneys from this bill to be used to fund or enforce the White House's  COVID vaccine mandates on the American people for the duration of the  CR.   As a physician, I have always supported the vaccine, and I encourage  Americans to talk to their doctor about getting vaccinated and about  the booster. But whether to receive the vaccine or not is a personal  choice. It should not be mandated via unconstitutional Executive  actions that the administration acknowledged earlier this year they  didn't have the authority to put in place.   No precedent exists in American history for punishing private  employers who don't enforce government vaccine edicts. As we all know,  multiple Federal courts have put a stop to the OSHA mandate, as well as  the Federal contractor and CMS mandates.   What is more, thank goodness, the White House even delayed  implementing their mandate for Federal workers until after the  holidays. This is an opportunity to right a wrong--for each Member in  this body to right a wrong. Let's get employers certainty and employees  peace of mind that they will still have a job this new year.   Make no mistake, these vaccine mandates are not about public health  or science. If they were, the White House would recognize the 92  percent of Americans--92 percent of Americans--who already built up  immunity to this virus between vaccines and natural immunity.   Beside me is a photo of upset union workers in Topeka, KS. These are  people who keep our electricity on and houses warm in the winter. These  are hard-working Americans who put their lives on the line throughout  the pandemic. Tonight, I am their voice. I am their voice and I am  proud to be here to keep fighting for them, for their families, and  their right to earn a living in this greatest country in the world.   Tonight, I ask my colleagues to join me in this fight and support our  amendment and avoid an economic shutdown, avoid brownouts, further  supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, higher inflation, and  weakening our national security.   I yield the floor.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I rise today to honor and  recognize a young Kansan who has truly gone above and beyond to help  others, Ms. Avery Herrmann from Sabetha, KS.   Avery has been making jewelry since 2017 to help support the Kansas  Honor Flight. She first began designing jewelry after developing  staphyloma in her right eye. Doctors had told her and her mother, Mary,  that Avery should pick up a hobby to help keep her motor functions  developing properly. Mary had made jewelry herself as a child, so she  showed Avery the tools of the trade, and she hasn't stopped since.   For a while, Avery had kept up with jewelry making for personal use,  but the death of her grandfather Robert in 2016 showed her what she  could do to make a difference with her skills. Robert was a Korean war  veteran who had previously gone on an Honor Flight himself, which was  one of his most memorable experiences. After his passing, Avery started  Abundant Love jewelry as a tribute to her grandfather and a way to  support veterans in her community. With this new business, she began  selling earrings online and at various fundraising events. To date,  Avery has raised almost $7,000 through Abundant Love.   Stories like Avery's are what truly show the best of Kansas. I have  met with countless veterans on Honor Flights, and each has their own  unique and incredible experience like Robert. Avery already is selfless  in making and selling her earrings to benefit Honor Flight, but what  truly makes this project extraordinary is that she doesn't take a penny  for herself. Every single dollar made from Abundant Love goes directly  to Honor Flight's benefit. Whether she knows it or not, those veterans  appreciate what she does for them, and I join them in showing my  appreciation for Avery. I now ask my colleagues to join in me in  recognizing Avery for her outstanding service for our Nation's  heroes.                            ____________________
