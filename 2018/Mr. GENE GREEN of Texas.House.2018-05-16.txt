 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the  farm bill and the Republican majority's scorched earth and  irresponsible  [[Page H3989]]  approach to a historically bipartisan bill.   Throughout this Congress, the Republican majority has cast aside  bipartisan efforts by keeping Democrats out of negotiations. The farm  bill is no different.   From sabotaging the Affordable Care Act to giving wealthy families  and corporations a tax break at the cost of hardworking families, to  make deep cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP,  this bill is on a dangerous path. We need to return to bipartisan  discussion that made the farm bill a win-win for both urban and rural  communities.   If this bipartisan bill becomes law, roughly 265,000 low-income  children will lose access to free school meals, and more than 1 million  Americans will no longer receive a benefit they rely on to buy food. We  can do better because America's farmers and children deserve better.   We have a farm bill every 5 years. Is it worth kicking children and  families off SNAP? No, Mr. Speaker.                            ____________________
