 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the work of the  Regional Leadership Council. My colleagues and I just got back to D.C.  after an extended work period in our districts. It was a busy, busy  time in the south metro of Minnesota but also across the Midwest.   To me, being busy is a really good thing. Busy means things are  happening, small businesses are opening roundtable discussions, ribbon  cuttings, shovels in dirt, townhalls, and, yes, a whole lot of  harvesting is about to be happening across the Midwest, including corn  and soybeans across my congressional district.   However, this work period was busy for a very particular reason. We  passed the 1-year anniversary of the Inflation Reduction Act, and we  were able to celebrate the benefits that this legislation has already  brought home, and, in particular, to rural communities.   I am going to take a minute and put this legislation into perspective  about what it has already done and what it will continue to do for  Midwest communities. Let me start with the Inflation Reduction Act's  historic investment in homegrown biofuels infrastructure, the largest  this Nation has ever made. E-15 and biofuel production are key for our  ag communities and environments. They expand markets for family farmers  and support economic growth in rural communities. They are a solution  that we have available today to help us address climate change.                                time  1900    Across Region 3, these credits are providing family farmers and  producers with the support and resources that they need to sustain and  grow their operations, enabling them to continue feeding and fueling  our country.   Earlier this summer, the Department of Agriculture awarded their  first awardees for the IRA's Higher Blend Fuels Infrastructure Program.  Half of the awards went to States in Region 3 alone.   The signing of the Inflation Reduction Act also signaled a historic  investment in our Nation's infrastructure. Infrastructure investments  are a win-win for America's workers, businesses, and communities. They  just make sense.   Here in Minnesota, we have received $3.8 billion in infrastructure  and clean energy investments, including Federal dollars to make our  roads, our bridges, public transits, and airports safer, deploy clean  water projects, and provide broadband funding to make sure our rural  communities can access the high-speed internet they deserve. These are  investments we are building on right here in Region 3.   We have about $1 billion heading to Wisconsin. If you know anything  about Minnesota, we are very competitive with Wisconsin, but as a  Region 3 representative, I am so proud to say that those dollars are  going to the Midwest through the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment  Program to provide high-speed internet to 253,000 homes and small  businesses; $73 million heading to Michigan through the Bipartisan  Infrastructure Law's Bridge Investment Program to replace the 85-year- old Lafayette Avenue Bridge, which serves as a critical passage point  in the State's economy, and the list, of course, goes on.   Each of these infrastructure projects will play a critical role in  building a safer, stronger America. I personally cannot wait to see  every single one of them come to life.   Mr. Speaker, I will end with a personal privilege.   I spent about 20 years working in the medtech industry, and since  entering Congress, working to lower healthcare costs have been one of  my highest priorities.   Given that, I thought I would just end my remarks by sharing a story  of a constituent of mine, a man named Bob Miller.   Bob relies on Medicare, and for years, about a decade, he has relied  on a prescription drug to treat his debilitating MS flare-ups. For over  a decade, Bob has seen the price of his drug skyrocket and was  ultimately forced to stop taking the drug that he relies on because  even with insurance, the price of that drug was just too expensive.   Bob's story is heartbreaking but unsurprising. We all know people  across America who have to make those same critical decisions each and  every day. Because here in the richest country in the world, people  like Bob have been forced to make the decision to forego life- sustaining medications because it is just too expensive.   When we passed the Inflation Reduction Act, we allowed Medicare the  power to start negotiating drug prices across our country; good old- fashioned competition to help lower drug costs for our seniors.   I don't understand for the life of me how my colleagues cannot be in  favor of good old-fashioned competition.   Many American seniors are now and will be able to live happier,  healthier lives as a result of this legislation.   That, Mr. Speaker, deserves to be celebrated. I look forward to  continuing to see the benefits of all of these important pieces of  legislation, and I thank the gentleman from Maryland for convening us.
