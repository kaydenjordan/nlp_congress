 Mr. Speaker, the only sanctuary involved here today is  the sanctuary that this sorry bill provides for prejudice. This is the  Trump counterpart to the outrageous SB4 that Governor Greg Abbott has  been promoting in Texas. It all goes back to the rhetoric of last year  about the ``bad hombres'' and the attacks on Mexico and Mexicans.   I will tell you, I want the bad hombres off the street no matter  where they come from, but I look to my local police chiefs, to my local  sheriffs and law enforcement officers to tell me what the best way is  to protect our families from crime. They say maintaining the confidence  of the immigrant community is vital, and that measures like this, which  simply have politicians in Washington interfering with and attempting  to intimidate local law enforcement officers, do exactly the opposite  of what all these speeches claim that they do.   Anti-immigrant hysteria, what a way to leave for July Fourth from a  Congress that has accomplished practically nothing but to attack  immigrants as we depart instead of standing by and supporting local law  enforcement and making our communities safe.
