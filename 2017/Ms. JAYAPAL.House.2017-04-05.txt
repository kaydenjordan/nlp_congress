 Mr. Speaker, I thank the Congresswoman so much for her  leadership and for her work on all of these issues.  [[Page H2739]]    I was listening to the gentlewoman as I came in and thinking that I  couldn't agree with the gentlewoman more on, first of all, the need for  us to do a lot of work to continue to increase our presence and our  ability to really effect policy decisions in the best ways, but also to  celebrate the accomplishments of Jeannette Rankin as well as all of the  Congress Members that are here.   I am so proud to represent the Seventh District in Seattle. When I  ran for the State senate, it was my first run for elective office. I  became the only woman of color in the State senate. But our State has  traditionally been very strong with women's leadership. We are  fortunate to have two women Senators. We have had a woman Governor and  a woman mayor of the city of Seattle. So we have, I think, made some  strides that have been very important to the well-being and the welfare  of our State.   Unfortunately, we have taken some steps backwards in the last couple  of years. The numbers of women in legislative office at the State level  have gone down, but I do believe that Republican and Democratic women,  together, have put together a strong agenda for the things that we care  about around families.   I am very pleased to have already worked with one of the members of  your caucus across the aisle, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, on a letter around  domestic violence victims and the immigration system. I am very pleased  about the work that the gentlewoman has championed and that we intend  to, together, lead around making sure that families have security for  themselves and for their children.   I rise to congratulate the gentlewoman for what the gentlewoman is  speaking about today, for the work that the gentlewoman has done, and  to say that I remain very committed to trying to find all of the areas  where we women, together, can put forward priorities that are important  to us.   We do joke that, if they would just turn the keys of all elective  office over to women, I think we would get a lot of things done--and no  disrespect to our incredible male colleagues who have been right there  with us every step of the way. So I am looking forward to this time  here in the House of Representatives.   I am proud to also be the first Indian-American woman ever elected to  the House of Representatives. I think that as we think about getting  women into office, we also should continue our work on making sure that  women of color enter elective office and that the representation of  people here in this great Chamber that we are so honored to serve in  reflects the representation that we have across the country of women,  of people of color, of African Americans--as the gentlewoman mentioned  in her speech--of immigrants, and, actually, of people who have been  born outside of the United States. I think I am one of just about a  dozen Members of Congress who were not born in the United States but  have the great honor and privilege of becoming a United States citizen  and now serving in this great body where only 11,000 or so people have  served before in the history of our country.   So I thank the gentlewoman again for her leadership. I look forward  to working with the gentlewoman. I appreciate her yielding in her  Special Order hour. Hopefully, it is a great symbol of the things we  can do together.    Not on Foreign Affairs, unfortunately, but we work on  immigration issues together.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my good colleague from Maryland  (Mr.  [[Page H2742]]  Raskin). It has been such a pleasure since coming to Congress--and it  seems difficult to believe that it has been almost 3 months--but it has  been such a pleasure to co-lead this Special Order hour with the  gentleman and to really bring to the public all of the issues that we  feel are so important in the Progressive Caucus, issues that have  ranged from the issue we are talking about now with the Supreme Court  nomination, to issues around health care, immigration, the Muslim ban,  and many others.   I think that the vision that we are trying to make sure people  understand for the Progressive Caucus and certainly for Democrats is a  vision of inclusion, a vision that respects the rights of everybody,  regardless of what gender you are, regardless of what race or religion  you might be.   This moment is, in fact, very important. Tomorrow, Senate Republicans  will attempt to push through President Trump's Supreme Court nominee  Neil Gorsuch. I stand with my colleague, Mr. Raskin, and with our other  Democratic colleagues in the Senate who are opposing this nomination  because I truly believe that confirming Neil Gorsuch to this position  would be a devastating backslide for numerous communities.   I want to go through some of the communities that would be affected  and how. Women, people of color, people living with disabilities and  members of the LGBTQ community will have to wonder if the conservative  majority on the Supreme Court is going to systematically remove their  protections and strip them of their rights.   Unfortunately, Neil Gorsuch, though an accomplished justice in his  own right, does have a track record of doing that throughout his  judicial career. So this isn't as simple as saying: Well, you blocked  our nominee; therefore, we are going to block your nominee.   No. This is about the issues and the refusal he has had to answer  some of the questions before the committee.   I did want to reflect briefly on the fact that yesterday was Equal  Pay Day. Ninety-four days into the year, Equal Pay Day symbolizes the  amount of extra time that it takes for a woman to earn the same amount  as a man. We have got to work--I see the heads nodding up there in the  Chamber--extra hard for an additional 3 months and some days in order  to earn the same wages as a man.   When you break it down by race, the gap widens even further. Black  women working full time year round only earn 63 cents to the dollar.  For them, Equal Pay Day comes on July 31. Latina women earn a mere 54  cents, which means that their Equal Pay Day--get this--is November 2.   Over a lifetime, the financial losses that women face due to this gap  are immense. On average, a 20-year-old woman will lose $418,000 over  the course of her 40-year career. For Black women, they will lose  $840,000. Latinas will lose more than $1 million.   Now, why do I bring this up in the context of Judge Gorsuch?   Because I believe that as we mark Equal Pay Day, we need to know that  we will have a Supreme Court Justice who will, in fact, crack down on  the gender pay gap and enforce the law.    Unfortunately, Judge Gorsuch has a history of prioritizing big  business over people. In fact, he has ruled in favor of employers in  two-thirds of the employment and labor disputes that have been brought  before him on the basis of discrimination. Let's be clear: Equal Pay  Day and the situation that women face is about discrimination.   Gorsuch ruled against an African-American man who claimed that he was  fired because of racial discrimination in Johnson v. Oklahoma  Department of Transportation.   In Poindexter v. Board of County Commissioners of the County of  Sequoyah, he ruled against a man who argued that he was demoted because  of his political views.   His opinion in Strickland v. UPS was particularly troubling. The  court ruled in favor of a female employee who had been discriminated  against based on sex. Judge Gorsuch, though, wrote a dissenting  opinion, despite the fact that the woman's male colleagues testified  that she was required to attend counseling sessions while they were  not, even though she was out performing them.   The court ruled in her favor, but, again, Judge Gorsuch, President  Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court of the United States of America,  went out of his way to undermine her.   Perhaps the clearest example of Gorsuch's affinity for big business  was his ruling in the Hobby Lobby case, which many people across the  country may know about. He ruled that private corporations should enjoy  the same constitutional protections as people.   Not only are people being told that the money of corporations  represents protected speech, but women across this country are being  told that those corporations can make decisions about women's health  care and their rights to make decisions about their own body. This case  sent a clear signal that Judge Gorsuch is no friend of women's  reproductive rights.   It isn't a surprise, frankly, that this President chose him, because  he does fit right into this administration's all-out assault that we  have seen since the beginning of this Congress on women's rights to  make decisions about their bodies and their health care.   Judge Gorsuch wrote a concurring opinion arguing that the Affordable  Care Act forced employers to violate their religious beliefs by  providing birth control. It is our right to choose whether and when we  want to have families. But rather than coming to the conclusion that  corporations should be required to allow women to make their own  healthcare decisions, Judge Gorsuch made it very clear that he stands  with big business and against women's rights.   His appointment is a deep threat to something that I have appreciated  my whole life and that women before me have fought for so hard. His  appointment is a threat to Roe v. Wade, which has protected women's  rights to abortion access.   Trump has said many times that he intended to appoint a Justice who  would overturn Roe v. Wade. While being questioned in his confirmation  hearing, Judge Gorsuch sidestepped all of the questions on this issue,  but his views are obvious. He has questioned and argued against the  legal foundation of a woman's right to choose, and he has been critical  of the decisions of Roe v. Wade's and its reliance on the right to  privacy and the substantive due process rationale.   That is unacceptable. Roe v. Wade is the law of the land, and it has  helped save the lives of millions of women across our country. We need  to make sure that we protect that right to choose and continue to allow  abortion access in this country.   Judge Gorsuch has also taken actions that signal his support for the  defunding of Planned Parenthood. Of course, we remember the doctored  videos that came out to destroy Planned Parenthood's image. Utah  Governor Gary Herbert attempted to defund the organization, but the  tenth circuit issued an injunction. Gorsuch stood with the Governor. He  even went so far as to push for a rehearing by the full court, without  being asked by the Governor. The court refused. Gorsuch issued then a  dissenting opinion that relied on the very fallacies that the Governor  was pushing.   We cannot afford to have this critical vote on the Supreme Court go  to someone who so clearly intends to undermine women's fundamental and  constitutional rights.   Judge Gorsuch has also shown that he presents a threat to the LGBT  community. In 2005, he wrote that people should rely on the ballot box  to achieve marriage equality.   During his confirmation hearing, he was asked about cases that  involve LGBT people as a class. This qualification is important because  it adds heightened scrutiny. Apparently, Gorsuch was not comfortable  with this, because he dodged the question. That is alarming. Our LGBT  community does face discrimination at extremely high rates. This is not  a speculation; it is fact.    Gorsuch could not even give a straight answer when Senator Dianne  Feinstein asked if he agreed with Justice Scalia that there is ``no  protection for women or gays or lesbians under the equal protection  law.''   With States around the country attempting to pass discriminatory  bills, it is crucial that we have a Supreme Court Justice who will  apply that heightened scrutiny.   Finally, people living with disabilities are also fearful of this  appointment and the possibility that Judge  [[Page H2743]]  Gorsuch might be our next Supreme Court Justice.   In Luke P., a case involving a severely autistic student, Judge  Gorsuch ruled that a State can provide an education offering minimal  educational progress to students with disabilities.   Rather than requiring States to fulfill their responsibilities under  the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, Judge Gorsuch was  satisfied with putting a student's learning potential at severe risk.  In the middle of his confirmation hearing, the current Supreme Court  unanimously overruled his decision.   What does that say about his judgment? Do we want a Supreme Court who  gets it wrong on so many issues?   Judge Gorsuch should not be appointed to the Supreme Court. The fact  that Senate Republicans are threatening the nuclear option if Democrats  filibuster his appointment is just terrifying. It would have long- lasting consequences, and it is inappropriate to select a man for this  key position to the United States Supreme Court who makes decisions  about so many issues that affect all Americans across our country.   It is not right that they would make that on a purely partisan  ideological basis. There should be a 60-vote threshold. We should make  sure that they understand that, if they do this and they go to the  nuclear option, it will have long-lasting consequences for them in  their districts, in their offices, and also for the entire country.                                time  1730
