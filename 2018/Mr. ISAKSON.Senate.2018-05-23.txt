 Madam President, I am delighted to stand today, shoulder  to shoulder with all my colleagues on the Veterans' Affairs Committees  in the House and the Senate, to thank the Senate for a very strong vote  on cloture yesterday to take us to a point today where we will pass the  VA MISSION Act, which is this legislative body fulfilling a promise to  those who fought and sacrificed for each of us to be here today--our  families and loved ones as well.   For years, there have been problems in the VA in terms of healthcare.  You read the headlines. I read them, too, and our constituents read  them. In Arizona, we had veterans who died waiting to get a routine  appointment. We had scheduling errors. People were getting bonuses for  scheduling things they had falsified. We had a lot of things that were  disappointing to all of us. We worked hard in the Veterans Affairs  Committee in the House and Senate to address these tough issues head-on  and fix them so that the VA would be the best functioning health  delivery system it could possibly be for the people who were willing to  risk their lives for each of us when they joined the military.   I think it is appropriate that we are doing this the week before  Memorial Day. Next Monday, we will celebrate all of those who, in all  the wars that preceded the fight we have today, represented our  country, volunteered unselfishly, fought, and in some cases died for  America's peace, freedom, liberty, and the perpetuation of our  democracy.   One promise we made to them was that they would have good quality  healthcare, and it would be successful. Four years ago, with the  leadership of John McCain, we started the movement toward Veterans  Choice. We passed a good bill with a 40-mile rule and a 30-day rule.  The 40-mile rule said that if you live within 40 miles of a VA clinic  or service, you can go to a closer clinic in the private sector, as  long as it is approved by the VA. The 30-day rule said that if you  couldn't get an appointment for a routine medical service in 30 days,  you could get an appointment in the private sector, and the VA would  approve it. But the labyrinth of the approval process for that 30-day  appointment or that 40-mile access made it almost impossible for the  veteran, in many cases, to get access that is as timely as we would  like it to be.   It was a good start. It was an improvement in our process. It  addressed the problem--but not well enough. We learned enough as a test  bed to know that veterans liked Choice, as long as it was not so  cumbersome that they couldn't use it. The VA liked Choice, as  [[Page S2858]]  long as they were a partner with a veteran who made the choices, so we  lost no continuity in healthcare.   With the passage of the MISSION Act, we are repealing both the 30-day  rule and the 40-mile rule. Instead, we are saying the following: If you  are an eligible veteran for VA healthcare services, you can choose a  private sector doctor if you want to, as long as the conditions and  circumstances, in concert with your VA primary care doctor, fit. In  other words, the VA needs to know about it and work with you in making  that decision and work with you in finding that private doctor. We are  not going to have mountains of paperwork and third-party administrators  breaking the rules and regulations and slowing things down. Instead,  the VA will be motivated to see you, the veteran, get fast, timely  service and quality healthcare, whether it is private or the VA.   There have been some who have talked about this being privatization.  It is not privatization; it is mobilization. We are mobilizing  healthcare for the veterans to see to it that they have access in a  timely fashion. The VA is an instrumental service for our veterans who  come home. Many of them come home with injuries and sicknesses and  illnesses and diseases that, quite frankly, nobody ever contemplated  people surviving.   Who heard of PTSD and TBI 20 years ago? Who saw veterans lose arms  and legs--in some cases, all of their arms and legs--and survive a  battlefield wound? How many of you have seen people wear an eye  prosthesis, where they had an eye replaced? The VA has specialists who  can do all of those things, the best in the world. They can deliver  high-quality healthcare and high-quality rehabilitation to veterans  with the most serious injuries in the history of warfare. We will  always continue to do that, but we also have to understand that when  healthcare in the private sector can be utilized for the convenience of  the veteran--not as a competitor to the VA--we can use it as a force  multiplier to lower the number of people we have to hire and, in  addition, lower the number of hospitals we have to build and instead  provide that money for services to our veterans. It is a win-win  proposition for the VA and for all of us.   It is no secret why every former VA Secretary who has served this  country has endorsed the VA MISSION bill. All of them have endorsed it,  every one of them, whether a Republican appointment or appointment by a  Democratic President. They all know this is something we needed to do  for a long time. It is no secret why we got a vote of 91 to 4 yesterday  on the floor of the U.S. Senate to invoke cloture and go to a vote  today on the VA MISSION Act. It is past time we made sure our laws for  healthcare available to our veterans are as high quality as our  veterans are when they go to fight wars for us.   Secondly, I want to focus on another feature which is very important  to me because I was in the service. I was not in Vietnam. I am a  Vietnam-era veteran. I was in the Georgia Air National Guard during the  Vietnam War. I lost buddies in that war. I know a lot of our soldiers  sacrificed in that war and made it home with terrible injuries, but  because of our healthcare delivery system in the battlefield and at  other hospitals around the world, we were able to save veterans and  rehabilitate them, but the need for ongoing medical healthcare for the  basic essentials of life is sometimes one of the byproducts for some of  the injuries and for some of those who survived those wounds.   There are veterans who have difficulty feeding themselves. There are  veterans who can't dress themselves. There are veterans who need  assistance in the five basic essentials of life, and then from time to  time, they have to call in a caregiver. There are spouses, moms, in  some cases, dads, brothers, and sisters who come and deliver those  services to their brother or sister or son or daughter. If they are a  veteran of almost any area except Vietnam, they get caregiver benefits  from the VA or a stipend benefit provided to that volunteer to help  that veteran. It helps the veteran pay for their service, and it helps  the VA not have to go out to find someone to do it because there is  someone offering to be their caregiver. We are expanding the caregiver  services in the VA to all veterans, so finally the Vietnam-era veterans  and their families will be as eligible as anybody else who is entitled  to VA benefits.   Patty Murray of Washington, Susan Collins of Maine, and a lot of  Members of this Chamber today deserve credit for that. We fought for  caregivers for a long time. It is a big step forward, and it is going  to be a lifesaver and a life extender for many and remove just one of  the major burdens that some have to care for a spouse or a loved one  injured in battle or who has fought for us.   I can go on and on and on about detail after detail after detail in  this bill, but I don't want to bore everyone. I want everybody to  realize, when they go home this weekend, how important it is to tell  them what we have finally done. We have finally dealt with the  accessibility of healthcare to our veterans. There will be no more  headlines of veterans dying because they can't get an appointment  because they are going to be able to get an appointment. They are going  to be able to make the choice with the VA at that appointment. It is  not the case anymore where a veteran is going to die because they can't  get a basic service to stay alive at their home, that if they don't  have the money to pay for a caregiver, they therefore languish, unable  to feed themselves or clothe themselves or live in a sanitary  condition. That is the very least we owe to our veterans. Today, when  you cast your vote for the VA MISSION Act, you will do just that.   I want to address some individuals, if I can, and thank them. One, I  thank John McCain, whose idea this was originally. He is a great hero  to all of us, a friend to all of us, one we love and pray for today as  he recovers from cancer. John is the one who started the movement  toward Choice, and he deserves the credit for it.   I thank all of those Secretaries who have worked with us over the  past 3 or 4 years to get to the point where we are able to pass the VA  MISSION Act today.   I will tell you whom I really want to thank. I want to thank all  those veterans who sacrificed and died for us in the wars before now.  The reason we enjoy our freedom and you, Madam President, can preside  freely without fear of retribution, I can say what I think without fear  of retribution, I can say to our constituents who gather in the Gallery  and listen to what we have to say, and protest if they wish, is we have  a Constitution and 10 basic amendments, the first 10 being our Bill of  Rights. It gives us everything, but the ones who protected that gift  are our veterans.   It is not a stretch to remember that had it been a different outcome  in World War II, I might be speaking Japanese or German today, not  English, but because of our veterans and because of our soldiers who  fought in the Battle of the Bulge, who fought in the Pacific--my  father-in-law flew reconnaissance in the Pacific. My brother-in-law was  in the Air Force in Vietnam. If those vets had not risked their lives  and really offered their lives in exchange for our liberty and freedom,  we wouldn't be enjoying this today. So we owe no less than the MISSION  Act to our veterans. I am proud to be part of it, and I am proud of my  committee and my committee members who are doing so much to help us.   Let me just say thank you to my colleagues for your vote yesterday. I  urge you to vote today for passage of the VA MISSION Act. It is an  honor to serve our country as a Member of the U.S. Senate. It is an  honor to be an American. May God bless our country.   I yield the floor.    I thank the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma. I will  tell him that the story of his veteran from Muskogee led us to the way  we wrote a lot of the provisions in section 101. Comfort, ease, and  accessibility for the veteran are equally important to every other  consideration that will go in.   The veteran who was sent to Seattle before would now be able to get  treatment in Oklahoma City or in Muskogee or wherever else closer to  home that is more convenient as long as it is in the best interest of  that patient. Specifically, it says that a veteran and the veteran's  referring clinician agree that the care or services in the community  would be in the best medical interest of the veteran after considering  criteria, including--and then all those criteria. So every personal  criterion, as well as medical criterion, is considered. So that should  never happen again because of the VA MISSION Act. I appreciate the  Senator bringing it to our attention, and I hope it never happens again  in Oklahoma or anywhere in the United States.    Mr. President, the Senator is correct. The term Indian  Health Service includes Indian Tribes and Tribal organizations that  operate healthcare facilities in lieu of the Indian Health Service  pursuant to a contract or self-governance compact with the Federal  Government.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come briefly to the floor to encourage  all Members of the Senate to vote for the VA MISSION bill. It is long  overdue, a lot of hard work went into it, and it had a great vote on  cloture of 91 to 4.   I am sure we will have an outstanding vote today because it is a vote  for our veterans, for the promises we made to them for better quality  healthcare and a better VA. It would not have happened if it were not  for a lot of people, but one of the most key persons in making sure  this bipartisan bill passes with the overwhelming margin it deserves is  Jon Tester, my ranking member on the committee. We worked together hand  in hand for about 3 years. We had enough pitfalls to want to quit many  times but never did because we knew the ultimate goal was to meet our  veterans' needs.   Today, when we adopt this bill, and later on this month when it is  signed, it will be because of the hard work of a lot of people but none  more important than Jon Tester from Montana.   I thank my ranking member for encouraging everyone to vote for the  bill, and I thank the Presiding Officer at this time.   I yield to the ranking member.    Mr. President, I have 7 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.
