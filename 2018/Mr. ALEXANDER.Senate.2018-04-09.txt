 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time  to be determined by the majority leader, in consultation with the  Democratic leader, the Senate proceed to executive session for the  consideration of the following nomination: Executive Calendar No. 376.  I ask consent that there then be 10 hours of debate, equally divided in  the usual form; that following the use or yielding back of time, the  Senate vote on the nomination with no intervening action or debate;  that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid  [[Page S2000]]  upon the table; that the President be immediately notified of the  Senate's action; that no further motions be in order; and that any  statements relating to the nomination be printed in the Record.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.
