 Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate and  celebrate the 100th anniversary of the House passage of the 19th  Amendment to amend the Constitution to guarantee women the right to  vote.   The struggle for women's suffrage was not an easy one, taking over a  generation of women fighting to see it through to the end. Women like  Susan B. Anthony, Lucretia Mott, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton took a  great risk, stepping out of what many thought to be the role of women  at the time to argue about the injustice they were facing.   After speeches, petitions, and failed attempts at change, the initial  group of women were not able to see their work through to the end but  made great strides that enabled future women to finish the job.   On this anniversary, I hope that we will all take the time to  remember the hard work that these women had to put in to gain equal  voting rights, to remember where our country has been and how we got to  where we are today, and to remember that the right for everyone to vote  is central to our democracy and a right that we need to continue to  protect.   I am grateful for the women who led this effort 100 years ago, and I  believe that it is something that should inspire all of us                            ____________________
