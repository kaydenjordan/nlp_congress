 Mr. Speaker, a strong, reliable food  supply chain is important 365 days a year. But COVID-19 has underscored  just how much we rely on this essential industry in times of crisis.   The men and women who work to provide our Nation with the food,  fiber, and energy that we depend on each and every day are among the  unsung heroes in this crisis.   In April, I introduced the GROCER Act to establish a Federal tax  holiday for our grocery store and convenience store employees from  February 15, 2020, to June 15, 2020. The bill benefits individuals  making less than $75,000 a year and gives the Treasury Secretary the  discretion to extend this benefit for an additional 3 months.   To build on the support for the GROCER Act, Congressman Dwight Evans  and I introduced the AG CHAIN Act.   The AG CHAIN Act extends the GROCER Act to the entire food supply  chain defined by recent Department of Homeland Security guidance. That  includes our farmers, ranchers, meatpackers, distributors, and more. It  also builds on the GROCER Act to include a payroll tax exemption in  addition to the Federal tax holiday.   Supporting our essential workers in the food supply chain is  something that Republicans, Democrats, and everyone in-between can get  behind.   A recent poll showed support from the public as well. According to  the Morning Consult, 90 percent of voters consider agricultural and  food production workers essential, and 93 percent consider grocery  store workers and convenience store workers essential. When it comes to  providing tax relief to the essential workers who keep our grocery  stores and our farms operational, two-thirds of voters supported some  kind of tax relief for these individuals.                                time  0930    Those numbers speak for themselves, Mr. Speaker.   We all depend on a strong food supply chain to feed our families.  Even in times of crisis, the shelves and coolers in our grocery stores  have remained stocked. Now, that would not be the case if we were not  blessed with such a hardworking and resilient agriculture industry.   Food security is national security, and employees in the food supply  chain are working overtime to ensure crops are harvested, shelves and  coolers are stocked, and Americans have food on the table.   The AG CHAIN Act is a simple way to say thank you to the hardworking  men and women across the full spectrum of the food supply chain. It is  a commonsense way to support these workers, and it is a way to put more  of their hard-earned money back into their own pockets.   Today and every day, I am grateful for the hard work of our food  supply chain workers, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting  the AG CHAIN Act.                            ____________________
