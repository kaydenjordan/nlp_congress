 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time.   Mr. Speaker, the default on America act is foolish. It is harmful. It  is a harmful piece of legislation offered to appease the Republican  Party's most extreme fringe.   The Republicans' plan to handle the debt limit is not a plan at all.  It is a ransom note that threatens aggressively to take our country  backward, and everybody loses.   Either Republicans force default, which results in skyrocketing  student loans, veterans losing out on hard-earned benefits, and  countless other incomprehensible effects that will hit the most  vulnerable the hardest but will hit working-class folks and middle- class folks hard, as well.    Republicans can enact their tone-deaf economic agenda, giving a huge  windfall to billionaires and oil barons, while cutting food assistance  to poor families, children, and older people.   If Republicans had their way, they would strip our communities of the  right to fight back against polluting industries while padding Big  Oil's pockets.   They cut funding for climate science while reversing the progress the  Democrats have made on clean energy. They do absolutely nothing to  address emissions.   In fact, they give companies free passes to pollute while cutting  funding to fight wildfires and provide drought relief.   They say they will help American families, but it slashes already  underfunded Tribal education programs and Indian child welfare  programs. Their budget would make it harder to tackle wildfires and  drought in the West.   This bill is not what the American people want. Our communities want  clean air and clean water. They want to be able to put food on the  table. They want good, stable jobs, and they want the Federal  Government to face climate change head on.   I urge my colleagues to stand up against the default on America act.  Vote ``no.''
