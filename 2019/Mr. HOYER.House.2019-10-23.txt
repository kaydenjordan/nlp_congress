 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow; and further,  when the House adjourns on that day, it adjourn to meet on Monday,  October 28, 2019, when it should convene at noon for morning-hour  debate and 2 p.m. for legislative business.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Louisiana for  yielding.  [[Page H8444]]    On Monday, Mr. Speaker, the House will meet at 12 p.m. for morning- hour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative business, with votes postponed  until 6:30 p.m.   On Tuesday and Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning- hour debate, and 12 p.m. for legislative business.   On Thursday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business;  the last votes of the week are expected no later than 3 p.m.   We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. The  complete list of suspensions will be announced by close of business on  Friday.   The House will consider H.R. 823, the Colorado Outdoor Recreation and  Economy Act; H.R. 2181, the Chaco Cultural Heritage Area Protection  Act; and H.R. 1373, the Grand Canyon Centennial Protection Act. These  three bills all recognize the need to protect some of America's most  iconic and important public lands.   The House, Mr. Speaker, will also consider H.R. 4695, the Protect  Against Conflict by Turkey Act. This bipartisan legislation,  cosponsored by the chair and ranking member of the Committee on Foreign  Affairs, provides a strong, targeted response to the crisis caused by  Turkey's invasion of Northern Syria.   It sanctions senior Turkish officials involved in the decision and  those committing human rights abuses, and penalizes Turkish financial  institutions involved in perpetuating President Erdogan's practices.   Lastly, the House will consider H.Res 296 affirming the United  States' record on the Armenian Genocide.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I cannot respond to that at this point in  time. We haven't made that decision to move ahead. The committees, as  the gentleman knows, are considering it, and if they decide that the  House should move forward, then we will make that decision.    Mr. Speaker, I will respond as I responded last week. We  are doing our constitutional duty of oversight of the administration  and the actions of the President of the United States to determine  whether or not there had been violations of law, whether the President  has committed high crimes and misdemeanors. And when those hearings are  concluded, obviously, they will make some determination and make  recommendations to the House, as they do with other matters that the  committees consider.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, no matter how many times the gentleman from Louisiana,  the Republican whip, says that these are unfair hearings, or that they  are secret hearings, or that Republicans can't participate, no matter  how many times he says that, it will not be true.                                time  1845    He talks about secret hearings. I will show you the front page of The  Washington Post about the hearing yesterday. It is on the front page.   Now, I know your Members can read. There are over 105 Members, 40 or  so of your Members, who are authorized to sit in the committee.   The President, Mr. Speaker, called the Republicans, and he has  tweeted about how they need to be tougher.   What I want to ask, Mr. Speaker, is: When are they going to focus on  defending the Constitution of the United States?   I ask the gentleman: Does he believe that the President is above the  law?    Read the paper.    Mr. Speaker, as usual, the whip did not answer my  question. I said, is the President above the law?   But he wants to pound on the table, Mr. Speaker, because neither the  facts nor the law is on his side.   The process is consistent with the rules put in place by the current  Secretary of State, Mr. Pompeo, and Mr. Trey Gowdy, who was a Member of  this body.   Let me ask the gentleman, Mr. Speaker: Does he believe it appropriate  that the Congress appropriates $391 million to help an ally confront  Russia--which I understand Mr. Putin probably wasn't for--but does he  believe that the President should have withheld that money from Ukraine  to defend itself on its eastern front?    He has no evidence of that. If the gentleman will yield,  he has no evidence of that.    He makes a bald-faced assertion that he has no way to back  up.    It is not true, in my opinion, but he has no way to back  up that statement, and I think the gentleman must know that.    Would the gentleman like to know the reason for that?    I thank the gentleman for yielding. It is a wonderful  poster.    We passed over 250 bills. The Senate won't take them up,  particularly one bill that says what 90 percent of the American people  want done: Pass a comprehensive background check to make their  communities safer.   They won't bring it up. No wonder it can't be signed, because they  won't bring up any of our bills.   The Republican leadership in the Senate stops our bills from going to  the Senate. They are not even being considered.  [[Page H8446]]    Then they have a poster that says you haven't passed any bills? Oh,  no, we passed them, and the American people support them.   Yes, we had an election in 2018, and the people spoke, which is why I  am the majority leader and you are the minority whip.   So, yes, we honor those elections. And when you were in the majority,  you passed bills you wanted to pass.   So, I tell my friend, it is an interesting poster, but it is a  reflection of the refusal of the Republicans in the United States  Senate to consider legislation supported by the overwhelming majority  of the American people. How sad.   But, let me ask you again: Are you saying it was right to keep the  $391 million, to refuse to have a meeting with Mr. Zelensky at the  White House until he agreed to conduct a political investigation that  would advantage the President of the United States? Do you believe that  was right?    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Of course, the Acting Chief of Staff, who is, I think, also the  acting head of OMB--not technically but actually, in my view--he said  there was a quid pro quo. Now, he tried to clean it up. I get that. I  get that.   But he said, yes, there was a quid pro quo.   And you read the transcript--which is not a transcript but a report  of the substance of the conversation--in which he brings up a number of  things, including Joe Biden and Hunter Biden.   And, yes, we now have testimony that says there was a quid pro quo.  There was going to be no meeting at the White House. There was going to  be no sending of the $391 million that we thought was essential for our  Ukrainian friends defending democracy in Ukraine from Putin.   Now, we have had a more recent action where a telephone conversation  with Erdogan led to another headline on that same page: Russia and  Turkey reach deal on Syria. America in retreat. America no longer a  factor in trying to bring peace.                                time  1900    Mr. Speaker, I asked a question. Is the President above the law?   I asked another question: Is it right to keep the $391 million that  we appropriated because we thought Ukraine was at great risk? And  again, the question wasn't answered. It was answered with a question  and with an assertion that the President had the authority to make sure  that there wasn't corruption in Ukraine.   Mr. Speaker, we are concerned whether there is corruption in the  United States of America. That concerns us, and that is why these  hearings are proceeding, consistent with our constitutional duty.   And all the Republicans can do is--not defend the actions, because  they are indefensible. All they can do is talk about process.   One thousand subpoenas issued by Dan Burton when he was the  Republican chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee.  One hundred subpoenas, unilaterally, under the Gowdy rule, under the  Pompeo rule, under the Republican rules, unilaterally.   Trey Gowdy, himself, as chairman of the Benghazi Select Committee,  three dozen subpoenas, without any input, under the Gowdy-Pompeo rules.   So I ask the gentleman, do you think it is consistent with our  Constitution that the President of the United States suggest to a  foreign leader that they become involved in our elections?    We are in that process.    Will the gentleman yield on that point?    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   What he didn't mention was the Benghazi Gowdy commission was the  eighth Republican-led investigation of that matter. They all reached  the same conclusion and found no evidence of wrongdoing; eight  Republican-led, and they kept after it, over and over and over again.   Why? As the minority leader said, on television, well, no, we got  something out of it. We got some dirt on Hillary Clinton.   I don't think it was dirt. It was the use of a computer which, by the  way, some of the Trump family is doing the same thing--somewhat  irrelevant.   What is relevant is not all this stuff about fairness and this, that,  and the other. We are following the Constitution. We are following the  rules of this House. We are following the law, and every legal scholar  that I have read asserts that. The only people who don't assert that  are the people who are afraid of the facts, afraid of what has been  done.   I asked the gentleman questions: Do you think this is right? Do you  think the President is above the law? He mentions the Mueller report.   What he fails to mention and he just ignores is the Mueller report  said there was evidence to suggest that there was the failure to follow  the law and cooperate with the law, in other words, obstruction of  justice. But he said Justice Department rules, of which he was an  employee, do not provide for the ability to indict a President of the  United States. That did not mean that there wasn't obstruction of  justice.   But what he said was this is the body to deal with this matter. So we  are following our constitutional duty, and we are going to continue to  do so, and there are going to be public hearings. There is going to be  debate. There is going to be a vote on the rule if something is brought  to the floor and full opportunity to debate on both sides of the aisle.   Right now, of course, there are members of the committee--you would  think this was somehow Mr. Schiff and the Democrats meeting in some  secret room. They are meeting with the Republican members of the  committee.   And, by the way, I asked the gentleman the question about Mr. Nunes.  But Mr. Nunes, apparently, comes sometimes and he doesn't come  sometimes. And Mr. Meadows is apparently always there, so he can always  tell you what is going on. This is an endless debate.   If the Republicans think we are violating the law, of course they can  go to court, as we have been forced to do by this President who has  instructed people not to cooperate with Congress, not to testify before  the Congress because he feels aggrieved.   He will have his day in court. That is how we run these kinds of  events in America: under our Constitution, under our laws. And, yes, he  will have due process.   But right now we are trying to find out whether there is probable  cause to believe the President of the United States committed high  crimes and misdemeanors and abused the power of his office, as Hamilton  said the purpose of the impeachment provision was designed to address.  Hamilton said that in two of the Federalist Papers.   But we are going to endlessly talk about fairness, with Republicans  sitting in the committee. He asserts, with no knowledge, that somehow  the Democratic members of the committee released this information.   I am not sure how the paper got this information. I know they get  almost all the information on all these networks. But this was the  testimony that was prepared by the witness who was there--who was  there.   He talks about the whistleblower and hearsay, but what he doesn't  talk about: Does he believe the President is above the law? Does he  believe it is appropriate?   And the transcript--I could read it again. I keep saying  ``transcript.'' It is not a transcript. A report of the phone call that  the President thought was okay, that is why he released it. He thought  it was perfect.   In addition, he said: The other thing, there is a lot of talk about  Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecutor, and a lot of people  want to find out about that. So whatever you can do with the Attorney  General--he wants his lawyer. It should be the Justice Department's  lawyer, but Mr. Barr to participate. And, of course, he wanted Mr.  Giuliani to participate as well.   So, Mr. Speaker, I would conclude, we are going down this rat hole  too long. We are going to have hearings. We are going to find out the  truth, and we are finding out the truth every day, and every day our  Republican colleagues get more nervous.   Every day there is some Republican who says: I don't know how long I  can defend President Trump. Every day that is happening now, because  the facts are coming out.   When you don't have the facts, as I have said, Mr. Speaker, you  attack the process. Republicans know the facts aren't on their side.  They can't answer the fundamental question: Is it acceptable for a  President to seek foreign interference in elections?   They will say: Oh, there is no proof of that. And the problem they  have is almost every day there is proof of that, not hearsay.   Yes, the whistleblower did the right thing. The whistleblower heard  something that he felt was dangerous to our national security, to our  men and women in uniform, and to the democracy that we hold so dear,  and so he said something. You have seen the signs: You see something,  say something. He heard this.   One could say, well, he didn't hear it, but then the President  admitted it. Then the Chief of Staff, Acting Chief of Staff, Mr.  Mulvaney, said, yes, that is what we did. And he instructed, don't get  that money to the Ukrainians.   Those are facts. We know those are facts.   So I tell my friend, we really ought to conclude this. We believe we  are following the law. If you don't feel we are following the law, go  to court, just as we had to go to court with the President refusing to  cooperate with the Congress of the United States in its constitutional  duty.  [[Page H8448]]                                     time  1915    And we are going to be fair, and I am sure the Senate will be fair if  we take action here. And I don't know that we are going to take action.  That hasn't been decided. But we are going to continue to try to find  the truth, to try to get to the bottom of what has happened.   I, frankly, think what we did in Turkey in that Erdogan phone call is  as damaging to the interests of the United States of America. And the  President talks about the public. The public ought to know.   I want any Member of the Congress I will yield to to tell me what the  deal was between Putin and Trump when they met in private and refused  to tell anybody.   Mr. Trump is great at disclosure. He says, I have nothing to hide in  my tax returns. I will show my tax returns. That was 3 years ago. We  have, by law, requested those returns. It has been denied. It has been  denied.   No openness. No, Mr. and Mrs. America, this is what my interests are.  I am acting in your interests, not in mine. Doral. He decided that was  too much, and Republicans criticized him.   And, Mr. Speaker, on Turkey we had a vote in this House. He was  really angry about that vote. 354 people of this House said this is  wrong, Mr. President, this is harmful to our allies. You are exposing  allies that we asked to participate to confront terrorists. You are  letting them out perhaps to be murdered and slaughtered. 354-to-60. We  voted on that.   We need to deal with the facts. And we are going to find out the  facts no matter how hard the Republicans want to pound on the table and  talk about process and ignore any discussion on the substance of what  is being disclosed.   So, Mr. Speaker, we can conclude this colloquy because it is not  going to come to any end. I understand the gentleman's perception. I  think he is misrepresenting each time he says that this is not a fair  procedure or that this is not a procedure consistent with the rules  that the Republicans adopted in their rules package when they were in  the majority.   So I hope that we can move on, decide what the facts are, have a  committee recommendation as is the process of this House and then have  a vote on the floor of the House, if such is required, and the  committees decide that moving forward is appropriate under the facts  adduced by those committees.    Mr. Scalise, watch your words. Watch your words, Mr.  Scalise. You and I both know it has no analogy to what you have just  said. You ought to know that. If you don't know it, you ought to sit  down with your counsel and find out about it. That is an allegation  that is absolutely untrue and very offensive.    It is very offensive.    Mr. Scalise, I know you are not a lawyer. Do you have any  idea what a grand jury is?    Of course it is.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I  hesitate to respond because this is a circular discussion.   Mr. Scalise and the Republican party, at the behest of Mr. Trump,  need to get tougher. They can't mention the facts. The facts are known  by the transcript the President sent down here. Again, not a  transcript, a report of a telephone call, the statement of the  ambassador, I think, a former U.S. marine.   They don't want to talk about the facts. I get that. So we can go  around and around in circles.   And I will tell you, to have eight hearings on Benghazi? Don't give  me this Trey Gowdy allowed this to happen and that to happen. It was  the eighth hearing you Republicans had on that one subject, eight, and  you never got the result you wanted, so you just kept doing it over and  over and over. Getting the same result. We all know that quote.   There are going to be public hearings, Mr. Speaker, but they are  going to be public hearings when the witnesses can't check one another,  can't give one story and then parrot the other story that was said.   And Ambassador Sondland, of course. I don't know that he was our  friend. He  [[Page H8449]]  was the President's friend, big contributor, special envoy to the  European Union, but apparently doing part-time work in Ukraine along  with Mr. Giuliani.   The facts are going to come out, Mr. Speaker. And they are going to  try to say, oh, the process. You are going to have public hearings, Mr.  Schiff has said so. He said so in his letter.   And you are going to have to answer the question: Do I believe that  the conduct that has been pursued by the President of the United  States, if he were a Democrat, would I believe that was right? That is  the question you're going to have to answer. It is going to be a tough  question for your side because the facts almost every day are mounting  up.   So I want to urge my friend, let's conclude this discussion, because  I am not going to agree with you, and you are not going to agree with  me.   But ultimately the American people--and those 236 million people you  talk about, there is not going to be any indictment, there is not going  to be any impeachment, unless 218 of us in this body vote. And we are  all going to vote. It is not going to be any Star Chamber. Everybody is  going to have to vote.   And then they are going to have to answer to their constituents, did  I vote my conscience, or did I vote my politics?    Mr. Speaker, I don't say that.    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman keeps misstating the facts and  the law and the process.   Every Member is going to have access to all the documents, all the  testimony before they are asked to vote on it, period.    When they have concluded their private sessions, which are  trying to get at the facts and not having been tainted by some circus.  Everybody is going to have the right to see what evidence is adduced.   That is the fear, of course, and I again suggest the gentleman think  of this: If he saw these headlines and it was a Democratic President  and Turkey and Russia were deciding what is happening in the Middle  East and deciding whether they are going to go after ISIS, our ally,  and then this other headline replete with the aid to Ukraine was  conditioned on a quid pro quo or they weren't going to be in the White  House, they may not get the $391 million, he would be outraged. He  would be on this ceiling.    Mr. Speaker, do I still have my time?    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman wasn't here during the Clinton  impeachment with Starr. Starr might as well----
