 Mr. President, we are taking about somebody today who was  actually a mentor for me right here in the U.S. Senate--Ted Stevens.   I believe it was 33 years ago when I first met him--33 years ago--and  I was in the House, and I was coming to the Senate. He was a power in  the Senate then. He was a worker. He was involved. He was involved not  only in what happened in Alaska, where he was a champion of his own  State--and should have been--but also in the world. He wanted to make  sure that America had a defense second to nobody; that we were  powerful, but we were peaceful.   I had the occasion to serve for years and years on the Appropriations  Committee and on the Subcommittee on Defense with him. I hadn't been on  the committee long, and Senator Byrd was chairman of the committee, and  Senator Hatfield from Oregon had been, and he tasked me with a lot of  things that probably as a freshman--you know, second-year, third-year  guy here--I probably was appalled but pleased--maybe not appalled, but  pleased--what he would do. He told me one day: Senator Shelby, you are  going to be chairman of this committee. I looked around, and I said:  Oh, it will be years. I will never be that.   But Ted Stevens was a Senator's Senator. He was involved, as I said,  in just about everything in the Senate--the Rules Committee, the  Commerce Committee, Appropriations, and Defense.   I will never forget his experience, his wise suggestions to me that  probably helped me on my way. I traveled with him around the world  because we had serious meetings on the Defense appropriations bill.   All I can say is that we are going to unveil a portrait of Ted  Stevens here in the Senate later today, and it is a fitting tribute to  a great Senator representing the State of Alaska but a U.S. Senator  representing us all, Ted Stevens.   Ted, I will never forget you. We miss you. You left an indelible  imprint on the U.S. Senate. I am glad I got to meet you and work with  you.
