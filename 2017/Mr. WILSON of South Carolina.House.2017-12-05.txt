 Mr. Speaker, sadly, South Carolina lost  a trailblazer with the death, Sunday, of Chief Justice Ernest A.  Finney, Jr.   Justice Finney started his storied career in public service as an  educator and then went on to become a renowned civil rights attorney  and was South Carolina's first African-American chief justice since  Reconstruction.   My first judicial commitment as a State senator was for Justice  Finney, after meeting him with former Congressman John Napier, who had  been my classmate in law school.   A graduate of Claflin University and South Carolina State University  School of Law, the justice was elected to the South Carolina House of  Representatives in 1972. As a member of the house, he made history as a  founder of the Legislative Black Caucus. He served as the first caucus  chairman.   In 1976, the justice was elected the first African-American circuit  court judge. In 1985, he became the State's first African-American  supreme court justice since Reconstruction. Justice Finney became chief  justice in 1994.   South Carolina is grateful for the life and service of Justice  Finney. We lift up his family and friends in our thoughts and prayers  during this difficult time.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
