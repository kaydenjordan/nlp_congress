 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that I may hereafter  be considered to be the first sponsor of H.R. 3545, a bill originally  introduced by Representative Murphy of Pennsylvania, for the purposes  of adding cosponsors and requesting reprintings pursuant to clause 7 of  rule XII.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Oklahoma?   There was no objection.                            ____________________
