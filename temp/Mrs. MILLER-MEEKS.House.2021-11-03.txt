 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a group  of young women who have made history in a small town in my district.   Last week, the Solon High School Girls Cross Country team defied the  odds at the 3A Iowa State championship and brought home their first  girls cross country title after upsetting last year's champion, Ballard  High School.   Led by top ten finishers, Kayla Young and Emma Bock, every Solon  Spartan finished in the top 54 in a crowded 133-member field, earning a  total score of 77 points.   Congratulations to Kayla Young, Emma Bock, Anna Quillin, Meghan  O'Neill, Mara Duster, Gracie Federspiel, and Kaia Holtkamp. This is a  great achievement for both Solon and the Second District, and I could  not be prouder to represent all of these young women in Congress.                            ____________________
