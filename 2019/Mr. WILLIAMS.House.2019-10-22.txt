 Madam Speaker, my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle have been trying to impeach President Trump since he took office,  and we all know this.   They have made it very clear they deem the President's every action  to be impeachable, and, since the beginning of this joke inquiry, they  have shown no interest in fair, fact-based proceedings.   Impeachment is a monumental step that must be conducted with full  transparency, but what we are witnessing here is a violation of due  process that should concern every single American.   Democrats have held meetings in secret where convenient, one-sided  information can be leaked to the public, denying American citizens the  right to have their elected Members of Congress present.   The dedication to using any and all resources in an attempt to remove  a duly elected President is unthinkable and, frankly, a waste of time.  The Constitution provides the House with the power of impeachment for  high crimes and misdemeanors, not for political theater to push an  agenda.   Madam Speaker, the Democrats have made a mockery of Congress and our  democracy throughout this process. The American people deserve better,  and this President deserves better.   As my colleague from Texas, Al Green, said: President Trump will win  again in 2020.   In God we trust.                            ____________________
