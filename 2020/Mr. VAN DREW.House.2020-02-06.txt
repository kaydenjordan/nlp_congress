 Madam Speaker, February 9, 2020 marks the 100th  anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment in New Jersey.   The 19th Amendment was introduced to Congress in 1878. The amendment  reads: ``The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not  be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account  of sex.''   It was not passed by Congress until the House of Representatives  passed it in May of 1919 and the Senate passed it in June of 1919. It  was then sent to the States for ratification, with New Jersey being the  29th of the 36 States.   I would like to honor the tireless efforts of advocates over history,  pioneer's like New Jersey's own, Dr. Alice Paul, who worked for years  to get women the right to vote. Her persistence and the persistence of  thousands of women before and after her is a true example of how the  dedication of these women changed our country and the world for the  better. They are true American heroes.                            ____________________
