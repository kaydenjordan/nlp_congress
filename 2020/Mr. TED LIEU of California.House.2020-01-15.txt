 Madam Speaker, yesterday the House  released additional documents and new text messages from Lev Parnas. He  is an associate of Donald Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani. He  has also been indicted. These documents and text messages show a  chilling picture of surveillance, both physical and electronic, of the  U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine. This is all the more reason why we need to  have a full and fair trial in the United States Senate.   The House today is going to transmit the Articles of Impeachment to  the Senate. Donald Trump was impeached for abusing his power and for  soliciting interference in our elections from a foreign government. He  will be branded for the rest of his life. It is permanent, it will not  go away, and now we need the Senate to act and have a fair trial. That  means witnesses and documents. If they do not do that, it will be the  equivalent of a coverup.                            ____________________
