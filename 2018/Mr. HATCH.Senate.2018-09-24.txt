 Mr. President, I appreciate the majority leader's remarks  in a wide variety of ways. What a great leader he is. We all should pay  very strict attention to the way he handles himself and his seriousness  about our U.S. Senate.   Last night, Senate Democrats continued their smear campaign against  Judge Brett Kavanaugh with a thinly sourced article that accuses Judge  Kavanaugh of conduct that no eyewitness can even corroborate. Rather  than having brought the matter to the attention of committee  investigators, Democrats coordinated with the members of the media to  drop the story in the most dramatic and damaging way possible. This  continues the Senate Democrats' pattern of playing hide the ball--after  having spent 6 weeks sitting on a letter regarding alleged conduct  while Judge Kavanaugh was in high school--before leaking it to the  press.   Senate Democrats will stop at nothing to prevent Judge Kavanaugh's  confirmation. As reported by the author of last night's article, the  individual in the piece came forward only because Senate Democrats  ``came looking.'' Even then, the individual went on the record only  after ``six days of carefully assessing her memories and consulting  with her attorney''--a former Democratic elected official. The New York  Times, which declined to publish the allegations when approached,  reported that it had interviewed ``several dozen people . . . in an  attempt to corroborate the story'' and could find ``no one with  firsthand knowledge.'' The Times further reported that the individual  in the story had herself contacted former classmates in an effort to  corroborate the story and had ``told some of them that she could not be  certain Mr. Kavanaugh was the one who exposed himself.''   Unsurprisingly, Senate Democrats are now using last night's article  as an excuse to call for further delays. This follows the same approach  they have taken since Judge Kavanaugh's nomination had first been  announced. No innuendo has been too low, no insinuation too dirty.  Everything is an excuse for delay no matter how unsubstantiated. It  does not matter that no other eyewitness can even confirm that Judge  Kavanaugh was at the party in question. It does not matter that every  other individual alleged to be present denies any memory of the event.  The goal is to delay--nothing new to most of us. It should be clear now  to all Americans that Democrats are engaged in a coordinated effort to  stop Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation by any means possible.   As I have said before, every accuser deserves to be heard. Moreover,  a person who has committed sexual assault should not serve on the U.S.  Supreme Court. Yet the way my Democratic colleagues have approached  these allegations makes clear that the driving objective here is not  the truth but is politics. Rather than having worked with Republican  colleagues to investigate Dr. Ford's allegations, they sat on them for  6 weeks until the eve of Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation vote and then  leaked them to the press. Rather than having brought last night's  allegations to the attention of committee investigators, they back- channeled them to the media and then denied any involvement. Such  underhanded tactics are not fair to Judge Kavanaugh, are not fair to  the individuals in the stories, and are not fair to the American  people.   Senate Democrats are demeaning both the Senate and the Supreme Court  through their partisan games and transparent attempts at character  assassination. As planned, we will hear and should hear from Dr. Ford  on Thursday. Then we should vote, and there should be no frivolous  approaches toward the U.S. Senate or toward this confirmation process.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today I wish to speak about legislation to  reauthorize the Emergency Medical Services for Children program  administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration's  Maternal and Child Health Bureau. I want to thank my fellow bill  sponsors, Senators Casey and Schatz, for their dedication to improving  children's health and for working with me to extend this important  program once again.   I am honored to have helped create the EMSC program with Senator  Daniel Inouye in 1984, and I take great pride in the work that I have  done since then to reauthorize it over the years. As we near the 35th  anniversary of EMSC, we can look back on the great progress we have  made. Indeed, we have made significant strides in assuring that  emergency medical personnel and systems are trained to effectively  treat pediatric patients while in transport to a medical facility.   As we have said time and time again, children are not just small  adults. They have different medical needs, presenting special  challenges for emergency and trauma care providers. From smaller-sized  medical equipment to different dosage requirements for medicines,  pediatric patients have important physical, mental, and developmental  differences from adults. It is the EMSC program that ensures state-of- the-art emergency medical care for all sick or injured children and  adolescents across the entire spectrum of care.   My home State of Utah has played such an influential role with EMSC  in advancing the level of emergency medical care for children. The  University of Utah is home to the EMSC program's National Emergency  Medical Services for Children Data Analysis Resource Center, which is  critical to helping States to evaluate EMS system effectiveness and  pediatric patient care. Also housed at the University of Utah is the  Central Data Management Coordinating Center for the Pediatric Emergency  Care Applied Research Network. The DCC serves as the central data  repository for the PECARN, which conducts high-priority, multi- institutional research on the prevention and management of acute  illnesses and injuries in youth of all ages.   Throughout its history, EMSC has received overwhelming bipartisan  support. The program makes a large impact with a relatively small  budget, aiding all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and U.S.  territories in improving their EMS systems, and developing improved  procedures and protocols for treating children. I urge my colleagues to  support our reauthorization bill so that the EMSC program will continue  to improve emergency medical care for children in the United States.                                  ______                                         By Mr. TESTER (for himself and Mr. Wyden):   S.J. Res. 64. A joint resolution providing for congressional  disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule  submitted by the Department of the Treasury relating to ``Returns by  Exempt Organizations and Returns by Certain Non-Exempt Organizations'';  to the Committee on Finance.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to speak about legislation to  reauthorize the Emergency Medical Services for Children program  administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration's  Maternal and Child Health Bureau.
