 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I  didn't know until he indicated he had gone to Howard University here;  that is just another plus mark because he has already got a lot of  pluses as far as I am concerned.   Madam Speaker, the rule before us for the D.C. statehood bill is no  ordinary rule. It is the prelude to the passage of a historic bill, and  I use those words advisedly. For the 219 years since the District of  Columbia first became the capital of these United States, countless  bills that have deeply affected D.C. residents have been enacted not  only without their consent, but without their participation.   Indeed, for the greater part of the existence of the Nation's  capital, there was neither representation in either the House or the  Senate nor even the right of District residents to govern themselves  locally. Local home rule.   In other words, the residents of our Nation's capital were excluded  entirely from American democracy for most of its existence as the  capital. Nevertheless, D.C. residents have always paid the same Federal  taxes as other Americans, today ranked number one in Federal taxes  paid, and have fought in all of the Nation's wars, including the war  that created the United States of America.   Throughout its existence, the country has flattered itself by  saluting itself as a democracy. With the passage of this rule and then  the D.C. statehood bill, that flattery at least will be deserved.    Madam Speaker, I speak of the flattery we give ourselves  of democracy here and around the world. With the passage of this rule  and of the D.C. statehood bill, that flattery at least and at last will  be deserved.
