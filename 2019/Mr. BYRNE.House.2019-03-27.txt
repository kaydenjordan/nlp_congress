 Madam Chair, I thank my colleague for yielding.   I believe all my colleagues can agree that women deserve equal pay  for equal work. However, the bill considered today takes the wrong  approach to ensure that current equal protections, protections that  have been in place since 1963, are reaffirmed and fortified.   This bill offers no new protections for women in the workforce.  Instead, it makes it more difficult for employers and employees to have  an open and informative discussion about hiring and other employment  decisions.   Perhaps worst of all, it is designed in a way that helps increase the  bottom line for lawyers. That is right. The only paychecks that this  legislation will increase are paychecks for lawyers.   It is unfair to women; it is unfair to the workforce; and it is  unfair to businesses.   It may come as a surprise to many people that the so-called Paycheck  Fairness Act offers no new protections against pay discrimination.   Let me repeat that. The legislation being debated today offers no new  protections against pay discrimination. Instead, it imposes a one-size- fits-all mandate to one of the most varied and complex workforces in  the world.   Rather than allowing for informal discussions, the Paycheck Fairness  Act strictly limits communications between employers and employees on  key hiring decisions. Under this bill, the burden is laid on the backs  of employers, and the lack of clarity for employees is simply  unworkable.   I don't see how limiting the discussion between employers and  employees, particularly on hiring decisions, is going to help anybody;  and I certainly don't see how opening the gates to limitless, frivolous  lawsuits is going to help anybody.    It should be noted, the Lilly Ledbetter Pay Act that the Speaker just  alluded to was signed 10 years ago with the promise that it would  alleviate pay discrimination in the workplace. Yet, if you look at pay  discrimination charges filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity  Commission, they have remained steady each year since 1997, both before  and after the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act became law. I am hearing  that same kind of overpromising when it comes to H.R. 7.   In an effort to improve the bill and ensure the damages actually go  to the women impacted instead of lawyers, I offered an amendment that  would cap  [[Page H2851]]  attorney's fees for any judgment to 20 percent of the judgment. Sadly,  this commonsense amendment was blocked by the Rules Committee.   Why don't my colleagues want to join me in ensuring that money  actually gets to victims of pay discrimination instead of simply  padding the wallets of lawyers?   It is a real shame this amendment was not made in order. I think we  can all agree that the idea of discrimination against someone based on  sex is absolutely unacceptable, and it is inconsistent with the values  we hold as Americans.   This issue is not partisan. In 1944, Republican Congresswoman  Winifred Stanley introduced a precursor to the Equal Pay Act, which,  since passing years later, has been the law of the land for the past 55  years.   The Equal Pay Act of 1963 specifically made it illegal to pay  different wages to employees of the opposite sex for equal work. In  addition, title 7 of the Civil Rights Act made it illegal for employers  to discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion,  and sex.   Yet, as I said before, despite these protections on the books, there  are bad actors who continue to practice pay discrimination. Based on  laws existing for decades, it is unacceptable, and we must hold these  bad actors accountable.   Unfortunately, the Paycheck Fairness Act, as written, fails to  improve employment protections.                                time  1415    We have a responsibility to the American people to craft strong  policies that support women in the workplace, not merely offer weak lip  service that, in fact, cripples employers and employees alike.   I ask my colleagues to join me in opposing this phony bill, and,  instead, let's work together in a bipartisan way to actually ensure  women continue to thrive in the workforce.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, this amendment adds the language ``a bona fide business- related reason'' to make clear to the courts that the factor other than  sex defense in the Equal Pay Act cannot be used as a loophole or excuse  for using sex as a factor.   This amendment additionally strikes the remaining provisions of the  underlying bill relating to applications of the factor other than sex  defense.   These unnecessary provisions require that, even when an employer  already shows the factor is other than sex, it must meet additional  illogical and insurmountable burdens, effectively paving an unimpeded  path to the promise of unlimited punitive and compensatory damages for  trial lawyers.   In sum, this amendment strengthens current law and eliminates the new  and untested concepts the underlying bill imposes on employers. It  would make it impossible for an employer to defend any difference in  pay, even when based on any number of legitimate job-related factors.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I was listening to the gentlewoman talk and I  don't know that she has read my amendment, because my amendment  actually solves the problem that she poses. There are some circuits  that have given opinions just exactly as she said. What my amendment  does is substitute for those decisions the bona fide business-related  reason, which has been decided by a number of circuits. It is very  clear. There is nothing amorphous about it. Practitioners in this area,  like myself, understand exactly what it means. It actually solves the  problem posed by the gentlewoman and makes it a lot better than what is  in the underlying bill.   The problem with the underlying bill is that it injects amorphous new  things that we don't have any idea what they would mean. What my  amendment does is it actually makes it clear and solves the very  problem that she stated in her presentation.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate what the gentlewoman had to  say. I was listening very carefully to her. I think she does have it  confused, however, because it does inject an additional burden for  employers that is not in the law right now and it does provide a ton of  unclarity with regard to what they are going to have to do to comply  with it. And I think my use of the bona fide business-related reason is  going to inject the clarity we need and actually protect plaintiffs  more than what is in the bill.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have great respect for the gentlewoman. I  don't think she understands what that language actually means, how it  has actually been interpreted by the courts, and how it may be totally  misinterpreted against plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits.   What my amendment does is actually strengthen the hand of parties  that have a clear understanding of what they are trying to accomplish  there, either the plaintiffs or the defendants. It is an improvement in  the bill for plaintiffs and defendants. We should all be for this, not  against it. I don't want to go tit for tat with her on everything, but  I do think she misunderstands both the amendment and the underlying  bill.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Chairman, once again, I heard what she read into the  Record. I already read that. I understand exactly what it says. I think  maybe I haven't made myself clear:  [[Page H2867]]  The underlying bill injects clarity into the law, which hurts  plaintiffs in their cases. This will hurt women in bringing their  cases. It will take years to try to get clarity through the court  system, if we ever get clarity. That hurts plaintiffs in these  lawsuits.   Defendants like to throw up unclarity. So I guess, perhaps, if you  wanted to argue from that point of view, let's have a confusing bill. I  am going to get clarity into the bill that actually helps women. And it  is the irony of this whole proceeding that the bill that is supposed to  help women, that they say is going to help women, hurts them. I am  trying to help women with my amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1545     Mr. Chairman, this language is consistent with how nearly  all circuit courts of appeal have interpreted this factor.   ``Bona fide business-related reason'' is not an empty phrase. For  example, in one case where the employer alleged that the difference in  pay was based on the higher paid person's participation in a bona fide  skills development program, the court carefully examined the program to  determine whether it was legitimate and, in fact, found that it was  not.   This amendment helps women. If you want to help women in the  workforce, this amendment does it. Their bill doesn't.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
