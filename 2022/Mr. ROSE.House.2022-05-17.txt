 Madam Speaker, I rise today to address an issue on the  minds of many Americans and middle Tennesseans: Rising crime.   Twelve major cities broke homicide records in 2021. The Council on  Criminal Justice says murders nationwide went up 5 percent from 2020  and up a whopping 44 percent from 2019. Aggravated assaults are up.  Robberies are up.   There has been one decrease under President Biden's watch: a drop in  the morale among the men and women in uniform.   In fact, the retirement rate for police departments across the  country has jumped by 45 percent since 2019. The blame can be squarely  placed on the left's antipolice rhetoric, including calls to defund the  police.   When the left chooses to demonize and demoralize the thin blue line,  officers' jobs become even tougher, as if they are not already tough  enough. However, I remind them that they have our support, and we stand  ready to defend and honor them as they protect and serve our  communities.   Thank you to all our Nation's police officers.                            ____________________
