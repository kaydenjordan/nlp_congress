 Mr. Speaker, my fellow Hoosier, I rise today to expose  an outrageous scheme by the Biden administration to pay out hundreds of  thousands of dollars to migrants who have violated our laws by  illegally crossing our southern border.   Right now, there is already a national security, humanitarian, and  public health crisis on the southern border. Every neighborhood in  America, including mine in Indiana, is facing the devastating  consequences of this crisis as illicit drugs come across the porous  border and wreak havoc in our communities through more violence and  drug overdoses.   Instead of protecting our country by securing the border, President  Biden wants law-abiding American taxpayers to pay illegal migrants,  whom people know and we know broke the laws, a ridiculous sum of money.  This decision will do nothing more than encourage human trafficking and  drug smuggling.   The administration's border policies are downright inhumane and will  continue to incentivize migrants to make the dangerous journey to reach  our border.    This radical proposal should be abandoned immediately. It will not  only exacerbate this crisis but it will also be put on the taxpayers'  dime.   As inflation skyrockets under the Biden administration's Big  Government giveaways, working families are struggling right now to pay  for everyday necessities. Small businesses are struggling with supply  chain and workforce shortages.   While Americans face these obstacles, President Biden has decided  that rewarding people who break our laws is more important than  fighting inflation, securing our border, or ensuring that we have the  necessary energy to heat our homes this winter.   This is Big Government insanity at its worst, and I wholeheartedly  reject it.                            ____________________
