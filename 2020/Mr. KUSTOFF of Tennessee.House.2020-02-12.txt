 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  remarkable life of Peggy Williams Daniel.   Peggy was a true friend not only to me, but, really, to everyone she  met.   A graduate of Lambeth College and earning her postgraduate degree  from the University of Memphis, Peggy loved watching and rooting for  her Memphis Tigers.   Peggy also knew that her roots were in west Tennessee. She was  married to a great man, Jimmy Daniel, who predeceased her.   Peggy was an active leader at the Girl Scouts, a Cub Scout leader,  and deeply involved in the political process. She and Jimmy worked hard  to build the Republican Party in west Tennessee; and, frankly, there  are few people that I can think of who are as patriotic as Peggy. Peggy  was a true American patriot. She loved wearing her red, white, and  blue.   Peggy's daughter, Melanie, summed it up best when she said: ``Peggy  Williams Daniel entered this world with a star-spangled bang and has  showered all with her firecracker wit and enthusiastic energy  throughout her colorful life.''   Peggy leaves behind her three children, my friends: Mike, Melanie,  and Drew. We will all deeply miss Peggy but know that her spirit lives  on.                            ____________________
