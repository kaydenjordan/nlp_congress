 Madam Speaker, I rise today to defend our Constitution and  our democracy by voting for the two Articles of Impeachment.   The words of our sacred oath define our duty, and those words must be  kept. Our Founders' primal fear was that powerful members of our  government would become, in Hamilton's words, ``mercenary instruments  of foreign corruption.''   President Trump abused the powers of the Presidency by ignoring and  injuring national security and other vital national interests to obtain  an improper personal benefit. He also betrayed our Nation by abusing  his high office to enlist a foreign power in corrupting democratic  elections.   Article II I agree with because it details the obstruction of  Congress by the President by directing unprecedented, categorical, and  indiscriminate defiance of subpoenas issued by this House of  Representatives and abused the powers of the Presidency in a manner  subversive to the Constitution.   I believe the Constitution is the soul of our Nation, and by  defending it, we are saying we will not be soulless.                                time  1745
