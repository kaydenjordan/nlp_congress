 Mr. Speaker, today is a proud day for California, but  particularly for the San Fernando Valley.   Hundreds of Members of this House did their best to protect America  from Donald Trump, but only one did it so well that he is the focus of  this ridiculous resolution. He was effective, he was direct, and Donald  Trump has demanded that he be attacked.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Adam for doing his job so well. California is  proud, and America is grateful.
