 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman  from Kentucky for yielding.   I was just sitting on the floor and it occurred to me, as I listened  to the debate, that the point just has to be made that the majority is  so obsessed with Donald Trump that they will run roughshod over the  Constitution to continue to try to persecute him.    Do they not see that they twice-impeached him and the court of  impeachment twice acquitted him?   Do they defer to the decision of our constitutional process in terms  of what was just characterized that the President did? Or do they  stubbornly override that and continue to pursue him endlessly, despite  what our processes and constitutional provisions require and provide  for?   What about the provision requiring Presidents, who the Constitution  specifies the qualifications for office, that they be required to  submit private tax returns in order to pursue that office? Perhaps, if  you'd like it, if it is a tradition to do so, for you to impose it by  law means you disregard the Constitution of the United States.   To what end will you go? To what end will you go to prevail?
