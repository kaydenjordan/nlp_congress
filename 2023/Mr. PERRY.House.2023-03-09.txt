 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Graves for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, this is a case of no good deed goes unpunished.   Now, the ranking member, a good gentleman, and I can agree that we  all want clean water. But this is just simply a Federal Government  overreach. That is all it is. And, oh, by the way, I will remind  everybody that it is only 2 months ago my friends on the other side of  the aisle controlled this body, the other body, and the Presidency.   If they wanted to pass a law, then why didn't they?   It is because they can't pass a law.   This isn't about the Clean Water Act because the Clean Water Act  still exists. This is about a rule made by bureaucrats down the street  to control the water in your backyard.   Mr. Speaker, if you have a child's swing set where they have hollowed  out underneath the swing set, don't you dare fill it in, otherwise  severe penalties--criminal imprisonment--can be imposed on you.   This is absolutely outrageous, unnecessary, and must be stopped.
