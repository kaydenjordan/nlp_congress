 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2213, the Anti-Border  Corruption Reauthorization Act of 2017.   I have forcefully rejected the President's mass deportation efforts  from the beginning, and I will continue to do so.   Many of us have appropriately criticized our President for wrongfully  attributing the criminal actions of a few undocumented individuals to  the entire undocumented population. Equally here, it would be  hypocritical to attribute the criminal actions of a few rogue agents to  the hardworking men and women that protect our Nation every day and who  uphold the ethical standards that we should expect.   The Anti-Border Corruption Reauthorization Act of 2017 will assist  CBP in fulfilling its mission to facilitate legitimate trade and travel  at our ports of entry.   According to the Joint Economic Committee, the volume of commerce  crossing our borders has more than tripled in the last 25 years.  Currently, 1.1 million people and $5.9 billion in goods enter and exit  the U.S. at 328 U.S. ports of entry every day.   In fiscal year 2016, CBP officers and agents seized and/or disrupted  more than 3.3 million pounds of narcotics across the country, including  approximately 46,000 pounds of methamphetamine, 48,000 pounds of  heroin, and 440 pounds of fentanyl, keeping these harmful drugs off of  our streets.   CBP has struggled with recruiting the officers and agents to fill its  frontline ranks at our Nation's air, land, and seaports. Currently,  there are 1,400 unfilled positions within the CBP workforce at our  Nation's ports of entry. Delays and short staffing at our ports of  entry costs the United States economy up to $5.8 billion each year.   Under this bill, the CBP Commissioner may, on a case-by-case basis,  exempt certain veterans and State and local law enforcement officers  who meet specific standards, such as holding a security clearance and  previously passing a polygraph, from having to take the CBP polygraph  as a part of the hiring process. All other vetting requirements in the  12-step hiring process for these applicants will still apply.   This bill simply grants CBP limited authority to waive a single step  in its robust vetting process for qualifying applicants who hold  security clearances or who have successfully completed polygraphs.   I would like to thank Chairman McCaul, Ranking Member Thompson, and  Chairwoman McSally for their work on this bill. I also thank Chairman  McCaul and Chairwoman McSally by accepting changes offered by the  minority to improve this bill.  [[Page H4678]]    Ranking Member Thompson offered an amendment in committee to require  CBP to report to Congress how many of these waivers are requested,  granted, and denied; the reasons for these denials; as well as whether  these applicants are ultimately hired or not.                                time  1515    Additionally, it requires CBP to inform Congress on the number of  applicants who are granted a waiver but undergo a polygraph examination  anyway based on information discovered during their background  investigation. Congress must remain vigilant about how the waiver  authority is used, and this amendment will ensure we have the  information to do so.   Mr. Speaker, in short, the men and women on the front lines of CBP  need our help. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lofgren).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from  New Mexico (Ms. Michelle Lujan Grisham).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Gonzalez).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Gutierrez).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Cuellar).    I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield myself  the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2213, the Anti-Border Corruption Reauthorization  Act of 2017, aims to bring some relief to the tremendous staffing  shortages at our ports of entry by providing CBP with limited authority  to waive its polygraph requirement on a case-by-case basis for certain  veterans and State and local law enforcement officers in its hiring  process.   H.R. 2213 is endorsed by the NTEU, the union that represents  frontline CBP officers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
