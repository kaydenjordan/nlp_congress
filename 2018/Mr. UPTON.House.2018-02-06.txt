 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 725, I call up  the bill (H.R. 772) to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act  to improve and clarify certain disclosure requirements for restaurants  and similar retail food establishments, and to amend the authority to  bring proceedings under section 403A, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on H.R. 772.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill, H.R. 772, is a bipartisan piece of  legislation introduced by Representatives Cathy McMorris Rodgers and  Tony Cardenas to amend the Food and Drug Administration's menu labeling  rule that was issued in November of 2014.   The goal of the bill was to make implementation of the nutrition  disclosure law useful for consumers and workable for food service  establishments. The existing regulatory framework, which has not yet  been implemented, is not only cumbersome for the food industry, but it  also impedes businesses' ability to provide meaningful information that  customers can use to make nutrition decisions.   The Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act is critical to avoid  harming consumers' choices, jobs, and, certainly, small businesses.  This bill was drafted to address the challenges of an overly  prescriptive, one-size-fits-all approach to regulation affecting a  very, very diverse industry.   We need to ensure that the law works for all food establishments:  convenience stores, supermarkets, grocery stores, pizza shops. All have  enormous challenges complying with the regulations as written.   This bill is going to provide those entities with the flexibility  and, frankly, the certainty that they need to comply without  compromising consumers' access to nutrition information. The Common  Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act will establish a more reasonable  standard for Federal regulations and allow nutritional information to  be provided by a remote access menu for establishments where the  majority of orders, in fact, are placed off premises.                                time  1245    Consumers should have this information when they are placing an  order. A menu board may work for some businesses where customers order  at the counter where they also pay, but for an establishment where most  people now order online or from a phone, having the calorie information  when they pick up their order won't be very helpful to that consumer.   This legislation also takes steps to preserve local foods and fresh  items that might be sold at just a few locations. To do so, the bill  clarifies that menu labeling regulations are intended for standard menu  items, defined as those items with substantially the same recipe  prepared in substantially the same way with substantially the same food  components that are routinely included on a menu or menu board or are  routinely offered as a self-service food or food on display at 20 or  more locations.   This bill also eliminates draconian penalties that are required in  current law by removing criminal felony penalties for store managers  and allowing restaurants and retailers to take corrective actions. This  shields small-business owners and their employees from frivolous  lawsuits based on inadvertent human error. No one ought to be  criminalized for putting too many pickles on a sandwich or maybe not  enough olives. This bill further clarifies that establishments will  have 90 days to correct a violation before FDA brings enforcement  action.   The food retail sector employs--let's face it--millions of Americans  and provides access to affordable, healthy options. The Federal  Government shouldn't impose arbitrary regulations that are going to  cause unnecessary harm to businesses and consumers.   The businesses impacted by this bill widely support providing  consumers with nutritional information to better inform their food  decisions, but they want to do it in a practical and a commonsense way.  This legislation provides clear guidance to small-business owners,  ensuring compliance and, at the same time, delivering critical  information.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my Energy and Commerce Committee  colleagues for their work on both sides of the aisle. I urge its  passage today, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I know that I have other speakers, so I am  going to stall a little bit for time here. I am told that some of them  may be at Jimmy John's trying to get through that menu wondering if  they should have olives or pickles or Dijon mustard or mayonnaise, but  they are on their way.   I want to say we all want consumer information--we do--but we ought  to be able to agree that food service establishments shouldn't face  Federal criminal penalties for inadvertent failures to comply with the  FDA's framework.   Under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, food labeling has to be  truthful and non-misleading. Food labeling that doesn't meet FDA's  standard for truthful and non-misleading is deemed misbranded. Under  U.S. Code, introducing misbranded food into commerce is, in fact, a  prohibited act, and the liable party shall be imprisoned for up to a  year, fined not more than $1,000, or both.   Food to which these menu labeling requirements apply is deemed  misbranded if the FDA's rule requirement is not met, so it is not  necessary that the person intentionally misleads customers. Under FDA's  framework, merely adding that extra olive or pepperoni is going to  render the calorie content on the menu misleading and the chef then  becomes criminal.   Come on. People say that the FDA won't put people in jail over this,  so I don't think there ought to be an issue codifying that in statute.  The Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act will give folks an  opportunity to correct inadvertent mistakes so long as they were acting  in good faith, and they are going to make standards far more  reasonable.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from the great State  of Michigan (Mr. Walberg), who is a member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, might I ask how much time each side has  remaining on this bill?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.   Mr. Speaker, I might say the previous speaker, my friend, asked about  what the original stakeholders had in mind before these regs were  written.   I was one of those. This was my bill. This was a bipartisan bill  offered by Jim Matheson and Fred Upton a lot of years ago. It was never  our intent to put people behind bars for having some misinformation  based on the number of olives or pickles or Dijon or mayonnaise. It is  just wrong. It was not our intent to do what the FDA has now done.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman  from Washington (Mrs. McMorris Rodgers), the author of this bill and a  member of our committee, where it passed 39-14.   Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today with legislation to address one of the most  burdensome rules in the Obama administration.   When the FDA announced its final rule implementing a national menu  labeling standard in 2014, the intent was twofold: deliver customers  increased access to nutrition information and establish a uniform,  single national standard.   However, in trying to establish this uniform standard, the FDA's 400- page rule attempts a one-size-fits-all approach to an industry as  diverse as its ingredients.   Under the current rule, every deli and salad bar offering, every  possible pizza topping combination will have to be calculated and their  calorie count displayed on physical menus.  [[Page H819]]    Last week, I was home in Spokane and visited My Fresh Basket. This  newly opened grocery store is also a great place to eat lunch, with  fresh, local options and made-to-order food. This rule would mean new  physical signage every time this locally owned grocer changes the  options they offer, which is just about every day.   This bill is not about the merits of calorie counts. This bill does  not remove the requirement of calorie counts on menus. This bill  certainly does not make it more difficult for customers to receive  nutritional information.   This bill, at its very core, is about flexibility for businesses to  meet the requirements of the rule and present this calorie information  in a way that makes sense for them and their customers.   The one-size-fits-all approach proposed by the FDA is problematic for  two reasons. First, the made-to-order portion of the food industry  offers endless, constantly changing combinations of ingredients. For  some sandwich shops and pizzerias, the possible variations are in the  tens of millions.   The FDA wants these restaurants to put on paper all of these  variations and their calorie counts and have it publicly displayed in  the restaurant. It is unrealistic and it is not a good use of the  businessowner's time.   Second, digital and online ordering is customers' preferred method  for ordering. Nearly 90 percent of orders in some restaurants are  placed without an individual ever stepping foot into the restaurant.   So tell me, how does it make sense to force a restaurant to have a  physical menu with calorie listings when 90 percent of your customers  aren't going to see it? How does it make sense to force a customer to  navigate millions of combinations to find the nutrition information  that matches their order?   This legislation provides flexibility in how restaurants provide the  nutritional information. It makes it easier for customers to actually  see and understand the information because it is displayed where  customers actually place orders, including by phone, online, or through  mobile apps.   By bringing this rule into the 21st century, customers can trust that  they are getting reliable information in a way that is easy to access  and is customer-friendly.   I also want to take this opportunity to clarify that this bill does  not change the preemption provision in the underlying statute. This  ensures that no State or political subdivision of a State may directly  or indirectly establish or enforce any requirement for nutrition  labeling of food that is not identical to the requirement laid out in  the final regulations.   While some States may disagree, I am committed now and moving forward  to ensuring that we have one unified menu labeling requirement.   Before I close, I want to thank all my colleagues and the  stakeholders for their hard work on this bipartisan legislation. This  has been a team effort over a number of years now, and I appreciate  their support.    Finally, I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support this important amendment and to ultimately vote ``yes'' for the  bipartisan Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter), a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would just remind my colleagues that this bill is  supported by literally hundreds of national State and local  organizations, including the National Grocers Association, the National  Association of Convenience Stores, the Food Marketing Institute, the  American Pizza Community, the National Association of Truck Stop  Operators, amongst many, many others.                                time  1330    I want to also reiterate that this bill, again, is bipartisan and has  passed the Energy and Commerce Committee 39-14, in this Congress, and  last year in the House, where it passed 266-144.   The bottom line is this: it clarifies that establishments acting in  good faith will not be penalized, particularly in a criminal way, for  inadvertent human error in reasonable variations in serving sizes and  ingredients, giving them 90 days to correct a violation before  enforcement action is brought by the FDA.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
