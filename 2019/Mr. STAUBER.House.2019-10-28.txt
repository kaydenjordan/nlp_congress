 Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I want to thank Chairman  DeFazio and Ranking Member Graves for their great leadership on the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.   I am pleased to rise in support of my bipartisan legislation that  improves the safety of air travel. I would also like to thank my  colleague, Mr. DeSaulnier, for his support and leadership on this  legislation as well.   Notice to Airmen, or NOTAMs, are extremely important to safety in our  skies. NOTAMs are critical as they relay safety information to pilots  that allow them to understand the possible hazards and conditions of  airports and runways before actually getting to the destination. The  current system simply is not working as well as it should. NOTAMs are  often buried in lengthy reports conflating important safety information  with more common alerts. These inefficiencies have the potential to  create life-threatening situations.    My bill creates a task force at the FAA with important input from  safety experts and industry professionals to address what changes need  to be made to NOTAMs to make air travel even safer than it already is.   Mr. Speaker, I am looking forward to working with my colleagues on  both sides of the aisle on future legislation that directly helps the  American people, and I urge support for my bipartisan bill, the Notice  to Airmen Improvement Act.
