 Madam Speaker, today I wish one of the  members of my team, Sam West, a very happy birthday but also farewell.   Sam is originally from Indianapolis. He went to school at Indiana  University and Purdue University, so he is both a Hoosier and a  Boilermaker. He worked as an auto technician before coming to work here  in Congress.   In healthcare there are a million acronyms. I don't know of any other  place in the world than D.C. that uses more acronyms, and nobody seems  to know what they stand for.   It is because of Sam's time working on automobiles that allowed us to  see eye-to-eye on so many things. I spent my entire career in the  private sector as an auto dealer, and Sam has always been able to  translate a lot of Pennsylvania's healthcare priorities into terms that  I have been using my whole life, and it just clicked. We really worked  well together.   He is moving over to the Senate to be a health policy adviser for  Senator Bill Cassidy. I know he is going to do a great job.   Sam, I tell people all the time, it is not so much the Member that  matters, it is the staff. Here is Sam with a couple of his cheerleader  friends, Indianapolis Colts cheerleaders. Wherever he goes, he will  always be a part of our team, and he is always going to have great  fans.                            ____________________
