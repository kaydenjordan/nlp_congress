 Madam President, I will be very brief here.        What we are trying to do is solve a dilemma for the Nation. The       people we are talking about here almost all came on military aircraft       as the country of Afghanistan descended into darkness.        Yesterday, the Taliban denied a university education for all women.       Basically, all women in Afghanistan, under Taliban rule, can't go to       school anywhere, anyhow.        The people who are here that we are talking about got on military       aircraft--some have come out other ways--and they have fought alongside       us. There is a vetting problem. I acknowledge it.        We are going to solve the vetting problem. We are going to make sure       that people go through a vetting system that protects our national       security interests here at home. But 40 percent of these people were       Chief of Mission vetted.        These are the people who interpreted for us, who were there when we       needed them during this 20-year war, and they have no place to go. If       we send them back, it is a certain death sentence.        We failed to get it in the omnibus, but we are going to keep trying.       I want to let everybody know--the veterans out there who served       alongside this population--we are not going to let you down. They were       there for you, and we are going to be there for you and them. We are       going to get this done. This is the right thing to do.        There is no other ending that is acceptable to me. The people who       were there with us in the fight, that are here in America, need to       stay. This will be their new home. They are willing to die for our       military members and contractors and civilians.        I have been to Iraq and Afghanistan over 50 times. A lot of the       interpreters that I worked with have made it out. I got involved, like       many veterans here in the Senate and the House. So we have a moral       obligation to these people. They will make great citizens over time,       and we are going to vet them to make sure that we have the right people       here.        But I promise Senator Coons and Klobuchar and Wicker and Moran--the       group that started this--that we are going to get this done. To all the       veterans groups: Keep your voice up. We need you now more than ever.       Next year, this will be a top priority.        So we are going to succeed in giving those who were willing to risk       their life for Americans serving abroad a place to call home: America.
