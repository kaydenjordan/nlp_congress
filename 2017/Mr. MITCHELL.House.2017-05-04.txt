 Mr. Speaker, my question today is: How long will the  opposition try to hold on to the failing Affordable Care Act? How long  will they desperately try to hold on with their fingernails, screaming  and thrashing at something that is failing so miserably?   Just this week, it was announced that 94 of 99 counties of Iowa will  not have a carrier at all. In Michigan this year, individual policy  premiums went up 20 percent, never mind deductibles and copays.   While currently 26 million Americans do not have coverage, 19.2  million either claim a waiver or pay a penalty that last year was $3  billion. Yet somehow the other side claims the Affordable Care Act is  some form of nirvana.   The American Health Care Act guarantees issuance of coverage and  targets assistance to those who have health challenges, in contrast to  the Affordable Care Act that just thinks we should throw money at it.  What amazes me, in my first few months here in Congress, if there is a  problem, we will just throw money. The opposition wants a blank check,  which will not work in this country. It is going to kill this country.   Let me suggest to my colleague from Michigan, my neighbor, that if he  wants to schedule to go around the State and talk about the benefits of  this program, the Affordable Care Act, I will go with him. We will go  anywhere he would like to go.
