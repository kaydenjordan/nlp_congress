 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of U.S. Air  Force veteran and San Angelo native Barney Brooks who passed away on  November 7, 2021, at the age of 92.   Mr. Brooks was a born pilot and often joked that he knew he was meant  to fly even before the stork dropped him off.   In the Air Force, Barney served as a lieutenant colonel and combat  pilot completing over 100 missions in the Korean war and 50 in the  Vietnam war. Over his 23-year career, he served in Korea, Vietnam, and  the Cold War, and he was stationed at multiple bases around the United  States and throughout the world.   Our country owes a debt of gratitude to Barney who was brave enough  to don the uniform and put his life on the line many times, as well as  his family, including his beloved wife, Nancy, and five children who  supported him and empowered him to charge forward in the fight for  freedom.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Barney for his noble service.                           Recognizing Philip Parks     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and  legacy of Philip Parks of Odessa, Texas, who passed away on October 29,  2021, at the age of 76.  [[Page H6274]]    Mr. Parks was a devoted Christian, husband, father, and grandfather  who was dedicated to the service of his family, his community, his  church, and many other things, including his country.   Philip served our country valiantly in the U.S. Air Force during the  Vietnam war as a linguist in Taiwan. He was a schoolteacher for over 30  years, a principal for many schools throughout the area, and an  extremely active member of the First Baptist Church and other  organizations, including the Rotary Club and VFW--even serving as a  volunteer firefighter.   We will never know the number of lives he impacted over the course of  his own life. I had the privilege of meeting Mr. Parks right here in  Washington, D.C., on his last flight when he traveled here with the  Permian Basin Honor Flight. What an honor it was to see the service,  the dedication, and the leadership.   I am sending my deepest condolences to his beloved wife, Lois, who  shared 52 years of marriage, and his children, grandchildren, and  great-grandchildren.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Parks for his service.                               Southern Border     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask a simple question: When  will this administration recognize the crisis at our southern border?   Late last night Customs and Border Protection released their record- shattering border crisis numbers. Once again, in the month of October,  more than 164,000 illegal immigrants were apprehended.   This is the worst October in DHS history, and these are only the  numbers of those who were apprehended, not to mention the got-aways.  Drug trafficking and human trafficking is surging. It is confirmed that  MS-13 gang members are crossing into the United States and hundreds of  thousands--in fact, over 2.1 million--have entered this country  illegally with more advancing towards our southern border right now.   Meanwhile, the administration is considering nearly half a million  dollars in payments to illegal immigrants who broke the law while they  are not paying contractors to build the wall and they are leaving  already paid for materials in the field to rot. All this is made worse  by the fact that the President is forcing our brave Border Patrol  officers who are woefully understaffed and lacking the resources they  need to choose between their livelihoods and a vaccine mandate. We have  seen reporting by the Border Patrol that nearly half of its agents  could be fired in less than a week due to the administration's November  22 COVID-19 vaccine deadline.   It has never been more clear. The President has abandoned Texas and  every other border State, and he is cutting his own Border Patrol  agents off at the knees. It is long past time to admit that there is a  crisis at our southern border and that the men and women of the United  States Border Patrol are overwhelmed and they need their Commander in  Chief to support them.   This crisis is not slowing down.   Mr. President, we urge you to secure the border, to not abandon  Texas, and to come to our rescue.
