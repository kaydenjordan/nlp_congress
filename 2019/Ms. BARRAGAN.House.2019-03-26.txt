 Madam Speaker, my colleague on the other side of the  aisle said this was a partisan whack job.   Yet, Congress has come together, which is rare to see these days, on  a bipartisan basis, in the House and in the Senate, to vote to  terminate this alleged crisis that is happening at the border.   This is a constitutional issue. This is about the separation of  powers. This is about Congress' ability to appropriate money and the  President saying he wants something, Congress doesn't give it to him,  and him going around Congress.   Again, this is not a partisan issue. This should not be a partisan  issue.   My Republican colleague in the Senate said: Never has a President  asked for funding and then had Congress not provide the funding, just  to have the President come right back to use the National Emergencies  Act to get around Congress.   This is a dangerous precedent. This is not a messaging vote.   Again, on the House and on the Senate side, on a bipartisan basis,  our colleagues are arguing today that we should stand with the  President.   I urge my colleagues: Stand with the Constitution. Stand with the  Constitution. Let's override this veto.   A wall will not stop the drugs that are coming in, the majority,  through the ports of entry; a wall will not stop migrants who are  coming to present themselves for asylum, legally, at the ports of  entry; and a wall will not stop the inhumane treatment that migrants  are receiving at the ports of entry.   Let's work together on a comprehensive immigration bill. Let's work  together to address this problem, not to fund a wall against the will  of Congress which is being done on a bipartisan and a bicameral basis.
