 Mr. Speaker, when I first took office in March of 2008,  one of my first official acts was to attend memorial services for the  17 students killed and injured in the mass shootings at Northern  Illinois University.   In the 14 years since, I have attempted to comfort families in my  communities again and again, suffering from gun violence like incidents  of the shooting at Henry Pratt.    But until today, we had nothing to offer them but our thoughts and  prayers. What we are going to pass today may not be enough, but it is a  start.
