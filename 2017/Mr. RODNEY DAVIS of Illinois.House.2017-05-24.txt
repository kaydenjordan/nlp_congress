 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the  life and memory of one of Illinois' great journalists, Dave Shaul, who  passed away this month at age 75.   For decades, Dave provided countless central Illinois residents with  their local news as an anchor, producer, and news director at WCIA in  Champaign, Illinois. During his storied television and radio broadcast  career, Dave covered the biggest local, State, and national news,  including covering every Presidential election from 1964 through 2016.  Dave was known for his honest and trustworthy coverage of local and  national politics.   Dave won a number of awards during his career as a journalist. In  1980, he won the UPI Best Television Sports Play-by-Play Award for his  coverage of Illinois basketball. And in 1999, he was honored with the  Associated Press Mark Twain Lifetime Achievement Award, was named to  the Eastern Illinois University Hall of Fame, and was designated a  lifetime member of the Illinois News Broadcasters Association. Dave  also received an Emmy Award for his career accomplishments in 2011.   Dave leaves a long legacy as a trusted figure on the news and in the  Champaign-Urbana community. His family and friends continue to be in my  thoughts and prayers.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from  Florida, and I thank my colleague from Virginia for supporting this  piece of legislation put forth by our friend and colleague from  California, Congressman David Valadao.   The Social Security Number Fraud Prevention Act is a bill that should  gain unanimous support in this institution. According to the Justice  Department, identity theft affects nearly 18 million people, costing  more than $15 billion in 2014 alone. This represents roughly 7 percent  of all Americans age 16 or older. In my home State of Illinois alone,  in 2014, it was recognized that the FTC saw a 65 percent increase in  identity theft. More than 14 percent of the victims are elderly.   We all know that Social Security numbers are the link to a key piece  of information criminals use to steal people's identities. This  commonsense piece of legislation takes a very important step to ensure  that our Federal agencies, our government, funded by the hardworking  taxpayers of this country, are not making this problem even worse.   This bill, as you have heard today, would restrict the use of Social  Security numbers on documents sent via mail by the Federal Government  unless the head of a department or agency determines the inclusion of  such number is necessary--which I can't think of a single instance  where that would be necessary, but I guess we have to put that in there  anyway. This seems like a no-brainer, but we in this institution have  to pass a bill to make sure that it happens, which is why I am a proud  cosponsor of this bill.   I want to thank Congressman Valadao again. I also want to thank  Congress' newest father, our colleague from California, Eric Swalwell,  for being a cosponsor of this legislation, too. This bill will have a  real impact on reducing identity theft in this country, and I want to  commend, once again, everybody on the floor today for their support.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise today also in support of H.R. 953, the Reducing  Regulatory Burdens Act of 2017. The House Committee on Agriculture,  which I serve on, as does Chairman Gibbs, passed this bill out of  committee every Congress since the 112th Congress. The bill language  was likewise included in the 2012 farm bill, reported out of the  committee, as well as in the 2013 farm bill the House sent to  conference. It was also included in the committee-reported text of the  FY 2012 Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies  appropriations bill. But it has never reached the President's desk.   For more than 100 years, the Federal Government has administered its  responsibilities under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and  Rodenticide Act, FIFRA, to review and register pesticides in a  responsible way that protects human health and the environment.   Under the Clean Water Act, the EPA or a State authority issues a  National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit, NPDES permit,  and that regulates the discharge of pollutants. NPDES permits specify  limits on what pollutants may be discharged from point sources and in  what amounts. Since the passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972, the EPA  has interpreted its responsibilities related to pesticide use such that  compliance with FIFRA would mitigate the need for duplicative  permitting under the Clean Water Act.   As litigation in the early part of this decade began to challenge  this interpretation, the EPA ultimately responded with the promulgation  of a regulation on November 27, 2006, to clarify how these two laws  operated. Under the EPA's final rule, the Agency codified its earlier  interpretation that permits for pesticide application under the Clean  Water Act were unnecessary where pesticides were used in accordance  with their regulation under FIFRA.   Following the finalization of this regulation, the rule was  challenged in numerous jurisdictions. The case was ultimately heard in  the Sixth Circuit wherein the government's interpretation of the  interaction of these two laws was not given the deference we would  normally expect. The final court order nullified the EPA's regulation  and imposed what is viewed as a burdensome, costly, and duplicative  permitting process under the Clean Water Act for literally millions of  pesticide applications.   This order has imposed a burden on the EPA, State regulatory  agencies, and pesticide applicators, costing our economy in terms of  jobs as well as severely threatening the already critical budgetary  situation facing governments at all levels. It is particularly  unfortunate that this court order imposed a new requirement that has  imperiled our water resource boards, our mosquito control boards, and  our forestry and agricultural sectors, yet has provided no additional  environmental or public health protection. On the contrary, by imposing  this costly burden on public health pesticide users, it has jeopardized  public health as it relates to protection against insect-borne diseases  such as the Zika virus, West Nile virus, various forms of encephalitis,  and Lyme disease.   I recently heard from the Macon County Mosquito Abatement District in  my district based in and around Decatur, Illinois. They can attest that  the price of complying with NPDES permitting is very high. Though they  had in place a reliable system of tracking chemical usage and treatment  areas for years, the added burden of the NPDES requirements have caused  them to spend a large portion of the district's annual budget on  software strictly just for compliance and reporting processes. The  recurring yearly fees associated with the software are a never-ending  burden needlessly placed on abatement districts. The fear of litigation  dictates the detailed tracking of EPA-approved products and diverts  those funds from their actual purpose of controlling mosquitoes.   The EPA has provided technical assistance to draft this very narrow  legislation. The goal of this legislation has been to address only  those problems created by the decision of the Sixth Circuit and to be  entirely consistent with the policy of the EPA, as stated in their  November 27, 2006, final rule governing application of pesticides to  waters of the United States in compliance with FIFRA.    I urge all Members to vote for this legislation.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, we agree that no one  thinks this bill is going to harm anyone. We are trying to look for  commonsense provisions, and I am thankful to my colleague for making  this a bipartisan solution.   I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho).
