 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, yesterday, I voted to advance the  nominations of Congresswoman Marcia Fudge to be the Secretary of  Housing and Urban Development and Judge Merrick Garland to be Attorney  General.   These aren't the nominees whom any Republican would have picked for  these jobs, but the Nation needs Presidents to be able to stand up a  team so long as their nominees are qualified and mainstream. I have  voted to confirm people like Secretaries Austin, Blinken, Yellen,  Vilsack, and Buttigieg. We certainly disagree on plenty of issues, but  I spent 4 years watching many of our Democratic colleagues do  everything possible to obstruct and delay President Trump's nominees  right from the start.   Now we hear of many of the same Democrats insisting that, as a matter  of principle, a new President needs his team and any delay is an  outrage. It is funny how some things change. My position has not.   I am voting to confirm Judge Garland because of his long reputation  as a straight shooter and a legal expert. His left-of-center  perspective has been within the legal mainstream.    For the country's sake, let's hope our incoming Attorney General  applies that no-nonsense approach to the serious challenges facing the  Department of Justice and our Nation. Let's hope that he controls the  bureaucrats and leftist subordinates that the President proposes to  place under him, rather than the other way around.   When I spoke to Judge Garland, we discussed his commitment to the  ongoing investigation of the events of January 6. Federal law  enforcement needs to continue the work of identifying, arresting, and  prosecuting those who broke the law in order to disrupt the  constitutional business of Congress. He assured me that will remain a  priority.   At the same time, it is essential that DOJ treat political violence  with equal seriousness no matter which political fringe it may come  from. Last summer, riots, vandalism, and even a so-called ``autonomous  zone'' consumed parts of American cities. In some instances, thugs  directly attacked Federal property. But amazingly, some local leaders  seemed more willing to tolerate the chaos than tolerate the angry  tweets that leftwing activists might have sent if they had stepped in  to actually do their jobs.   We were fortunate to have Attorney General Barr, who took seriously  the Federal Government's role to protect Federal property and enforce  Federal law. Judge Garland must be prepared to do the same.   Of course, the riots haven't been the only area where we have seen  liberal governance give short shrift to the rule of law. The Obama  administration was famous for its willingness to let ideology dictate  the enforcement of Federal laws or the lack thereof.   Take the DACA Program, for example. When the Obama administration  realized their preferred immigration policies couldn't get through  Congress the right way, they stretched prosecutorial discretion and law  enforcement discretion to breathtaking unconstitutional extremes. When  confirmed, Judge Garland must not back other constitutionally corrosive  efforts to effectively repeal laws just by ignoring them.   That brings me to the issue of immigration more broadly. Just a few  weeks into the job, the Biden administration and Secretary Mayorkas are  flailing and failing on our southern border. The number of  unaccompanied migrant children in Border Patrol custody has tripled in  just 2 weeks and now dwarfs anything seen during the last 4 years.   Like I mentioned last week, this is not an isolated question of  border policy alone. The backdrop behind this entire crisis is the  giant push toward amnesty and insecurity that the administration  advertised throughout the campaign and every time they step to the  podium now. That is what has enticed people to flood in.   Even now, administration staff keeps parroting strange lines like  ``Now is not the time to come.'' ``Now is not the time to come''? Well,  when is the right time to break Federal law? Is there going to be a  good time to break into the country illegally, and people need to just  be patient and wait for their signal? What on Earth are they talking  about?   A lot of blame for this mess rests on Secretary Mayorkas himself. He  spent the first weeks of his tenure downplaying and denying the crisis  instead of solving it. But, again, the Biden administration's far-left  approach to this issue is not limited to DHS or to the border. Interior  enforcement is a key component.   On Secretary Mayorkas' watch, we have seen what the Washington Post  calls ``a sharp drop'' in arrests by Immigration and Customs  Enforcement--a collapse of more than 60 percent from just the prior few  months--a political choice, in effect, not to enforce the law.   Judge Garland must ensure the Department of Justice takes its duty to  uphold the law more seriously   Mr. President, on a related matter, after we confirm Congresswoman  Fudge and Judge Garland, the Senate will consider two nominees I will  not be supporting. They both report straight to the frontlines of the  new administration's leftwing war on American energy. They would work  to unbalance the balancing act between conservation and the economic  comeback we badly need.   To head the Environmental Protection Agency, the President has  nominated Michael Regan, a longtime regulator and activist. Mr. Regan  has plenty of experience. The problem is what he is poised to do with  it. He and the administration are plainly prepared to put that  experience behind the same far-left policies that crushed jobs and  prosperity in States like Kentucky throughout the Obama administration.   The Clean Power Plan? Back on the table. The absurd waters of the  United States rule? Back on the table.   Kentuckians know that when bad policies like those are on the table,  it means their jobs, their livelihoods, and their communities are on  the menu.   Congresswoman Haaland, the President's pick to lead the Department of  the Interior, was literally an original cosponsor of the Green New  Deal. She has vowed to ``keep fossil fuels in the ground'' and once  pledged ``to vote against all new fossil fuel infrastructure.''   Her record and her views ignore the fact that American energy  independence fueled prosperity for the working class and middle class  over the last 4 years. Yet in multiple of those years, our carbon  emissions actually went down--went down. The supposed choice between a  clean environment and domestic energy independence is a false choice.  It only exists as a zero-sum tradeoff in the minds of Democrats.   We have every reason to believe that voting for Mr. Regan and  Representative Haaland would be voting to raise gas prices for families  who are already struggling, voting to raise fuel and heating bills for  seniors on a fixed income, voting to take the tough times we have been  going through and making them even tougher.   I will be voting for American families and against both of their  nominations.                            ____________________     Mr. President, it was one decade ago that my friend  Brad Richardson saw an opportunity in Hardin County. The community was  ready to step on the gas pedal and start a new era of growth. It had  the raw materials: a dynamic workforce, a premium location, and a  strong ally in Fort Knox. All it needed was the right person to lead  the way. Today, I would like to pay tribute to Brad, a visionary leader  who helped realize the area's potential. At the end of this month, he  will begin a well-deserved retirement with our sincere thanks.   The first step was bringing everyone together. Brad is a natural team  builder. He oversaw the consolidation of four local business advocacy  groups into the Hardin County Chamber of Commerce. The new organization  would help attract investment to one of Kentucky's most populous  counties. As the chamber's inaugural president, Brad spent the next  decade doing just that.   One of Brad's first moves at the new Hardin Chamber was to restart  the annual Small Business Expo. The event gives local entrepreneurs the  opportunities to connect with customers and local leaders as they  expand their operations. Brad also launched a Buy Local campaign to  keep Hardin County's dollars in the community. In 2014, he was named  the Chamber Executive of the Year by the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce  Executives.   Hardin County is more than a great place to live and work. It is also  the proud home to Fort Knox, one of Kentucky's premier military  installations and the location of the U.S. bullion depository. The  installation supports over 20,000 local jobs and makes a multibillion  dollar annual economic impact. In 2016, Brad was a driving force in the  establishment of the Knox Regional Development Alliance. The group is  tasked with promoting the relationship between the community and our  Armed Forces. For his work to encourage the partnership, Brad was given  the Fort Knox Gold Neighbor Award.   I've worked closely with Brad and KRDA to invest in Fort Knox's  infrastructure and capabilities. Last year,  [[Page S1457]]  that hard work paid off. The Pentagon selected Fort Knox to host the  reactivated V Corps headquarters. Kentucky is one of the most military- friendly States in the country, and Hardin County was eager to welcome  more than 600 additional soldiers. I am grateful to KRDA, Brad and his  team, and our many other partners who made the stationing of the V  Corps at Fort Knox a reality.   Over the years, Brad increased chamber membership and made  substantial innovations for his community and our Commonwealth. That  record of accomplishment would be enough for anyone. But Brad was  determined to bring his good humor and enthusiasm to every project. He  made it a real pleasure to be part of his team. When Brad took this  job, he set an ambitious goal to enhance the quality of life in Hardin  County. By any objective standard, I think he succeeded.   So we are all going to miss working with Brad at the Hardin County  Chamber of Commerce. Along with his colleagues and friends, I extend my  best wishes for a fulfilling retirement. On behalf of the Senate, I  would like to congratulate Brad on all of his success and to thank him  for many years of leadership in Kentucky.                            ____________________
