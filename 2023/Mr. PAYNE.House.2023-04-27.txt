 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to praise Bobbi Wilson and her  attempts to rid our neighborhoods of the invasive spotted lantern  flies.   Bobbi Wilson is 9 years old and a young lady from Caldwell, New  Jersey. When she learned about the dangers of spotted lantern flies,  she made it her mission to collect and kill as many of them as  possible.   This invasive species is so dangerous to local plants and trees that  ecologists urge residents to squash them on sight.   Unfortunately, a local Republican Party leader called the police on  her. He said that he was scared when he saw a young, 9-year-old Black  female in his neighborhood.   I am livid that even Black children doing good deeds are subjected to  the abject racism that infects this country.   Luckily, Bobbi Wilson was praised locally and nationally for her  efforts. She earned recognition during a city council meeting and even  from Yale University. No child in America should have to face the  police for doing good deeds in their community.                            ____________________
