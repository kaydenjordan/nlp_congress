 Mr. Speaker, I rise to address the injustice  of poverty and low wealth.   Let me just say, this pandemic has exposed the toll of longstanding,  interlocking inequities stemming from structural racism, poverty,  economic inequality, ecological devastation, and many more systemic  barriers keeping people living on the edge.   Our country now stands at a tipping point. Mr. Speaker, 140 million  people are poor or one healthcare crisis, job loss, or emergency away  from economic desperation. We must prioritize their needs and give them  the opportunity to live in dignity and with hope.   We can realize the third reconstruction to fully address poverty and  low wages from the bottom up, from housing to healthcare, water,  education, and more. We need a third reconstruction to revive our moral  and political commitments to democracy and the founding principles of  this country.   That is why Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal and I have worked with  great leaders, such as Bishop William Barber and Dr. Liz Theoharis, co- chairs of the Poor People's Campaign, A National Call for a Moral  Revival.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to cosponsor our resolution, and I  want to thank the millions of people whose voices we have heard.                            ____________________
