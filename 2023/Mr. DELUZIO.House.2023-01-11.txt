 Madam Speaker, I rise today with the solemn duty to  honor the life of Brackenridge Police Chief Justin McIntire, who was  gunned down in the line of duty last week. His family and my community  mourn Chief McIntire today at his funeral, as does this House and this  country.   Chief McIntire was a hometown hero in Brackenridge and a life-long  resident of the area. He gave his neighborhoods 22 years of selfless  service as a police officer.   Day in and day out, like so many who wear a badge or a uniform, Chief  McIntire put himself in harm's way to keep others safe, ultimately  giving the last full measure of devotion.   He represents the very best of western Pennsylvania, the very best of  America.   So, too, does Tarentum Police Officer Jordan Schrecengost, who was  shot and wounded in the line of duty that fateful day, and is  recovering.   Although Chief McIntire's watch has ended, we will never forget his  sacrifice.                            ____________________
