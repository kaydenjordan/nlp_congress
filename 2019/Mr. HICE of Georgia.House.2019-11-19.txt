 Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend for  yielding a quick moment.   There are few people in Washington, D.C., and in America who have had  the impact of Senator Johnny Isakson. And when we think of Senator  Isakson, no question, there are so many things that come to our mind.   Senator, you are and you have been an incredible statesman, a  phenomenal leader, in Georgia, here in the United States Senate, and in  our country, and we just want to say thank you for all that you have  done for us.   I think, personally, when I first came to Congress, you were one of  the first individuals to reach out to me and to give advice and  encouragement. And to this day, every time I see you, you do that, and  you will never know how much that means.   I just want to publicly state that Johnny Isakson, Senator Isakson,  is a hero for people all across this country. Your brilliant mind and  your leadership will always be here, and we say thank you from the  bottom of our heart. May God bless you and your family as you go into  this next chapter.
