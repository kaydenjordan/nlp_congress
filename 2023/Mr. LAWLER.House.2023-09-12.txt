 Mr. Speaker, yesterday marked the 22nd anniversary of  September 11, 2001, when 2,977 American lives were taken from us on  that fateful day in the worst act of terrorism in our Nation's history.   Over the last few days, I crisscrossed my entire district, attending  more than 10 events, and meeting with constituents and families and  victims of September 11.   Still today, we have first responders dying from 9/11-related  illnesses. It is the responsibility of our Nation to continue to care  for our heroes that went down to Ground Zero to try and save lives and  recover the remains of those we lost.   As a Nation, we have an obligation to ensure that our children never  forget and understand what occurred on that fateful day.   There is not a child in the school system today that was born on 9/11  or before. We must teach this in our schools. Only 14 States currently  teach 9/11 as part of their curriculum. It is shameful, and it needs to  change.   Mr. Speaker, on the 22nd anniversary of September 11, may we always  remember the fallen, and thank our brave men and women who rush toward  danger to preserve, protect, and defend the greatest Nation in the  history of the world.                            ____________________
