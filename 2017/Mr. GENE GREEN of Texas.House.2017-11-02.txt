 Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to thank  the Houston Astros for winning the World Series and giving some folks  in Houston and southeast Texas something to cheer about. We have had a  tough few months, but you could see from last night that there is a lot  of cheering in Houston.   But I am here to talk about a major issue that is really important:  the Children's Health Insurance Program--the CHIP program--and the  federally qualified health centers. Both programs are bedrocks of our  health system, providing health insurance for over 9 million lower  income children, and serving on the front lines of primary care,  providing high-quality primary and preventative care for 25 million  Americans.   Congress let funding for these programs expire more than a month ago,  and we must act in a bipartisan manner to strengthen and sustain them.  Both CHIP and community health centers have always had strong  bipartisan  [[Page H8394]]  support since their creation 20 and 50 years ago, respectively, but not  this time.   We should not cut Medicaid to fund these two programs. You are taking  money away from the poorest children to give to the less poor children.  We need to support vaccination programs, infectious disease detection  and prevention, and chronic disease prevention. We need to make sure  this bill is bipartisan, and it is not right now.                            ____________________
