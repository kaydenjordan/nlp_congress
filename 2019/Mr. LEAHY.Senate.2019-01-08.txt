 Mr. President, the Appropriations Committee has worked  extremely hard to get these bills through. We passed them almost  unanimously. Every single bill to keep this government open has been  passed by this Senate or the Senate Appropriations Committee and will  be passed again if Republicans allow it to come to a vote. They passed  almost unanimously out of committee. Senator Shelby and I worked very,  very hard to have bipartisan bills, and we did. I think the  appropriations bills have had more bipartisan votes than they have had  in over 20 years.   Now, where are we? We are on the 18th day of the Trump shutdown. For  more than 2 weeks now, the President has withheld the paychecks of more  than 800,000 Americans. He has held them hostage in order to extort  Congress into funding his border wall--a wall for which he gave his  word to the American taxpayers over and over again that Mexico would  pay for, not the American taxpayers. Now he says: I want the American  taxpayers to pay for it.   For more than 2 weeks, the President has withheld vital government  services from the American people in order to gain leverage to fulfill  a divisive campaign promise and rally his base. He has totally ignored  that we had passed the bills that would reopen the government.  Shamefully, he cares more about this cynical bumper sticker symbol of  his Presidency than he does about the millions of Americans impacted by  his shutdown or the hardships to come if the Trump shutdown continues.  He wants rhetoric, not reality. I want reality.   I ask, what will the President say to the 800,000 Federal workers who  will not get a paycheck this Friday because of this political stunt?  What will he say to the men and women who have mortgages, families to  feed, and bills to pay? What will he say to those forced to deplete  their hard-earned savings or retirement funds or to those who have no  safety net at all?   I will give an example. Just yesterday, a man called my office. He  has a job with the Internal Revenue Service in Vermont. He has been  furloughed. He will not receive a paycheck this week. He fears he will  not be able to pay his bills past mid-January if he does not get paid.  He has already turned off the cable and most of his family's cell  services to save money. He is concerned about feeding his family, and  his wife has serious medical issues that require attention.  Incidentally, I was looking at the weather report for parts of Vermont.  Tomorrow, it will be 5 degrees below zero. He also has to heat his home  in that weather. So he was upset, he was worried, and he was looking  for help.   Does the President even care about these people? The President claims  he can relate to them, but he dismisses their fears, glibly saying they  will ``make adjustments.'' Make adjustments for their child's medical  bills? Make adjustments for their mortgage payments? Make adjustments  for heating their homes when it is 5 degrees below zero? He even  absurdly claims they support his silly wall. Really? Really? Come on.  There are 800,000 Federal employees who are affected by the Trump  Shutdown. Let somebody poll them and find out how many support what  many in Vermont have called a ``dumb wall.'' I have never heard  anything more tone-deaf from a President of the United States of  America.   Perhaps for a man who was made a millionaire by his father at the age  of 8, the idea of living paycheck to paycheck is a foreign concept, but  it is not to the millions of Americans--both Republicans and Democrats  alike--across this country who struggle to make ends meet. They should  not be bargaining chips in the President's game. This is not a game for  them, and the President should not treat it as such.   In fact, in addition to all of the Federal employees who are  wondering when they will get their next paycheck, vital services on  which many Americans rely and have paid taxes to support have come to a  grinding halt. Remember that. Americans have paid taxes for these  services, and they have come to a grinding halt.   Farmers can't get loans from the U.S. Department of Agriculture-- USDA--to get them through the next planting season because no one is in  the office to process the applications. We passed a 5-year farm bill. I  am proud of the bipartisan bill that Senator Roberts and Senator  Stabenow led through the Senate. I was one of the conferees on that  farm bill, and it was bipartisan. It is complicated, and there are new  rules in it, but the USDA cannot implement the new farm bill because  all of the staff have been furloughed. How about all of the midwestern  farmers who don't know what the rules are going to be before they start  planting? They have to make that decision now. They paid their taxes to  have the Department of Agriculture to help them, but it is closed now.   Our national parks--the prize of this country since the time of Teddy  Roosevelt--are being vandalized and littered with trash and human  waste. Since the Trump shutdown began, seven people have died in  national parks. The parks were left unsupervised and unstaffed.   Homebuyers are finding out that their Federal Housing Administration  loan applications are on hold.   Food safety inspections are slowing. How many people are going to die  of food poisoning?   The Small Business Administration has stopped issuing new business  loans, and our Federal courts are running out of money.   This is the United States of America. We are an embarrassment to the  rest of the world because of this. The President should be embarrassed  because he is the one who has asked for the Trump Shutdown.   Everyone agrees that we need to secure our borders, but there are  smart ways to do it. A wall is not one of them. It is a 5th-century  solution to a 21st-century problem. In 2015, the President's own acting  Chief of Staff said that the idea of a wall was ``absurd and almost  childish.'' He said that a ``fence doesn't stop anybody who really  wants to get across . . . you go under,  [[Page S43]]  you go around, you go through it.'' It may be one of the few times Mick  Mulvaney and I are in agreement.   To do what the President wants to do would require seizing land from  ranchers and farmers. Some of these ranchers and farmers have had that  land in their families for years. They are proud, hard-working,  taxpaying Americans, and we say that we are going to come in with a  wall through their land. It would require building walls through  wildlife refuges and nature preserves. It would forever scar the  landscape and ecosystem of the southwest border in ways we cannot  anticipate. After all of that and billions of wasted taxpayer dollars,  what would we have accomplished?   Tonight, the President will assert that the security of our Nation is  in crisis. He will assert that criminals and drugs are pouring across  the border. But his claims are not grounded in fact. That is typical of  the claims he makes. The disinformation coming from the White House has  been staggering.   In his zeal to feign a national emergency at the border, the  President has employed nothing short of a propaganda campaign like we  have seen in dictatorships of the past.   The reality is that between the year 2000 and 2018, apprehensions at  the border have dropped. How much? They have dropped by 75 percent. The  reality is that apprehensions at the southwest border have dropped to  similar levels we had in the 1970s. It has dropped.   The reality is, many southern border communities have violent crime  rates that are lower than the national American average. The reality,  according to the Drug Enforcement Administration, is that the vast  majority of drugs apprehended at the border are seized at ports of  entry so a wall between such ports would be entirely useless at  stopping drugs.   The demographic that is increasing in number are families--women and  children--seeking asylum. Many are not even trying to sneak past the  Border Patrol; they present themselves to Border Patrol agents when  they cross. They are not here to perpetuate violence; they are fleeing  violence, they are fleeing murder, they are fleeing rape, they are  fleeing crime from their countries. Wasting billions of American  taxpayer dollars to build a wall will not stop them from coming. We  need comprehensive immigration reform--like the bipartisan bill the  Senate passed in 2013--and smart foreign policy to address these  issues, not fearmongering, not distortions, not lies, and certainly not  thousands of miles of concrete or steel.   The Constitution vests the power of the purse to Congress. It is our  job to be good stewards of taxpayer dollars. A border wall doesn't meet  that threshold. Even if it did, the President has never provided us  with a detailed plan for how he would spend the money, and he has been  all over the map about how much he is demanding. The only thing he has  said is: We are going to have a wall, and Mexico will pay for it. Fine,  let Mexico pay for it. For someone who spent years as the host of a  reality TV show, reality has never been his strong suit.   We are not in the business of providing blank checks to satisfy  Presidential whims. The President's own budget request to Congress was  $1.6 billion for the wall, and he has never submitted an addendum. No  matter how much he or others talk about it, he never has. Instead, he  makes demands by tweets and through the press. I have lost track of all  the times his demands for the wall have changed, but I still go back to  the original request. The only request in his budget was $1.6 billion.   This weekend, Democrats asked the Vice President for more details on  their border wall request. The administration sent Chairman Shelby and  me a letter asking for $7 billion in border security investments that  the President is demanding as part of this negotiation, including $5.7  billion for the wall. This letter came out of nowhere 3 months into the  fiscal year and 18 days into the shutdown, and it did not come from the  President, it came from the Acting Director of the Office of Management  and Budget. I think I may have that letter. They are asking for $5.6  billion more for the Department of Homeland Security than they proposed  in their original budget request, including an additional $4.1 billion  for the wall. This came up this weekend, but the letter included no  budget justification, no details, and no suggestions for how to pay for  it. The letter has a lot of cliches but does not say where the money  comes from or what it is going to do. That is not the way we operate.  It should not be the way we operate.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:           Executive Office of the President, Office of Management             and Budget,                                   Washington, DC, January 6, 2019.      Hon. Patrick Leahy,      Vice Chairman, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate,           Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Leahy: The President continues to stress the       need to pass legislation that will both reopen the Federal       Government and address the security and humanitarian crisis       at our Nation's Southwest border. The Administration has       previously transmitted budget proposals that would support       his ongoing commitment to dramatically reduce the entry of       illegal immigrants, criminals, and drugs; keep out       terrorists, public safety threats, and those otherwise       inadmissible under U.S. law; and ensure that those who do       enter without legal permission can be promptly and safely       returned home.        Appropriations bills for fiscal year (FY) 2019 that have       already been considered by the current and previous       Congresses are inadequate to fully address these critical       issues. Any agreement for the current year should satisfy the       following priorities:        Border Wall, Customs and Border Protection (CBP): The       President requests $5.7 billion for construction of a steel       barrier for the Southwest border. Central to any strategy to       achieve operational control along the southern border is       physical infrastructure to provide requisite impedance and       denial. In short, a physical barrier--wall--creates an       enduring capability that helps field personnel stop, slow       down and/or contain illegal entries. In concert with the U.S.       Army Corps of Engineers, CBP has increased its capacity to       execute these funds. The Administration's full request would       fund construction of a total of approximately 234 miles of       new physical barrier and fully fund the top 10 priorities in       CBP's Border Security Improvement Plan. This would require an       increase of $4.1 billion over the FY 2019 funding level in       the Senate version of the bill.        Immigration Judge Teams--Executive Office for Immigration       Review (EOIR): The President requests at least $563 million       for 75 additional Immigration Judges and support staff to       reduce the backlog of pending immigration cases. The       Administration appreciates that the Senate's FY 2019 bill       provides this level of funding, and looks forward to working       with the Congress on further increases in this area to       facilitate an expansion of in-country processing of asylum       claims.        Law Enforcement Personnel, Border Patrol Agent Hiring, CBP:       The President requests $211 million to hire 750 additional       Border Patrol Agents in support of his promise to keep our       borders safe and secure. While the Senate's FY 2019 bill       supports some Border Patrol Agent hiring, fulfilling this       request requires an increase of $100 million over the FY 2019       funding level in the Senate version of the bill.        Law Enforcement Personnel, Immigration and Customs       Enforcement (ICE): The President requests $571 million for       2,000 additional law enforcement personnel, as well as       support staff, who enforce our U.S. immigration laws and help       address gang violence, smuggling and trafficking, and the       spread of drugs in our communities. This would require an       increase of $571 million over the FY 2019 funding level in       the Senate version of the bill.        Detention Beds, ICE: The President requests $4.2 billion to       support 52,000 detention beds. Given that in recent months,       the number of people attempting to cross the border illegally       has risen to 2,000 per day, providing additional resources       for detention and transportation is essential. This would       require an increase of $798 million over the FY 2019 funding       level in the Senate version of the bill.        Humanitarian Needs: The President requests an additional       $800 million to address urgent humanitarian needs. This       includes additional funding for enhanced medical support,       transportation, consumable supplies appropriate for the       population, and additional temporary facilities for       processing and short-term custody of this vulnerable       population, which are necessary to ensure the well-being of       those taken into custody.        Counter-narcotics/weapons Technology: Beyond these specific       budgetary requests, the Administration looks forward to       working with Congress to provide resources in other areas to       address the unprecedented challenges we face along the       Southwest border. Specifically, $675 million would provide       Non-Intrusive Inspection (NII) technology at inbound lanes at       U.S. Southwest Border Land Ports of Entry (LPOE) would allow       CBP to deter and detect more contraband, including narcotics,       weapons, and other materials that pose nuclear and       radiological threats. This would require an increase of $631       million over the FY 2019 funding level in the Senate version       of the bill.  [[Page S44]]         In addition, to address the humanitarian crisis of       unaccompanied alien children (UACs), Democrats have proposed       in-country asylum processing for Central American Minors.       This would require a statutory change, along with       reallocation of State Department funds to establish in-      country processing capacities at Northern Triangle consulates       and embassies. Furthermore, for the new procedure to achieve       the desired humanitarian result, a further corresponding       statutory change would be required to ensure that those who       circumvent the process and come to the United States without       authorization can be promptly returned home. Without the       latter change, in-country processing will not reduce the       unauthorized flow or successfully mitigate the humanitarian       crisis.''        These upfront investments in physical barriers and       technology, as well as legislation to close loopholes in our       immigration system, will reduce illegal immigration, the flow       of illicit drugs entering our country and reduce the long       term costs for border and immigration enforcement activities.        The Administration looks forward to advancing these       critical priorities as part of legislation to reopen the       Government.            Sincerely,                                                 Russell T. Vought,                                                   Acting Director.     The President may not care about the impact the shutdown  is having on millions of Americans, but the U.S. Senate--a body that  should be the conscience of the Nation--should care. Stoking fear  through misinformation in order to promote a political agenda is simply  wrong. We could and should reopen the government this week.   Last week, the House passed a bipartisan, six-bill minibus to reopen  most of the government and a continuing resolution for the Department  of Homeland Security. To show how bipartisan it is, the six  appropriations bills the House passed originated in the Republican- controlled Senate last Congress and had bipartisan support, including  by Senator Shelby as chairman and by myself as vice chairman of the  Appropriations Committee.   I worked hard with Senator Shelby--and I admire his efforts--to  produce these bills last summer and fall, and all of them received  nearly unanimous support when they were considered on the floor of the  Senate or in the Appropriations Committee. Senator McConnell should  bring them to the floor of the U.S. Senate today and put them up for a  vote. We have already shown virtually every Republican and every  Democrat in this body will vote for them.   Bring them up. Let's vote for them. End this nonsense. End it. The  leader owes that to the American people. We owe that to the American  people. Let us be the conscience of the Nation, not an institution that  is simply a foil for the latest tweet or posting. We can do it. We have  passed these bills before. Bring them up. Bring them up. Bring them up,  and pass them again. Republicans and Democrats have voted for them in  the past. The Republican chairman and I strongly support them. Bring  them up. Bring them up. Bring them up and pass them and open the  government and let 800,000 Americans stop their suffering.   I yield the floor.   I see the Senator seeking recognition, so I withhold my request.
