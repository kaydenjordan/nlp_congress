 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my two amendments  to the NDAA to ensure the Pentagon pays attention to the most  vulnerable, both within the ranks and within the theaters of war, where  they operate.   My first amendment is a response to the ongoing but still poorly  understood problem of hazing in the military. For years, unchecked  hazing has been eroding unit cohesion and troop morale. Too many, like  my own nephew, Harry Lew, have died by suicide after having been  mercilessly hazed by their fellow soldiers.   Stopping this requires understanding the problem, which is why this  amendment extends regular reports through 2027 on hazing and what the  Pentagon is doing to address it.   My second amendment is a response to the horrific August drone strike  in Kabul that killed at least 10 civilians. This kind of mistake is  inexcusable. These families can never get their loved ones back, but  with just compensation they can begin to rebuild their lives. Accepting  our responsibility is the bare minimum of what they deserve.   Madam Speaker, I urge support of this en bloc package.
