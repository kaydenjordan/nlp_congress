 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, as I have said before, when it comes to the  actions of government, it is often legislation that grabs the biggest  headlines. But it is equally important to focus on what a Presidential  administration is doing with its regulatory power--something I was  reminded of again last week when I signed on to a letter headed by  Senator Cassidy on the Biden administration's proposed new overtime  rule. Because in the modern regulatory state, Presidents have a  tremendous amount of power to affect our economy and Federal policy  through regulation.   Today, I would like to take a couple of minutes to talk about some  labor regulations coming out of the Biden administration that are  likely to prove detrimental to workers, business owners, and our  economy.   Let me start, as I mentioned, with the Biden administration's  proposed new overtime rule. This proposal would impose a 55-percent  increase in the exemption threshold for providing overtime pay for  covered employees.   Currently, employers are required to pay covered employees making  less than $35,568 per year overtime if they work more than 40 hours per  week. Under the Biden administration's proposed new rule, employers  would be required to pay overtime to covered employees making less than  $55,068. As I said, a massive 55-percent increase in the exemption  threshold.   So what would be the effects of this proposed rule? It would likely  result in some combination of higher prices, fewer job opportunities,  and lower base pay for employees because employers--and I am thinking  particularly of small businesses that are always going to be hit  hardest by regulations like this--are going to be forced to look for  ways to offset what could be a substantial increase in costs.   Indeed, many small businesses will have to find some way of  offsetting this cost increase if they want to stay profitable. So  businesses large and small are likely to compensate either by  increasing prices on their goods or services, reducing the number of  positions that they have available, or lowering the base pay to create  room to pay overtime wages. Needless to say, none of these are  attractive options for workers, consumers, or businesses.   Consumers are currently stretched to their limit with price hikes in  the Biden economy, and lower base pay or fewer available positions are  not attractive options for American workers.   By the way, you don't have to take my word for it on that lower base  pay. The head of President Biden's own Council of Economic Advisers has  previously noted:         The costs of increase [overtime] coverage would ultimately       be borne by workers as employers set base wages taking       expected overtime pay into account.    It would be nice if this were the only bad labor rule coming out of  the Biden administration, but it is not. Among  [[Page S5440]]  other bad regulations, there is also the independent contractor rule,  which the Biden Labor Department is likely to finalize soon. It is  referred to as the ``independent contractor rule,'' but in many ways,  that is a misnomer because this rule is likely to substantially reduce  the number of independent contractors.   How? By replacing the previous administration's independent  contractor rule, which would have provided clear guidelines for  determining whether a worker classifies as an independent contractor,  with a vague, sweeping new rule that could end up with many workers  being reclassified as employees.   Independent contractors, who range from computer programmers to  freelance editors to Uber and Lyft drivers, generally value independent  contracting thanks to things like the flexibility and opportunity that  this path provides.   Indeed, a 2017 survey from the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that  fewer than 1 in 10 independent contractors would prefer traditional  employee status. But thanks to the Biden administration, many of them  may be forced into employee status.   The rule will threaten workers in the gig economy, which is made up  of platforms like Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, and TaskRabbit, that allow  workers to pursue full-time work with a platform or simply augment  their income from a regular 9-to-5 position.   The bad ideas don't end with the independent contractor rule. There  is also the joint employer rule the National Labor Relations Board  recently finalized--yet another move from the Biden administration to  use the power of the Federal Government to advantage unions.   The joint employer rule substantially changes the standard of what  constitutes a joint employer, which comes into play in a major way with  franchising. To put this in practical terms, this rule means that  companies could end up being considered joint employers of employees at  franchised locations of their business, which could force both the  company and the local franchise owners to negotiate with unions, or  make both the company and local franchise owners liable for unfair  labor practices that potentially only one party is responsible for.    The result is likely to be that companies cut back on franchising or  increase oversight or control of their franchisees, which would disrupt  one of the most accessible paths to business ownership for Americans  looking to run their own businesses.   In comments after the new joint employer rule was proposed, the  International Franchise Association noted:         The proposed rule will needlessly upend the franchise       business model and close the door to opportunity for hundreds       of thousands of Americans, especially women, people of color,       veterans, and first-time business owners.    But, apparently, that doesn't matter to the Biden administration, as  long as union bosses are benefiting.   On the economic front, President Biden is perhaps most famous for  helping to kick off the worst inflation crisis in 40 years with the so- called American Rescue Plan. But as these rules and regulations  demonstrate, the President is continuing to build on that negative  economic legacy with regulations that will diminish economic  opportunities for workers and entrepreneurs and likely continue to  drive up prices for consumers.   In other words, business as usual in the Biden administration: The  President imposes his Big Government policies, and the American people  end up paying the price.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from Wyoming (Mr. Barrasso), the Senator from North Dakota (Mr.  Cramer), the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Scott), and the Senator  from Ohio (Mr. Vance).   Further, if present and voting: the Senator from Ohio (Mr. Vance)  would have voted ``nay.''
