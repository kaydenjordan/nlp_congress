 Madam Speaker, I want to thank Chairman McGovern for  yielding, and also for his leadership on the Rules Committee and,  equally important, his relentless leadership in the House to help those  that are unacceptably hungry in America.   I rise today as a member of the House Appropriations Committee to  urge support for the rule and the bill, which includes important  investments to fight our Nation's substance use and mental health  crisis, and significant funding for the National Institutes of Health.   The COVID pandemic has only worsened our Nation's addiction and  mental health epidemics. The data is alarming. Last year over 93,000  people died in America from an overdose. That is a 30 percent increase  in our country. This year more people are reporting frequent thoughts  of suicide and self-harm than ever before.   Unlike COVID, there will be no vaccine for addiction, no vaccine for  mental health.   It is going to take consistent, increased funding to meet the needs  of our most vulnerable Americans. I am happy to say this bill does  that. I am also happy to have secured over $6 million in this bill for  critical projects in Maryland's Sixth District that invest in important  social services for the most vulnerable and job training in our  community for those that need it the most.   I want to thank Chair Rosa DeLauro for her work to lead this  committee and invest long term in this important funding for our  country. I urge a ``yes'' vote.    Madam Speaker, I rise today as a Member of the House  Appropriations Committee in opposition to this mindless amendment which  would gut the important investments this bill makes on our Nation's  physical and social infrastructure.   Our Nation faces an unprecedented housing crisis. This bill would  ensure 4.8 million people remain stably housed by increasing  investments by $8.7 billion.   Our Nation's infrastructure is falling apart. This bill provides  robust funding for highways, transit, rail, and aviation, and we must  do better for our Nation's veterans when it comes to mental health.   This bill almost doubles the funding for the Veterans Suicide  Prevention and Outreach Program and for the Veterans Crisis Line. These  investments benefit our constituents from Montgomery County to Garrett  County.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank Chair DeLauro for caring so much for  all Americans. I urge a ``no'' vote to this amendment and support the  work of the Appropriations Committee.                                time  1700
