 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize National Opioid  Awareness Week. My home State of Kentucky has been one of the hardest  hit by our Nation's ongoing opioid crisis. Sadly, over 1,300  Kentuckians died of a drug overdose in 2018.   I have been proud to work with my colleagues on the House Energy and  Commerce Committee to combat the ongoing nationwide opioid epidemic.  Next month we will honor the 1-year anniversary of the SUPPORT Act  being signed into law. This landmark legislation is already helping  communities prevent the rampant spread of opioid abuse, but more work  needs to be done.   Last month I visited the Customs and Border Patrol international mail  facility located at JFK Airport in New York. There I saw firsthand the  dangers of illicit fentanyl coming through our borders. Fentanyl is a  synthetic opioid that can be so potent it can kill anyone that comes in  contact with it, including our law enforcement officers. I will  continue to work with President Trump and my colleagues to stop  fentanyl from coming to our country and help stop this epidemic from  harming our communities.                            ____________________
