 Madam Speaker, for 11 years now, the  families of Continental Flight 3407 have come to Capitol Hill with the  heart-driven goal of improving airline safety.   Thanks to their efforts, and with bipartisan support from Congress,  the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill of 2010  included measures to improve transparency and safety for the flying  public.   At long last, the Pilot Records Database, one of the final elements  to be implemented, is moving forward.   The captain of Flight 3407 had only 600 hours of flight experience  and failed three practical tests known as check rides. Still,  Continental and its regional carrier, Colgan Air, hired him.   The National Transportation Safety Board found that pilot error had  caused the crash.   Led by the courageous family and friends of the victims of Flight  3407 and their tragic yet awe-inspiring public advocacy to protect the  flying public, this success, in a deeply personal way, belongs to them  and those they loved and lost.                            ____________________
