 Mr. Speaker, today, instead of working to  protect DREAMers, enacting commonsense gun safety legislation, or  reforming our tax system to benefit hardworking Americans and not just  the wealthy, I have to stand here and speak out against H.R. 36,  another radical assault against women's health and reproductive rights,  a bill that would deny care to women in the most desperate of  circumstances, a bill designed to restrict a woman's access to a full  range of healthcare services, and a blatant attempt to chip away at a  woman's right to choose.   Congressional Republicans failed in their numerous attempts to strip  healthcare away from everyone, so they will settle for just taking  health decisions away from women.   We settled this issue 40 years ago. Women have the constitutionally  protected right to manage their own bodies. I will continue to defend  the woman's right to choose and vigorously oppose any and all attacks  against that.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New  York for yielding to me.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise for Kerri from New Jersey. This is her  story.   With the help of a fertility specialist, Kerri and her husband were  thrilled to be expecting their first baby in January of 2016. All of  Kerri's tests and scans were looking great until the 20-week  ultrasound.   Kerri recounts: Our ultrasound tech spent a lot of time looking at  her heart, and, finally, the doctor from maternal fetal medicine came  in.   As she scanned, she told Kerri and her husband that there were some  severe brain and heart abnormalities. The doctor also told them the  chest cavity was small and that the lungs were not developing properly.  A few days later, a geneticist told Kerri and her husband that the baby  had three copies of every chromosome, a very rare condition. The doctor  informed them that infants born with this condition very rarely survive  more than a few days after delivery.   According to Kerri: We both calmly made the decision to have an  abortion. We did not want our little girl to suffer. We would much  rather take on that suffering for her.   On behalf of Kerri, New Jerseyans, and women everywhere, I urge my  colleagues to vote ``no'' on this rule and vote ``no'' on H.R. 36.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague and my  friend, Mr. Bennie Thompson, for organizing this important Special  Order hour honoring his fellow Mississippian, Ms. Fannie Lou Hamer.   Yesterday, Cosmopolitan published an article written by Zerlina  Maxwell, aptly titled ``Trust Black Women.'' In the article, Maxwell, a  fellow New Jerseyian, quoted her colleague, who said: ``Black women  have been a part of every great movement that has happened in this  country. We always show up.''   Tonight, we celebrate the birth of Fannie Lou Hamer, a black woman  who, like many of us, always showed up. In 1964, Fannie Lou Hamer  showed up at the Democratic National Convention to speak on behalf of  the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party and highlight the hurdles,  both physical and political, that were preventing Blacks in the South  from showing up at the ballot box.   During her testimony, she recounted her 26-mile journey to Indianola,  Mississippi, to register to vote at the county courthouse where seven  other men and women were looking to do the same. On the way, they  encountered coordinated opposition from local and State law enforcement  and men and women who sought to deter them from exercising their right  to vote.   Upon returning home, Fannie Lou Hamer found that she had been fired  from her job. According to The New York Times, she said: ``They kicked  me off the plantation; they set me free. It is the best thing that  could happen. Now I can work for my people.''   That same year, Fannie Lou Hamer ran for Congress as a candidate from  Mississippi's Second Congressional District. And even in her defeat,  Ms. Hamer continued to show up and work for her people.   In 2014, 50 years after her testimony and her run for Congress,  residents in New Jersey's 12th Congressional District elected me, the  State's first ever African-American woman to represent them here in the  House of Representatives.   During my freshman term, I joined my two amazing colleagues,  Representative Robin Kelly of Illinois and Representative Yvette  Clarkee of New York, to form the first ever Congressional Caucus on  Black Women and Girls, a body of elected officials who work to ensure  that Congress shows up for us.   And in 2016, I stood at the Democratic National Convention, standing  on the shoulders of Ms. Hamer's legacy, and proudly told America that  this Nation is stronger when everyone has a chance to succeed.   Ms. Hamer would beam with pride knowing that my colleagues and I  continue to beat back hurdles placed at the feet of minorities and the  poor that restrict their access to the vote.   Ms. Hamer, however, would be very sad to know that, instead of being  fired for trying to exercise the right to vote, they change polling  places or amend requirements for valid identification. It is the same  game, she would recognize, it is just different tactics.   I am honored to stand here to honor the birthday of Ms. Fannie Lou  Hamer, walk alongside her footsteps of greatness and, like she so often  did, lift as I climb. We as women, and women of color, have to be the  standard bearers we have been and continue to be. We have always and  will continue to fight for what is right and what is necessary, even if  we must do this alone.   As we battle back against the racism, the sexism, and the bigotry  that runneth over in this administration, we must always be awake,  alert, and to show up.   Today, in honoring the birthday of Fannie Lou Hamer, we  simultaneously celebrate the strength of women, the ways we can  encourage one another to be our sisters' keepers, and continue to build  a future for the next generation of women ready and waiting to show up  and to lead.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I did not ever have the pleasure  and honor of meeting her in person, but I remember watching television  during that Democratic National Convention, which was taking place in  my home State in the great city of Atlantic City.   I remember the conscious bearing energy that evolved around all of  that activity, and it made me very proud. And I would say that, indeed,  Fannie Lou Hamer's work has not gone, has not been in vain. But she  also is smiling down knowing that what she started, you are continuing  on, and that you are serving in the very district that she loved enough  to fight for way back when.   It is my honor to know you, and to know that you have been touched by  her. So that means that with less than 6 degrees of separation, I have  been touched by her, and that is my blessing.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I think it is vitally important on  this 100th anniversary of Ms. Hamer's birth to also recognize that we  are still fighting for the unfettered access to the vote, and that here  in Congress, we have the opportunity to eliminate barriers and to fix  the problems with the Civil Rights Act that just negatively impacts  access and unfettered access to voting. There are just so many  fundamental things that we could be doing today that honor the work  that she did and that she gave her life's work to.   In closing for me, I want to just say that I thank the gentleman so  very much for doing this because I know that there are people who  listen to these moments of Special Orders hours on C-SPAN, or catch it  in some other form. It is important for our communities to recognize  just how significant this woman's role was in ensuring that they have  the access to the things that they have access to today, and to demand  their right to vote, and to exercise that right to vote every chance  they get.   I am very grateful for the gentleman carrying this message this  evening.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I would just like to note that there was an amazing demonstration of  people in front of the Supreme Court demanding that we do something  about gerrymandering because that is another way of negatively  impacting the impact of one man and one vote.   So it is, again, fitting to be honoring this woman who gave her  life's work to ensuring that everybody who was eligible to vote was  given the right to vote; to eliminate any obstacles that were placed in  their way so that we could open up opportunities to elect people who  would be fair in the policies that are important; to ensure that there  is equality of opportunity in this country for all people, predicated  upon their ability to do the intellect and their willingness to work  hard, therefore, the content of their character versus the color of  their skin. So it is indeed an honor to have shared this moment with  you. Thank you for the invitation.
