 Madam Speaker, on September 9, 2006, Corporal Johnathan  Lee Benson from North Branch, Minnesota, succumbed to his injuries  sustained in a roadside bombing during his second tour of duty in Iraq.  He was 21 years old.   By all measures, Johnathan was a courageous and enthusiastic young  man with an infectious smile, a prankster's heart, and a love for  adventure.   He was dedicated to our country and to the Marines. Tattooed on his  back was the Bible verse: Greater love knows no man than this, that he  lay down his life for his friends.   Madam Speaker, Johnathan not only laid down his life for our country,  but he gave up his hopes, his dreams, and his future to preserve,  protect, and defend ours.   For 15 years, I have worn this bracelet in his memory, and today, I  am honored to enter his name into the Congressional Record and to  recognize his wonderful parents, a Gold Star family, Marjorie and Steve  Benson.
