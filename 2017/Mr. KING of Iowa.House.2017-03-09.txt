 Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 150.   The Acting CHAIR. There being no further amendments, under the rule,  the Committee rises.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Womack) having assumed the chair, Mr. Byrne, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 725) to  amend title 28, United States Code, to prevent fraudulent joinder, and,  pursuant to House Resolution 175, he reported the bill back to the  House.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is  ordered.   The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.   The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was  read the third time.                              Motion to Recommit    Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit  at the desk.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill?   Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. I am opposed in its current form.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to  recommit.   The Clerk read as follows:         Ms. Kuster of New Hampshire moves to recommit the bill H.R.       725 to the Committee on the Judiciary with instructions to       report the same back to the House forthwith with the       following amendment:        Add, at the end of the bill, the following:       SEC. 3. PROTECTING AMERICANS' RIGHT TO HOLD GOVERNMENT                     OFFICIALS TO ETHICAL STANDARDS.         Nothing in this Act or the amendments made by this Act may       be construed to apply to a civil action pertaining to ethics       in government.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from California is  recognized for 5 minutes.   Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment  to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee.  If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as  amended.   Today, our country is in an era where appropriate ethics and conduct  by elected officials is of the utmost importance.   I think we can agree that many representatives and others in  government have failed to live up to the expectations of the American  people.   We all have immense responsibility to advocate for our constituents,  and it is so important that our work and the work of those in this  administration reflect our genuine desire to do well on the part of  those we represent.   I have heard from literally thousands of my constituents in New  Hampshire who are concerned about the President's reluctance to fully  give up control of his businesses, his refusal to publicly disclose his  tax returns, and the connections between Russia and those in his  campaign and the administration. This pattern of nondisclosure and  hidden interests in the administration could put our public welfare  and, indeed, our national security at stake.   Citizens must have all the legal tools at their disposal to push back  against improper ethics and crony capitalism at all levels of  government, including the highest levels of the Federal Government.   This also includes instances in which a business could face unfair  competition because conflicts of interest in government provide unfair  support to their competitors.   Unfortunately, the bill before us today makes it harder for those who  may have been wronged by established and well-funded interests to get a  fair shot in court.   My amendment simply states that nothing in this legislation shall be  construed to apply to any civil action related to ethics in government.  Private citizens trying to hold government officials to high ethical  standards should not have barriers like this legislation thrown in  their way.   Going forward, I hope that as Republicans and Democrats we can work  together to promote legislation and efforts that increase transparency  in government, rather than making it more difficult for citizens to  hold the government accountable.   I ask that my colleagues support this important motion to recommit.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 150.   The Acting CHAIR. There being no further amendments, under the rule,  the Committee rises.
