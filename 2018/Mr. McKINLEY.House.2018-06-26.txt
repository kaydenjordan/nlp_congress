 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, increasing funding for arthritis research within the  Department of Defense is an issue that deserves and warrants our  attention. Military servicemembers and veterans live with arthritis at  significantly higher rates than civilians.   A recent study found that servicemembers aged 20 to 24 had  osteoarthritis at a 26 percent higher rate than their civilian  counterparts. In the same study, servicemembers over 40 are twice as  likely to develop osteoarthritis after returning to civilian life.  Arthritis affects one in three veterans and is the second leading cause  of medical discharges.   The corresponding healthcare and disability compensation costs are  ultimately borne by the taxpayer. But by increasing research funding,  we could help identify ways to reduce the risk and help prevent the  development of arthritis in our military training and service.   As co-chairman of the Arthritis Caucus with Anna Eshoo, I have been  engaged with the Arthritis Foundation, the American College of  Rheumatology, and other organizations on this important issue. We are  asking Chairwoman Granger to commit to working with us to ensure that  arthritis research receives the funding it deserves.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairwoman for her  consideration on this important issue, and I look forward to working  with her as we move forward.
