 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   If every Senate Republican did their job, we wouldn't be in this  mess. Yet yesterday, 18 Republican Senators voted for this $1.7  trillion omnibus bill in order to skip town for Christmas. Those Senate  Republicans got played by the Democrats as expertly as my wife plays  the violin.   Unfortunately, we are likely to see Republicans in this body do the  very same thing and get played the very same way as the Senate, hoping  to quickly and quietly pass this massive spending bill with no  questions or accountability.   But Americans deserve the truth. A vote for this bill is a vote for  increasing inflation as Americans struggle to afford the costs of  living; bolstering foreign nations' border security, while woefully  ignoring our wide-open southern border, rubber-stamping wasteful pork  projects like LGBTQ museums, to bee-friendly highways and everything in  between, empowering alphabet agencies like the ATF with more money, as  bureaucrats destroy our Nation and infringe on our freedoms, pouring an  additional $45 billion into Ukraine, with zero accountability, and  green-lighting another year of the left's Big Government, socialist  agenda, right before the end of Democrats' one-party rule in  Washington.   A vote for this omnibus bill is a vote for America last. I urge all  my colleagues to reject the swamp status quo and stand up for America  and vote ``no'' on this monstrosity.
