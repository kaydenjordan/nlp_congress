 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 6, and I thank our  ranking member for yielding time to me.   There isn't any question that our country is in the midst of a  destructive opioid epidemic that claims 142 lives every day. This is a  national crisis, and it is our duty as Members of Congress to do  everything in our power to stem the tide of addiction and the  devastation that this epidemic is causing. It is claiming more lives  than were lost in the Vietnam war. They are staggering figures.                                time  0930    H.R. 6 includes policies to expand the number and types of providers  who can administer medication such as buprenorphine and naloxone to  opioid-addicted patients, and it allows Medicare to pay for opioid  treatment programs. That is a very important addition in the  legislation. This will help people suffering from opioid use disorder  to get access to the critical treatment they need on the day this  legislation is signed into law.   H.R. 6 also creates a payment structure that incents rather than  discourages the use of nonopioid alternatives. I think this is a very  important provision in the legislation because it will help to decrease  the number of opioids prescribed and keep patients from becoming  addicted in the first place.   I want to point something out that I believe is deeply troubling, and  the ranking member did as well. The majority has repeatedly voted to  gut funding for the benefits offered by Medicaid, which is the single  largest payer of mental health services, providing health coverage to  27 percent of adults with a serious mental illness.   The majority has also consistently and repeatedly undermined the  Affordable Care Act, including refusing to defend the protections for  patients with preexisting conditions.    Mr. Chairman, this is very serious because this would  provide critical access to treatment for substance abuse disorders. So  the majority gives with one hand and takes away with the other.   These policies will harm millions of vulnerable Americans and limit  our responsibility to respond and recover from this epidemic.   This is an important first step. We need to do more to address the  causes of the epidemic, stem the tide of addiction, expand meaningful  access, and pay for it so that we can help the very people who need the  most help.
