 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of Kimchi Day.  Kimchi is a staple Korean banchan, or side dish, consisting of  fermented cabbage and other vegetables.   What was once limited to Korean families' tables is now a culinary  icon that reflects the growing Korean cultural influence in the United  States since the first Korean immigrants arrived more than a century  ago.   I am proud to be joined by many Korean Americans from all across the  country in the gallery today to celebrate kimchi and the larger  contributions that the Korean-American community have made here in the  United States.   Later this afternoon, Members and those listening are invited to come  to the Cannon Caucus Room at 2 p.m. as we celebrate Kimchi Day with our  Korean-American community.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my Korean-American colleagues--there are four of  us serving in Congress:   Andy Kim, Young Kim, Michelle Steel, and  Marilyn Strickland--who have been instrumental in working with me in a  bipartisan way to introduce this Korean Kimchi Day resolution to make  November 22 as Kimchi Day. I thank my colleagues and those who signed  on to that resolution.   Lastly, I thank everybody for loving kimchi. ``Kimchi mah-nee  saranghae joosaeyo,'' ``Please love kimchi a lot.''                            ____________________
