 Mr. Speaker, I understand how CRs work, but also the  set-asides go away. We have a standalone bill from the Senate right  now. We could put it on the Consent Calendar.   Just to give a little history, the Debbie Smith Act originally passed  in 2004, and in 2008, under Democrat control, the House passed the  reauthorization under a suspension of the rules by voice vote. The  Senate, which was under Republican control, passed the bill with an  amendment by unanimous consent. The House subsequently passed the  Senate amendment version, and it was signed into law by George W. Bush.                                time  1245    In 2014 under Republican control, the House passed the bill under  suspension by voice vote. The Democratic-controlled Senate passed it  under unanimous consent. It was signed by President Barack Obama.   So the question is: Why can't we take a standalone bill?   Why, all of a sudden, in this Congress did it need to be part of a  larger bill that turns into partisan gamesmanship and a fight between  the two Chambers and the two parties?   In 2017 there were approximately 136,000 rapes. Only four in ten  rapes even go reported. That is actually an improvement. Not so many  years ago it was only two in ten. Mr. Speaker, 90,671 of those rapes  are unsolved. Many of them are never charged. Out of every 1,000 sexual  assaults, 995 perpetrators will go unpunished.   Just earlier this week I sat in the Rules Committee, and we argued on  the repeal of forced arbitration. By the way, I agree with my  Democratic colleagues. Sexual assault should never be forced into  arbitration. But if we are going to make the argument of forced  arbitration and deal with that in a civil proceeding or an employment  proceeding or those types of issues, clearly, we can all agree that the  single best way to put violent sexual predators behind bars in jail and  in prison is with DNA testing.   Mr. Speaker, I said it yesterday, and I will say it again: You have  the best ability to convict criminals--the worst kind of criminals--and  you have the ability to do it without revictimizing the victim through  a criminal process, through a deposition, through a jury trial. Many of  the reasons these crimes go unreported or unconvicted, particularly  child victims of sexual abuse, are because of the trauma associated  with a criminal proceeding.   Do you know what happens in a criminal proceeding with DNA evidence?   You get guilty pleas, because you can't beat the evidence.   So conservative estimates say that the number of rape kits is around  170,000 which are untested. Every single one of those kits represents a  human being, and it is somebody's mother, sister, daughter, or  granddaughter. That person has gone through a horrible, terrible, and  grotesque trauma, and they deserve justice.   This is easy. This is easy to do. We could do it today. We could do  it tomorrow before we go home. But here's the deal: it expires in 14  days, and while we are gone for 2 weeks in recess, 5,000 more rapes  will be committed.
