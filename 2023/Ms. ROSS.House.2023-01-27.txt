 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to defend women's access to  medication abortion.   In the wake of the Dobbs decision, the Justice Department reaffirmed  that States cannot ban the abortion pill, which now accounts for the  majority of abortions nationwide.   Medication abortion is safe and effective. It is healthcare.   However, in North Carolina, women face unnecessary limitations that  not only allow treatment to be delayed by 72 hours but require  counseling before medication abortion.   This week, a brave physician in North Carolina, Amy Bryant, filed a  lawsuit challenging these dangerous restrictions.   Let's be clear. Any State that limits a physician's ability to  prescribe abortion medication is causing harm to women and creating  needless barriers to healthcare.   We cannot give up on the fight for full reproductive autonomy.                            ____________________
