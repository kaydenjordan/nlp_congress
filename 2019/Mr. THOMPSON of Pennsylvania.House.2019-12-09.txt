 Madam Speaker, this past weekend, we  remembered and reflected on the 78th anniversary of the devastating  naval base attack in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. This act of war against our  Nation prompted our entry into World War II.   The surprise attack by the Japanese on the morning of December 7,  1941, left 2,403 people dead. Among them were members of the U.S. Navy,  Army, Marines, as well as civilians.   It was one of the deadliest attacks in U.S. history. President  Franklin Delano Roosevelt described it as a ``date which will live in  infamy.''   Madam Speaker, let us honor the lives of those brave Americans who  perished on that day 78 years ago.   As President Roosevelt said: ``No matter how long it may take us to  overcome this premeditated invasion, the American people in their  righteous might will win through to absolute victory.''   And we did.   May God bless all of our Pearl Harbor victims and survivors.                            ____________________
