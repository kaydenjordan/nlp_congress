 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of our kids. It  is so important that we come together alongside the next generation of  Americans and give them the resources they need to succeed in a 21st  century economy.   There are so many issues facing our youth today. Between the mental  health crisis, rising costs of education, and childhood hunger, our  children are dealing with issues that can and must be addressed by  Federal lawmakers.   Mental illness is on the rise among the next generation of Americans.  We are witnessing an unprecedented increase in depression, anxiety,  substance abuse, and suicide.   We are in the middle of a crisis. Mental health concerns are American  parents' top concerns for their children, and the pandemic just  exacerbated already troubling trends.   Working families matter. Our kids matter. There is so much  opportunity to come together across partisan divides and address these  critical issues.   This week, I have been meeting with school board members and college  officials from my district. They are ready to partner with us to  improve the lives of our students.   I am here for the next generation of west Michiganders. We owe it to  our kids to address these critical issues through commonsense solutions  that work for them.                            ____________________
