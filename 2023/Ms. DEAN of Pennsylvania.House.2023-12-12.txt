 Madam Speaker, I thank Representative  Kaptur for all her extraordinary work for Ukraine many Congresses over  and especially now since the brutal invasion.   Madam Speaker, it has been more than 650 days since Putin's illegal  and brutal invasion of Ukraine, the largest armed conflict in Europe  since World War II. Today, President Zelenskyy visits the United  States, yet again, to call upon us to continue to lead.   The United States, President Biden, has led a coalition of more than  50 nations to provide Ukraine with the resources to protect its people,  its land, its democracy, its sovereignty. The United States is leading,  and we cannot abandon Ukraine now.   The war has taken more than 22,000 of Ukraine's men, women, and  children in the brutal, harshest ways as the Speaker Emerita just  detailed. We cannot abandon Ukraine now because Ukraine's fight is our  fight.   We must pass the supplemental funding package currently sitting in  the Senate. It is unconscionable of us to go home for the holidays  without doing that. Without it, we impede Ukraine's ability to win. At  the same time, I hope everyone understands that we weaken our own  military readiness and our own national security because not only does  this legislation include crucial funding for ammunition and  intelligence for Ukraine, but it invests in our own military--$43.6  billion to increase our weapons capacity, including $24.5 billion to  replenish U.S. weaponry supply.   We must not abandon Ukraine now because to do so would be a failure  to protect a young democracy; to do so would be a threat to our own  military readiness, to our own national security; and to do so would be  a failure of the United States to lead, and that is simply  unacceptable. It is un-American.
