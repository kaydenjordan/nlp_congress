Pursuant to House Resolution 22 and rule  XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House  on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 26.   The Chair appoints the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hultgren) to  preside over the Committee of the Whole.                                time  1433                        In the Committee of the Whole    Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the  Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill  (H.R. 26) to amend chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, to provide  that major rules of the executive branch shall have no force or effect  unless a joint resolution of approval is enacted into law, with Mr.  Hultgren in the chair.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Pursuant to House Resolution 22, the  resolution is considered read.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                 H. Res. 11         Whereas the United States has long supported a negotiated       settlement leading to a sustainable two-state solution with       the democratic, Jewish state of Israel and a demilitarized,       democratic Palestinian state living side-by-side in peace and       security;        Whereas since 1993, the United States has facilitated       direct, bilateral negotiations between both parties toward       achieving a two-state solution and ending all outstanding       claims;        Whereas it is the long-standing policy of the United States       that a peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian       conflict will only come through direct, bilateral       negotiations between the two parties;        Whereas it is the long-standing position of the United       States to oppose and, if necessary, veto United Nations       Security Council resolutions dictating additional binding       parameters on the peace process;        Whereas it is the long-standing position of the United       States to oppose and, if necessary, veto one-sided or anti-      Israel resolutions at the United Nations Security Council;        Whereas the United States has stood in the minority       internationally over successive Administrations in defending       Israel in international forums, including vetoing one-sided  [[Page H147]]       resolutions in 2011, 2006, 2004, 2003, 2002, 2001, 1997, and       1995 before the United Nations Security Council;        Whereas the United States recently signed a new Memorandum       of Understanding with the Government of Israel regarding       security assistance, consistent with longstanding support for       Israel among successive Administrations and congresses and       representing an important United States commitment toward       Israel's qualitative military edge;        Whereas on November 29, 2016, the House of Representatives       unanimously passed House Concurrent Resolution 165,       expressing the sense of Congress and reaffirming longstanding       United States policy in support of a direct bilaterally       negotiated settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and       opposition to United Nations Security Council resolutions       imposing a solution to the conflict;        Whereas on December 23, 2016, the United States Permanent       Representative to the United Nations disregarded House       Concurrent Resolution 165 and departed from longstanding       United States policy by abstaining and permitting United       Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 to be adopted under       Chapter VI of the United Nations Charter;        Whereas the United States' abstention on United Nations       Security Council Resolution 2334 contradicts the Oslo Accords       and its associated process that is predicated on resolving       the Israeli-Palestinian conflict between the parties through       direct negotiations;        Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334       claims that ``the establishment by Israel of settlements in       the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, including East       Jerusalem, has no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant       violation under international law and a major obstacle to the       achievement of the two-State solution and a just, lasting and       comprehensive peace'';        Whereas by referring to the ``4 June 1967 lines'' as the       basis for negotiations, United Nations Security Council       Resolution 2334 effectively states that the Jewish Quarter of       the Old City of Jerusalem and the Western Wall, Judaism's       holiest site, are ``occupied territory'' thereby equating       these sites with outposts in the West Bank that the Israeli       government has deemed illegal;        Whereas passage of United Nations Security Council       Resolution 2334 effectively lends legitimacy to efforts by       the Palestinian Authority to impose its own solution through       international organizations and through unjustified boycotts       or divestment campaigns against Israel by calling ``upon all       States, bearing in mind paragraph 1 of this resolution, to       distinguish, in their relevant dealings, between the       territory of the State of Israel and the territories occupied       since 1967'', and will require the United States and Israel       to take effective action to counteract the potential harmful       impact of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334;        Whereas UNSCR 2334 did not directly call upon Palestinian       leadership to fulfill their obligations toward negotiations       or mention that part of the eventual Palestinian state is       currently controlled by Hamas, a designated terrorist       organization; and        Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334       both sought to impose or unduly influence solutions to final       status issues, and is biased against Israel: Now, therefore,       be it        Resolved, That --        (1) it is the sense of the House of Representatives that--        (A) the passage of United Nations Security Council       Resolution 2334 undermined the long-standing position of the       United States to oppose and veto United Nations Security       Council resolutions that seek to impose solutions to final       status issues, or are one-sided and anti-Israel, reversing       decades of bipartisan agreement;        (B) the passage of United Nations Security Council       Resolution 2334 undermines the prospect of Israelis and       Palestinians resuming productive, direct negotiations;        (C) the passage of United Nations Security Council       Resolution 2334 contributes to the politically motivated acts       of boycott, divestment from, and sanctions against Israel and       represents a concerted effort to extract concessions from       Israel outside of direct negotiations between the Israelis       and Palestinians, which must be actively rejected;        (D) any future measures taken in international or outside       organizations, including the United Nations Security Council       or at the Paris conference on the Israeli-Palestinian       conflict scheduled for January 15, 2017, to impose an       agreement, or parameters for an agreement including the       recognition of a Palestinian state, will set back the cause       of peace, harm the security of Israel, run counter to the       enduring bipartisan consensus on strengthening the United       States-Israel relationship, and weaken support for such       organizations;        (E) a durable and sustainable peace agreement between       Israel and the Palestinians will come only through direct       bilateral negotiations between the parties resulting in a       Jewish, democratic state living side-by-side next to a       demilitarized Palestinian state in peace and security;        (F) the United States should work to facilitate serious,       direct negotiations between the parties without preconditions       toward a sustainable peace agreement; and        (G) the United States Government should oppose and veto       future United Nations Security Council resolutions that seek       to impose solutions to final status issues, or are one-sided       and anti-Israel; and        (2) the House of Representatives opposes United Nations       Security Council Resolution 2334 and will work to strengthen       the United States-Israel relationship, and calls for United       Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 to be repealed or       fundamentally altered so that--        (A) it is no longer one-sided and anti-Israel; and        (B) it allows all final status issues toward a two-state       solution to be resolved through direct bilateral negotiations       between the parties.     The gentleman from California (Mr. Royce)  and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each will control 30  minutes.
