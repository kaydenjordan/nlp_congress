 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Madam President, first, this morning, as everyone knows,  there was an attempted terrorist attack in New York City, near the Port  Authority bus terminal and very close to Times Square. I was about 15  blocks away when that happened. Thankfully, praise God, the attack was  a failure, and the only serious injuries were sustained by the would-be  perpetrator.   On mornings like this, I am even more thankful--and I am thankful all  the time--for the service of the New York City Police Department, the  Port Authority Police Department, the New York City Fire Department,  and the bomb squad, that responded so quickly to the scene. Today was a  startling reminder as to why the ``See Something, Say Something''  campaign is so crucial to keeping our city safe and why we must always,  always, always be vigilant against the threat of terrorism.   Madam President, on judicial nominations, this evening, the Senate  will vote on whether we should consider the nomination of Leonard  Steven Grasz to be a judge on the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. The  nomination is significant because Grasz is just the third nominee since  1989 to be unanimously deemed ``not qualified'' by the American Bar  Association. To underscore that fact, the ABA has reviewed over 1,700  judicial nominees since 1989. Before this administration, only two were  ever unanimously deemed ``not qualified.'' Those two nominated by  President Bush were not confirmed. The nominee we are voting on this  evening is the third.   A panel of nonpartisan legal experts unanimously concluded that this  man is not fit to be a judge. What else do my colleagues need to know?  They should all vote no this evening.   Instead of withdrawing the nomination and finding someone better,  which is what President Bush did in a similar  [[Page S7941]]  situation, some of my Republican colleagues have started attacking the  ABA.   The junior Senator from Texas said:         The ABA's record on judicial nominations has been highly       questionable. It has demonstrated over past decades       repeatedly partisan interests and ideological interests.    I don't remember my colleague from Texas complaining when his party  was touting then-Judge Gorsuch's favorable rating from the ABA. I heard  over and over again from my Republican colleagues that he received a  favorable rating from the ABA. All of a sudden, they attack it.   Leader McConnell once likened a ``well qualified'' rating from the  ABA to ``getting straight A+'s on your report card.'' That is what  Leader McConnell said. Now Members of his party are singing a much  different tune, as not one but two of President Trump's judicial  nominees have received unanimously ``not qualified'' ratings.   Unfortunately, this is indicative of what has become part of the  Republican playbook--a playbook that Donald Trump specializes in, and  unfortunately my colleagues are joining right in. If you don't like the  message, shoot the messenger. If you don't like what the CBO is saying  about healthcare, attack the CBO even if it is your handpicked  Director. If you don't like what the Joint Committee on Taxation is  saying about your tax bill, attack the JCT even if it is using the  exact type of economic model that you asked it to use. If you don't  like what the ABA is saying about judicial candidates, call it partisan  even if you praised its judgment only a few months ago.   This is the Republican Party of President Trump, who, instead of  mounting a credible defense of his record by using facts and arguments,  will resort to shooting the messenger, whether that is Special Counsel  Mueller, the CIA, the intelligence community, or the entire FBI.  Imagine attacking the entire FBI. I know those agents. They are so  dedicated to the country--they are nonpolitical--but when they  investigate President Trump because he might be doing something wrong,  he just attacks them recklessly.   The same thing has happened with our Republican colleagues. Like  President Trump, when Republican lawmakers don't agree with what  independent arbiters are saying, they try to discredit them. These  attacks may suit their short-term political interests, but it is going  to have a devastating effect on our country. A tax bill that explodes  the deficit and raises taxes on millions of middle-class Americans may  pass, but Republicans refuse to believe the analyses that say it does.  Our Federal judiciary may be filled with unqualified candidates-- lifetime appointments, mind you--because Republicans refuse to trust  the advice of independent legal experts.    More importantly, these attacks in important ways diminish our  democracy. We are a country founded on facts. People have different  views once they view those facts, but we are founded on facts. That is  what the Founding Fathers did at the Constitutional Convention--they  debated, but they started from the same fact base. That is what the  townhall meetings throughout America have done for two centuries and  more. They are beautiful. They debate, they discuss, but people accept  a row of given facts. That is what we are supposed to do here in the  House and Senate, and for many years we did. Now, led by President  Trump, facts don't seem to matter. Anything he doesn't like he calls  fake news, even though it is real. He contradicts himself. He says one  thing one day and one thing the next, and it doesn't even matter. That  is him, and he was elected, but why are our Republican colleagues so  willfully going along? Why are they not saying that truth matters? Why  do they attack the ABA, which has been nonpartisan and has had a grand  tradition for decades? When the ABA approved Judge Gorsuch, they  embraced it.   This is not a good thing for democracy. American democracy depends on  our ability to work together on a common baseline of facts to find  solutions that work in the real world. We can't do that if Republicans  are going to discredit or ignore the judgments of agencies like the  CBO, JCT, and ABA. We will end up with an even less productive debate  here in Congress--something that no one will like and the American  people can ill afford.
