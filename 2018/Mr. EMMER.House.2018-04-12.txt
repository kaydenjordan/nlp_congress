 Mr. Speaker, many years ago, an outstanding coach from my  home State of Minnesota once said, ``I learned early on that you do not  put greatness into people but somehow try to pull it out.'' That coach  was Herb Brooks, who led Team USA to victory at the 1980 Olympics.  Minnesota is home to many outstanding coaches who carry on the legacy  of Coach Brooks every day.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize two of my district's  incredible coaches for receiving awards from the Minnesota Hockey  Coaches Association. St. Michael-Albertville High School's Jerremiah  Johnson achieved the AA John Mariucci coach of the year award, and  Andover High School's Brett Barta received the assistant head coach of  the year award.   In Minnesota, we treat the sport of hockey as a lifestyle, and our  youth coaches spend a lot of time with our young people. I am proud  that coaches like Coach Johnson and Coach Barta are carrying on the  legacy of Minnesota legends like John Mariucci and Herb Brooks and  pulling the greatness out of our young athletes every day.   Thank you, Jerremiah and Brett, for passing on lessons in  perseverance, integrity, and the great game of hockey to the next  generation.      Celebrating the St. Michael-Albertville High School Wrestling Team     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the St. Michael- Albertville High School wrestling team for winning their first-ever  undisputed Class 3A State title. The young men on this team came close  to winning in 2013. Due to a tie, however, they had to share the title  with another team. But not this year. This year, the St. Michael- Albertville High School wrestling team finished what they started.   Congratulations to the wrestlers of St. Michael-Albertville High  School for your first State championship. We expect many more.   Recognizing Tammy Oveson for Being Named National Childcare Provider of                                 the Month     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Tammy Oveson of  Waite Park, Minnesota. Tammy is an outstanding childcare provider in  Minnesota's Sixth Congressional District. She operates Learn `n Play  Preschool and was recently named National Childcare Provider of the  Month for her dedication to early childhood development and learning  techniques.   Mr. Speaker, right now in Minnesota, at this moment, Tammy and her  assistant, Karla, are working with young children who will one day grow  up to be great citizens and, hopefully, leaders of this great Nation.  Tammy and Karla's work keeps Minnesota and our Nation moving forward. I  am grateful for them and all of our childcare providers, teachers,  counselors, and educators who are fostering future generations of  Americans across the country.   I am honored to recognize Tammy today and thank and congratulate her  on the incredible work she does for young Minnesotans.       Honoring the Life and Legacy of Vietnam Veteran Leo K. Thorsness     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate Vietnam veterans,  to remember the heroes who served our great Nation during the most  expansive war in American history. To those who have passed and those  still living, we offer our humble and eternal thank you. While you may  not have always received a warm welcome or the gratitude you deserve,  we honor your sacrifice to this Nation, now and forever.   The great State of Minnesota is home to many of these incredible  heroes, and today I am proud to honor the life and legacy of Leo K.  Thorsness, who was recently interred at Arlington National Cemetery.  Leo was Minnesota's last living recipient of the Medal of Honor. He  deserved that great honor and distinction for the incredible courage he  displayed in the Vietnam war.   During his time in Vietnam, Leo was captured and imprisoned for 6  years, spending one full year in solitary confinement. In honor of  brave men like Leo, I rise today to say thank you. Thank you for your  service, your sacrifice, and your willingness to put your life on the  line and fight to preserve America's values.             Recognizing Anoka County Special Deputy Vern Waldner     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Vern Waldner of  Anoka County, Minnesota. After serving for 26 years as special deputy  with the Anoka County Sheriff's Office reserve program, Vern is  retiring.   Local communities are made better by people like Vern who are willing  to give their time and service to help others. Simply put, he made  Anoka a safer place to live.   For nearly three decades, Vern ensured the safety of families during  each annual Anoka Halloween Parade, an event so large and so widely  attended, it has earned Anoka the title ``Halloween Capital of the  World.'' Vern was at that parade every year, dedicated to protecting  his neighbors and friends.   As a community, we are grateful for Vern and congratulate him on  being the second longest serving reserve deputy in Anoka County  history. Thank you, Vern. We wish you a long and happy retirement.                            ____________________
