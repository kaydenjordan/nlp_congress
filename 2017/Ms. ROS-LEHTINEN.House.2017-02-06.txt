 Mr. Speaker, this Saturday night is Israel Bonds'  ``Una Noche en la Playa''--``A Night on the Beach''--in Miami Beach.   Over the years, I have had the honor of participating in many of  Israel Bonds' programs. The work that Israel Bonds does is vital in  expanding and growing Israel's economy and has helped Israel become a  global leader and innovator in so many sectors.   With all of the threats now facing the Jewish state, the work of  Israel Bonds is more important now than ever. The  [[Page H995]]  guest speaker will be none other than the Israeli Ambassador to the  United States, my good friend and Miami Beach native, Ron Dermer.   The Israel Bonds event will also serve as a commemorative tribute to  Isaac and Nieves Olemberg. Isaac and Nieves were dear friends who did  so much for the south Florida community, for the American Jewish  community, for the Cuban American community, and for Israel, herself.  Their memories will forever live on through their kindness and  compassion.                            ____________________
