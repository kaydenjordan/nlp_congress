 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the delegate from the  Virgin Islands for cohosting this Special Order in honor of Elijah  Cummings.   We all ask that question to the Lord: ``What is required of thee?''   And the answer is simple: Act justly, love mercy, walk humbly with  thy God.   That is exactly what Chairman Elijah Cummings did. He fought for  justice every day, not just in the halls of Congress, not just in  courtrooms, sometimes it was on the streets of Baltimore. When the  community was protesting, he was out there fighting for justice.   He loved mercy. He fought for criminal justice reform every ounce and  minute of his life, because he knew that we have to give people a  second chance and that, but for the grace of God, who knows where  anybody would be.   And then last, it was to walk humbly. Many people don't know this,  but Elijah Cummings was one of the first Members of Congress to endorse  me, because he was about lifting up the next generation. He knew that  you don't have to blow out somebody else's candle for yours to shine  brighter. And what he did all the time was light candles in the next  generation so that they would assume the mantle of leadership and so  that they would find their purpose in life.   So I would just end with this: Elijah Cummings was a man of purpose.  It wasn't about politics. It wasn't about partisanship. It certainly  wasn't about profits. It was about purpose. And the one thing that  comforts me, and I am sure the entire Black Caucus, is that we know in  our hearts that last Thursday, at 2:30 a.m., we know that Elijah  Cummings heard these words: Well done, my good and faithful servant.
