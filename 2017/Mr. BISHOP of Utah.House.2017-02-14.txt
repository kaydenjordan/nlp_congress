 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 99, I  call up the bill (H.R. 428) to survey the gradient boundary along the  Red River in the States of Oklahoma and Texas, and for other purposes,  and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 428         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Red River Gradient Boundary       Survey Act''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Affected area.--        (A) In general.--The term ``affected area'' means land       along the approximately 116-mile stretch of the Red River,       from its confluence with the north fork of the Red River on       the West to the 98th meridian on the east.        (B) Exclusions.--The term ``affected area'' does not       include the portion of the Red River within the boundary       depicted on the survey prepared by the Bureau of Land       Management entitled ``Township 5 South, Range 14 West, of the       Indian Meridian, Oklahoma, Dependent Resurvey and Survey''       and dated February 28, 2006.        (2) Gradient boundary survey method.--The term ``gradient       boundary survey method'' means the measurement technique used       to locate the South Bank boundary line in accordance with the       methodology established in Oklahoma v. Texas, 261 U.S. 340       (1923) (recognizing that the boundary line along the Red       River is subject to change due to erosion and accretion).        (3) Landowner.--The term ``landowner'' means any       individual, group, association, corporation, federally       recognized Indian tribe or member of such an Indian tribe, or       other private or governmental legal entity that owns an       interest in land in the affected area.        (4) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary       of the Interior, acting through the Director of the Bureau of       Land Management.        (5) South bank.--The term ``South Bank'' means the water-      washed and relatively permanent elevation or acclivity       (commonly known as a ``cut bank'') along the southerly or       right side of the Red River that--        (A) separates the bed of that river from the adjacent       upland, whether valley or hill; and        (B) usually serves, as specified in the fifth paragraph of       Oklahoma v. Texas, 261 U.S. 340 (1923)--        (i) to confine the waters within the bed; and        (ii) to preserve the course of the river.        (6) South bank boundary line.--The term ``South Bank       boundary line'' means the boundary, with respect to title and       ownership, between the States of Oklahoma and Texas       identified through the gradient boundary survey method that       does not impact or alter the permanent political boundary       line between the States along the Red River, as outlined       under article II, section B of the Red River Boundary Compact       enacted by the States and consented to by Congress pursuant       to Public Law 106-288 (114 Stat. 919).       SEC. 3. SURVEY OF SOUTH BANK BOUNDARY LINE.

SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.         There is authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary to       carry out this Act $1,000,000.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 99, the  gentleman from Utah (Mr. Bishop) and the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms.  Hanabusa) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah.                                General Leave     I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and insert  extraneous material on H.R. 428.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Utah?   There was no objection.    I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and insert  extraneous material on H.R. 428.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Utah?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Thornberry), the sponsor of this piece of legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. McClintock), chairman of the Committee on Natural  Resources' Subcommittee on Federal Lands that deals with this area.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Thornberry for  working through three congressional sessions to do justice to the  property owners along the Red River.   The injustice that this bill corrects is galling. In 1923, the U.S.  Supreme Court established rules for determining the boundary between  Texas and Oklahoma, which established property rights over this land.   For nearly a century, the Federal Government recognized and respected  the property lines established by this ruling. Property owners  purchased and sold this land and, in some cases, passed it down from  generation to generation. These property owners, in good faith,  dutifully paid taxes on their lands year after year, invested in these  lands, maintained them, cultivated them, and improved them.   Nearly 100 years later, in 2013, the Bureau of Land Management  announced that it was arbitrarily changing these long-established and  settled boundaries and claiming ownership of 90,000 acres of land. This  outrageous claim clouds property rights along this vast territory.   It is based on the flimsiest of pretexts: a 2009 survey of some 6,000  acres out of the total 90,000 in dispute. This survey ignored the 1923  Supreme Court decree that originally established the boundary lines,  and it then extrapolated the results of this limited survey to justify  this land grab over the entire region. In other words, BLM laid claim  to these lands with a guess based upon a fraud.   The BLM has since scaled back its claim to 30,000 acres, a testament  to the flimsy process with which it has upended the lives of every  property owner in the region.   The Red River Private Property Protection Act tells the BLM to back  off. It authorizes a comprehensive survey of all of the disputed  acreage to be conducted jointly by the two States directly affected and  in consultation with the tribal governments involved. It requires that  the survey be conducted on the longstanding criteria established by the  Supreme Court, rather than the recent and illegal invention of the BLM.   Upon the completion of the survey, the States of Texas and Oklahoma,  in coordination with federally recognized Indian tribes, will review  and approve the survey to ensure its accuracy and impartiality.   Without this act, title to the farms and homes will be clouded for  decades while the matter drags on through the courts. That is the  course that the gentlewoman suggests we should follow: drag this on for  years, if not decades, while these property owners languish in  uncertainty.   Meanwhile, the BLM's assertion of regulatory jurisdiction would have  devastating impacts on local homeowners and businesses and make it much  more difficult to encourage economic development in the region.   This measure is a scaled-down version of the bill passed by this  House in 2015, in order to address concerns expressed by the American  Indian Nations involved.   Mr. Speaker, government exists to protect our natural rights,  including our property rights, and this bill realigns our government  with its stated purpose and its stated promise.   I urge its speedy adoption.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. LaMalfa), chairman of the Committee on Natural  Resources' Subcommittee on Indian, Insular and Alaska Native Affairs.   Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, you know when we swear to uphold an oath to  our country and to our States, a lot goes with that responsibility. We  have a very sacred covenant in protecting private property rights, the  cornerstone of the founding of this Nation.   So to see that after many decades or even centuries of people feeling  secure in their property, in their land, how can one government agency  come along and defy two entire States in a process they have used, the  gradient boundary survey method, in this case, along the Red River  between Texas and Oklahoma? How can you have one rogue Federal agency  coming in and saying we supersede what these two States and decades and  decades of tradition and security that these families have had along  here is completely wrong?   That is why H.R. 428 would send the right signal and give certainty  back to these families. We are talking about a court process. Well, for  private parties to have to go to a court, it is not the same as the  government with its endless resources, endless time to slog through  court in this case after 8 years. This is a lot of wear and tear on  families when their property and their longtime traditions are in  question here.   I go back to a case some years ago, the Kilo v. New London decision,  where it was deemed that government can just take property if it was  deemed beneficial to the government or to the tax base, indeed,  trampling on property rights. At least, in that case, you can count on  that there might be some compensation for having that land taken.   Will that even happen here? They are over a mile off in some of their  surveys where the BLM believes the land line is. So the true border  needs to be made certain and needs to be respectful of Texas and  Oklahoma in their process in this property right discussion.   Indeed, an 8-year-long nightmare, imagine what this does to families.  It happens in my district as well when regulators come in and decide  they are going to change the water rights. It is not even good for  their health. People, when they are going through this legal process,  it is painful for them.   So H.R. 428 is a very important method of doing, through the gradient  boundary survey, a fair way--one that is recognized by Texas and  Oklahoma for many decades as the correct way--to survey and finally put  this issue to rest after many, many more years than what it should have  been.   Indeed, private property rights are the cornerstone of part of why  this country was even founded. Why do we continue to do this to the  families who have, in good faith, paid taxes, made their land payments,  and been part of the fiber of Texas and Oklahoma around the Red River  for so many, many years?                                time  1530    Instead of confusion, let's give them certainty. I urge us to all  support H.R. 428 and go to a survey method that is fair and recognized  by two States, not by one Federal agency that wishes to override that  process.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert), who understands this, who is  coming from that State, and who also serves as the vice chairman of the  entire Resources Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert), who understands this, who is  coming from that State, and who also serves as the vice chairman of the  entire Resources Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Now, in summary of what we have heard today, this situation is a  result  [[Page H1159]]  of a silly and suspect survey that has slapped the citizens with  uncertainty and soured them for the security because seizing citizen  sites has taken place.   The question was asked: Where is BLM? That is a good question. Where  is BLM? They started this problem 8 years ago and have yet to do  anything to try and solve the problem. That is why this bill is here  before us because BLM has not done their job. Using a poor survey  process, they have simply put people who have done nothing wrong in  doubt of their ownership of their property which they have had for  generations and have been paying taxes on for years. Yet, in 8 long  years, BLM has done nothing to solve the situation to give them the  certainty so they know where they stand.   That is why the private citizens went to court. The only reason it is  in court is because these private citizens were so frustrated with BLM  taking so long to do something that could have been done within a  matter of weeks, and yet it is now 8 years into a process simply  because BLM used a flawed survey. Instead of using the gradient  boundary survey method that the Supreme Court suggests, they did  something else which brought them to the unusual conclusion that BLM  actually owned 90,000 acres of land on this riverbank that they have  never had in their history.   Later, they realized that was an unusual claim, so they lowered it  down to: I own 30,000 acres of land--but 30,000 acres of land that has  been in private property for years, for generations, they have been  paying taxes on it, and now their land is in limbo. They can't do  anything simply because BLM has refused to do its job.   It is not just here in Texas. Go across the State boundary to  Louisiana where Lake Bistineau has the exact same problem with the  exact same survey problems from the same agency, BLM. Go all the way to  Colorado with Elkhorn Ranch. Once again, survey problems done by BLM  which placed claims on private property that are exorbitant and yet  moves at a snail's pace to try and solve the problem.   One of the first issues I dealt with when I came to Congress was Hyde  Park, and, once again, the Federal Government--this time it was the  Forest Service--taking claim on lands that had been, for generations,  in private property and refusing to try and work with the property  owners to solve the problem. That is what has been going on for 8 long  years with the boundary line between Texas and Oklahoma.   Why are we coming here with a bill? Simply because you have got to  solve the problem. You have got to fix the problem for people.   I have to also say something. The misrepresentation of the BLM  planning rule that was presented is a total misrepresentation. In fact,  when we removed that rule, the 2.0 planning rule, we did it because  people want to have their voices heard and are eliminated if that  planning rule goes into effect. That is why it has to stop, so this  type of situation does not happen again.   Some people have said this may be an unprecedented concept. Actually,  our realization that somebody has to handle the situation by actually  allowing Oklahoma and Texas to pick qualified surveyors, do the  survey--and do the survey--and then coordinate with the tribes so they  come up with a process, that is exactly what should have happened in  2009. Because BLM didn't do it, we are going to bring a bill to make  sure they actually get something done.   This has been supported by the Texas and Oklahoma Farm Bureaus, the  Texas General Land Office, Texas Southwest Cattle Raisers Association,  and the people who live in this area who want to have some kind of  conclusion so they can have their property rights respected.   Now, it has been said what we are doing is unprecedented--perhaps.  What we are doing is trying to solve the problem to help people; and if  it takes an unprecedented action by Congress to solve people's problem  and let them move on with their lives, then that is the responsibility  of Congress. We are the ones who establish what the policies should be,  not some executive branch agency of government. It is our  responsibility.   We are doing exactly what the people expect us to do by saying 8  years of unexpected and unanswered questions is far too long. Solve the  problem and help people so they know what is their private property and  what is not their private property and they can move on with their  lives. If that is unprecedented, then it is about time we did something  that is unprecedented. That is important.   That is why this bill is here, and that is why this bill is here now.  It is coming at the beginning of the session because we cannot wait  longer for the BLM to actually do what they should have done in 2009.   Now, Mr. Speaker, I want you to realize we are here on Valentine's  Day. There is nothing special about that, but this is an issue where  there has been no love lost. In fact, the landowners along this river  have been simply soaked. But deep in the heart of Texas--all right, I  know it is a boundary line, but I have got to get the heart in there  some way. Deep in the heart of Texas, we are coming forth with a bill  that is showing that the love for people who have paid their taxes and  lived on this land for generations is not forgotten and that BLM has  committed a crime of the heart with this land grab.   Indeed, Chairman Thornberry has passionately defended the interests  of his constituents who just want to know the government loves them.  That is why this bill is here. That is why it needs to be supported,  and that is why I urge you to vote ``yes.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.   Pursuant to House Resolution 99, the previous question is ordered on  the bill.   The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.   The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was  read the third time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the bill.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.
