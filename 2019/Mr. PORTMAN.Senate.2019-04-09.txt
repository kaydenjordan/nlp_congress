 Madam President, I am on the Senate floor to talk about  the importance of trade and specifically our country's economic  relationship with China.   As a trade lawyer, as a former U.S. Trade Representative, as a member  of the Finance Committee now that handles trade issues, I have been  involved in these issues over the years.   Most importantly, I am from Ohio, which is a huge trade State. We are  concerned about trade because we have a lot of manufacturing and a lot  of agriculture, where jobs depend on trade back and forth. In fact, in  Ohio, about 25 percent of our manufacturing workers make products that  get exported, and one out of every three acres planted by Ohio farmers  is now being exported.   These are good jobs. These are jobs that pay, on average, about 16  percent more than other jobs and have better benefits. We want more of  them.   With only 5 percent of the world's population and about 25 percent of  the world's economy, America wants access to the 95 percent of the  consumers living outside of our borders. It is always in our interest  to open up overseas markets for our workers, our farmers, and our  service providers.   While promoting exports, we also have to be sure we protect American  jobs from unfair trade, from imports that would unfairly undercut our  farmers and our workers, our service providers. Simply put, we want a  level playing field, where there is fair and reciprocal treatment. If  it is fair, if we have a level playing field, I believe American  workers and businesses can compete and win.   The sweet spot for America is this balanced approach: opening up new  markets for U.S. products, while being tougher on trade enforcement so  American workers have the opportunity to compete.   In that context, I want to talk a little about the inequities in our  relationship with China. We don't have a level playing field with  China, and it is one of the most important policy issues that faces our  country today.   It is certainly really important to Ohio. Ohio sells a lot of  products--auto parts, aerospace parts, and other things--to China. We  also sell a lot of oilseeds and grains, particularly soybeans--about  $700 million worth every year. China is actually our third biggest  trading partner in Ohio after Canada and Mexico.   Yet, despite these exports, we have a trade deficit with China  because they send a lot more to us than we send to them, and it is not  always fair trade.   As an example, Ohio has been ground zero for steel imports coming in  because of government-directed overcapacity in China. Our steel mills  have been hit hard because, to put it bluntly, China has not been  playing by the rules.   In 2000, China produced about 15 percent of the world's steel. Today,  thanks to massive subsidies and other forms of state intervention, they  now produce about 50 percent. So, again, about 19 years ago, they  produced 15 percent of the world's steel; now they produce 50 percent  of the world's steel, and they do it, again, through the government  subsidizing them.   They often sell that steel at below its cost. They don't need it in  China so they are trying to push it out to other countries. They  transship it to try to avoid our anti-dumping duties or our  countervailing duties, which were put in place because China wasn't  playing by the rules. So we find out they are selling below their cost,  which is dumping, or we find out they are subsidizing, we win a trade  case, but then China sends that product to a third country that then  sends it to us, therefore, evading the tariffs we put in place to deal  with the unfairness.   It hits our plants hard in Ohio, but it also reduces the cost of  steel around the world.   When it comes to our bilateral economic relationship, there is little  or no transparency from China when it comes to their regulations, their  approvals for inbound foreign direct investment into China, and the  required notification of subsidies that is required by the World Trade  Organization.   This lack of transparency, of course, frustrates American businesses,  and it violates China's international obligations.   China also exhibits a lack of reciprocity. Its market is  substantially more closed to American companies than our market is to  their companies. We have Chinese companies in Ohio. They don't have to  be in a joint venture with a 51-percent Ohio partner, American partner;  they can own the whole thing. They don't have to go through this  process of approvals that American companies have to go through, where  often their intellectual property is taken.  [[Page S2318]]    China, as we all know, has relatively higher tariffs than the United  States--on average, about a 10-percent tariff in China versus our 3.4  percent tariff, but that is not the biggest problem.   The biggest problem is a host of what are called nontariff barriers.  Some keep out our ``Made in America'' products and others coerce the  production of those products to be in China. So if you want to sell in  China, you have to produce in China, and that is in order to transfer  this valuable intellectual property from U.S. companies to Chinese  companies.   Investment is not reciprocal either. According to the U.S. Trade  Representative in its section 301 report on China, in 2016, the OECD-- Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development--ranked China the  fourth most restrictive investment climate in the world, despite their  being the second largest economy in the world.   So of all the countries in the world, OECD ranked them the fourth  most restrictive in terms of accepting foreign investment.   Based on this report, China's investment climate, then, is nearly  four times more restrictive than that of the United States.   So the confluence of these two factors--the lack of transparency and  reciprocity--stem from China's Communist Party-led nonmarket economy.  While China made an effort after joining the World Trade Organization  to become more market oriented, in recent years, they have actually  moved away from more market-based reforms and instead doubled down on  the kind of mercantilism you would expect in the last century but  revamped for the 21st century.   In doing so, China has placed enormous strain on the world's trading  system and, in turn, has undermined American jobs, American workers,  and America's overall competitiveness.   When I served as U.S. Trade Representative, I said that the United  States-China trade relationship lacked equity, durability, and balance.  Sadly, that is still the case today. We didn't have a level playing  field then.   Since that time, the conduct has even worsened. China has invested  large sums of money in industrial capacity, subsidizing production that  impacted industries in places like the United States but also Japan,  the European Union, and many developing countries.   China has embarked on a so-called indigenous innovation campaign  backed by hundreds of billions of dollars and the full weight of its  nontransparent regulatory apparatus. This intent of the indigenous  innovation campaign seems to be directed primarily at us but also other  countries around the world that are innovating.   The United States has been the leader in many innovative  technologies, and now China is attempting to be the leader. Think of  artificial intelligence or 5G.   China's embrace of techno-nationalism has undercut critical  commitments it has made to open up its markets, protect intellectual  property rights, adhere to internationally recognized labor rights, and  meet its WTO commitments on unfair trade practices, such as illegal  subsidies.   Without changes to these practices, as long as the inequities and  imbalances persist, the durability of our economic relationship remains  in question.   I understand China is not going to become a free market economy  anytime soon, and while I hope we can have a more market-oriented  economy someday and we can move toward that in China, as they were  moving that way after joining the WTO, I think it is vital that we at  least demand a level playing field in the meantime.   That is why I have supported the Trump administration's efforts to  demand structural changes as part of its ongoing negotiations with  Beijing. This takes the form of a few different things. One is  addressing our huge trade deficit--that is part of the negotiations--so  China would buy more soybeans and might buy more LNG, liquefied natural  gas. That is all good, but this agreement must also deal with these  other issues, like forced technology transfers and dealing with  nonmarket practices, like state-owned enterprises and other subsidies.    Addressing the first issue by selling additional soybeans and  liquefied natural gas to China is a positive step forward, but a short- term reduction of our trade deficit, which is out of balance, isn't  enough. We have to seek progress on these sustainable structural  changes so we can count on a fair trading relationship between two now  mature trading partners.   Ambassador Lighthizer, who is the current U.S. Trade Representative,  is a tough negotiator. I feel confident that he understands this, and  he is going to ensure that we not only improve the imbalance in our  trade deficit but also--if we get these structural changes we need-- bring home a strong and sustainable agreement.   That leads me to my next point. Any agreement must not just address  these important structural problems, but it also has to be enforceable.  Without enforceability, it is going to be impossible to make any real,  meaningful progress in our economic relationship based on the past. We  also have to do more than merely enforce by negotiation. I support  consultations and consistent engagement; that is also good. But there  also has to be some enforcement mechanisms with some consequences.   While I look forward to seeing the agreement that we come up with  China--and I hope it happens soon--I would like to offer a few  suggestions related to enforceability.   First, I favor reviving a China-specific safeguard to provide both  due process and an effective response to surges with Chinese imports  that injure U.S. domestic industry, such as the high-tech products or  those derived from nonmarket practices we talked about earlier.   One model to consider is section 421 of the Trade Act of 1974. Now  expired, section 421 was a China-specific safeguard that was created,  pursuant to China's WTO Accession Protocol, to guard against increased  imports from China--surges--with less demanding requirements than that  afforded market economies. I think it would be good to get back to  that.   Second, strong trade laws have been successful in addressing some of  the externalities caused by China's nonmarket practices. We have to  continue to enforce those laws. Consider the 266-percent tariff that is  currently in place with regard to imports of cold-rolled steel from  China. That was because we brought a trade case, and we won the trade  case using internationally accepted criteria as to what constitutes  dumping and subsidies. Nonmarket economy methodologies give our trade  remedy tools extra heft when deployed against these unfair imports from  countries like China, which lack the market-driven system found  everywhere else in the world.   China knows the effectiveness of our trade laws, especially the  nonmarket economy methodologies we use to get that 266-percent tariff  in place, and has therefore challenged the use of these methodologies.  China has challenged this at the World Trade Organization. I hope that  as part of any commitments made pursuant to the current talks, China  will drop its challenge to the use of nonmarket methodologies until  such time as China has actually become a market economy under  established and accepted statutory criteria set out in U.S. law.   Third, increased transparency requirements can help make enforcement  more effective. As long as key elements of the ways that China  intervenes in the economy--such as the provision of illegal subsidies;  currency manipulation, for that matter; the participation in the market  in state-owned enterprises; and the application of laws--remain without  transparency, it is going to be difficult to effectively monitor  compliance with commitments that are made. We have to know. We have the  right to know. I thus urge the administration to secure enforceable  transparency commitments to ensure we have enough visibility on China's  nonmarket practices to make enforcement as effective as possible.   I hope the administration takes some of these enforcement suggestions  into account.   Today, pursuant to our section 301 investigation, the United States  has levied tariffs of 25 percent on $50 billion and 10 percent on $200  billion of exports from China to the United States. These tariffs are  in place now, and they are affecting a lot of our companies here in the  United States because China has,  [[Page S2319]]  in turn, retaliated against us, putting tariffs ranging from 5 to 25  percent on $100 billion of U.S. exports to China. So there has been an  escalation of tariffs as we have been in these negotiations.   There has been discussion about the United States keeping our 25  percent and 10 percent tariffs in place as a backstop even after an  agreement is reached. I think that is unlikely because I think it is a  recipe for no agreement or an inadequate agreement.   Instead, I believe it is important for both countries to reduce or  eliminate altogether the new tariffs under 301 and the retaliatory  tariffs when the agreement is reached. Of course, the United States  would be able to quickly reimpose tariffs if China doesn't live up to  the commitments it makes, and that would be appropriate. But I think we  ought to make a commitment now to China that we are willing to get rid  of these tariffs, or substantially all of them, if a good agreement is  reached.   Over the next few weeks, I hope the President remains focused on  reaching this agreement that addresses the structural inequities in our  trade relationship. Buying more soybeans is important, but this is a  chance to resolve deeper issues, especially when there is such  compelling evidence of commitments not met in the past and continued  inequities in the U.S.-China trade relationship.    As part of reaching an enforceable structural agreement, I urge the  administration to give China certainty about what we actually want and  exactly what we want. From what I have heard, I believe giving Beijing  the security of an unwavering negotiating position will help unlock  China's last best offer. My sense is that is not yet on the table  because perhaps they think we have shifted in terms of our objectives  and priorities. The agreement would then allow the United States to  take a step forward toward a more balanced, equitable, and durable  U.S.-China relationship.   Again, I commend the administration and President Trump and  Ambassador Lighthizer for engaging in these negotiations. I think we  are headed in the right direction, but let's bring it to a close.   I want to note that the current negotiations are only part of what  must be a holistic and long-term strategy toward China. A good  agreement and strong enforcement is essential, but to keep the United  States competitive over the long term, we have to invest more here at  home.   As an example, if you are going to be in a sports competition, it  helps to go to the gym once in a while. Until recently, we hadn't been  hitting the gym too much.   Tax reform and lifting burdensome regulations recently have given our  economy a shot in the arm. It is really important because it has  created jobs and increased wages, but it has also made our country more  competitive, particularly by investing in technology and investing in  new equipment.   Unfortunately, we still have some challenges we need to address to be  truly competitive. We have a workforce that too often lacks the skills  necessary for the 21st century. We have an opioid epidemic that is  undermining our economy as well as our communities. We have a crumbling  infrastructure that is holding back economic growth.   Instead of people being awed at how quickly China can build a bridge,  I want people to be awed at how effectively and how fast we can build a  bridge here in this country. To do that, we need to build on the  permitting reforms we have enacted in the last few years to make it  easier to start and quicker to finish projects that keep our economy  moving and growing. Reinvesting in America with world-class career and  technical education, infrastructure investment, pro-growth and pro- innovation economic policies, as we started with tax reform and  regulatory relief--these are the things that would send signals to  China and to the rest of the world that we are a vibrant nation, we are  in the game, we are focused on the future, we are constantly  innovating, and we are not a nation in decline.   I believe the best days of our country can be before us. We need to  show the world that America remains, in fact, the world's preeminent  power because of our free markets, because of our innovations, and  because of our work ethic. If we do that, we will be able to compete  with China. If we don't, even without these trade negotiations, it will  be difficult.   By the way, unlike some, I don't propose to compete with China by  adopting policies and processes that mimic their system. As an example,  nationalizing our 5G deployment or adopting 5-year industrial plans, as  China does, is not the path to success. It gives in to the critiques  that we make of Beijing. Instead, we need to double down on the  American way: big ideas and bold visions grounded in principles unique  to our origins. After all, we believe in freedom and free markets  because they work.   With regard to China, we should want to have a successful and  mutually beneficial relationship on trade and other issues. China and  the United States must be strategic competitors going forward, not  enemies.   I commend the Trump administration for entering into these difficult  and very important negotiations with China, and I encourage the  administration to stay strong in the pursuit of long-term, meaningful  structural changes in that relationship. I want our country to do the  hard work here at home, to ensure that American competitiveness is  second to none. That combination--a successful resolution of  longstanding issues with China and staying on the cutting edge here at  home--will ensure the continued prosperity and global leadership of the  United States of America.   Thank you.   I yield back my time.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, the postcloture time on the Stanton  nomination expire at 11:45 a.m. on Wednesday, April 10; further, that  if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action.
