 Madam Speaker, yesterday the Fifth Circuit Court of  Appeals heard oral arguments in the lawsuit where Republicans sued to  not only strike down protections for people with preexisting  conditions, but eliminate every last protection and benefit provided by  the Affordable Care Act.   House Democrats have used our vote to send a strong message against  this lawsuit, and yesterday, the House general counsel argued in  support of people with preexisting conditions and the healthcare of all  Americans.   While our Republican colleagues attempt to undermine people with  preexisting conditions, House Democrats will do everything in our power  to protect the healthcare of the American people.   If the administration's position is supported by the Fifth Circuit,  it will destroy the protection for more than 130 million people with  preexisting conditions, Medicaid expansion coverage for 15 million  Americans, significant savings that our elders receive and seniors  receive due to ACA's closing of the doughnut hole in Medicare drug  coverage, bans on discriminatory insurance practices that force women  to pay more for coverage, and young adults' ability to remain on their  parents' insurance until age 26.   Madam Speaker, Democrats will continue to deliver on our For the  People agenda and American healthcare.                            ____________________
