 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Lieutenant General  Robert Scott Williams as he retires after 32 years of service to the  United States Air Force.   On June 20, General Williams completed his tour as dual commander of  Air Forces Northern and First Air Force headquarters at Tyndall Air  Force Base, capping a long and distinguished career.   His service to the Air Force included a tour as commander of the  169th Operations Group and Fighter Wing at McEntire Joint National  Guard Base in South Carolina.   General Williams' leadership during and after Hurricane Michael was  top tier. He and his team at Tyndall Air Force Base overcame numerous  obstacles and exceeded expectations by opening First Air Force  headquarters way ahead of schedule. This is only 2 short months after  the category 5 storm Michael devastated the panhandle.   Madam Speaker, I applaud the work he has accomplished over his last 3  years of command and his 32-year career. Please join me in saluting  Lieutenant General Robert Scott Williams for his great service to the  Air Force.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the  Speaker's table H.R. 3401, with the Senate amendment thereto, and  concur in the Senate amendment. This bipartisan bill passed the Senate  with 84 votes and could be sent to the President's desk today.
