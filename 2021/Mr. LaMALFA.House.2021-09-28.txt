 Madam Speaker, the other day, we saw the press secretary  for President Biden, Jen Psaki. She was complaining and tired of  Republicans talking about the border and not having any ideas.   Well, we have ideas. They don't always get publicized. Here are some  of them right here: enforce our laws; enforce our laws as written;  complete the border fence and complete all border construction; the  remain in Mexico policy, why don't we reinstate that? It worked pretty  well without people rushing the border before.   Require negative COVID tests before entering our country. Wouldn't  that be something since we are telling all of our citizens we have to  do the same to go to a simple thing like a restaurant or a ballpark?   Maybe we could shut off the green light inviting people and sending  people the message, incentivizing the dangerous trek to come to  America.   Lastly, stop the benefits from hardworking U.S. taxpayers. Stop  promising amnesty, tax remittances, healthcare, and sanctuary cities to  illegal immigrants.   These are the messages Republicans have been conveying all along, so  I invite Jen Psaki to listen up.  [[Page H5499]]                                ____________________
