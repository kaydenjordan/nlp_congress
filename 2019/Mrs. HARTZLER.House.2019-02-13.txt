 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman's leadership  in bringing this subject up here to the floor, to the American people,  and to our colleagues.   It is deeply disturbing to see what is happening across this country,  as life is no longer valued and babies are allowed to be killed, their  lives snuffed out in the final moments before they are born and after  they are born.   Like my colleague from Kansas before me, I was shocked when I turned  on my TV, very similarly--and I am sure there are people all across  this country who did that--to see the Governor of New York sitting at  his table signing this bill and having all these women celebrate it and  then even having a building in New York City lit up in honor of this  celebration. But what were they celebrating?                                time  1745    They were celebrating not only the demise of human lives in late-term  abortion, when, as Dr. Marshall said, they could be born alive in a  hospital and given medical care, and have a productive, full life; they  could have permission to have that life snuffed out; but then to have  the death, perhaps, of the woman as well, at the hands of that  procedure.   A lot of people are unfamiliar of how a late-term abortion is done  and what these individuals in New York were celebrating. It is graphic,  but people need to know what happens.   The woman's uterus is dilated, and forceps are put in there, and a  limb of the baby, in the womb, is grabbed hold of. Steel forceps grab  hold. They find a leg or they find an arm. They clamp down, and they  pull and they pull until it rips off, and they pull out the leg and  they put it in the tray.   And they go in again and they find the other leg. They pull and they  rip it off and pull it out.   And then they go in for the arm, and then they pull that out. They  pull out the other arm. And then they go in and crush the skull and  suck it out.   Now, if this doesn't turn your stomach, America, I don't know what  does. And that we could be celebrating this in parts of the country is  just not only tragic, it is barbaric, and it has to be stopped.   So that is why, here in Congress, we are trying to pass the Born- Alive Infants Protection Act, to stand up and to say, we are better  than this as a country. That is not what America is about; that our  Founders established this country and the basic rights of all who are  created by our Creator, and that is the right to life, liberty, and the  pursuit of happiness.   We want to make sure every American can live out that American Dream,  the ones who have the privilege of being born and the ones who, right  now, people are celebrating, unborn. We want everybody to have that  opportunity of life.   I call on all my colleagues and everyone across this country to rise  up and say, now, now is the time that we stop this, and we set up a new  path for America that values every life.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for leading this.
