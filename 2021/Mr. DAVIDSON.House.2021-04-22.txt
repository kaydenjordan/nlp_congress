 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life and memory of  David Kern.   David recently passed away at the age of 79, following a long fight  with cancer. I am particularly extending my condolences to his beloved  wife, Katy; his 4 children and 11 grandchildren.   David was a veteran of the United States Army, a volunteer  firefighter, a small business owner. He served as Liberty Township  Trustee for 32 years, and he was chairman of the Butler County  Republican Party. He was an avid hunter, fisherman, and  conservationist.   More than all that, however, he was a friend and someone who gave me  sound advice and used his influence as a mentor.   David Kern was a very good man, and his presence will be sorely  missed by his family, our community, and all who knew and loved him.
