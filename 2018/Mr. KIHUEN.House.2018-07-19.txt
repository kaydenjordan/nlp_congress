 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of  Michelle Vo. Michelle attended the Route 91 festival in Las Vegas on  October 1.   Michelle was a very hard worker at her job as a financial adviser  with the LAX Coastal Chamber of Commerce. During the month before her  death, she had been named the top producer of her company.   Michelle was passionate and would religiously donate blood every 2  weeks. In her free time, she enjoyed volunteering with the Red Cross,  rock climbing, and golfing. Everything Michelle did, she did with 150  percent effort. Michelle is remembered as being fun, charismatic,  brave, and vibrant.   I would like to extend my condolences to Michelle Vo's family and  friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada,  and the whole country grieve with you.                            ____________________
