 Mr. President, I was unavailable for rollcall vote  No. 274, on the nomination of Mark T. Esper, of Virginia, to be  Secretary of the Army. I believe Mr. Esper is well qualified to be the  Secretary of the Army. Had I been present, I would have voted yea.   I would also note that I was unavailable for this rollcall vote  because I was serving as ranking member at a Senate Judiciary Committee  hearing for judicial nominees--and specifically a panel of four  district court nominees from Kentucky and Kansas that had been  enthusiastically endorsed by Majority Leader McConnell and Senators  Roberts and Moran earlier that morning. Senator Cruz--who was serving  as the acting chair of the committee for this hearing at this time--and  I had hoped that the vote would be held open long enough for us to  participate.   (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________
