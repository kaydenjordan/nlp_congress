 Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt about it, we are in a  time of crisis largely fueled by the Democratic Party and President  Biden's policies. Store shelves are increasingly empty, the cost of  basic goods is soaring, supply chains are failing, ports are  backlogged, and government restrictions on domestic energy have driven  the price of gasoline to 7-year highs. Who is it that foots the bill  for these progressive policies? I will tell you, it is hardworking  American families.                                time  1045    Rather than address the underlying causes of scarcity by bolstering  American production and enhancing our Nation's energy independence, the  Biden administration has worsened the situation with their dictatorial  policies and mandates, most recently in the form of an executive order  requiring all Federal employees and contractors be fully vaccinated  against COVID-19 by November 22 and December 8, respectively.   The alternative? Termination.   This mandate goes too far and has become a model for Democratic  Governors across the country--including my own State of Washington's  Governor Inslee--who are using it to justify their own drastic actions  and impose similar State-level mandates.   Now, in addition to the hundreds of State emergency personnel who are  already out of work, threatening the safety of our communities, central  Washington also has hundreds of Federal workers and contractors who are  facing termination.   American businesses have been struggling enough to find workers, fill  production shifts, and deliver goods. President Biden's one-size-fits- all vaccine mandate will further hammer our small businesses, driving  up prices, slowing down deliveries, and exacerbating supply chain  problems.   First responders and frontline healthcare workers are also being  fired for not complying with COVID-19 vaccine mandates. In the State of  Washington, we have seen hundreds of our brave law enforcement officers  forced to choose between vaccination and doing their jobs. Leaving our  communities, which are facing rising crime rates, unprotected is not  going to increase anyone's safety.   Hospitals and health clinics are experiencing staffing shortages as  well. The remaining employees are then overworked to compensate,  leading to burnout and increased staff turnover. Leaving our hospitals  understaffed is not going to help our communities overcome this public  health crisis.   President Biden's deadline for the vaccine mandate brushes right up  against the peak holiday season. Since cargo distribution companies are  already battling unprecedented labor shortages, this mandate is likely  to wreak havoc on the global supply chain when it is stressed the most,  during the holidays. Leaving our tables empty and the space under our  Christmas trees bare is not going to improve morale.   But why is President Biden perpetuating a permanent state of  emergency? The only answer that comes to mind is that he is more  concerned about expanding governmental control than the safety and  stability of our workforce or the protection of our individual rights.   Not only does this mandate go against our inalienable rights  protected in the Constitution, but it ignores the fact that natural  immunity also provides protection against infection from the virus. In  fact, other countries have adopted policies upholding this as a valid,  science-based exemption from vaccine requirements. The mandate also  doesn't allow workers to opt out through frequent COVID testing, as  many private businesses have chosen to do.   Federal employees who have opted not to receive the vaccine because  they have natural immunity developed after recovering from the virus do  not deserve to be fired, especially when those same men and women have  worked tirelessly to keep our communities safe and healthy before there  was even a vaccine available. These men and women, who have been on the  front lines since the beginning of the pandemic and risking their  families' health and safety to ensure our Federal and State projects  continued and that our communities remained protected, deserve our  respect, not our condemnation.   But the President has doubled down on his policies, stating that he  absolutely thinks police officers and emergency responders should be  fired if they do not comply with this mandate.   That is why I introduced the Options Over Terminations Act. This  legislation would provide an exemption to the Federal COVID-19 mandate  for any Federal employee or contractor who provides proof of COVID-19  antibodies.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support my legislation and  provide our workers with a smart, science-based alternative to  President Biden's vaccine mandate.                            ____________________
