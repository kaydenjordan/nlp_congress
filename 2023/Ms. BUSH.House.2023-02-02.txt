 Madam Speaker, St. Louis and I rise in support of  Congresswoman Ilhan Omar. I have been to her district. I have spoken  with her constituents. We visited marginalized communities globally  together. This institution is better because of her leadership, and the  Foreign Affairs Committee benefits from her perspective.   Let's talk about what is really happening. Republicans are waging a  blatantly Islamophobic and racist attack on Congresswoman Omar.   I have said it before, and I will say it again: The white supremacy  happening is unbelievable. This is despicable.  [[Page H649]]    It is Congresswoman Omar who has been harassed at her job for simply  existing as a Muslim woman in Congress. It is she who has been attacked  by a Member of this body, ridiculing her as a potential terrorist for  simply existing as a Muslim woman in this Congress.   Rather than bring actual accountability, any accountability, to  Congress, they bring this offensive resolution to the floor. This is  just a bunch of racist gaslighting. We all know it. Vote ``no.''
