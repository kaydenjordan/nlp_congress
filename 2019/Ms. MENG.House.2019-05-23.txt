 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in gratitude that my bill, H.R.  615, the Refugee Sanitation Facility Safety Act, unanimously passed the  House. I thank my colleagues for their support.   I am especially grateful to Chairman Engel and Ranking Member McCaul  for their leadership and support of this critical bill to ensure the  protection of women and girls.   While refugee camps are intended to serve as a temporary refuge from  war, refugees often find that they have been followed by the very  violence rise and insecurity that caused them to flee their home  countries in the first place. Women and girls, in particular, face high  levels of sexual assaults, and the infrastructure of camps fail to  protect against these already-vulnerable populations.   Refugee camps around the world don't provide safe and secure access  to sanitary facilities, and those that exist are often mixed sex,  public, and without locks or well-lit paths.   Many women and girls so fear using the bathroom at night that they  develop urinary tract infections, are forced to relieve themselves in  their tents, or are unable to change their clothes for weeks.   Refugee camps have failed to provide commonsense solutions to protect  refugees from sexual assault in sanitation facilities. This legislation  aims to fix that by requiring U.S. refugee funding to prioritize  securing restrooms in refugee camps.   I now urge the Senate to take up this commonsense, but critical  legislation.                            ____________________
