Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.  [[Page S5834]]    The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues on the  floor to share concerns I have been hearing from people in my State  about the latest healthcare repeal bill.   Minnesotans and patient groups, such as AARP, oppose this bill  because eliminating the Medicaid expansion and the Affordable Care  Act's help for millions of people means they would lose coverage, and  it would increase their out-of-pocket costs.   People in my State are concerned about this bill's impact on rural  hospitals, especially--as are the rural hospitals--because it makes  deep cuts to Medicaid, and the new block grant in the bill would end  completely by 2027.   I am very concerned that this bill would reverse the progress we are  making in addressing the opioid epidemic by putting a cap on Medicaid,  a program that has been critical for substance abuse treatment for  people struggling with this addiction.   A few months ago, I pointed out that we were on plan F in the Senate.  Plans A and B were the two House versions of a repeal; plans C and D  were the two Senate versions of the repeal; plan E was the repeal bill  without a replacement plan; and then we were presented with plan F.  That, of course, went down after the Senate Democrats were joined by  three Republican Senators in voting it down. I actually thought we  couldn't get lower than F, but apparently we can because now we are  here.   Many of the Minnesotans I have talked to don't like A, B, C, D, E, F,  or the plan we are discussing that has been proposed. I have heard from  people all over my State. At the Minnesota State Fair, I heard from  Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. I heard from people from our  cities and people from our rural areas. There are a lot of people-- nearly 2 million people--at the Minnesota State Fair, which is the  biggest State fair in the country. A lot of people stopped by my booth.  I heard from the old and the young, from men and women, cancer  survivors, people with disabilities, and many more. None of them wanted  us to keep going down a partisan path when it comes to healthcare.   That is why I was so happy to tell them over the recess that new  work--bipartisan work--was being done with Senator Alexander and  Senator Murray, two Senators who proved that they could work across the  aisle on the education bill, which they did last year. They are the  leaders on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, and  they have been moving forward together with truly bipartisan hearings  and discussions. I have attended a number of them with Governors and  with experts on this issue to figure out the best ways to strengthen  the individual markets and to reduce costs. That is something we have  done successfully in our State with an all-Republican legislature and a  Democratic Governor. We worked on it in our State, so I figured we  could maybe bring this out on the national level. But it isn't enough  that the work that is going on with Senator Alexander and Senator  Murray on a bipartisan basis could be imploded in favor of another  version of a repeal bill that hasn't even gone to a hearing before the  HELP Committee in regular order, as we would expect--the regular order  Senator McCain spoke up for in the incredible speech he gave when he  came back to the Senate. If that isn't enough, we heard yesterday that  we will not even be able to get a full Congressional Budget Office  analysis of this bill this month. Why would we rush to take a vote  before we have that critical information?   I have repeatedly heard my colleagues criticize moving forward with  bills when we don't know their impact. Our constituents are owed this.  This is the entire healthcare system of America. Why would we be taking  a vote on a bill when we don't even know the full impact--when we do  not have a full score of the bill--either financially or, most  honestly, the impact it would have on people's healthcare? Our  constituents are owed this. It is their healthcare and their money we  are messing around with.   When I talk to my constituents, none of them ask me to do what we  already know this bill does. It cuts Medicaid, eliminates the Medicaid  expansion, threatens protections for people with preexisting  conditions, and kicks people off their insurance coverage. Instead,  they want us to work together on bipartisan solutions to fix what we  have when it comes to healthcare: to strengthen the exchanges, support  small businesses, reform delivery systems, and lower the cost of  prescription drugs. I don't see anything in this bill that would lower  the cost of prescription drugs--nothing.   I have heard the same message from senior groups and the Children's  Hospital Association, which are strongly opposed to this bill. I have  heard the same message from the American Heart Association, the  American Diabetes Association, the American Cancer Society, and several  other patient groups that have said this ``proposal just repackages the  problematic provisions'' of the bills that were voted down earlier this  summer.   This bill, the Graham-Cassidy bill, is not the only option. Instead  of making these kinds of cuts and moving backward, Senator Alexander  and Senator Murray have invited all Senators, as I noted, to  participate in their process. They have had dozens of Senators show up  at early morning breakfasts or, as Senator Alexander calls them,  coffees, with 30, 40 Senators showing up. I know because I was there.  Why do they show up? Because they know we must make changes to the  Affordable Care Act. They also know, based on the work we have seen in  Minnesota and other places, these changes can be made across the aisle.   In these hearings and discussions on bipartisan solutions, we have  talked about the State-based reinsurance program passed in Minnesota.  While we are still waiting for the Federal waiver--I will make a pitch  for this at this moment--from the administration, even passing it alone  helped us to bring promised rates down. I know Alaska has a State-based  reinsurance program and recently got approval from the administration,  and New Hampshire and other States are pursuing similar plans. That is  why I support Senator Kaine and Senator Carper's legislation, the  Individual Health Insurance Marketplace Improvement Act, to reestablish  a Federal reinsurance program. This bill would lower premiums by  providing support for high-cost patients.   Another topic we have discussed frequently as part of the HELP  Committee process over the past few weeks is the cost-sharing reduction  payments. These are crucial to stabilizing the individual market and  reducing uncertainty. That is why I support Senator Shaheen's  Marketplace Certainty Act.   It is clear that this type of legislation could get support from both  sides of the aisle to improve the system, but beyond these immediate  fixes, it is long past time that we come together to pass legislation  to address the skyrocketing costs of prescription drugs. I have a bill  that would harness the negotiating power of 41 million seniors on  Medicare to bring drug prices down. Right now, Medicare is actually  banned by law from using their market power to negotiate for better  prices. I would bet on 41 million seniors for getting better prices,  but we are not giving them that chance.   Senator McCain and I have a bill to allow Americans to bring in safe,  less expensive drugs from Canada.   Senator Lee and I have a bill that would allow temporary importation  of safe drugs that have been on the market in another country for at  least 10 years when there isn't a healthy competition for that drug in  this country. This would let patients access safe, less expensive  drugs.   Senator Grassley and I have a bill which would stop something called  pay-for-delay, where big pharmaceutical companies actually pay off  generic companies to keep less expensive drugs off the market. That  bill would save taxpayers $2.9 billion and a similar amount for  individual consumers.   Are those bills in this latest proposal from our Republican  colleagues? No, they are not. Instead, what does this bill do? While it  devastates the Medicaid Program, it repeals big parts of the Affordable  Care Act that help people afford insurance and, instead, puts in place  an inadequate block grant which completely goes away in 10 years. This  bill does the opposite of what the people came up to me and talked to  me about in my State over the August break.   So before we rush through a vote on it, before we even know the  impact of  [[Page S5835]]  it, before it has even gone through the committee process as it is  supposed to do, before we even give an opportunity for Senator Lamar  Alexander and Senator Patty Murray--the two leaders on the committee  that matters for healthcare--to come up with their plan, no, the  proposal would be to rush the vote on this, and that is just wrong.   What is this in real terms? It is a woman from Pine Island, MN. Her  husband has struggled with mental illness for years, but she told me  she felt so fortunate that he was able to get mental health treatment  through their insurance coverage. She is worried that if these types of  repeal efforts succeed, people like her husband will go back to being  desperate for help.   This debate is about people with preexisting conditions who would see  their costs skyrocket under this bill. Teri from my State has ovarian  cancer. Unfortunately, it is not the first time she has had it. She  said that when she was diagnosed back in 2010, she ended up declaring  bankruptcy due to the cost of her treatment. Teri said bankruptcy was  ``just a reality for a lot of people with cancer.''   Luckily, under the Affordable Care Act, Teri can afford insurance and  is currently responding well to treatment, which, by the way--I see  Senator Durbin here--is based on NIH-funded research. It is treatment  based on that research, which, unfortunately, we cut back on in the  bill, and Senator Durbin will continue to fight to get that treatment  through the Department of Defense included.   But the bill we are facing now, the Graham-Cassidy bill, would allow  insurers to charge sick people or those with preexisting conditions  much more than healthy people. Teri is worried that it would make it  difficult, if not impossible, for people like her to afford health  insurance.   This debate is about all the parents whom I have spoken to over the  last few months who have children with disabilities. These parents  would literally come up to me at parades over the summer, bring their  kids over in the middle of the parade route, and introduce those  children to me--kids in wheelchairs, kids with Down syndrome--and say:  This is a preexisting condition. This is what a preexisting condition  looks like. That is why they oppose repeal.   In Minnesota, one out of four children get their health coverage from  Medicaid, and 39 percent of our children with disabilities or special  healthcare rely on Medicaid or children's health insurance. We should  be spending our time this week reauthorizing the Children's Health  Insurance Program before States like mine run out of money at the end  of the month, before debating another repeal bill for which we don't  even have a Congressional Budget Office score on the impact. That word  ``score'' sounds technical, but it is about what the bill would mean to  people like those kids who came up to me in the parades with their  parents and to people, like Teri, with ovarian cancer.   This debate is also about our seniors and our rural communities. Our  hospitals are essential to rural communities. They don't just provide  health services; they employ thousands of doctors, nurses, pharmacists,  and other healthcare workers. These rural hospitals often operate at  margins of less than 1 percent. That is one reason Senator Grassley and  I introduced the Rural Emergency Acute Care Hospital Act a few months  ago to help rural hospitals stay open. But cutting Medicaid by billions  of dollars and repealing the Medicaid expansion would move us in the  opposite direction.   In my State, Medicaid covers one out of five people living in rural  areas. I know my colleagues, Senators Collins, Capito, and Murkowski,  have previously expressed real concerns about the impact of Medicaid  cuts in their States, which also have big rural populations. Cutting  Medicaid and eliminating the Medicaid expansion doesn't just threaten  healthcare coverage for these populations; it threatens the local  communities where these hospitals are located.   These rural hospitals are on the frontlines of one important fight;  that is, the fight against the opioid epidemic. We just found out that  in our State last year, over 600 people died from opioid and other drug  overdoses--over 600 people. That is about two per day. It is more  people than we see die from car crashes in our State. It is more people  than we see die from homicide. Deaths from prescription drugs now claim  more lives than either of those two issues. This epidemic affects our  seniors too. One in three Medicare part D beneficiaries received a  prescription opioid last year.   While there is much more work to do to combat the epidemic, I want to  recognize the progress we have made with the CARA Act and the Cures  Act, with all the work that has been done, but making cuts to Medicaid  will move us in the other direction.   We have all heard the voices, not just of those on the frontlines of  the opioid crisis but from doctors and hospitals, patients, seniors,  nursing homes, and schools saying that this bill is not the way  forward. Instead, let's do what we all heard people wanted us to do in  August; that is, to work across the aisle on actual solutions that help  people afford healthcare.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous rule, all postcloture time  has expired.   The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the Francisco  nomination?
