 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a  prominent conservative leader, Reta Hamilton, for her long-standing  commitment to serving and strengthening the Republican Party in  Arkansas and nationwide.   Mrs. Hamilton launched her political activism career in 1987. In the  decades since, she has made numerous contributions to mobilize the  conservative cause--and with great success. Nicknamed ``the Road  Warrior'' since her early days, she has driven nearly every highway in  Arkansas, supporting, encouraging, and building county committees and  Republican Women clubs. She is a longtime Tusk Club member, which  denotes her dedication to GOP candidates and ideas.   Mrs. Hamilton's commitment and impact have been widely felt at the  local level. She served as president of the Washington County  Republican Women in 1989 and more than doubled its membership, for  which she received a newly-created award from the Arkansas Federation  of Republican Women as well as recognition from the National Federation  of Republican Women. The Washington County Republican Committee honored  her as Republican of the Year at its 1989 Lincoln Dinner, with  Congressman John Paul Hammerschmidt participating in the presentation.  That year, she was also elected as AFRW third vice-president.   Mrs. Hamilton eventually moved to Benton County and in 1994 was  elected secretary of the Benton County Republican Party. She later  served as a State committeewoman and was honored at the 1996 Lincoln  Dinner as Republican of the Year in Rogers, AR. Mrs. Hamilton was  elected one of six electors to serve both in the 2008 and 2012  electoral college.   During her years of involvement in the Republican Party of Arkansas,  she became second vice chair and was appointed to the Arkansas  Governor's Appointments Committee, as well as a serving a record 14  continuous years on the Executive Committee of the Arkansas GOP.   Mrs. Hamilton was appointed by the State chairman to serve over 10  years on the RPA Rules Committee. A pinnacle of her political career  came in 2003, when she was elevated to the position of RPA State  chairman. During this time, she was able to refocus the State party and  set it on a course to majority leadership. Mrs. Hamilton was elected  Arkansas Republican National Committeewoman in 2005 and served until  term-limited in 2012. She also served on the RNC Rules Committee from  2010 through 2012.   She was also elected by RPA delegates to serve on the RNC Rules  Committee from 1996 to 2016. Mrs. Hamilton was an elected delegate to  every Republican National Convention from 1992 through 2020, serving as  a Trump delegate in 2016 and 2020.   At the Reagan Rockefeller Dinner in 2016, the RPA awarded Mrs.  Hamilton the ``Hi, I'm Frank White'' Award for making significant  contributions to build the State party.   Having been involved with the National Federation of Republican Women  since 1983, Mrs. Hamilton was appointed to serve as a nonvoting member  of the NFRW Board of Directors in 2000 and served until 2020 as a  regent and capital regent. She has attended nearly every NFRW biennial  convention since 1987. Mrs. Hamilton was honored with an appointment  and election to fill the vacancy of national committeewoman from  December 2020 to June 5, 2021.   I am honored to call Reta Hamilton my friend, and I am incredibly  proud of her efforts to elevate and expand the Republican Party in  Arkansas. Her conservative influence on the Arkansas GOP and this  Nation has made a difference. The direction of our State and growth of  the Republican Party into the majority party demonstrates the power  that passion and commitment to one's ideals can have. I hope her  example will serve as a lesson to future generations of Arkansans and  Republican leaders.                            ____________________
