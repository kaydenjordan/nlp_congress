 Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend, Judge Al Green.  He is a brother, and I appreciate him very much. We have differences of  opinion, but I know we are going to end up the same place together.   Madam Speaker, there is so much that has been going on that has been  disrupting the country, and I am not sure what all my good friend, a  former judge in Houston, was saying. I didn't get to hear that. But I  believe he was addressing some of the unrest.   He and I both want to see freedom. We want to see equality. We want  to see people treated fairly and equally. Those are things we share,  and I know that is what is on his heart.   But I am highly concerned about the legitimate peaceful protests that  were taking place as a result of the cruel death, the killing of George  Floyd. And his family, and the way they approached it, was  inspirational. There deserve to be protests over that horrendous death.   The Floyd family pointed out they did not want the legacy of George  Floyd to be violence and suffering and death and looting. That was not,  and is not, what they want for the memory and legacy of George Floyd.    But the movement has been hijacked. The violence they don't want,  just the justice they want. It has been hijacked. And it is very  important that Americans understand what is going on here, so that it  is not just those who have spent our lifetimes studying history that  see so clearly what is going on by instigators who want to see the  country that has been in an ongoing state of getting better and  better--for years, even with unfairness and inequality, it has still  been the hope of the world when it comes to freedom and a shot at  equality.   Antifa, short for antifascist--and there has been no greater irony in  the world that Hitler and Stalin--two mad men, evil men with a  globalist desire--ended up against each other. Of course, it is quite  ironic that when they got together and signed a treaty, both of them,  behind the scenes, were talking about the day when that individual  would breach the treaty with the other.   One of the things Stalin was so furious about when Hitler moved east  was that Hitler broke the treaty before Stalin had the chance to. They  were two evil people, and they were pushing an evil idea: with Hitler,  the evil of fascism; with Stalin, the evil of Marxism, communism,  socialism, whatever you want to call it. It is all about the same  thing.   So, you have communism and fascism. Both of them want globalism. They  want to control the world, and they don't want anybody else to control  it. They want to control it.   The treachery and the evil that went under both of those leaders is  legendary. Hitler killed over 6 million Jews in some of the most  horrific and evil ways conceivable. Stalin did the same thing, except  he killed many millions more.   Then in China, decades after that came Mao, who brought communism to  China. It is hard to get your arms around a proper number. We know  Stalin killed around 20 million Ukrainians, starving them to death, but  he killed no telling how many millions more. You just look at the evil  treatment of the poor Polish people that when he liberated them, he  took so many who were what he saw as good slave labor and brought them  back in slavery to the Soviet Union, where they either worked as slaves  under Stalin or they were killed.   When the Iron Curtain fell, just as many historians, including a  brilliant historian I eagerly learned under at Texas A&M--she was not  allowed back in the Soviet Union after she wrote about the evil that  was done to so many of the Polish officers and people. One of my  favorite history teachers, she was terrific, brilliant. But when the  Iron Curtain fell, we found out the things that she said and  discovered, and others did, were exactly right.   Reagan was right. It was an evil empire. And the one Hitler was  trying to build was just about as evil--in some ways, much more evil.   But it is important that young people and millennials understand what  we are talking about here. This country, warts and all, has been, as  moviemaker Ron Maxwell said, ``a history of liberation.'' It wasn't  founded on slavery. It was on the march toward liberation, each step.   So many Christians, like the Pilgrims and so many others, came to  avoid persecution for being Christians. Sometimes, people came who were  considered unwanted in other countries.   If you look at the original draft of the Declaration of Independence,  Thomas Jefferson, who owned slaves, had entered what probably was the  biggest paragraph setting out a grievance against King George. It is  spelled out in this grievance against King George, that he ever allowed  slavery to get going in the Colonies, because it was so terrible. It  was evil, and it took too long and cost too many lives to get rid of  it.   By the way, that grievance didn't end up in the final draft because  there were States that objected, that supported slavery. So that  grievance Jefferson had originally put in was taken out. It was not in  the final draft.                                time  1900    But it took a war that took half a million lives in a country that  didn't have half a million lives to spare, devastated the United  States.   Lincoln believed the Union should be held together, and it would be  held together, and this would be the capital of the whole country.   And he wanted no malice to anyone at the end of the war. He wanted to  bring the country together. But it took an ordained Christian minister  named Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and so many others, including some  who served in Congress, it took them standing for equality and what is  right to ensure that the Declaration of Independence and the  Constitution would mean what it said.   In some ways, in recent years, we have been distracted by people who  have been at war, on offense against Christianity, so that now we are  to the point where, if you believe what Jesus said, as set out in the  New Testament, then you, among so many millions now in our country, are  to be an object of scorn and hate.   So, as you see these groups that are really Marxist groups-- antifascist does not mean it is a good group; it means it is Marxist.  And that is where they want to take us, and it means Christianity will  be persecuted to the extent we have seen, with the horrors we have seen  over the centuries since Jesus was here.   So there is an article by Igor Norinsky, June 28, in American  Greatness, talking about Black Lives Matter.   I really don't believe at all that there is a single member of  Congress who doesn't agree Black lives matter. I don't know anybody who  is in Congress who does not believe that Black lives matter.   This article starts out saying: ``To the 60 percent of Americans not  polling for Trump, many firmly left-of-center, a thought experiment as  November draws nearer: What must be true so that Trump gets your vote?  It is a miserable question because many Americans are, to put it  mildly, negative on the President.''   The article goes on--don't have time to go through the whole thing.  But the point is made here: ``The emotional call-and-response appeal of  `black lives matter' ''--and that is with little B, little L, little  M--``entices all who repeat  [[Page H3054]]  it into believing they are antiracists and that everyone else must be  the opposite. But `black lives matter'--with small letters--which no  one disagrees with, is not the same as''--capitalized--``Black Lives  Matter.''   They had what they believed at one time--that has since been taken  down, as I understand it--and substituted for one that is a little more  palatable, but make no mistake: You look at the history of this group,  it is a Marxist group.   The article points out: ``Communism,'' which is simply ``Marxism  applied, was responsible for over 100 million deaths during the last  century alone, which says nothing of the psychological terror, the  Auschwitz of the mind, that imprisoned the untold millions who did not  perish. The systematic oppression and terror Marxist ideas engendered  is nowhere better described than Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's `Gulag  Archipelago,' a painstaking and harrowing account of the forced labor  camp system under Soviet Communism. In a telling passage, he provides  an insight into the engine that made the tyranny possible.''   And he quotes from Solzhenitsyn:   ``Macbeth's self-justifications were feeble--and his conscience  devoured him. Yes, even Iago was a little lamb, too. The imagination  and spiritual strength of Shakespeare's evildoers stopped short at a  dozen corpses. Because they had no ideology. Ideology--that is what  gives evildoing its long-sought justification and gives the evildoer  the necessary steadfastness and determination. That is the social  theory which helps to make his acts seem good instead of bad in his own  or other's eyes. . . . That was how the agents of the Inquisition  fortified their wills . . . the colonizers, by civilization; the Nazis,  by race. . . . Without evildoers, there would have been no  Archipelago.''   The writer says: ``I was spared those horrors thanks, in part, to  being born near the dismal end of the Soviet Union and thanks, in part,  to the courage of parents who dared seek permission to leave from a  central authority notoriously brutal to the unbelievers. As Jews  ostensibly bound for Israel, we had the great fortune of being unwanted  anyway. Almost all of your life's possessions stay behind--they belong  to `the people,' after all--but the scars most certainly do not. Scars  travel with you. The many hundreds of thousands of refugees and exiles  from Communist countries living in America today can fill entire  libraries with the stories behind those scars. Go seek them out and  listen.   ``Whether in Stalin's Russia, Mao's China, Pol Pot's Cambodia, the  precepts of Marxism led humanity as close to the abyss as it has ever  come.''   ``Neither do Marxism's purveyors and apologists all sit in Beijing.  For years, many intellectuals in the West openly espoused Marxism. Its  great utopian appeal should come as no surprise particularly in our  present age of social justice. Solzhenitsyn would later lament at the  West's failure to accept the grim warnings of his testimonial.''   And, again, from Solzhenitsyn: ``Modern society is hypnotized by  socialism. It is prevented by socialism from seeing the mortal danger  it is in. And one of the greatest of all is that you have lost all  sense of danger; you cannot even see where it's coming from as it moves  swiftly toward you.   ``You imagine you see danger in other parts of the globe and hurl  arrows from your depleted quiver there. But the greatest danger of all  is that you have lost the will to defend yourselves.''   Hate Donald Trump if you want. So far, for now, we have that freedom.  But the fact is, he saw the dangers from China before anybody in public  office did and talked about them.   But anyway, Solzhenitsyn wrote that ``in 1976 as the United States  was deep into the Cold War. Nearly 45 years later, long after the Cold  War has ended, the generation that is driving today's revolutionary  agenda has little to no conception of what socialism is and what brand  of misery it left in its wake. It is nearly impossible to cultivate any  sense of dread or urgency in a society where connection to that chapter  of the human experience has all but been severed. But we have to try.''    And he is so right.   ``BLM,'' he says, ``is pure ideology. It appears bent on redefining  America and its institutions pursuant to progressively tribalistic  commandments. Draped in the powerful, albeit deceptive, cover of racial  indignation''--which we should all stand for equality there--``the  movement has convinced many Americans that being White is an original  sin, that America is evil, and that the sinner's day in court has  arrived. It prescribes class struggle, exponentially amplified by the  battle cry of racial reckoning.''   ``Revolutions vilify the past.''   And he goes on.   But it is important that people understand that, as we try and move  closer and closer to end any injustice in America--it will never be  perfect, but it is the closest humanity has ever gotten, and still  there are things we can do to make it better--it is critical to  understand the evil that is so close to taking over and embracing this  country, because we have generations now that have not learned true  history. They have learned some misbegotten professor's idea, as he or  she dealt with their own hate and own prejudice, as they rewrote our  history.   But if you look fairly at the history, you see injustice, none more  so than slavery's existence.   But if you go back to the late 1940s, early 1950s, when Whittaker  Chambers, who had had a very unpleasant childhood, unpleasant family  life growing up, thought maybe communism, Marxism was the way to go,  and he began working with people like Alger Hiss, who was one of the  most respected people in the State Department, right at the top. And  because he had an Ivy League education, Ivy Leaguers loved the man,  just thought he was fantastic.   But both Alger Hiss, Whittaker Chambers, and others with whom they  worked and believed in communism, were working to bring down the United  States, just as antifa and so many others are today.   When Whittaker Chambers began to see that this Marxism that he  thought so much of actually caused more suffering than the very type of  government he was trying to bring down, that was revolutionary in his  mind, and he realized he was fighting the wrong people.   His book ``Witness''--I should have read it years and years ago, but  it is only in the last couple of years I read it. Some great statements  he has in his book.   ``Few men are so dull that they do not know that the crisis exists  and that it threatens their lives at every point. It is popular,'' he  said, ``to call it a social crisis. It is, in fact, a total crisis-- religious, moral, intellectual, social, political, economic. It is  popular to call it a crisis of the Western world. It is in fact a  crisis of the whole world. Communism . . . is itself a symptom and an  irritant of that crisis.''   He quoted Stalin's statement: ``Is it not true that social democracy  and social fascism are twins? ''   Our current chairman of the Judiciary Committee has gotten very upset  when some of us have pointed out that Hitler and Hitler's party were  the National Socialist Workers Party in Germany. And he tried to draw  that distinction, but Stalin himself says: Isn't it true that social  democracy and social fascism are really twins?   But Dostoevsky, he quoted, saying: ``The problem of communism is not  economic problem; the problem of communism is the problem of atheism.''   I have seen it, lived it for a summer in the Soviet Union. They  didn't want Christianity. They only allowed one authorized seminary. I  was told, when I visited there, that they allowed only 40 people to go  to the only authorized seminary back during those oppressive years  under communism.   Whittaker Chambers says: ``One day the Communist really hears those  screams. The screams . . . do not merely reach his mind. They pierce  beyond. They pierce to his soul.''   ``A communist breaks because he must choose at last between  irreconcilable opposites--God or man, soul or mind, freedom or  communism.''                                time  1915    This Marxist ideology that is being pushed on us by groups that hate  America is very dangerous. Chambers points out `` . . . the crisis of  the Western world exists to the degree it is indifferent to God. It  exists to the degree in which the Western world actually  [[Page H3055]]  shares communism's materialist vision, is so dazzled by the logic of  the materialist interpretation of history, of politics, and economics,  that it fails to grasp that, for it, the only possible answer to the  communist or Marxist challenge is to choose either faith in God or  faith in man. . . . `'   He said: ``Freedom is a need of the soul and nothing else. It is in  striving toward God that the soul strives continually after a condition  of freedom.''   I think every American has felt that.   He says: ``God alone is the insider and guarantor of freedom. He is  the only guarantor. External freedom is only an aspect of interior  freedom. Political freedom, as the Western world has known it, is only  a political reading of the Bible. Religion and freedom are indivisible.  Without freedom, the soul dies. Without the soul, there is no  justification for freedom.''   Vladimir Ilyich Lenin made this comment on religion in a November  1913 letter: ``Every religious idea of God, even flirting with the idea  of God, is unutterable vileness . . . of the most dangerous kind.''   I think that is why, on visiting that sole recognized seminary at  Zagorsk decades ago, I was struck because there was a building there,  and on the side of the building--this is where you turn into the gates  of the seminary--was a big painting of Lenin's face and the words:  ``Lenin s nami.'' ``Lenin is with us.''   So anyone going into this Christian seminary had to see, as they went  in, that message from the government. You may be going into this  Christian seminary, but don't ever forget it is Lenin who is with us.   Now, I had a chance to see Lenin in his tomb. There were rumors that  his ear was deteriorated and had been replaced by a rubber ear. I don't  know if that was true, but Lenin was not with us, I can verify. He is  long gone to his just reward, such as it was.   Whittaker Chambers said: ``If I had rejected only communism, I would  have rejected only one political expression of the modern mind, the  most logical because the most brutal in enforcing the myth of man's  material perfectibility. What I sensed, without being able to phrase it  was what has since been phrased with the simplicity of an axiom.''   This axiom is: ``'Man cannot organize for himself without God;  without God, man can only organize the world against man.' The gas  ovens of Buchenwald and the communist execution cellars exist first  within the minds.''   He said: ``What I grasped was that religion begins at the point where  reason and knowledge are powerless and forever fail--the point at which  man senses the mystery of his good and evil, his suffering, and his  destiny as a soul in search of God.''   ``Against liberalism's social optimism,'' which is progress by  reform, ``and the social optimism revolutionary left,'' which is  progress by force, ``Dostoevsky asserted the eternal necessity of the  soul to be itself. But he discerned that the moment man indulged his  freedom to the point where he was also free from God, it led him into  tragedy, evil, and often the exact opposite of what had been intended.  In human terms, there was no solution for the problem of evil.''   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
