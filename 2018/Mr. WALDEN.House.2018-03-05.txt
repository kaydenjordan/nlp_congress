 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman of the  Environment Subcommittee, my friend, Mr. Shimkus, who has worked  tirelessly--not just this year, not just last year, but probably since  the first year he came to Congress--to try and find a permanent  solution to the storage of nuclear waste in America. He has been a  tireless worker in this endeavor, a smart worker in this endeavor, and  a successful, so far, worker in this endeavor, as this bill passed out  of the committee 49-4.   I rise tonight to address this pressing national need, and that is  the importance of fixing our broken nuclear waste management program.   It was more than 35 years ago that the United States Congress made a  commitment to communities throughout our Nation which host spent  nuclear fuel and nuclear waste. Congress, the Federal Government,  agreed to assign the Department of Energy with the responsibility to  permanently dispose of hazardous material, nuclear waste, by 1998.   There are many of those communities, like in the Tri-Cities in  Washington State, co-located with the Department of Energy's Hanford  site just up Columbia River, across the river from where I live and the  people I represent. We have been DOE's partner to help win World War II  at that site. It has maintained a nuclear weapon deterrent and powered  our fleet of nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers.   Additionally, electricity consumers in many other communities have  paid the Federal Government more than $40 billion to develop, license,  construct, and operate a nuclear waste repository. They have already  paid $40 billion to do this, and that was pursuant to the Nuclear Waste  Policy Act, the law that Congress enacted. Yet rate payers have little  to see for their investment because, I will call it political science,  has deprived the public of the actual science to prove that nuclear  waste can be safely and permanently disposed of.   As a consequence of this political interference, taxpayers and rate  payers across the country are on the hook for DOE's inaction. The  American people pay over $2 million every day to temporarily store used  fuel scattered throughout the United States. So it is up to us to fix  this waste management program and stop this cost that will continue in  perpetuity if we don't act.   Now, after hearing from dozens of expert witnesses over many years,  the Energy and Commerce Committee developed and passed a bipartisan  bill by a vote of 49-4. Mr. Shimkus led our effort in this measure.   This legislation makes targeted reforms to the Nuclear Waste Policy  Act of 1982 to set the Federal Government up to finally, finally, keep  its promise.   Nuclear waste challenges have vexed policymakers for generations.   We, this Congress, have the chance now in a bipartisan way to  successfully build a durable solution. I look forward to working with  my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to achieve that goal, which  brings about tonight's Special Order.   Now, Mr. Speaker, I just want to show something. This is a piece of  glass. This is not actually nuclear waste. The Pacific Northwest  National Lab, when I visited Hanford a little while back with Secretary  Perry, gave me this because it is an example of what the liquid waste,  the waste at Hanford, will end up being.                                time  1930    It will look like this in a big cylinder. It is glass. This is what  would go to Hanford, and it would be stored safely when that occurs.   If we don't have a repository, these nuclear wastes, in their various  forms, will sit around in various locations, not nearly as safe or  secure as we can have with the kind of legislation fully enacted that  Mr. Shimkus has led on. So I thank Mr. Shimkus for his leadership on  this. And I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their  encouragement, their participation, their counsel. We are going to get  this thing done.
