 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman  from Minnesota, the Honorable Brad Finstad, be permitted to take the  oath of office today.   His certificate of election has not arrived, but there is no contest  and no question has been raised with regard to his election.    Madam Speaker, on behalf of myself and the entire  delegation from Minnesota, I would like to welcome Representative Brad  Finstad to the House of Representatives.   Hailing from New Ulm, Minnesota, Representative Finstad continues a  proud tradition within the Minnesota Congressional Delegation of a life  of public service and a commitment to agricultural issues and rural  development.   From 2003 to 2009, he served as a member of the Minnesota House of  Representatives, including a term as assistant minority leader.   In the previous administration, Representative Finstad served as  Minnesota's Director of USDA Rural Development. He has also held  leadership positions in the Center for Rural Policy and Development and  the Minnesota Turkey Growers Association. And I will brag for a second  that Minnesota is the largest turkey producer in the United States. You  don't have Thanksgiving without us.   Today, Representative Finstad continues a proud generational  tradition with his wife, Jackie, of running their family farm in the  New Ulm area, and I am sure all the children pitch in and help with  chores.   We look forward to warmly welcoming Representative Finstad and his  family to Congress.   Madam Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.  Emmer), my colleague.
