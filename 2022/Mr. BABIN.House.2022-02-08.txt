 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Louisiana for  having this Special Order.   Mr. Speaker, there are multiple crises. That is exactly right. It is  nearly impossible to discuss President Biden's self-inflicted economic  crisis without mentioning his excessive spending. I am not talking  about money to strengthen our military or to make America more  competitive in the world. Biden and the Democrats have no interest in  that. This out-of-control spending is necessary only to appease the  radical Democrat base who prioritize radical climate change policies  without a care in the world for their consequences.   As a result, inflation sits at a 40-year high and our national debt  has increased by trillions of dollars. For years, my colleagues across  the aisle have worked tirelessly to desensitize Americans to the word  ``trillion,'' and they have succeeded for the most part because a  trillion of anything is such a mind-boggling figure for the average  human to wrap his mind around it.   When I was elected to Congress in 2014, our national debt was $17  trillion. Fast-forward 8 years later, our national debt has topped $30  trillion. This should shock every American taxpayer, but it doesn't  seem to. Allow me to put this into perspective.   If you owed $1 trillion, and you decided to pay $1 per second until  your debt was paid off, it would take you around 31,700 years to become  debt-free. Now, multiply that by 30, for $30 trillion of our national  debt. I am no mathematician, but this amounts to approximately 951,000  years. So if we paid $1 per second until our $30 trillion national debt  is paid off, it would take us just shy of a million years to become  debt-free.   President Biden and the Democrats must be stopped. American solvency  must be preserved. Generations of future Americans are counting on us  to regain control of Washington's unsustainable spending. We literally  cannot afford to fail.
