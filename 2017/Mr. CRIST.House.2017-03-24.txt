 Mr. Speaker, this bill we are talking about takes about  $880 billion out of Medicaid. Medicaid is for the poor, and Medicaid is  for the disabled. We are in Lent. It is supposed to be the holiest  time. I want to read to you from Matthew 25, verse 45: Whatever you do  to the least of my brothers, you do unto Me.   Think about that before you vote for this bill. Please vote against  it. God bless.
