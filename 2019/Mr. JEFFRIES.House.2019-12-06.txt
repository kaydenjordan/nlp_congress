 Mr. Speaker, the right to vote is precious and central  to the integrity of our democracy. It is not a Democratic issue or a  Republican issue. It is an American issue.   The Republican party used to support the unfettered right to vote. In  fact, every single time the Voting Rights Act has been reauthorized, it  was signed by a Republican President: 1970, Richard Nixon; 1975, Gerald  Ford; 1982, Ronald Reagan; 2006, George W. Bush. The unfettered right  to vote should be a bipartisan issue, but the party of Lincoln is gone.  The party of Reagan is gone. The party of McCain is gone. Voter  suppression is not a legitimate electoral tactic. It is a stain on our  democracy, and it must be crushed.   Vote ``yes'' on H.R. 4.
