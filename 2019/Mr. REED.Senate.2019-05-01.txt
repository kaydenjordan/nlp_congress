 Mr. President, on Sunday, I had the opportunity to attend  the 104th anniversary commemoration of the Armenian genocide, hosted at  the Armenian Martyrs Memorial in Providence, RI. I was pleased to be  able to join with so many in the Armenian community in my home State  for this solemn event.   Over a century ago, one of the greatest tragedies of the 20th century  began when the Young Turk leaders of the Ottoman Empire executed more  than 200 prominent Armenians. What followed was an 8-year campaign of  oppression and massacre. By 1923, an estimated 1 and a half million  Armenians were killed and over a half a million survivors were exiled.  These atrocities affected the lives of every Armenian living in Asia  Minor and throughout the world.   The U.S. Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire during this dark time,  Henry Morgenthau, Sr., unsuccessfully pleaded with President Wilson to  take action, and later remembered the events of the genocide, saying,  ``I am confident that the whole history of the human race contains no  such horrible episode as this. The great massacres and persecutions of  the past seem almost insignificant when compared to the sufferings of  the Armenian race in 1915.''   Those who survived the Armenian genocide, however, persevered due to  their unbreakable spirit and steadfast resolve, going on to greatly  contribute to the lands in which they established new homes and  communities, including the United States. That is why we not only  commemorate this grave tragedy each year, but also take the time to  celebrate the traditions, the contributions, and the bright future of  the Armenian people. Indeed, my home State of Rhode Island continues to  be enriched by our strong and vibrant Armenian-American community.   To honor the memory of this tragedy, I have once again joined with  several of my colleagues on a resolution to encourage the U.S. to  officially recognize the Armenian genocide. We must find a way to come  together to recognize the truth of what happened and support and assist  those facing persecution today.   As ranking member on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I also  remain committed to supporting assistance to Armenia to strengthen  security, promote economic growth, and foster democratic reforms and  development.   As we remember the past, we remain committed to forging a brighter  future. We must continue to guard against hatred and oppression so that  we can prevent such crimes against humanity from happening again.                            ____________________
