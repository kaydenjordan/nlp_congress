 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I bring a  report to the Senate from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in  Parkland, FL, a suburb of Ft. Lauderdale. The teachers and staff of the  school returned to work today, which is less than 2 weeks after a  former student walked on to the campus with an AR-15 and opened fire on  all three floors of a classroom building.  [[Page S1207]]    I have spent time the past couple of weeks in Parkland, visiting with  some of the families. Those of us who are parents can only imagine the  grief and anger that they are feeling, just like the grief and anger  after every one of these massacres. I have also spent time meeting with  some of the courageous students who have turned this tragedy into a  call for action. As I have suggested to them, their hope gives me hope.  Their determination gives me all the more determination. These students  have told us over and over that they don't plan to stop until Congress  and the State legislators around the country start enacting commonsense  gun reform. They have said that they are not going to stop, and neither  am I.   What happened at that high school shouldn't happen anywhere in this  country. It shouldn't have happened in Columbine. It shouldn't have  happened in Newtown. It shouldn't have happened in Orlando. It  shouldn't have happened at the Ft. Lauderdale airport or Parkland. It  shouldn't happen, period. Now it is up to us to make sure that it never  happens again.   This Senator grew up on a ranch. I have always had guns. I have  hunted all my life. I still hunt with my son. An AR-15 or a SIG Sauer  MCX, the gun that was used at the Pulse nightclub, is not for hunting;  they are for killing. Yet, despite these horrific events, these  devastating tragedies are occurring throughout our country over and  over, and Congress refuses to act. Why is it that we can't enact the  most commonsense measures to protect the people we represent?   We need a comprehensive background check on the purchase of a weapon,  a commonsense background check that would not only include if there is  a criminal record or if someone has been adjudicated mentally  incompetent but all the other myriad reasons, all the other things  surrounding mental health. Was the shooter on the terrorist watch list?  Had Omar Mateen, the shooter, been on the terrorist watch list, he  would have been caught. He was the shooter in Orlando. We need to get  assault rifles off the streets.   Protecting our fellow citizens should be a top priority. If making it  more difficult for someone to walk into a store and purchase a weapon  of war will do that, why can't we get that done? Why? I will tell you  why. Because there are folks who are more concerned about an A-plus  rating from the NRA than they are about providing those commonsense  solutions to the problems.   I want to read something that appeared in a national magazine,  reprinted in the paper that is published in Broward County, where the  shooting occurred. It is from a radiologist who is in the trauma center  at Broward Health, which is a hospital chain organization in the area  of Broward County. Her name is Dr. Heather Sher. She was working the  day of the school shooting, and she went to work in the trauma center  on some of the victims. She has treated countless gunshot wounds in  trauma centers throughout her career, but this one was the second time  that she had treated someone shot by an assault rifle like the AR-15.  Here is what Dr. Sher had to say:         Routine handgun injuries leave entry and exit wounds and       linear tracks through the victim's body that are roughly the       size of the bullet. If the bullet [from a handgun] does not       directly hit something crucial like the heart or the aorta .       . . chances are, we can save the victim. The bullets fired by       an AR-15 are different.    She continues:         With an AR-15, the shooter does not have to be particularly       accurate. The victim does not have to be unlucky. If a victim       takes a direct hit to the liver from an AR-15, the damage is       far graver than that of a handgun bullet injury. Handgun       injuries to the liver are generally survivable unless the       bullet hits the main blood supply to the liver. An AR-15       bullet to the middle of the liver would cause so much       bleeding and tissue loss that the patient would likely never       make it to a trauma center to receive our care.    She continues:         As a doctor, I feel I have a duty to inform the public of       what I have learned as I have observed these wounds and cared       for these patients. It's clear to me that AR-15 or other       high-velocity weapons, especially when outfitted with a high-      capacity magazine, have no place in a civilian's gun cabinet.       . . . Banning the AR-15 should not be a partisan issue.    The senseless shootings are not going to stop until we change  ourselves as a culture. I believe, with these students who have been so  strong in their statements, so determined to make a change, that time  might be now. It didn't happen after Sandy Hook Elementary. Nothing  happened. It didn't happen after the myriad of others. It didn't happen  just 2 years ago after the Orlando nightclub shooting. Again, it did  not happen after the Ft. Lauderdale airport shooting.   Is it different now? It certainly is time for us to come together and  enact commonsense gun measures to keep our communities safe. It is time  for us to come together--not as Republicans or Democrats but as human  beings--and to say that this time it is going to be different.   You hear so many different things. You hear about mental health, and  that is certainly a part of it. You hear about school protection, and  that is certainly a part of it. You hear about the miscues not only in  the FBI, and that is certainly a part of it, but the miscues in the  Florida Department of Children and Families a year prior that had noted  that this shooter--all of those things ought to be a part of the  solution. If you get right down to it, we ought to come together, not  as Republicans or Democrats but as human beings, and say that if we  want to solve the problem, the solution is commonsense background  checks in order to purchase a weapon and getting assault rifles off the  streets.   Let's do this. Let's use this tragedy as the catalyst to enact real  change in our society--changes that are going to have a real impact.  Let's make what happened at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School a  significant moment in this country's history, not because it was one of  the largest mass shootings but because it was the last.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I say to my friend from Georgia:  Hallelujah that you have expressed that heartfelt concern and that your  constituents in the State of Georgia have been very emotionally touched  by this whole incident, this terrible incident that we have gone  through again in this country. I am grateful for the comments of the  Senator from Georgia.
