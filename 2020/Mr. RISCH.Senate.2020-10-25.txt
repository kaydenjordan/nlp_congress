 Madam President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed  [[Page S6593]]  in the Record the notifications which have been received. If the cover  letter references a classified annex, then such annex is available to  all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations Committee, room SD- 423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                 Defense Security Cooperation Agency, Arlington, VA.      Hon. James E.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION  Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States       (TECRO)--RGM-84L-4 Harpoon Surface Launched Block II Missiles         TECRO has requested to buy up to one hundred (100) Harpoon       Coastal Defense Systems (HCDS) consisting of up to four       hundred (400) RGM-84L-4 Harpoon Block II Surface Launched       Missiles; and four (4) RTM-84L-4 Harpoon Block II Exercise       Missiles. Also included are four hundred and eleven (411)       containers, one hundred (100) Harpoon Coastal Defense System       Launcher Transporter Units, twenty-five (25) radar trucks,       spare and repair parts, support and test equipment,       publications and technical documentation, personnel training       and training equipment, U.S. Government and contractor       representatives' technical assistance, engineering and       logistics support services, and other related elements of       logistics support. The total estimated program cost is $2.37       billion.        This proposed sale is consistent with U.S. law and policy       as expressed in Public Law 96-8.        This proposed sale serves U.S. national, economic, and       security interests by supporting the recipient's continuing       efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a       credible defensive capability. The proposed sale will help       improve the security of the recipient and assist in       maintaining political stability, military balance, economic       and progress in the region.        This proposed sale will improve the recipient's capability       to meet current and future threats by providing a flexible       solution to augment existing surface and air defenses. The       recipient will be able to employ a highly reliable and       effective system to counter or deter maritime aggressions,       coastal blockades, and amphibious assaults. This capability       will easily integrate into existing force infrastructure. The       recipient will have no difficulty absorbing these systems       into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be The Boeing Company, St.       Louis, MO. There are no known offset agreements proposed in       connection with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will require the       assignment of two (2) U.S. contractor representatives to the       recipient for a duration of 8 years to support technical       reviews, support, and oversight.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 20-68       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The RGM-84L Harpoon Surface Launched Block II missile       system is a non-nuclear tactical weapon system. It provides a       day, night, and adverse weather, standoff air-to-surface       capability and is an effective Anti-Surface Warfare missile.       The RGM-84L incorporates components, software, and technical       design information that are considered sensitive. These       elements are essential to the ability of the Harpoon missile       to selectively engage hostile targets under a wide range of       operations, tactical and environmental conditions:         The Radar Seeker,         The Radar Altimeter,         The GPS/INS System,         Operational Flight Program Software, and         Missile operational characteristics and       performance data.        2. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       CONFIDENTIAL.        3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures or       equivalent systems, which might reduce system effectiveness       or be used in the development of a system with similar or       advanced capabilities.        4. A determination has been made that the recipient can       provide substantially the same degree of protection for the       sensitive technology being released as the U.S. Government.       This sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign       policy and national security objectives outlined in the       Policy Justification.        5. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the recipient.                            ____________________
