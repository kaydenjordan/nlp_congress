 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the millions of  Americans who rely on Medicaid for access to mental health services.  Individuals with mental illnesses and addictions were among the largest  beneficiaries of the Medicaid expansion.   The mentally ill, along with disabled, low-income families, and older  adults, will undoubtedly suffer if their coverage is reduced or taken  away entirely under the Trump administration's new guidance to cut  Medicaid funding. Block grants will shift costs to States, forcing them  to make tough decisions about what services to cut, picking the well- being and care needs of one patient population over another.   Not only is this plan unethical, it is illegal. And the American  people understand block grants would hurt some of the most vulnerable  amongst us. We cannot allow this administration to recklessly cause  such hardship.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in expressing their  disapproval of the Trump block grant plan by voting to support H. Res.  826.
