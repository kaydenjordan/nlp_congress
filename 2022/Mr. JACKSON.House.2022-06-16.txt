 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to a  serious issue facing all of rural America: the Biden administration and  the radical left's war on agriculture.   Today, the House will vote on H.R. 7606, which will exacerbate  fractured supply chains, skyrocketing input costs, and historic levels  of inflation, all of which are hammering American consumers.   This bill is the latest attempt to scapegoat private industry rather  than address the real needs and concerns of farmers, ranchers, and  rural Americans. We know the Biden administration and my colleagues  across the aisle see Americans in the oil and gas industry as the  enemy, and I truly believe they now see farmers and ranchers as the  enemy, too.   Mr. Speaker, I want my constituents back home in Texas to know that  this is something I am fighting for every day. I represent the number  one ag district in the State of Texas, and farmers and ranchers in my  district are experiencing out-of-control input costs for fertilizer,  fuel, and basic parts for equipment. I can assure you the legislation  we are voting on today will make that worse.   A spending and regulatory agenda that compounds the situation further  limits American ag industry's ability to meet global food demands is  not the answer.
