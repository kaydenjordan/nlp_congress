 Mr. President, I remember when title 42 went away--the  COVID public health order that the Border Patrol used to expel people  from the border region in the interest of public health. There were  many people who expected a surge of migration recognizing what a  moneymaking opportunity that human smuggling and drug smuggling is for  the cartels that control much of the U.S.-Mexican border.   And for a while it looked like maybe--just maybe--that surge would  not happen. But despite the administration's best efforts to downplay  or distract from the situation at the southern border, we now see the  Biden border crisis in full flower.   Preliminary data secured by the Washington Post shows that last  month--last month--a record number of migrant families illegally  crossed the southern border.   In August, the Border Patrol arrested more than 91,000 migrants--in  August--people who entered the United States as part of a family unit,  the highest number we have seen in a single month. But it is not just  the families; apprehension numbers have increased dramatically over the  past couple of months in all categories.   We have gone from just under 100,000 detentions in June to 132,000 in  July, to more than 177,000 in August. I would point out that much of  the migration we have seen into Texas has been seasonal because it has  been very hot, and it is dangerous for migrants to make the dangerous  trip from their home to our border. But that hasn't happened this year.  It got worse and worse the hotter the summer months got.   So when you include migrants processed through the ports of entry,  the Washington Post is estimating roughly 230,000 migrant encounters in  August--230,000.   This would make it the busiest month for border crossings this  calendar year. As I said, since title 42 ended in May, the Biden  administration has tried to spike the ball and declare victory. They  pointed to a temporary drop in border crossings and said this is the  proof that their situation was under their control, but that is  obviously not the case.   We have just experienced the busiest month in family crossings on  record and likely the busiest month for overall crossings this calendar  year. As the New York Times reported, in August alone, nearly 82,000  migrants passed through the Darien Gap, the sole land route to the  United States from South America, describing it as ``by far the largest  single-month total on record.''   And the border crisis isn't getting any better. If anything, it is  getting worse, and communities in Texas and those across the Nation are  beginning to feel the strain. El Paso, for example, right across the  border from Juarez, in West Texas, is in the midst of a surge in border  crossings. It is seeing an average of 1,200 encounters per day.   The leader of Rescue Mission El Paso, which provides migrants with  food, clothing, and shelter, said:         We've lost track of what capacity means. We are beyond       full.    Further down the Texas-Mexico border is Eagle Pass, which experienced  a mass crossing earlier this week. Between midnight on Sunday and  Monday morning, more than 2,200 migrants crossed illegally. That is  2,200 in 1 night. The migration surge is happening along the entire  U.S.-Mexico border, but two areas in particular are under tremendous  strain. One is the Tucson Sector, which covers most of the Arizona- Mexico border. Border crossings in this sector have been on the rise,  with agents apprehending as many as 2,000 migrants a day. This includes  migrants from all over the world, even those from Senegal.   It reminds me of, when I was in Yuma, AZ, with four Democratic  Senators and four Republican Senators, we were welcomed by the Acting  Border Patrol Chief, who said: Welcome to the Yuma Sector. Last year,  we encountered people from 174 countries, speaking more than 200  languages.   Senator Kelly, the Senator from Arizona, was there and noted that  Mexicali is a city in Northern Mexico with an airport. And so it was  explained to us that what likely was happening is that human smugglers  were facilitating the travel of migrants to Mexicali, where they could  simply Uber over to the Border Patrol and claim asylum, and the Biden  administration would make sure they were successfully deposited in the  United States of America, perhaps to await an asylum hearing that may  never occur.   Well, given the spike in border crossings, the Border Patrol--it is  no surprise--is struggling. The Agency doesn't have the facilities, the  resources, or the personnel to manage an influx this large, and,  actually, that is part of the plan.   If you are a transnational criminal organization that profits from  smuggling migrants and drugs across the border, what a tremendous idea:  Let's flood the zone with migrants, and then when the Border Patrol is  distracted or diverted elsewhere, then here come the drugs. And we saw  last year alone 108,000 Americans died of drug overdoses, 71,000 from  synthetic opioids like fentanyl.   We know where it is coming from. The precursors come from China. It  goes to Mexico. It is manufactured there, largely, to look like  traditional pharmaceuticals, but they are contaminated with fentanyl. I  was in Houston just last week, meeting with some parents who lost their  children to fentanyl poisoning. I wear on my wrist--I typically don't  wear things like this, but I have for the last 9 months. A father in  Carrollton-Farmers Branch asked me to wear this band around my wrist in  memory of his daughter who lost her life to fentanyl poisoning. It  says, among other things, ``One pill can kill.''   Now, the children who die of fentanyl poisoning, they don't know they  are taking fentanyl. They think it is maybe something more innocuous,  and that is part of the insidiousness of what the cartels are  doing. They are using industrial-sized pill presses to make it look  like things that certainly wouldn't kill you. Maybe it is not optimal,  things like Xanax or Percocet or some other pharmaceutical drug, but,  in fact, it is counterfeit and contaminated with fentanyl. And as I  said, 71,000 Americans died last year alone as a result of synthetic  opioid poisoning.    So the Border Patrol can't keep up with the flooding of the zone, and  here come the drugs, only to be distributed across the country in each  of our communities by various criminal gangs. Well, because the Border  Patrol can't keep up with the influx of people, they simply are now  releasing them. That is right. Instead of returning them across the  border, they are releasing them onto U.S. streets every day.   And it is unclear, really, who these individuals are or how they are  being released. How many of these migrants are asylum seekers who have  completed a credible fear screening? How many are simply being paroled  into the country with flimsy instructions and told to appear at an ICE  office, Immigrations and Customs office, in the interior at their  destination.   How many are given a date to appear before an immigration judge, and  how far away is that court date? I read recently in New York, an  immigration court date could be as far as 10 years off. We don't have  answers to these questions because the Biden administration has not  been candid about exactly what is happening.   They basically have hoped nobody is noticing what is going on, but we  are noticing. And, oh, by the way, people like the Governor in  Massachusetts, the mayors of New York City, of Chicago, and Washington,  DC, they are noticing because these migrants, once they pass the border  region, they go somewhere, and what we are seeing is the impact on  cities very far away from the southern border.   Well, the Biden administration keeps sweeping the problem under the  rug and expecting us not to ask questions and conduct appropriate  oversight. Last week alone, agents released 100 to  [[Page S4578]]  200 migrants a day near Nogales, AZ. The Tucson Sector is not alone.  San Diego is also seeing a spike in border crossings. Last week,  Customs and Border Protection closed one of two pedestrian crossings at  the San Ysidro Port of Entry so personnel could help with the migration  surge.   Again, the Border Patrol doesn't have the space or the personnel to  accommodate the flood of humanity coming across. Videos show hundreds  of migrants are being released into the streets and sidewalks of San  Diego, including migrants from as far away as Pakistan and China.   Now, one of the things that amazes me, when President Biden appointed  Vice President Kamala Harris as the border czar, she claimed that all  of the flow of illegal immigration was as a result of local  circumstances in Mexico or South America and as if we couldn't fix our  border problems without basically nation building in one of those  states. But either she does not understand or is unwilling to  acknowledge that this is a global phenomenon. And who can blame some of  these people coming across? If you think, Well, for a few thousand  bucks, maybe I can make my way into the United States and stay there-- well, maybe it is a good bet.   But it is a disaster when our immigration system is basically handed  over to transnational criminal organizations that care nothing about  the people and that care nothing about the drugs that are coming  across; all they care about is the money. And they are getting richer  by the day as a result of Biden border policies.   Well, if there was any question about whether the Biden  administration understands what is going on, recently, a migrant asked  an agent if he could travel to Chicago, and the agent replied:         You can do whatever you want. You're free.    That is the Biden administration's border enforcement policies.         You can do whatever you want. You're free.    If there was any confusion about the Biden administration's catch- and-release policies, well, that statement cleared it up.         You can do whatever you want. You're free.    This interaction happened to be captured on video, and it has made  the rounds on social media and national news. And it has been viewed by  people around the world. And, you know, when other people see that, do  you think they are discouraged or deterred from coming to the United  States through this illegal route? No. They are encouraged. It is like  a magnet, which is why we are seeing the huge numbers that we continue  to see.   Again, it makes me think the Biden administration simply does not  understand the dynamics at the border or, which is more likely the  case, they simply don't care. You have to imagine there are people out  there who are debating whether or not to make this dangerous journey.   If they had any doubts about whether or not their journey would be  successful, well, this video statement pretty much cleared that up. The  secret is out.   You know, it is ironic when I hear Secretary Mayorkas of the  Department of Homeland Security or the President or the Vice President  say: ``Don't come. Don't come,'' when almost every other message that  people around the world are receiving is ``Come. You can make it. Just  pay the money; take the dangerous journey; take the risk; pay these  criminal organizations the cash they demand; and you can make it into  the United States.''   And, boy, have they come. People around the world see that America's  borders are open. They see videos of migrants from all over the world  being released in the United States and told ``you're free.''   The Biden administration continues to create new incentives for  migrants to make the dangerous journey to the border. President Biden  has proven he is not only incapable of addressing this crisis, he is  completely uninterested. He doesn't care. He apparently has no desire  to enforce the law and secure the border. And the reason I conclude  that is because if he did care, if he were willing to work with us to  solve that problem, we are here ready to meet him halfway, but all we  hear are crickets.   He would rather appease the open borders base in his political party  than take the steps needed to protect the American people.   Border communities have endured the Biden border crisis for more than  2\1/2\ years now, and they are bracing for yet another migration surge.   Given the administration's complete and utter failure to address the  crisis, it is time for Congress to step up. I am proud to cosponsor the  Secure the Border Act, which was introduced by my friend and fellow  Texan, Senator Cruz. This legislation would give the Border Patrol the  tools they need in order to secure the border and safeguard the  American people. It includes more agents to enforce the law to stop  anyone or anything that doesn't legally enter the United States.   It restricts the Biden administration's ability to release thousands  of migrants into the United States under the weak guise of parole. This  is not parole in the criminal law sense where somebody is released from  jail. This is a mechanism under our immigration laws where people are  simply released and told: You have 2 years in the United States, and  come back and check with us later on about staying longer. There is no  such thing as a temporary program. All of this becomes permanent.   But this legislation tightens asylum standards that prevent migrants  with frivolous asylum claims from gaming the system. This legislation  implements a range of reforms that address the humanitarian and  security crisis at the border. It passed the House in May and has been  cosponsored by more than half of the Republican conference in the  Senate.   My hope was that this would serve as a starting point for the Senate  to begin discussing ways to secure the border and protect the American  people. It would also be nice--and I have had this conversation with  the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, on which I serve, the  Senator from Illinois, who so far has declined to consider a markup of  any immigration bills or border security bills. In the Senate, that is  the committee of jurisdiction on which I sit, and I happen to be the  ranking member of the Immigration and Border Security Subcommittee.   Well, it is clear that President Biden's approach to the border is  not sustainable. His administration has rolled out one incentive after  another to encourage--not discourage, not deter, but to encourage-- people from around the world to come to our borders and enter our  country.   That is the reason we are experiencing a humanitarian and security  crisis. The record migration levels of the last year have tested law  enforcement, tested our cities and nonprofits in ways that I have never  seen before--a record number of migrants, soaring demands for  resources, dwindling budgets, overworked personnel--and we haven't even  talked about the impact of this uncontrolled migration on our local  hospitals and our education systems and the like. All of them have been  operating under incredible strain for more than 2 years. So it is past  time to adopt policies that impose consequences. That is what the  Border Patrol said we need, is we need consequences to illegal  immigration.   Look, I think that legal immigration--orderly, humane legal  immigration--has been one of the greatest things that America has ever  embraced. It has made us the country we are today, the most prosperous  in the world, the most diverse. But surrendering our legal immigration  system to drug cartels and human smuggling organizations is a recipe  for disaster--what we are seeing right now.   Well, any time the Biden administration would like to engage on this  topic, I am standing ready, willing, and able to do that, but so far,  even when we have bipartisan legislation like the Bipartisan Border  Solutions Act that Senator Sinema and I and Congressman Cuellar and  Congressman Tony Gonzales introduced a couple of years ago, there has  been zero interest by the Biden administration and no markups in the  Judiciary Committee simply to consider that and come up with some  consensus on how to deal with this disaster.   I yield the floor.  [[Page S4579]]
