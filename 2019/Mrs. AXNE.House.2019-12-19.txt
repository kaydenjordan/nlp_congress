 Madam Speaker, today, a lot of hard work is paying off  with the passage of USMCA.   I thank my colleagues who crafted this agreement that gives market  stability to farmers, protects Iowa workers from having their wages  undercut, and helps reduce the high cost of biologic drugs. It even has  important environmental protections.   I know my farmers, producers, and agriculture workers are celebrating  the passage of USMCA today.   Everywhere I go, the message has been clear: We need USMCA because of  uncertainty in our markets.   We now have that deal.   The House has done a great job, but the Senate already said they  won't take up this agreement anytime soon.   It will pass today with bipartisan support. Whenever the Senate  chooses to bring it up, it will pass with bipartisan support then, as  well. The same Senators who have blamed the House for not moving this  forward quickly enough are now stopping the USMCA from becoming law.   Iowans and Americans are asking for help, and we must get this deal  done.   I am proud to have fought for a better trade agreement that works for  Iowa, and I encourage those of us to vote for it in the House and for  the Senate to take it up for a vote to make life better for people  across the country.
