 Mr. President, had there been a recorded vote, I would  have voted ``No'' on S. Res. 490, ``a resolution recognizing the  essential work of United States Capitol personnel on the anniversary of  the insurrectionist attack on the United States Capitol on January 6,  2021.''   I am grateful for the service of all Capitol personnel who come to  work every day to help operate the workings of Congress and keep  Members safe. However, this resolution has been written to score cheap  partisan political points. It attacks Republicans for their response to  COVID-19, and it contains falsehoods, such as the incorrect assertion  that the riot at the Capitol on January 6, 2021 was perpetuated by  ``violent insurrectionists.'' Not a single person from that day has  been charged with the crime of insurrection. If we are going to honor  Capitol Hill workers--and we should--we must do so in a manner that  focuses on their service to their nation, not on false narratives that  are meant to divide us.   I support Capitol personnel but oppose this resolution as written.                            ____________________
