 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to honor Major James M.  Brophy, a marine from Staatsburg who lost his life while serving our  country and was laid to rest this past Friday.   Major Brophy was a decorated combat veteran who served in Afghanistan  as well as Japan. He dedicated his life to our Nation, and he was a  devoted father, husband, and son.   This is a tremendous loss to not only his family but to the entire  Dutchess County community, and he serves as an example to all of us.   My thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends, and I offer  my sympathy, support, and gratitude for his selfless service to our  country.                            ____________________
