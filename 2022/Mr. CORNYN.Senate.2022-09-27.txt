 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, this week, the Senate has one extremely  important item on our agenda: to keep the lights on; in other words, to  pass a government funding bill. We are just 3 days from the end of the  fiscal year, and the Democrat-controlled Senate has yet to pass a  single appropriations bill--no funding for our military, no funding for  veterans services, no funding for border security, nothing.   Now, this deadline does not sneak up out of nowhere; it arrives on  the same day every year. Yet here we are, 3 days before the funding  expires, and not a single appropriations bill has been voted on.   The majority leader conceded a long time ago that the regular  appropriations bills would be punted to a later date and we would pass  a short-term funding bill to bridge the gap. As a general rule, I am  not a fan of short-term funding bills. They don't provide the stability  or predictability we need to plan for the future. That is especially  true for America's military, which is operating in a dynamic threat  environment with countless unknowns. In order to plan for and prepare  for the future, government Agencies need a predictable budget, and  stopgap bills simply don't cut it.   As though this last-minute funding gambit isn't dramatic enough, the  majority leader has raised the stakes even higher. He is not putting a  clean funding bill on the floor; he is weighing it down with partisan  freight. This is part of a political horse trade that happened a couple  of months ago. In order to get the senior Senator from West Virginia to  vote for his reckless tax-and-spending bill, the majority leader  promised to attach permitting reform to the government funding bill.  Forget the fact that Senator Manchin's permitting bill was nowhere near  complete; the majority leader blindly agreed to tack it on to must-pass  legislation.   Senator Manchin, the senior Senator from West Virginia, finally  released his bill last week, and it became clear why he was so  desperate to attach it to a must-pass continuing resolution. That is  because the bill doesn't even come close to delivering the real  commonsense changes that were promised. The provisions meant to speed  up the approval process for new projects lack teeth, making them  unlikely to produce any real progress.   The bill doesn't touch the environmental reviews, which cause a lot  of delays to happen in the first place. On top of that, it is a power  grab by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, granting them  unprecedented authority to force electric transmission lines on States.  Under the current law, States have the authority to decide whether or  not to grant transmission lines to run through their States. It is part  of something called State sovereignty, federalism. Under this bill,  that would change, though. The unelected leaders at the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission could override a State's objection to a new  project transmitting renewable energy.   In short, if a State like Illinois needs a new interstate  transmission line to help meet its clean energy mandates, its neighbors  will have no choice but to oblige. It will be forced on them. Folks in  Indiana or Ohio or any other State could be forced to help subsidize  the costs of Illinois' renewable energy. This is a far cry from the  kind of commonsense permitting reform that Senator Manchin has been  talking about.   This bill falls short in almost every regard, which is why we have  seen such broad bipartisan opposition. There aren't many Energy bills  where my vote aligns with that of the junior Senator from Vermont,  Senator Sanders, but this is one of them.   Despite the strong opposition to Senator Manchin's bill, the majority  is still moving forward with a procedural vote this evening. He knows  it will fail. It will not succeed. Then, Senator Schumer, the majority  leader, will have a choice: pass a clean funding bill to keep the  lights on, to keep government open, or shut down the government over  their reckless tax-and-spending spree deal cut behind closed doors last  summer.   If you remember, a couple of months ago, at the same time he  professed publicly and privately that the disastrous, radical tax-and- spending spree bill was dead, the senior Senator from West Virginia was  negotiating a sweetheart deal in secret, unbeknownst to Republicans  and, by the way, unbeknownst to all Democrats other than the majority  leader. Fast-forward to today. When that deal falls apart this evening,  he will need to abandon his secret deal with Senator Schumer.   For our country's sake, I hope the majority leader and Senator  Manchin won't shut down the government. With so much economic  uncertainty already, the last thing we need is a government shutdown.                                 Legislation    Madam President, this is the last week the House of Representatives  will be in session until after the election. Once the Chamber gavels  out at the end of the week, Members will go home, and they won't return  until November 14. That doesn't leave a lot of time to accomplish the  work of the American people. In fact, after this week, the House is  scheduled to only be in session for 4 more weeks this year.   As my colleagues here in the Senate know, the House has a lot to do  and not a lot of time to do it. Since the start of the Congress, the  Senate has passed a long list of bipartisan bills that are still  awaiting action in the House. Many of these bills passed this Chamber  unanimously and will provide critical support for our communities.   Here is just one example. Last year, Senator Padilla, the junior  Senator from California, and I introduced a bill to support  infrastructure and disaster relief projects all across the country. Our  bill would open up billions of dollars for States and local governments  to put toward their most critical projects without adding a penny to  the deficit. That is because the money that would be freed up has  already been appropriated for COVID-19 relief but is in excess of what  the States and local governments need for that purpose. Our bill would  take the handcuffs off and allow them to spend that money if they want.  They are not required to do so, but if they want, they can spend up to  one-third of their excess funds on infrastructure or disaster relief,  and it doesn't add another penny to the deficit.    Over the last year and a half, I have heard from leaders all across  my State of Texas who are frustrated about the handcuffs that have been  put on them when it comes to spending the money that Congress had  appropriated for COVID-19 relief. Senator Padilla told me he is hearing  the same thing from leaders in California. So we got to work. We spoke  with folks in our States as well as our Senate colleagues and  administration officials, and we came up with legislation that was  simple but very effective in providing that sort of flexibility that  our local communities and our States have asked for.   With some places, that means pandemic-related expenses, which will  [[Page S5042]]  take the priority. Our legislation won't interfere with any plans to  spend that money on already-approved pandemic expenses, but it will  give the States and localities without that need the option to invest  those funds in infrastructure projects.   Usually, what happens here in Washington is the U.S. Congress  appropriates money, and it literally takes a couple of years to get the  money from DC down to places like Austin, TX, where the Texas  legislators can then figure out how to disburse those funds. Now, we  know they already have the money in their hands, but they simply can't  use it because of the restrictions placed on those funds.   Senator Padilla's and my bill would remove those restrictions for  important purposes, like infrastructure and like disaster relief;  things like widening highways, constructing bridges, extending  railways, expanding broadband. Our bill includes a long list of  qualifying expenses.   It also will allow leaders to put their funding toward disaster  relief, which is a major need in areas all across the country. Places  like Texas and Kentucky, for example, have experienced devastating  flooding in the last few months. Puerto Rico, we know, has just been  hit by a terrible hurricane and is still trying to restore power.  Florida is bracing for impact of Hurricane Ian as it makes its way to  the gulf coast. California continues to battle destructive wildfires.   Our bill would allow leaders to open up disaster relief funds  virtually instantly, as soon as the President signs the bill into law.  They already have the funding in hand. They won't have to wait for a  Federal disaster declaration or emergency funding from Congress; they  could write the check themselves and mobilize resources  instantaneously. It is no surprise this bill passed the Senate 100 to  0. It was unanimous.   These are the sorts of commonsense things that will benefit  communities all across the United States. This bill will open up tens  of millions of dollars for infrastructure projects in communities all  across the country, and it will support critical disaster relief  efforts as well. It will empower State and local leaders to make the  best decisions for their communities. It will ensure that this funding  can deliver on its intended purpose, which is to alleviate the  financial burden imposed by the pandemic on our State and local  governments. I hope Speaker Pelosi will bring up and pass this bill as  quickly as possible. It would help her State of California, but more  importantly, it would help the entire country.   But this is just one of many bipartisan bills that are currently  sitting in the House since the start of Congress--the Senate's  unanimously approved bills that I have introduced to prevent and  identify child sexual abuse; to provide incarcerated individuals with  access to treatment for their substance use disorder; to facilitate  more cross-border trade with our neighbors to the north and the south;  to support programs and help individuals experiencing mental health  crises; to provide tax relief to survivors of human trafficking; to  equip law enforcement officers with the tools they need in order to  help people in crisis.   It would be a shame if the Speaker declined to bring these bills up  and pass them. I am sure they would pass by overwhelming votes in the  U.S. House of Representatives, as they did here in the Senate. But the  House is only scheduled to be in session a few more weeks this  Congress. It is time to get moving on these commonsense,  noncontroversial, nonpartisan bills. Otherwise, we will have to start  back at square one next year.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
