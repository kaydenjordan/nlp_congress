 Madam President, I rise today to honor RDML Richard T.  Brennan, Jr., of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,  NOAA, Commissioned Corps, one of our Nation's eight uniformed services.  Admiral Brennan most recently served as the Director of the Office of  Coast Survey, one of America's oldest bureaus, created by Thomas  Jefferson in 1807 to produce nautical charts to help the Nation with  safe shipping, national defense, and maritime boundaries.  Unfortunately, Admiral Brennan passed  [[Page S3418]]  away suddenly on May 13, 2021, due to complications from surgery. He  was 52 years old.   Former leaders of the storied ``Survey of the Coast,'' going back to  the first superintendent, Ferdinand R. Hassler, were either impeccable  surveyors, expert scientists, ingenious engineers, master shiphandlers,  intrepid explorers, or visionary risk-takers. With 27 years of diverse  experience and a constant desire to learn more, Admiral Brennan  embodied all of those qualities and more. He served on nearly every  hydrographic ship in NOAA's fleet, surveying the East Coast, Caribbean  territories, the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Coast into remote areas  of Alaska, even mapping far into the Arctic Ocean to support the U.S.'s  Law of the Sea claim. Whether discovering a new, uncharted seamount  deep in the Chukchi Sea or uncovering the sunken remains of a lost  locomotive tender car off the tidal banks of the Piscataqua River,  Admiral Brennan's endless enthusiasm for mapping our oceans and coasts  was infectious to all who sailed with him.   During his various land assignments, Admiral Brennan provided  valuable technical direction to the many physical scientists,  hydrographers, cartographers, and officers who worked for him while  leading change to pull charting services ever more into the digital  age. He served as a reliable resource to various maritime stakeholders  and other Federal Agencies, using his effective interpersonal skills to  bring NOAA assets to bear in addressing their concerns. He notably  earned the NOAA Corps Commendation Medal and the Department of Commerce  Group Silver Medal for his service during Hurricane Irene by  coordinating NOAA resources to quickly reopen the port of Norfolk, a  waterway that is as vital for national security as it is for global  commerce. I am proud to point out that along the way, he earned a  master's degree in ocean engineering at the University of New  Hampshire's esteemed Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping.   However, Admiral Brennan's stellar career is not what endeared  himself to so many or what makes his passing so devastating. He was an  exemplary civil servant and leader, and he is remembered as the person  whom so many were grateful to work alongside during their own careers.  People across the country remember Admiral Brennan for his empathy, wry  humor, generosity, friendship, and humanity. Many sought his guidance  on personal matters as much as they did on professional challenges, and  he went out of his way for them, seeking out the struggling colleague  to cheer them up with his warm wit or changing plans to chat over a  commiserating meal. The task at hand was important to Admiral Brennan,  but he never looked past the people around him, putting them first. My  thoughts are with NOAA and the maritime community, knowing that his  loss has created a hole in the hearts of all who were fortunate to know  him.   More importantly, my deepest sympathies go out to his wife Tracey and  his two sons, Ty and Sam, who lost a wonderful husband and loving  father far too soon. By all accounts, Admiral Brennan's family were  front and center in his life, and they never left his thoughts,  especially when he was away in support of NOAA's mission.   On behalf of all the people of New Hampshire, I ask my colleagues and  all Americans to join me in honoring Admiral Brennan for his  leadership, integrity, and dedicated years of service to this grateful  Nation. May he rest in peace.                            ____________________
