 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to one of the amendments made in  order  [[Page H4154]]  by this rule. The Foxx-Davis amendment would dramatically alter  American sugar policy by eliminating the economic safety net for sugar  producers.   There is a Domino Sugar Refinery located in my district in Yonkers,  New York, which has been a staple of the neighborhood for almost a  century. According to their own figures, the refinery employs 280  people and sustains an additional 138 jobs through trucking, terminal  operations, cargo handling, and ship piloting. That is more than 400  local jobs, most of them union jobs, supporting local families and  pumping additional dollars into our communities.   These are the men and women I represent, and they are the ones for  whom I cast my vote. I will cast my vote against the Foxx-Davis  amendment and encourage my colleagues to do the same.   America's sugar policy is working. It has operated at zero cost to  taxpayers in 14 of the past 15 years, and the U.S. Department of  Agriculture projects that sugar will run at a zero cost to taxpayers  over the next 10 years.   According to the International Sugar Organization, food manufacturers  in the U.S. pay 10 percent less for sugar than other developed  countries. Meanwhile, America's grocery shelf sugar prices are among  the lowest in the world.   Again, most importantly, the reason I rise is that the U.S. sugar  industry provides good union jobs. Without the current sugar policy,  142,000 American jobs are in jeopardy of being outsourced, and the U.S.  stands to lose nearly $20 billion in annual economic activity.
