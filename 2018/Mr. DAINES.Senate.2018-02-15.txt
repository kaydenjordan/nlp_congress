 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Blackfeet Community College, BCC. By 2020, BCC hopes to  produce 40 certified teachers for Montana, and these teachers will be  able to integrate Blackfeet culture into their classrooms.   BCC is operated exclusively for nonprofit purposes, ensuring that  postsecondary and higher educational services are provided to the  community. BCC students, staff and board of trustees have adopted core  values that recognize the way our interactions with others effect our  value and thought systems. The first core value is the Blackfeet Way of  Knowing, which means Blackfeet culture/spirituality in philosophy,  thought, and action.   BCC is raising up leaders of tomorrow who are rooted in the Blackfeet  culture and heritage, a heritage that is known for traditional singing,  drumming, and dancing, as well as stick games and rodeos.   Thank you, BCC, for your continued dedication to creating the  thoughtful and values-driven Montana teachers and leaders of  tomorrow.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
