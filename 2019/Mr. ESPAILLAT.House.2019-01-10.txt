 Mr. Speaker, President Trump has threatened to build  his wall and has put out of work over 800,000 Americans through his  Trump shutdown, and just today he doubled down on a threat to declare a  national emergency so he could usurp Congress and trample on our  Constitution.   These bully tactics may have worked running his business, but they  will not work running our country.   Let me promise the American people right now, Democrats in Congress  will fight and disallow Trump to waste your hard-earned taxpayer  dollars on his ridiculous wall. That is why I have introduced  legislation to stop the wall.   My This Land Is Our Land Act will counter the many threats Trump has  made to get his medieval and ineffective wall: It won't allow him to  build it on public land; it won't allow him to take away people's  private land by using eminent domain; and, most importantly, it won't  allow him to use fake national emergencies.   So let me finish by paraphrasing Ronald Reagan: Mr. Trump, give up  your wall.    Mr. Speaker, I want to first thank the gentlewoman and  the Progressive Caucus for organizing this very important Special Order  hour. It is an important opportunity for us to share stories about how  the Trump shutdown is causing real damage in many of our communities  and to remind the American people that President Trump is holding  government hostage not for some noble cause, but for his petulant  demand for an unnecessary and medieval border wall.                                time  1830    There are 14,000 Federal workers in New York State whose pay has been  impacted by this Trump shutdown, but I will share the story of one of  my constituents.   This is the reality of a constituent from the 13th Congressional  District, someone I have the privilege to represent and know. That  person is a NASA employee who, along with dozens of her colleagues, has  been furloughed due to the Trump shutdown.   Most Americans are unaware that NASA operates and conducts some of  the most important climate change research in New York City through  NASA labs right in the heart of New York City.   My constituent's work is even more critical now than ever before, as  our global climate is in its most fragile state, with record-shattering  hurricanes pounding the Caribbean. We saw how Hurricane Maria ravaged  through the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico and the Gulf Coast of our  country, as well as the massive wildfires burning throughout California  and other parts of the West Coast.   My constituent and her fellow workers, dedicated researchers, conduct  observational-based climate assessment. Now, because of the Trump  shutdown, these crucial studies will stop.   The intensive models they build explain past climate behavior and  help us predict future climate conditions so we can be better prepared  in the future.   This is not surprising, Mr. Speaker, because many of the folks around  the  [[Page H453]]  White House believe that climate change is a hoax, that it doesn't  exist at all.   These researchers that have been furloughed are so necessary for the  future of our Nation and our planet. Their periodic reports are  essential for understanding our climate and how it is changing.   In a response from agencies that seems almost like a cruel joke,  furloughed Federal workers, like my constituent, have been encouraged  to get creative, to budget closely. They have been asked that perhaps  they could make ends meet if they baby-sit or if they have garage  sales.   This is the message that these agencies have given to some of the  furloughed workers across the country, but too many in our Federal  workforce simply cannot afford to miss a loan payment, a utility bill,  their rent, their mortgage.   This President simply doesn't understand just how hard it is for  working class people and middle class people. As Speaker Pelosi aptly  put it, President Trump doesn't understand that working people cannot  ask their dad or their mom for money.   This whole situation is unacceptable. And just like President Trump  said when he accepted the Republican nomination back in 2016, he alone  can fix this. He created this crisis.   I bring this here to show the American people who is crossing the  border. I went down to the border in New Mexico, and I saw moms and  little children running away from violence, from hunger, running away  from natural disasters, sleeping on a cold, dirty, dingy floor, packed  like sardines.   We are a better country. We are a better America.   We ask you, Mr. President: Give up your wall. Give up your wall and  reopen government. Free the 800,000 Federal workers you have held  hostage in this manufactured, fictitious security crisis.   This is the moment, this is the time. Mr. Speaker, we must fight  back, we must reopen government. We will not give in to the wall.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me.
