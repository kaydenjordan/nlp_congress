 Mr. President, I rise to introduce the bipartisan  ``Salton Sea Projects Improvement Act'' to expand the Bureau of  Reclamation's ability to participate and invest in projects at the  Salton Sea.   This legislation would ensure Reclamation can meaningfully partner  with state, local, and Tribal governments to address both the public  health and environmental crises at the Salton Sea.   Under current law, the Bureau of Reclamation is only able to engage  in projects that have a research focus. This means that Reclamation can  only engage in projects to research how to protect habitat, enhance  fisheries, enhance recreational opportunities, or control salinity.  Reclamation also operates under a $10 million authorization.   This effectively prohibits Reclamation from participating in the  Salton Sea Management Program run by California.   This legislation would expand Reclamation's authority so they can  participate in large-scale projects, even if they don't have a research  focus. Projects could improve air and water quality, restore fish and  wildlife habitat, and improve public health at the Salton Sea. It would  also increase Reclamation's authorization for Salton Sea efforts from  $10 million to $250 million.   The Salton Sea, located in southern Riverside and northern Imperial  counties, is California's largest inland body of water. It formed after  Colorado River floodwater breached an irrigation canal and flowed into  the Salton Sink.   The current Salton Sea maintains water levels from irrigation runoff  but has been shrinking for many years. The water has become  increasingly salty, so much so that its salinity is 50% higher than the  Pacific Ocean. This has led to major water quality issues with  [[Page S6283]]  devastating impacts to the Salton Sea's ecosystem, which serves as  critical habitat for migratory waterfowl and other species.   But this ecological crisis has even more widespread impacts. The  declining water levels have also exposed wide swaths of lakebed at the  Salton Sea, polluting the air with dust and pesticides. The largely  disadvantaged communities who live nearby suffer from toxic, poisonous  air and experience higer levels of related health conditions like  asthma.   It is an environmental and public health crisis, and we need to  ensure that the Bureau of Reclamation has the authority it need to  partner with the State of California, Tribal and local governments, and  nonprofits to adequately address these crises.   I thank Senator Feinstein for co-leading this bill with me, and for  her decades of efforts at the Salton Sea. I also thank Congressmen Ruiz  and Vargas for their relentless leadership to address this  environmental hazard.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass the bipartisan  ``Salton Sea Projects Improvements Act'' as quickly as possible.   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to introduce the bipartisan  ``Salton Sea Projects Improvement Act'' to expand the Bureau of  Reclamation's ability to participate and invest in projects at the  Salton Sea.
