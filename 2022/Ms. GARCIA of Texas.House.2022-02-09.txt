 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the  critical need for Congress to act to improve our Nation's supply chain  issues.   Last week, the House took a big step to make sure that the products  we rely on are available for all Americans by passing the America  COMPETES Act.   The pandemic turned all of our lives upside down. What that  disruption revealed are longstanding problems in how much we rely on  foreign manufacturing and foreign ingenuity.   House Democrats have taken bold, decisive action to authorize $45  billion to fix these issues.   We will build more critical components right here in America.   We will strengthen our national security by cultivating domestic  sources and investing in American workers.   And we will never again face shortages of goods needed for the safety  and health of our communities across America.                            ____________________
