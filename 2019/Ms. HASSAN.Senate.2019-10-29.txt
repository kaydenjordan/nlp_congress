 Mr. President, first, I thank my colleague, the  distinguished Senator from Washington, for her leadership on the issue  of providing healthcare to all Americans. In a democracy where everyone  counts, everyone should have access to high quality, affordable care.   I rise today to discuss the Trump administration's efforts to  undermine our health insurance system and scam healthcare consumers by  allowing harmful health plans to be sold to unsuspecting, vulnerable  Americans.   Since the President's first day in office, his administration has  taken measure after measure that makes it harder for patients to access  necessary care, weakens our healthcare system, and increases costs.   This latest effort to expand access to what are appropriately  referred to as ``junk'' health insurance plans would allow insurance  companies to discriminate against Americans who experience preexisting  conditions and would also leave patients with higher healthcare costs  and worse insurance coverage.   Junk plans don't cover even basic benefits, such as prescription  drugs, substance use disorder treatment, or maternity care. People  often don't realize how inadequate these plans are until they are in  the middle of a medical crisis.   Unless you can guarantee that you will never get sick, never break a  limb, or never get into an accident, these plans are a bad deal for  you. We all know that life doesn't come with those guarantees, and when  the worse does happen, when illness or injury strikes, these plans are,  more often than not, barely worth the paper they are written on.   This can lead to two very bad outcomes. The first is that the patient  chooses to receive the critical care they need, but, because the short- term junk plan doesn't cover the care, the patient ends up being stuck  with an incredibly high out-of-pocket medical bill, or the patient,  upon learning that the junk plan doesn't cover critical care, chooses  not to get the care they need, which leads to adverse outcomes or an  unplanned trip to the emergency room, the cost of which may be footed  by the taxpayer.   If you are someone with a preexisting condition, such as asthma,  diabetes, or cancer, you could be charged more, sometimes truly  astronomical amounts, for insurance that will not even cover many of  your most basic benefits or you can be denied certain benefits  altogether.   If that sounds familiar, it is because it is the same situation  people with preexisting conditions were in before the passage of the  Affordable Care Act. That is why I am calling on all of my colleagues  on both sides of the aisle to vote to repeal the Trump administration's  rule that authorizes these junk plans, threatening protections for  millions of Americans with preexisting conditions and increasing  healthcare costs all across the board.   If there is one thing that Republicans and Democrats should all agree  on, it is that we must ensure that people with preexisting conditions  are protected and that they can be covered--people like Bernadette  Clark of Manchester, whose youngest son is living with cerebral palsy,  a complex medical condition, and would not have access to the type of  health insurance that she and her family need if not for the  protections that the Affordable Care Act afforded to people with  preexisting conditions.   Doctors, nurses, hospitals, and patients universally oppose these  junk plans because they know how dangerous these plans are for the  health and well-being of our people.   I urge every Senator to stand with Granite Staters and all Americans  in opposing the Trump administration's latest attack on our healthcare  system.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, today I would like to recognize  the birthday of U.S. Navy Seaman 2nd Class Martin Roy of Manchester NH.  Mr. Roy was born on November 11, 1914, in Armagh, Canada, a day that  would become Armistice Day in 1918 and was later renamed to Veterans  Day in 1954. Mr. Roy moved to the United States as a teenager and  worked in the mills in Lowell, MS as a mechanical repairman.   In 1943, Mr. Roy enlisted in the U.S. Navy and served during World  War II. He was onboard the USS Franklin, also known as Big Ben, on  March 19, 1945, when a Japanese pilot dropped two bombs on the ship.  The bombs caused explosions and fires that triggered ammunition, bombs,  and rockets. Along with 700 surviving crewmembers, Mr. Roy helped throw  the remaining explosives overboard and saved the ship. When he was  honorably discharged in 1945, Mr. Roy received a letter of thanks  signed by James Forrestal, then Secretary of the Navy who would later  become the first Secretary of Defense.   On February 22, 1946, Mr. Roy married Louise Boutin, whom he had met  while working in the mills. They had two children, Paul and Cecile, and  moved to Suncook, NH in the early 1950s.   Mr. Roy took a job at the Suncook Mills and, using his mechanical  skills, he, along with a friend developed a patent to repair looms in  the mill. In addition, for many years Mr. Roy owned and operated two  convenience stores, one in Lowell and another Suncook. A man of many  interests, Mr. Roy also trained thoroughbred horses over a nearly 20- year period and traveled the New England circuit, owning eight  [[Page S6240]]  horses at one time. Upon his so-called retirement, Mr. Roy worked part  time as a janitor and repairman in the local bank, never ceasing to  work hard and give back to his community.   Mr. President, I hope you will join me in wishing a dedicated,  patriotic, and multi-talented Granite Stater, Martin Roy, a very Happy  105th birthday.                            ____________________
