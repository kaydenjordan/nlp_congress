 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Madam Chair, I rise today to offer an  amendment to H.R. 1585, the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act  of 2019.   Madam Chair, rape is a crisis in this country. In the United States,  one in five women will be raped in their lifetime--one in five. Men can  be rape victims, too. As a matter of fact, 1 in 71 men will be raped.   The LGBTQ community suffers from even higher rates of sexual violence  and rape. Forty-six percent of bisexual women have been raped, and 47  percent of transgender individuals have been assaulted at some point in  their lives. These statistics are more severe for people of color in  the LGBTQ community. What is worse is that many LGBTQ victims are  denied services simply because of their sexual orientation or gender  identity.   Whether we know it or not, everyone in this room knows a rape  survivor. Maybe she or he is the barista who makes your morning coffee.                                time  1545    Maybe she or he is a security officer who smiles at you on your way  to work. Maybe he or she is your coworker, your sibling, your partner,  or your child. Many people don't realize that they know a rape  survivor.   Too often, rape isn't reported because victims fear the consequences.  Often survivors fear that no one will believe them or that they will be  blamed or stigmatized. In the #MeToo era, the pervasiveness of sexual  assault has come to the forefront. However, the public is still  grappling with our understanding of rape, the myth versus reality.   Many people still think that rape is only an act committed by a  stranger in a dark alley. Instances like this do happen. In 2016, Brock  Turner raped an unconscious young woman behind a dumpster. His  punishment? Three months in jail. This sentencing alone reflects the  failure to understand rape and a tendency to blame the victim.   Our comprehension of rape has changed dramatically in the past  decade. Instances of rape being perpetrated by strangers do happen, but  eight out of ten rape survivors knew their rapist. The majority of  female survivors were raped by an intimate partner.   While there is plenty of data on VAWA grants administered by the  Office of Violence Against Women, an analysis by the Congressional  Research Service found that there is insufficient information on RPE  formula grants run by the CDC.   To prevent rape and create innovative trauma-informed policies and  programs, we need to improve our understanding of which initiatives are  effective. My amendment will bridge this information gap and help  better inform our rape prevention efforts. My amendment requires the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to provide a report to  Congress on the activity of grant awardees funded through the Rape  Prevention and Education Grant Program as well as on emerging and best  practices relating to rape prevention and education.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I would like to thank the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Bass), the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee), and Chairman Nadler for introducing H.R. 1585, the  Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2019, and I urge its  swift passage.   Lastly, Madam Chair, I would ask that this amendment be made in  order, and I yield back the balance of my time.
