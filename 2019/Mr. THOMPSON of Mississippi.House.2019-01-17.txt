 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and concur in the Senate amendments to the bill (H.R. 251) to extend by  two years the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards Program of the  Department of Homeland Security, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the Senate amendments is as follows:   Senate amendments         On page 2, line 10, striking [``6 years''] and insert ``5       years and 3 months''.        Amend the title so as to read: ``An Act to extend by 15       months the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards Program       of the Department of Homeland Security, and for other       purposes.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, last week, I came to the floor with Democratic and  Republican leaders of the Homeland Security and Energy and Commerce  Committees to urge the House to take urgent action to prevent  termination of the Department of Homeland Security's Chemical  Facilities Anti-Terrorism Standards program.   The House answered the call by passing H.R. 251 by an overwhelming  margin of 414-3. Now, the Senate has acted on this critical legislation  and sent H.R. 251 back with an amendment. It falls to the House to get  it to the President's desk.   Although 414 Members of the House sent a strong message to the Senate  [[Page H697]]  that the program should be reauthorized for 2 years, which would have  provided sufficient opportunity for meaningful engagement with DHS,  stakeholders, and the Comptroller General, the Senate amendment  authorizes the program for a shortened period of 15 months.   I am concerned this abbreviated authorization period provides less  stability for DHS and more uncertainty for the regulated community, but  unless we act, the CFATS program will expire at midnight tonight.   Allowing this program to lapse will be disruptive, irresponsible, and  would sacrifice the important security gains that DHS and the regulated  community have achieved.   In short, allowing the program to sunset would make our communities  less safe. After all, this program is designed to prevent the next  West, Texas, where a dozen first responders lost their lives after a  bad actor caused an explosion at a fertilizer plant, creating a blast  that leveled an entire community.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my House colleagues to support this legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no speakers, and I  am prepared to close after the gentleman from Texas closes.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   Mr. Speaker, if the House does not act today, an important national  security program would terminate in a matter of hours. I cannot  overstate the threat that would pose.   As DHS Secretary Nielsen put it in a letter last November: `` . . .  if the program were to lapse as a result of the current sunsetting  provision, it would increase the risk to our country and create  uncertainty across the chemical industry.''   Before I close, I want to thank my partners in this month-long  effort. My fellow committee members, Representatives Richmond, Rogers,  and Ratcliffe; my colleagues on the House Energy and Commerce  Committee, Representatives, Pallone, Walden, Tonko, and Shimkus; our  new partner in the Senate, Ranking Member Peters; majority and minority  leadership staff, most notably Shuwanza Goff and Luke Murry; and Alicia  Smith on my staff, as well as Jackie Cohen, Jerry Couri, and Julie  Klein.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the measure, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
