 Mr. Speaker, on this first day of December, I rise  today to point out that the people's House went the entire month of  November without passing a bill to tackle our Nation's housing crisis.   Communities on the California central coast are ranked as some of the  most expensive places in our country to live in.   I was sent to this Chamber by my constituents to enact policies that  will help lower these skyrocketing prices.   Congress needs to help increase the availability of affordable  housing options. We need to reform and expand programs that provide  housing assistance for working families and veterans like I have been  pushing for. We need to invest in our communities for solutions that  are helping those experiencing homelessness.   Mr. Speaker, there are bills we could pass today to lend a hand,  including bipartisan ones that I have helped write.   By all means, let's keep pursuing baseless impeachment inquires or  defunding the salaries of Cabinet members that we don't agree with.   Mr. Speaker, please, let's start governing.                            ____________________
