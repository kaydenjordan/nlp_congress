 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 672) to require continued and enhanced annual  reporting to Congress in the Annual Report on International Religious  Freedom on anti-Semitic incidents in Europe, the safety and security of  European Jewish communities, and the efforts of the United States to  partner with European governments, the European Union, and civil  society groups, to combat anti-Semitism, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 672         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Combating European Anti-      Semitism Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) During the past decade, there has been a steady       increase in anti-Semitic incidents in Europe, resulting in       European Jews being the targets of physical and verbal       harassment and even lethal terrorist attacks, all of which       has eroded personal and communal security and the quality of       daily Jewish life.        (2) According to reporting by the European Union Agency for       Fundamental Rights (FRA), between 2005 and 2014, anti-Semitic       incidents increased in France from 508 to 851; in Germany       from 60 to 173; in Belgium from 58 to 130; in Italy from 49       to 86; and in the United Kingdom from 459 to 1,168.        (3) Anti-Zionism has at times devolved into anti-Semitic       attacks, prompting condemnation from many European leaders,       including French Prime Minister Manuel Valls, British Prime       Minister David Cameron, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.        (4) Since 2010, the Department of State has adhered to the       working definition of Anti-Semitism by the European       Monitoring Center on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC). Some       contemporary examples of anti-Semitism include the following:        (A) Calling for, aiding, or justifying the killing or       harming of Jews (often in the name of a radical ideology or       an extremist view of religion).        (B) Making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or       stereotypical allegations about Jews as such, or the power of       Jews as a collective, especially, but not exclusively, the       myth about a world Jewish conspiracy or of Jews controlling       the media, economy, government, or other societal       institutions.        (C) Accusing Jews as a people of being responsible for real       or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jewish person or       group, the State of Israel, or even for acts committed by       non-Jews.        (D) Accusing the Jews as a people, or Israel as a state, of       inventing or exaggerating the Holocaust.        (E) Accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel,       or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the       interest of their own countries.        (5) On October 16, 2004, the President signed into law the       Global Anti-Semitism Review Act of 2004. This law provides       the legal foundation for a reporting requirement provided by       the Department of State annually on anti-Semitism around the       world.        (6) In November 2015, the House of Representatives passed       H. Res. 354 by a vote of 418-0, urging the Secretary of State       to continue robust United States reporting on anti-Semitism       by the Department of State and the Special Envoy to Combat       and Monitor Anti-Semitism.        (7) In 2016, the International Holocaust Remembrance       Alliance (IHRA), comprised of 31 member countries, adopted a       working definition of anti-Semitism which stated: ``Anti-      Semitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be       expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical       manifestations of anti-Semitism are directed toward Jewish or       non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish       community institutions and religious facilities.''.        (8) The IHRA further clarified that manifestations of anti-      Semitism might also target the State of Israel, conceived of       as a Jewish collectivity. Anti-Semitism frequently charges       Jews with conspiring to harm humanity, and it is often used       to blame Jews for ``why things go wrong''. It is expressed in       speech, writing, visual forms, and action, and employs       sinister stereotypes and negative character traits.       SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that--  [[Page H4276]]         (1) it is in the national interest of the United States to       combat anti-Semitism at home and abroad;        (2) anti-Semitism is a challenge to the basic principles of       tolerance, pluralism, and democracy, and the shared values       that bind Americans and Europeans together;        (3) there is an urgent need to ensure the safety and       security of European Jewish communities, including       synagogues, schools, cemeteries, and other institutions;        (4) the United States should continue to emphasize the       importance of combating anti-Semitism in multilateral bodies,       including the United Nations, European Union institutions,       and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe;        (5) the Department of State should continue to thoroughly       document acts of anti-Semitism and anti-Semitic incitement       that occur around the world, and should continue to encourage       other countries to do the same, and share their findings; and        (6) the Department of State should continue to work to       encourage adoption by national government institutions and       multilateral institutions of a working definition of anti-      Semitism similar to the one adopted in the International       Holocaust Remembrance Alliance context.       SEC. 4. ANNUAL REPORTING ON THE STATE OF ANTI-SEMITISM IN                     EUROPE.         Paragraph (1) of section 102(b) of the International       Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6412) is amended by       adding at the end the following new subparagraph:        ``(G) Anti-semitism in europe.--In addition to the       information required under clause (vii) of subparagraph (A),       with respect to each European country in which verbal or       physical threats or attacks are particularly significant       against Jewish persons, places of worship, schools,       cemeteries, and other religious institutions, a description       of--        ``(i) the security challenges and needs of European Jewish       communities and European law enforcement agencies in such       countries to better protect such communities;        ``(ii) to the extent practicable, the efforts of the United       States Government over the reporting period to partner with       European law enforcement agencies and civil society groups       regarding the sharing of information and best practices to       combat anti-Semitic incidents in Europe;        ``(iii) European educational programming and public       awareness initiatives that aim to collaborate on educational       curricula and campaigns that impart shared values of       pluralism and tolerance, and showcase the positive       contributions of Jews in culture, scholarship, science, and       art, with special attention to those segments of the       population that exhibit a high degree of anti-Semitic animus;       and        ``(iv) efforts by European governments to adopt and apply a       working definition of anti-Semitism.''.     I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include any extraneous material in the Record.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by thanking my colleagues Nita  Lowey and Chairman Emeritus Ileana Ros-Lehtinen for their leadership on  the Bipartisan Task Force for Combating Anti-Semitism and for their  good work on this timely and important bill.   Mr. Speaker, I will lay out this case, but it is one we are familiar  with. Hostility towards the Jewish people in some European cities is  very deep, making Jews in certain areas look over their shoulders,  afraid to walk the streets at night. In recent years, this surge in  anti-Semitism has led to an outbreak of violent attacks.   Those violent attacks are targeting certain Jewish neighbors. They  are targeting places of worship. I think back to 2015, the deadly  attacks on the kosher supermarket in Paris and, later on, the synagogue  in Copenhagen.   European governments have since passed laws designed to better  protect their Jewish citizens, designed to punish those who perpetrate  anti-Semitic incidents, but much more work remains to be done because  there needs to be a better coordination on these efforts between Jewish  communities and law enforcement and more comprehensive reporting on the  incidents to identify trends, to identify problematic regions.   In addition, in order to consistently apply anti-Semitism laws  throughout Europe, there needs to be a uniform legal understanding of  what constitutes anti-Semitism.   Let me explain. We must be clear on this. The fire bombing of  synagogues is not a political protest. The defacing of cemeteries, the  yelling slurs at rabbis, the threatening of Jewish school children,  this is not political protest. This is anti-Semitism, and it must be  stopped.   Absent a clear-eyed definition of anti-Semitism, perpetrators of  violent acts have, at times, been given a pass for their actions due to  the flimsy defense of political protest.   Adoption across Europe of a single definition of anti-Semitism would  provide an important foundation for law enforcement officials, enabling  them to better enforce laws and develop strategies for improved  security for the Jewish community.   This bill, H.R. 672, the Combating European Anti-Semitism Act of  2017, calls for these fundamental improvements, and it reaffirms the  U.S. commitment to combating anti-Semitism. It urges European nations  to adopt a working definition of anti-Semitism. It calls for increased  reporting on it.   Anti-Semitic incidents in Europe have to be reported in a way in  which people can be held accountable. Collaborative efforts between  U.S. and European law enforcement and the efforts to improve security  for Jewish communities is another important aspect of this legislation.   Now is the time to act and pass this important measure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), chairman of the Foreign Affairs'  Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), who chairs the Foreign  Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa and is our  chairman emeritus.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   First, let me say that the words just spoken by Ranking Member Eliot  Engel are precisely the sentiment that I think we all wish to convey.  We must do all we can to combat anti-Semitism in all of its insidious  forms, and we do it because the consequences, the horrifying  consequences of doing nothing in the face of such evil, are  unconscionable. We must not repeat the mistakes of the past by  remaining silent, as this same poison affects our communities today.   Passage of this bill sends a clear signal that anti-Semitism has no  place in free societies and urges our European partners to provide  practical guidance that will empower law enforcement and better equip  them to tackle this rising problem, and it sends the message that our  own law enforcement is willing to work hand in hand with theirs in  order to tackle this problem.   I appreciate the work of Congresswoman Lowey and Congresswoman Ros- Lehtinen and, of course, Mr. Engel, the ranking member. I urge my  colleagues to join me in support of this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  agree to the resolution (H. Res. 145) expressing the sense of the House  of Representatives regarding the fight against corruption in Central  America, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 145         Whereas according to Transparency International's 2016       Corruption Perception Index, the citizens of Honduras,       Guatemala, El Salvador, and Nicaragua perceive high levels of       government corruption;        Whereas widespread corruption in Central America weakens       citizens' faith in public institutions, limits government       capacity to advance development goals, and allows drug       traffickers and other criminals to thrive;        Whereas the International Commission against Impunity in       Guatemala (CICIG) was created at the request of the       Guatemalan Government in 2007, and has strengthened the       capacity of Guatemalan institutions, especially the Office of       the Attorney General, to combat corruption;        Whereas the Office of the Attorney General of Guatemala and       CICIG have recently collaborated to investigate and prosecute       a series of corruption cases involving high-level government       officials, demonstrating that it is possible for governments       in Central America to confront entrenched corruption, and       that no one is above the law;        Whereas the Attorney General of El Salvador has made       significant progress in tackling corruption at the highest       levels;        Whereas after thousands of Hondurans joined street protests       against corruption and in favor of an International       Commission against Impunity in Honduras, the Honduran       Government reached an agreement with the Organization of       American States to create the Mission to Support the Fight       against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (MACCIH);        Whereas MACCIH has begun to assist the Office of the       Attorney General of Honduras with the investigation into the       more than $300,000,000 that was embezzled from the Institute       of Social Security; and        Whereas the leadership of CICIG and MACCIH and the       attorneys general of Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador       have faced significant challenges, including credible threats       against their lives, attempts to publicly discredit their       work, or efforts to remove them from their posts: Now,       therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) reaffirms that combating corruption in the Northern       Triangle is an important policy interest for the United       States;        (2) acknowledges that the International Commission against       Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) and the Mission to Support the       Fight against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (MACCIH)       are currently making important contributions to this effort;  [[Page H4279]]         (3) urges the Government of Guatemala to continue to       cooperate with CICIG and the Government of Honduras to       continue to cooperate with MACCIH; and        (4) encourages the Governments of Honduras, Guatemala, and       El Salvador to--        (A) publicly support efforts to fight corruption;        (B) respect the independence of the judicial branch and the       Office of the Attorney General; and        (C) ensure that the Office of the Attorney General in each       Northern Triangle country receives sufficient domestic budget       allocations to carry out its core responsibilities and that       budgeted funds are delivered in a timely manner.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous materials in the Record.    I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 145, which affirms this  body's support for the independent anticorruption commissions in  Central America that seek to combat corruption and combat impunity in  the countries of the Northern Triangle region.   I would like to commend the gentlewoman from California (Mrs.  Torres), a new member of the committee, for her work on this important  resolution. Of course, I appreciate Mr. Engel, the ranking member and  the former chairman of the Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, for  his long-time focus on this critical region.   Mr. Speaker, in recent years, the U.S. has seen a surge in illegal  migration from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Now, that is the  Northern Triangle of Central America.   Many of these migrants are fleeing violence. They are fleeing  criminality and institutionalized corruption. More than anything, the  citizens of these countries want governments that will work for them.   As a result of these governments, the international community has  responded. Governments in the region, including the United States, have  helped to establish the International Commission Against Impunity in  Guatemala--that is called CICIG--and the Mission to Support the Fight  against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras, known as MACCIH.   Both of these organizations are making important contributions to  tackling the culture of corruption and impunity in their respective  countries and are working to give the citizens of these countries  confidence in their own judiciary. These organizations have put  politicians and public servants on notice that nobody should be above  the law and that their citizenry demands transparency.   For example, this special body in Honduras has begun to assist the  Office of the Attorney General with the investigation into the more  than $300 million that was embezzled from the Institute of Social  Security and, in Guatemala, has trained the prosecutors that  successfully built high-profile corruption cases against multiple  government officials, including the former Guatemalan President,  President Molina.                                time  1645    Once again, I want to thank Representative Torres for bringing this  measure forward and for her efforts in working with the Northern  Triangle countries to urge greater respect for an independent judiciary  and to bring greater security and prosperity to the people of the  Northern Triangle countries.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), who chairs the Foreign  Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Norma  Torres for authoring this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Moolenaar), a member of the Committee on Appropriations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Kinzinger), a member of the Committee on  Foreign Affairs and an Air Force pilot.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), who chairs the Foreign  Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to once again recognize the  work of Ranking Member Engel and the other committee members who have  contributed to this bill.   Our committee has heard the firsthand accounts of the suffering. We  heard the testimony from Raed Saleh of the Syrian White Helmets as he  spoke of their efforts to rescue and treat those who were killed and  injured in Assad's brutal air assaults. When the bombs come in, as they  often do, his organization, which was nominated for the Nobel Peace  Prize, runs toward those shelters being destroyed to provide relief for  the victims and to pull them out.   We have heard of the terror. More than a year ago, Dr. Mohamed  Tennari of the Syrian American Medical Society described for the  committee the sound of helicopters overhead, the thump of exploding  bombs, and the overpowering smell of bleach in the air. This brave  doctor described the horrendous effects this toxic gas has on the human  body and the slow, agonizing deaths as the chlorine gas turned to  hydrochloric acid in the lungs of victims.   Many of those victims he spoke of were children. They were targeted  by the regime. People were targeted as they slept in their beds in  their neighborhoods. Just a few weeks ago, one family lost 20 relatives  in a single sarin  [[Page H4291]]  gas attack. Of the 92 victims of that attack on that day, 23 were  children.   Mr. Speaker, in 2016, efforts to establish a lasting cease-fire  failed, resulting in an aggressive campaign by Syrian and Russian air  assets against eastern Aleppo. U.N. officials described that assault as  ``crimes of historic proportions.''   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
