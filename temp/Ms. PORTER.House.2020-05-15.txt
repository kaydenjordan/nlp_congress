 Mr. Speaker, Americans are suffering enough from this  pandemic. They deserve the best policy to help them. Even if infection  rates go down in May and June, unemployment will keep going up.   The Paycheck Recovery Act would protect our capitalist economy, which  the virus is attacking. It would preserve businesses and give workers  what they need most: their paychecks so they can provide for their  families.   The HEROES Act should have used this approach, but I know our States  and local governments and our frontline workers cannot wait for Federal  help. I, therefore, support this bill.
