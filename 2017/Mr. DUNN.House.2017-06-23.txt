 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Florida  Highway Patrol Master Sergeant William Bishop of Lake City. Sergeant  Bishop was killed last Saturday while working a traffic accident on I- 75 in Alachua County, Florida.   Sergeant Bishop is a 30-year veteran of the Florida Highway Patrol,  and he dedicated his life to law enforcement. He truly loved his patrol  family. He also served in the United States Army, serving on the front  lines all his life. That is a calling, not a job.   Many of Bishop's colleagues remember him as someone who exhibited  compassion, honesty, and faith. He loved watching football, but his  greatest love of all was his family, especially his son, Trampas.   His service and sacrifice to the State of Florida is a debt we will  never be able to repay.   Please join me in honoring Florida Highway Patrol Master Sergeant  William Bishop and all of our fallen heroes who have made the ultimate  sacrifice for our safety.                            ____________________
