 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Clyde), for putting this together.   Madam Speaker, I want to begin this evening by thanking my Democrat  colleagues for their outstanding work in encouraging millions of  Americans to celebrate their Second Amendment rights by purchasing  their first, second, or even 100th firearm.   From the last riots in cities across America, to Biden's threat to  strip away our basic constitutional rights, Democrats are  singlehandedly responsible for the sale of tens of millions of  firearms.                                time  2030    Bravo. Well done. I hear that the interest has begun to peak when it  comes to the sale of F-15s.   Now, I have some questions for these freedom-haters. When are you  going to call on the Chief Executive, the basement dweller, to hold his  own son accountable for his gun crimes? Hunter Biden lied on a Federal  firearms application, which is punishable by up to 10 years and a  $250,000 fine, of which 10 percent will not be going to the big guy.   Rules for thee but not for my crackhead, parmesan-smoking, gun  criminal son?   What about the disposal of Hunter Biden's gun in a back-ally  dumpster? Why was the Secret Service involved in locating this firearm?  Can you just imagine, for half a second, if Donald Trump, Jr., was  involved in firearms crimes, and his dad ordered the Secret Service to  cover it up?   That is just the start of the hypocrisy. Biden will call widely  purchased firearms ``weapons of war,'' but then he will tell you that  you need an F-15 or a nuke to keep the Federal Government in check. He  will target so-called ``merchants of death'' but celebrate the 600  abortion clinics across America. This regime will encourage riots,  defund the police, and try to take away Americans' rights to self- defense.   Madam Speaker, the American people are not on board with the Biden  regime's hypocritical gun-grabbing. Instead, they are buying guns at a  record rate. So my colleagues from the other side, they can keep  running their mouths, and we will keep adding to our arsenals.
