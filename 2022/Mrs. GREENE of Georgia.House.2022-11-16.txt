 Madam Speaker, we have watched tens of  billions of dollars be sent to defend another nation's border that is  not our own.   Every single day, our border is invaded by people from foreign lands  and also by drugs. Over 300 people are dying every single day.  Americans are dying every single day from fentanyl poisoning.   Yet, the Biden administration and this Congress have not done  anything to protect our Nation's border and the American people.   Just to remind everyone, the building that we are standing in, the  Federal Government and everyone's paychecks here are paid by the  American taxpayers. The American taxpayers and the American people  deserve to have a secure border and deserve the protection of the  Federal Government from the Mexican cartels that funnel drugs into  America to kill Americans.   I am calling for an audit of every single penny that has been sent to  Ukraine, including aid money and any other moneys that have been given  to the Ukrainian Government to defend their national security while our  national security has been ignored.   This must be done. It has to be done as soon as possible for the  American people. They deserve transparency, and they deserve to see  where their money is going.                            ____________________
