 Mr. Speaker, the U.S. was thrust by Biden and the  Democratic Party into the Ukrainian conflict. We have spent over $113  billion to support Ukraine in its war against Russia.   Democrat legislation passed in the 117th Congress exempted Biden from  complying with numerous requirements of the Arms Export Control Act and  the Foreign Assistance Act for leases to Ukraine, a country that former  President Obama didn't think twice about not lifting a finger to assist  in 2014.   These exemptions have led to rampant spending with little to no  accountability. The American people deserve  [[Page H1851]]  transparency and assurance that their hard-earned dollars are not  simply being given away, which is why I have introduced the Ukraine  Lend-Lease Accountability Act this morning.   This legislation would ensure that the terms of Federal foreign  military aid leasing would be followed by the President. It is  unacceptable to throw money to a country with no terms for repayment,  especially when we are talking about over $100 billion at a time when  we are having to cut our own budget.   If I have to choose between a foreign war and our seniors who are  struggling, I choose our seniors. If we have to choose between our  children and their future, I choose our children.   Mr. Speaker, I choose America first.                            ____________________
