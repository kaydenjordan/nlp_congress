 Mr. Speaker, it is with great sadness that I rise to  recognize the loss of a very great American, Brigadier General Chuck  Yeager, who passed last evening. He and his wife, Victoria, are  constituents of ours in Nevada County in our district in northern  California.   Truly, he was an American icon. He inspired the world to push farther  and faster and to push the envelope, as they say, a man I was honored  to call a friend.   He grew up in West Virginia, a country boy hunting and fishing the  hills where he lived. He entered World War II and became one of the  greatest pilots that we would know. He had an amazing 20/10 vision that  helped him to see enemy aircraft sooner than the rest of his colleagues  or the enemy could see ours.   His exploits in the sky continued after World War II, when he was the  first man to break the sound barrier in his Bell X-1 aircraft.   Indeed, he was an amazing gentleman. He was a determined man with a  lot of grit, provided a lot of help advancing the aviation situation in  this country, even just a few years ago, exceeding the sound barrier  once again.   He had a straight and dry sense of humor. He didn't have a whole lot  of use for politicians. I was lucky to be able to count him as a  friend, not as a politician but as more of a neighbor.   We will grieve this man and we will grieve his loss, because they  don't make very many like Chuck Yeager. Indeed, he will be  irreplaceable.   God bless him and his family.                            ____________________
