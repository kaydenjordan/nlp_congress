 Mr. Speaker, the previous speaker said Republicans want  to do nothing to help, which is false, untrue. Members in this body  came together during an unprecedented crisis and passed five bills to  provide much-needed relief and pave the way to defeat the virus. I  believe that all of us continue to support targeted help for those who  need it.   But that is not what this bill is. This bill may have made sense a  year ago, but why would we print and borrow $2 trillion when we are so  close to crushing this virus and returning to a way of life that all  Americans sacrificed?   Why give $130 billion to schools and not require them to open when  the CDC says it is safe and at a time when so many kids are desperate  for personal social interaction?   Why provide $350 billion to States that shut down their economies  even though their revenues are at record highs?   Why send $1,400 checks to individuals when the majority of those  receiving the checks never lost any income?   People want to get back to work. So why make it harder, as we are  doing in this bill by giving them a bonus to stay home?   The answer is this bill is not just about COVID relief. It is about  enacting the largest progressive policy wish list of all time.   Mr. Speaker, we can do better than this, and the American people  deserve better.
