 Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today to thank all of  the Members who voted to support the Great Lakes Restoration  Initiative.   In the appropriations legislation the House passed 2 weeks ago, we  included $300 million in the fiscal year 2018 budget for protecting our  Great Lakes.   The Great Lakes are a critical resource and an essential part of  Michigan's outdoor heritage. They are enjoyed by millions of Americans  from across the country, and they are a unique ecosystem with one-fifth  of the world's freshwater. They are also a major trade route and they  form an international border.   There is a Federal role for protecting the Great Lakes, and by  working with public and private organizations like Michigan's  universities and Ducks Unlimited, the GLRI does vital work to protect  the Great Lakes and the streams, rivers, and wetlands that flow into  them.   Again, I want to thank all of my colleagues for their support of this  critical program.                            ____________________
