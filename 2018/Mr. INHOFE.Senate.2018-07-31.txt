 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  recognized to speak as in morning business for up to 15 minutes.    Mr. President, let me just follow up on the remarks of my  friend from Iowa.   I think most of us around this Chamber had a chance to meet Judge  Kavanaugh. I am in kind of a unique situation in that I am not a  lawyer. So I ask different questions than most people do, but I was  already convinced, judging from his history in voting and his adherence  and commitment to the Constitution, that he is my kind of guy. In fact,  I even sent a message to him saying: Don't bother wasting your time on  me because you don't need to. But, nonetheless, he came.   This is what is interesting about this guy. Everything that the  Senator from Iowa said is true, but over and above that, I have had  personal conversations with people who were from his home church. There  was one lady who was a close friend of Judge Kavanaugh whose husband  died, and every time there is an event, such as a parent-student event,  Judge Kavanaugh would go and get the children of his deceased friend  and take them to the events as if he were their father. It is not very  often that we see that kind of compassion in somebody. So we had a  conversation about those things and I was very excited about it.                     National Defense Authorization Bill    Mr. President, on Thursday we are going to be passing a bill that I  consider every year to be the most significant bill of the year. We  know it is going to pass because it has passed every year for the last  57 years. It is going to pass. It is named the John S. McCain National  Defense Authorization Act, and I am pleased that this conference report  is the result of an open and bipartisan process.   I have to thank, first of all, Chairman McCain and his staff for  working so diligently in leading the legislation that bears his name.  This year's NDAA is a fitting testament to him. We are talking about  John McCain's policies and his priorities and the lasting legacy on our  Nation. John is a true American hero. So it is appropriate that we name  this bill after him.   I also want to thank Ranking Member Reed. Senator Reed has been by my  side. The two of us have worked this Defense authorization bill now for  several months, and we have been very busy doing that. We have been  working closely with Chairman Thornberry over in the House, as well as  with Ranking Member Smith in the House. I thank them for their hard  work on this bill.   It always gets around to the big four, after we all meet and we have  the meetings with the House and the Senate, our joint conference  meetings. But then there are always some things that need to be done,  and they have to be done by the big four. I have been involved with  several of these, and this year, of course, the chairman of the House  committee, the acting chairman of the Senate committee, and the ranking  members worked very hard, and we got this done.   So we should all be proud of this week's National Defense  Authorization Act, but we shouldn't lose sight of why it is so  important. We need to remember the degraded state of our military.   I don't mean this in a partisan way, but we had 8 years of the Obama  administration, and one thing that I have always appreciated about  previously Senator Obama and then-President Obama is that he is a real,  sincere, in-the-heart liberal. Quite often, the priorities of those  individuals are not the same as some of us, particularly in a strong  national defense. So we are really hurting.    At the end of the Obama administration, in 2016, only 33 percent of  our brigade combat teams were at sufficient levels to be deployed; only  a quarter of our aviation brigades were ready; and just 40 percent of  the Marines' F-18s were flyable--only 40 percent--because the first  thing somebody does when they are cutting down on the expense of a  strong military is they do away with the maintenance, and that is the  problem we had. We were short 1,500 pilots and had shrunk the force by  nearly 100,000 servicemembers despite growing threats around the world.   I don't think anyone can argue that this is a threatened world. I  think it is the most threatened our country has ever been. Countries  around the world have the capability of firing a rocket and hitting a  city in America. That didn't used to be the case. You had to be a giant  in order to be one of the leaders. Now we have people out there whose  judgment we have to question, and they have this capability. So we have  a lot of things.   We have fallen behind China and Russia. This year's national defense  strategy--the first in a decade--rightfully recognized that China and  Russia are strategic adversaries and competitors.   We are also falling behind especially in technologies that will  define the future of deterrence and capabilities.   Look at hypersonic weapons. Hypersonic weapons operate at five times  the speed of sound. They are still in the experimental stage. We are  working on it, but we are behind China and Russia. They are both ahead  of us at this time.   The nuclear triad is a modernization program. Over the 8 Obama years,  we didn't do anything in that. Consequently, during those years, both  China and Russia passed us up.  [[Page S5481]]    Long-range artillery. Artillery is measured by the rapid fire and by  the range, and right now, in both cases of rapid fire and range, China  and Russia are ahead of us.   The national defense strategy identified these vulnerabilities, but  it is our responsibility to take that strategy and turn it into policy,  and that is exactly what we are doing. This year's NDAA does that. We  are investing in training, maintenance, and modernization, restoring  our qualitative and quantitative advantage around the world. I say  restoring, not achieving, because we lost it. The Chairman of our Joint  Chiefs of Staff, in the fifth year of the Obama administration, said  that we are losing our qualitative and quantitative advantage around  the world. It is kind of hard for people to conceive of this. I am used  to the fact that most people believed and probably still believe today  that the United States has the very best of everything. Well, we have  the best troops and the best-trained troops, but our equipment is not  all that good, and so we are doing everything to try to change that.   So that is the situation in which we find ourselves. This year's NDAA  will fully fund the key priorities we have identified that will ensure  that our Armed Forces have the training, resources, and equipment they  need to complete their mission. We fully fund what is needed to  modernize the force, including procurement for aircraft, shipbuilding,  and artillery.   Procurement has always been a problem. It has been a problem since I  was serving in the House on the House Armed Services Committee. We are  addressing this problem as it has not been addressed before.   We have now fully funded in this bill the modernization of our  Nation's nuclear strategy, including the development of low-yield  nuclear weapons and a layered missile defense. A lot of people don't  realize that Russia had low-yield nuclear weapons and we didn't. So we  are trying to catch up in those areas.   We fully funded support for critical allies and partners, including  the Afghanistan security forces, coalition support, Iraqi security  forces, and Israel.   We have increased end strength to align with the President's budget  request and adapt to the growing threats from around the world. Now,  this sounds easy, but it is not because we are starting from behind.  The NDAA bill we are going to vote on on Thursday goes beyond the  President's request to provide greater funding for research and  development, ensuring that we can continue to focus on new and emerging  threats, like hypersonics, space, and cyber.   We are standing up to China by strengthening our position across the  Pacific region. This bill provides support to our allies who stand up  against China's military and economic coercion and procures deployable  airbase systems to enhance credible combat power.   The NDAA also calls out China for illegally creating and fortifying  islands in the South China Sea. I was in the South China Sea about a  month ago. Our allies are looking at us and looking at China, and  wondering, whose side do we want to be on? Because all they see is what  is happening in China. Those are illegal islands. They don't own the  land under them. There are some seven different islands exceeding 3,000  acres that are as if they are preparing for World War III. So we know  what their capability is. We know what the problems are.   Then, of course, the NDAA counters Russia's growing aggression and  influence across Eastern Europe by directing a study on permanently  stationing U.S. forces in Poland and conducting a study on Russia's  malign influence around the world. That is in this bill. So we are  actually going to take some action.   It wasn't long ago--I think in March--that the RAND Corporation,  which makes assessments as to what our capabilities are, said that  Russia is to the point right now that if they were to take on NATO,  including our forces in NATO and Western Europe, that they would win.  That is a pretty frightening thought.   The bill continues limitations on U.S.-Russia military cooperation  and provides defensive lethal aid to Ukraine. I happened to be in  Ukraine with President Poroshenko way back when they had their  Parliamentary elections. I think it was about 4 years ago. That was the  first time they had a Parliamentary election where there was not one  Communist in the Ukraine Parliament. He was very, very proud. Of course  that upset Russia, and Putin started sending people into Ukraine and  killing them, and our President at that time, President Obama, would  not allow us to send defensive weapons in there to help them.    It keeps faith with our troops by providing a 2.6-percent military  pay increase--the first one in about 10 years--and it is modernizing  the officer personnel system and supporting our troops and military  families.   When Senator Reed and I started on this process, we shared a  commitment to making sure that this year's NDAA is more than just  another piece of legislation; rather, that it is a message to each and  every one of our servicemembers. And we did that. The NDAA tells them  that they are our top priority. It is what we have to do to defend  America. After all, the No. 1 thing we should be doing around here is  defending America. A lot of people have forgotten that there is an old  document around that nobody reads anymore called the Constitution. The  Constitution says what we are supposed to be doing: defending America.  I am proud to say that we did. Every soldier, sailor, airman, and  marine can look at this legislation and know they have the support and  commitment of their country.   I want to speak for a minute about the historical significance of  this legislation because the history of the National Defense  Authorization Act is a distinguished one.   As I mentioned before, we have passed this for 57 consecutive years.  This is the 58th year. But what is unique is the fact that we are  passing the legislation this week--a record for how quickly in the year  it will be passed and signed into law. This was deliberate. We are  moving quickly, but we are thorough, considering hundreds of bipartisan  amendments in both committee markup and on the floor. This will be the  earliest an NDAA has passed since 1996 when we were considering the  legislation for fiscal year 1997. So it is the result of the  legislative process working.   We set a budget in February and are authorizing the funding well in  advance of next year's fiscal year. So now we can and should turn our  attention to passing the necessary appropriations bill on time that  aligns with that which we are authorizing today.   About 5 years ago, we were all the way to December before we passed  this bill. To remind you, if we don't get it done by the end of  December, it means we are not going to get flight pay and hazard pay to  our troops who are standing in harm's way. So we have done a good job  on this. I am anxious to get this out of the way and vote it into law,  which is going to take place on Thursday.   We have to remember that without consistent, continued funding, the  critical reforms in this year's NDAA will not be possible, and we won't  be able to make the needed investments to restore our competitive  advantage over China and Russia. That is exactly what we are going to  do--we are going to restore what we have lost, and it is all happening  in this bill. I think we will have the chance on Thursday to vote for  what I consider to be the most significant legislation each year.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
