 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 111) to require each agency, in providing notice of a  rulemaking, to include a link to a 100-word plain language summary of  the proposed rule.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 111         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Providing Accountability       Through Transparency Act of 2023''.       SEC. 2. REQUIREMENT TO POST A 100-WORD SUMMARY TO                     REGULATIONS.GOV.         Section 553(b) of title 5, United States Code, is amended--        (1) in paragraph (2), by striking ``and'' at the end;        (2) in paragraph (3), by striking the period at the end and       inserting ``; and''; and        (3) by inserting after paragraph (3) the following:        ``(4) the Internet address of a summary of not more than       100 words in length of the proposed rule, in plain language,       that shall be posted on the Internet website under section       206(d) of the E-Government Act of 2002 (44 U.S.C. 3501 note)       (commonly known as regulations.gov).''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on S. 111.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 111, the Providing  Accountability Through Transparency Act of 2023.   We have already spent a lot of time in this Congress exposing the  problems of the administrative state. Agencies impose rules on the  American people that lack popular support and would never get through  the House and Senate to become law.   One of the major problems is that agencies are less transparent and  have much less accountability than we do here in Congress.   The Administrative Procedure Act requires agencies to make certain  disclosures when they propose those rules. Some of these explanations  can be dense and bureaucratic and may not always help Americans quickly  grasp what agencies plan to do.   This bill is a commonsense approach to increasing agency transparency  and accountability. It requires agencies to provide a link to a plain  language summary of 100 words or less for proposed rules.   This requirement is a simple, easy way to help the American people  better understand what the rules are that agencies may impose. I urge  Members to support this bill. It is good, it is strong, it is simple,  and it is bipartisan.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reiterate my strong support for S. 111,  the Providing Accountability Through Transparency Act.   The rules that agencies impose have real-world consequences.  Americans should be easily able to understand what a proposed rule  does. Instead, they are often left trying to interpret pages of  technical and bureaucratic jargon.   This bill is a simple measure that will make Americans' lives easier.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
