 Mr. Speaker, I introduced H. Res. 1009 in March of this  year. This resolution states that it is the sense of the House that the  House should debate five of the six commonly accepted principles of the  Just War theory to declaring war or authorizing military force.   The other Just War principle is that wars should be authorized by the  Nation's legitimate body, which in this case is the House of  Representatives.   The reasoning behind H. Res. 1009 is as follows:   One, the U.S. House of Representatives shares the constitutional  responsibility to declare war and authorize military force with the  United States Senate (Article I, Section 8, Clause 11), but the House  has traditionally been the body responsible to declare war or authorize  military force.   Two, war and military action will always cause injuries, death,  destruction, loss of property, famine, displacements, and other  hardships. Because of these privations, military authorizations should  only be undertaken with sufficient justification.   Three, weapons of mass destruction are possessed by a substantial and  growing number of nations. These weapons may be capable of  exterminating humanity.   Four, any conflict has the potential to expand beyond the original  intent of the belligerent nations.   Five, the Just War theory of what constitutes the moral justification  for a nation to engage in war has been developed over the past two  millennia.   Six, some of the Just War principles are incorporated into the United  Nations charter, but this has not prevented the many wars that have  taken place since the United Nations was established. No nation in  recent history has incorporated the principles of Just War theory into  its own governing laws or traditions.   Seven, in the United States, an open and transparent debate of the  Just War principles would give lawmakers in the United States House of  Representatives a structured framework to examine if a call to conflict  would be morally justified and may prevent our Nation from entering  conflicts that may be harmful to our Nation's interests.   Eight, it is possible that debating the Just War principles in the  U.S. House of Representatives before authorizing military force would  have kept the United States out of military conflicts in the past that  have been harmful to our Nation's interests.   Nine, H. Res. 1009 does not require the U.S. House of Representatives  to debate the Just War principles, but essentially recommends that it  does so.   Ten, H. Res. 1009 does not limit executive authority, but it does  help to ensure that the executive does not overreach.   Eleven, after discussions and inputs from Just War scholars, some  improvements to H. Res. 1009 have been noted.   My intention with H. Res. 1009 is to introduce the idea of having an  open and structured debate in the House of Representatives on the most  serious and grave responsibility of our government, that of declaring  war.   In our Nation's history, declarations of war have been done at the  request of the President. Having an open and structured debate will  lessen the opportunity for misuse of our Nation's military but should  not impede our Nation's ability to react to defend our country.  [[Page H9738]]    Mr. Speaker, I urge the House of Representatives to adopt this  concept in the upcoming 118th Congress of debating the Just War  principles before authorizing military action and expect that adopting  such a resolution will inspire other nations to do the same, thereby  reducing the likelihood of future unjustified wars.                            ____________________
