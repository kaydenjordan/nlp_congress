 I thank the distinguished Senator for his comments. I  appreciate the shout-out for the U.S. Marine Corps and to all of us who  are marines.   The Marine Corps taught me one thing, and that was that I could  always do more than I thought I could. This is a good example of what  happens when we work together as a team--when we work with our  colleagues across the aisle--when we see a real problem that has come  up.   This was a situation for which I wanted to express my gratitude to  all of the Members who joined together to provide certainty and  predictability. This is what we sold the farm bill on--certainty and  predictability. We had a situation that we faced, and it was really  difficult to understand how this came about, but that is not the news  today. The news today is good news in that we reached a compromise and  found agreement to replenish the CCC, the Commodity Credit Corporation,  in the continuing resolution, absent some of the barbed wire that was  in there.   I especially want to thank more than 40 agriculture organizations,  and I have the letter right here. I know both Senators who are in  attendance here, as well as Senator Thune and everybody concerned, are  aware of it. It is to Majority Leader McConnell, Speaker Pelosi, Leader  Schumer, and Leader McCarthy. It is from 47 different farm  organizations and commodity groups that speak for, I think, virtually  every farmer, rancher, and grower in the country. So I give thanks to  the 47.   I ask unanimous consent to have printed at this point in the Record  this letter, dated September 15, 2020, from 47 farm organizations and  commodity groups   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:   [[Page S5801]]                                                  September 15, 2020.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles Schumer,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader McConnell, Speaker Pelosi, Leader       Schumer and Leader McCarthy: As Congress assembles a       continuing resolution to extend government funding, we       respectfully ask that you provide the U.S. Department of       Agriculture (USDA) with the resources necessary to continue       assisting American farmers and ranchers. To that end,       reimbursement for the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) must       be included in any measure to keep government operating past       the current fiscal year.        For decades, CCC has been regularly replenished to fund       programs integral to the farm safety net that Congress has       worked tirelessly to craft. Producers count on programs like       Agriculture Risk Coverage, Price Loss Coverage, Dairy Margin       Coverage, Marketing Assistance Loans, conservation programs,       and many others as they provide food, fuel and fiber for our       nation. Without immediate CCC reimbursement, payments and       programs would be significantly delayed, jeopardizing       operations across the country.        More than ever, farmers and ranchers need the certainty and       support provided by farm programs. Low commodity prices,       unjustified retaliatory tariffs, natural disasters, and a       global pandemic have placed a tremendous burden on farm       country. USDA's most recent farm income projections forecast       that cash receipts will be at their lowest level in more than       a decade. Coupled with rising farm debt and a decrease in       working capital, producers face challenges not experienced in       decades.        As the industry continues to endure hardships during this       unprecedented time, we urge you to include CCC reimbursement       in a continuing resolution. Thank you for your consideration       and continued efforts on behalf of American agriculture.            Sincerely,        Agricultural Retailers Association, Amcot, American Agri-      Women, American Cotton Producers, American Cotton Shippers       Association, American Dairy Coalition, American Farm Bureau       Federation, American Pulse Association, American Sheep       Industry Association, American Soybean Association.

Mr. President, if we had not done this, it would have  resulted in delays in the 2018 farm bill programs--the one that we  passed here with 87 votes--and the ability farmers would have with the  risk management tools.   I would just simply point out that no matter what they grow or where  they live, farmers, ranchers, and growers have done their part to  ensure that our Nation's food, fiber, and fuel supplies continue  without disruption during these unprecedented times. They are counting  on the Department of Agriculture--and, for that matter, the Congress-- to deliver a range of agriculture, nutrition, conservation, and  forestry programs.   More than 50 of these programs--here is the list--were in danger  because of the uncertainty in replenishing the CCC funding and then due  to some of the add-ons with regard to policy being difficult to  understand. Well, they are easy to understand, but it is bad policy,  bad precedent.   We have put the Secretary of Agriculture in a very bad position in  that he has announced the specifics of this program. I would urge all  of my colleagues--more especially my colleagues across the aisle who  have expressed great concern as to what is in this latest program and  what isn't--to get on the phone, and I will get on the phone with the  Secretary. I know that Senator Boozman and Senator Hoeven will do the  same. We all have concerns as to how this is going to work, and that  has been true with all of the programs prior to this one. That is the  way to express our concern with regard to getting something done.   I do want to point out that my colleagues across the aisle, under the  banner of nutrition programs--the SNAP program in particular, school  lunches, et cetera--did point out that we had some real deficiencies  with regard to keeping our commitment to these programs, more  especially with COVID-19. I understand that, so that was included. That  is really what we are all about here--working in a bipartisan fashion  on behalf of farmers, ranchers, and growers in agriculture. That is  what we have always done on the committee.   I thank my distinguished ranking member, and I thank everybody who  brought this thing together.   As the chairman of this committee, we were successful. As I  indicated, in a bipartisan manner, we--87 Members of this Chamber-- voted in favor of this legislation. These were some of the programs  that were threatened: price loss coverage, agriculture risk coverage,  and marketing assistance loans. If you just go down the list of  everything farmers were depending on, all of a sudden, it was up in the  air. Why that was true I am not quite sure, but this shows the extent  of the damage that could have been done with the original request in  the CR without the CCC funding.   I ask unanimous consent to have printed at this point in the Record a  list of these programs that were in danger.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                        Programs Funded Through CCC         Price Loss Coverage; Agriculture Risk Coverage-County;       Agriculture Risk Coverage-Individual; Marketing Assistance       Loans; Economic Adjustment Assistance for Upland Cotton; ELS       Cotton; Payment Limitations and Actively Engaged (commodity       certs, separate peanut payment limit, marketing loan; Sugar       Loans; Electronic Warehouse Receipts; Dairy Margin Coverage.        Dairy Indemnity Payment Programs; Milk Donation Program;       Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program; Feedstock       Flexibililty Program; Biofuels Infrastructure Program;       Biobased Market Program; Biorefinery Assistance Program;       Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels; Rural Energy for       America Program; Export Credit Guarantee Program.

Mr. President, finding a bipartisan solution to  replenish the CCC and to provide much needed certainty and  predictability for all reasons, all crops, all farmers, and all  ranchers, I, again, appreciate the efforts of my colleagues and those  who represent them--the Nation's farmers, ranchers, growers, rural  stakeholders, everybody in rural and small-town America, and their  lenders, who could not believe what we were about to face with pulling  out the CCC funds with regards to the CR, or the continuing resolution,  to keep our government running and avoid a government shutdown.   So this agreement, the continuing resolution, represents a good step,  a good bipartisan step. I really appreciate that, although I must say  we didn't have to go down this road.  [[Page S5802]]    There is a saying we have in Kansas that there are a lot cactus in  the world. We don't have to sit on every doggone one of them. And, boy,  we sat on this one, and we sat on it too long.   I want thank the staff, especially the Agriculture Committee staff,  representing all of our Members on the Ag Committee. They did  tremendous work, making sure the right policy was there, making sure  that at least the CCC was operating with the funds that they need to  operate during the middle of COVID-19, and, again, on behalf of all of  agriculture.   So I want to again thank Senator Hoeven for holding this discussion.   I yield the floor.    I am not sure this is the final word. In the Senate of  the United States there is no final word, I would assume.   But this points out something that is just absolutely  understandable--common sense. When people ask me how on  [[Page S5803]]  Earth we got 87 votes together for a farm bill, with the tremendous  help of the ranking member, Senator Stabenow, it was pretty easy.   We were holding hearings, as both of the Senators know. And people  asked me: How do you get something like this done?   It is just a huge undertaking. You have to listen to farmers. You  have to sit on the wagon tongue and listen.   Well, this time we didn't have to sit on the wagon tongue and listen.  United, they said: What on Earth is going on? How did this proposal get  loose? In other words, keeping us out of the continuing resolution,  given the problems that we are having, what on Earth is going on?   And so it wasn't much of a surprise to any of us when farmers--every  one of them represented by the groups that the distinguished Senator  has just listed--said: Whoa. Wait a minute. We are getting left out.   I think the leader in a conference said something about, well, other  than the fact that we are treating agriculture and farmers like bums--I  mean, it was pretty clear what was going on, and it was terribly  counterproductive. I don't know how people come up with these things.  It is what it is.   But we listened to farmers. We got the job done. We cooperated. It  was bipartisan.   Some of the nutrition programs were addressed. It was a good news  story. We couldn't have done it, however, without the 47 groups that  sounded the alarm. And so we have been able to do it over a period of  about 3 or 4 or 5 days.   I thank everybody concerned. I think it is a good news story in the  end result.
