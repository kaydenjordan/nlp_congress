 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Kentucky for  yielding the time for this important legislation.   On January 29, 2017, U.S. Navy Chief Special Warfare Operator William  ``Ryan'' Owens was killed during a raid in Yemen. At the age of 36, he  gave the ultimate sacrifice in order to protect our great Nation.  Today, he is survived by his wife, Carryn, and their three young  children.   Ryan Owens grew up in Edelstein, Illinois, in my congressional  district, a town that is in a very rural area with barely one stop  sign. Friends and family say that, even at a very early age, Ryan knew  he wanted to serve his country as a Navy SEAL.   After graduating from Illinois Valley Central High School in  Chillicothe, Illinois, in 1998, he took the first steps towards his  goal by enlisting in the Navy.   Ryan served his first tour of duty at the Office of Naval  Intelligence in Suitland, Maryland, eventually completing his SEAL  training in California in 2002. Over the next 15 years, he completed  four tours as a U.S. Navy SEAL, working all over the globe to fight  against terrorism and protect the interests of the United States.   Ryan was 2 years into his fifth tour as a Navy SEAL when he was  tragically killed during an intelligence-gathering operation against an  al-Qaida cell in Yemen.   Throughout his 15 years as a Navy SEAL, Ryan Owens gave much to our  country, protecting our freedoms, and helping rid the world of evil. It  is for these reasons that I introduced H.R. 3109, which will rename the  post office in Chillicothe, Illinois, as the Sr. Chief Ryan Owens Post  Office Building.   My office and I worked closely with the U.S. Postal Service, the U.S.  Navy Congressional Liaison's Office, the Central Illinois Gold Star  Families, and, most importantly, Ryan's family. All of us were  determined to make sure we got this right, choosing a location with  strong ties to the community in which Ryan grew up. In the end, it was  his wife, Carryn, who decided on Chillicothe, the town where Ryan  attended and graduated high school, as the best place for this building  to be renamed in his honor.                                time  1530    I was proud to introduce our bill with overwhelming bipartisan  support here in the House with every member of the Illinois delegation  signing on as a cosponsor in support. It is my hope that the House acts  to pass this bill today and that the Senate will quickly follow suit.   While we can never repay Chief Owens or his family for the sacrifices  he made, renaming the post office in his honor is a small way to thank  him for his service and dedication to protecting our great Nation and  the values that we hold so dear. We continue, today, to pray for Carryn  and his children. We are indebted to his service and his sacrifice to  our great country.    Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Illinois  for his commitment and dedication to this terrific bill that we have  before the House tonight.   Madam Speaker, the people of Illinois are unfortunately all too  familiar with high taxes and the burden they put on families and our  local businesses. At the Federal level, things have become just as bad  with a Tax Code that is over 74,000 pages long and riddled with  loopholes.   Over 30 years have passed since the last time Congress passed  comprehensive tax reform, and you can see the effects of our outdated  Tax Code everywhere. We have stagnant hiring, stagnant wages, and a  stagnant economy that is holding back our middle class instead of  helping them get ahead.   H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, is our chance to change all of  this. By simplifying our Tax Code and bringing real relief to everyday  families, we can, once again, jump-start the American economy and get  it back to working for the middle class.   The choice before us is a simple one: Do we support this bill and  support the middle class, or do we embrace the status quo? That is why  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come together and  vote for this bill. Let's send a signal that we don't stand for the  status quo. We stand for growth and economic opportunity for the  American people. Let us bring relief to the middle class. Support this  bill.
