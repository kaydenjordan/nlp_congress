 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlelady from New  York--and let me say the gentlelady from New York has served these  United States so admirably and so effectively and with such dignity and  honor. Gentle because she has a big heart soft for this country. She  mentioned the civility and the commitment to civil discourse. She was  part of leading that effort and leading by example. A gentlelady, she  was class every day and in every way in her term in serving the people  of New York in her district. Gentlelady from New York, she is a New  Yorker, and I am a Texan. The only folk I know who may rival Texas in  toughness are New Yorkers. She is tough, she is strong, she is  passionate, and she fought every day for her constituents and for this  country she loves.   So I just wanted to say that it has been an honor and a privilege to  serve with Claudia Tenney, United States Representative, Claudia  Tenney.   I am a better person, I am a better servant leader, and I am a better  Representative of my people in west Texas because of the time I spent  with you. So I know your folks back home are proud, your freshman  class--and I will say this on behalf of our freshman class, and I can  say it with confidence--you make us proud. We are going to miss you,  but I know we haven't seen the last of you and your service to this  country.    Mr. Speaker, I wanted to address this body and commend  my Republican colleagues for standing with this President.   We are facing a national security crisis on our own homeland, at our  borders, and our Commander in Chief has pleaded with us for the  resources and tools necessary to secure the border and to protect the  American people.   The President understands his first job and the first job of the  Federal Government, which is to keep its citizens safe. He understands  and I believe most Americans understand that the current situation is  anything but safe.   Mr. Speaker, I am from the great State of Texas. Being a State along  the border, I can tell you it is absolutely chaotic. This President has  been hamstrung and for too long we have let people pour into this  country illegally and we have allowed criminals and gang members and  criminal activity and drugs. A lot of bad stuff comes over here and  wreaks havoc on our communities on account of us being derelict in our  duty to do our first job to provide for the common defense.   So, Mr. Speaker, this President has come along at such a time as  this--a strong man, a strong leader, who ran on an agenda to put  America first and the American people first. That is exactly what he  has done. I have never seen a politician more hell-bent, more doggedly  committed to delivering on what he promised.   At the center of those promises and that agenda that he ran on was  securing the border and building the wall. I am one who believes that  comprehensive border security is more than a wall. I believe it is  technology. I believe it is boots on the ground. It is a number of  things.   If we are going to truly be effective in the long run, we have got to  fight this battle on a number of fronts. I believe that the driver of  illegal immigration is supply and demand. As long as we have demand in  this world for a better life and for the job opportunity and the  services that we provide in this country, and as long as we provide the  supply of jobs and services to folks who come here illegally, they will  continue to come.   I do believe that, no matter how high you build a wall, or how long,  you have got to turn off the magnets that are drawing people here.  Chief among them are hiring people who are not in this country legally.  I welcome the freedom-loving, law-abiding immigrant. This is a Nation  of immigrants. But I will only welcome them if and when they respect  our laws, our sovereignty, and the safety of our citizens.   We have a process. It is not perfect. We should work on it. We should  improve it. But we have a process by which you can legally enter this  country, and a million people do that every year. Millions more are  standing in line to get a piece of this incredible land of opportunity  and all the blessings of liberty that this country offers.   So, understand this. The American story and the story of the  immigrant are indistinguishable, inseparable. I am proud that we are  the leading Nation in terms of immigration and welcoming the immigrant  and that we continue to circulate the new blood of those who are hungry  for freedom and opportunity into the system, into this country's  bloodstream. It is part of the greatness of America, no doubt.   But we are also a Nation of laws. As the President has said, without  borders, you don't have a country. Without security, you don't have  freedom. So we must uphold the laws of the land. We must fix the broken  pieces of the immigration system. We must close the loopholes. We must  turn off the magnets. And, yes, we must build a wall, a fence, and  whatever physical barriers make sense. That physical barrier, that  wall, that fence is a fundamental component of comprehensive border  security.    Most of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have already  voted to  [[Page H10507]]  provide resources: $1.6 billion in the last budget. The leader of the  Senate Democrats, Chuck Schumer, has voted for 700 miles of fencing  along the border. So he, too, has committed and understands and  appreciates the need for physical barriers along the border where they  make sense.   I think we are long overdue to put some common sense in this United  States Congress. I am proud that my colleagues, again, on the House  side, my Republican colleagues, have continued to drive the agenda of  America first and keeping America safe as the first and foremost  responsibility of this Federal Government all the way to the end of  this 115th Congress.   Today was a proud day for me to come alongside of my colleagues and  this President and vote for the funding that he has requested for that  fundamental component of border security in the wall. I am proud to  have done that. I am grateful that we have a leadership that listened.  This morning, we had a wonderful meeting. It was wonderful because the  leadership listened. Our majority leader, Kevin McCarthy; our whip,   Steve Scalise, our outgoing Speaker, Paul Ryan, listened and allowed  the Members to drive the strategy and the decision today to put that  funding bill on the floor, to vote for it, and send it over to the  Senate. That is our job.   I am proud of my colleagues' passionate and very compelling pleas to  the leadership and to our team to make that vote happen today. Today is  a great day for America's security. It is a great day for border  States. It is a great day for the citizens who expect their government  to do its first job.   Mr. Speaker, again, I am grateful for the opportunity to have served  in this 115th Congress with the likes of Jack Bergman, Representative  Claudia Tenney, and so many more. I am proud of our freshmen class for  restoring civility, the theme of our class with our Democratic  colleagues, and I am proud of all the results.   In west Texas, leadership, at the end of the day, is about results.  If you don't deliver results, you cannot claim to be a leader. Whether  it was rebuilding military or unleashing the full potential of this  economy through tax reform and regulatory relief or improving services  to our veterans or it was defending our fundamental God-given rights,  the rule of law, the Constitution, and traditional American values, we  have done what we said we would do in this House as Republicans, as  conservatives, and as Americans first. I am proud of that.   God bless these United States of America, my colleagues, and go west  Texas.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Tenney).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New York.  Again, we salute her service and we are so proud to have served with  her, if only for one term. But, again, this is not the last that we  have seen of the gentlewoman and her service to this great country. We  will certainly carry on our friendship for years and years to come.   What a special bond our classmates have, and what a unique privilege  our constituents and people back home have given us.   And I know the gentlewoman cherishes that. I know she has stewarded  that. I wish they could see the gentlewoman every day, because they are  already proud, but they don't know the half of it.   So God bless Claudia Tenney and all the new ventures that she will  undertake in the weeks, months, and years to come.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.
