 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I would like to take a moment today to talk  about the ongoing efforts by the Senate Republicans to take away health  insurance from millions of Americans by repealing the Affordable Care  Act.   I was here on the floor just a couple of weeks ago reading letters  from my constituents about how they have benefited from the ACA and  what TrumpCare would mean for them based on what we had seen of their  bill so far. Since then, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  have continued forging ahead in their effort to repeal the ACA, in  spite of overwhelming opposition. Indeed, nearly every major healthcare  organization representing patients, doctors, nurses, and hospitals,  among others, is opposed to this misguided effort, and that is on top  of the millions of Americans who know firsthand how devastating  TrumpCare would be for them and their families.   Senate Republicans are working on tweaks to convince their colleagues  to vote for this disastrous bill. Unfortunately, their so-called  ``fixes'' are not improvements. That is because, in my view, TrumpCare  is fatally flawed and cannot be fixed. My constituents know better and  have continued to write and call--even stopping me in stores and on the  streets--to express their opposition and fear, quite frankly, of all  versions of the Senate TrumpCare bill.   For example, my Republican colleagues are looking to add a provision  that would bring us back to the days when insurance companies could  deny coverage or charge exorbitant amounts for those with preexisting  conditions. The Affordable Care Act ended this practice once and for  all, we hope, and I can't imagine why my colleagues want to bring back  those discriminatory policies. However, the amendments that several  Senators have proposed would do just that. They would allow insurance  companies to sell plans on the marketplace with no protections for  those with preexisting conditions, which would create a death spiral in  the marketplace, so that the very people who need health insurance the  most would be priced out entirely.   Just last week, I heard from Anne in North Smithfield, RI, about this  very issue. Anne said:         I am the parent of a childhood cancer survivor. The last 11       months of my life have been fighting alongside my warrior, my       hero, my 9-year-old osteosarcoma survivor, Julia. She loves       unicorns, horses, the beach, and going for walks. Due to no       fault of her own, she hasn't been able to walk for the past       11 months.        I am writing to ask for your support to ensure that all       children fighting cancer have access to affordable, quality       healthcare. If enacted into law, the current proposal for the       healthcare bill will have devastating impacts on the hundreds       of thousands affected by childhood cancer. Without quality       health insurance and access to treatment, my child would not       have survived.    Anne went on to explain that the Republican efforts to undermine  preexisting conditions protections would be devastating for childhood  cancer survivors. Even parents who get their insurance through their  employer would be at risk. Anne pointed out that nearly half of  families of children with cancer will experience gaps in coverage  because one or both parents often need to stop working or reduce their  hours to care for the child.   Further, TrumpCare erodes other critical consumer protections by  allowing annual and lifetime limits on care.  [[Page S3951]]    Anne continues her message:         Additionally, childhood cancer patients must be assured of       access to essential health benefits without the threat of       lifetime or annual caps that would effectively price patients       out of lifesaving treatments. Two-thirds of childhood cancer       survivors will develop serious health conditions from the       toxicity of treatment. My child's future is already uncertain       enough. We should not have to worry about annual or lifetime       caps on coverage.    I agree with Anne. What use is healthcare coverage that expires just  when you need it the most? Why would anyone think it makes sense to  sell a health insurance policy for thousands of dollars that doesn't  actually cover anything--or nothing--when you need it? This is a step  in the wrong direction, and I continue to urge my Republican colleagues  to reverse course.   I would also like to talk about what this bill would do to those  suffering from opioid addiction, a public health crisis that has taken  a tremendous toll on our country and particularly on my home State of  Rhode Island.   I, along with many of my Democratic colleagues, have been talking  about how the Senate TrumpCare bill would pull the rug out from many of  those who are suffering from substance use disorders, like opioid  addiction, by decimating Medicaid, which is how many people suffering  from the opioid crisis access treatment.   News reports suggest that Republicans are considering adding a fund  for opioid addiction treatment as another so-called fix to the  TrumpCare bill. While we absolutely need more Federal funding to expand  access to drug treatment--in fact, I have been urging Republican  leaders to do just that for years--what they are proposing cannot make  up for the bill's nearly $800 billion in cuts to Medicaid with a $45  billion opioid fund. The math simply doesn't work.   Second, short-term drug treatment programs do not provide a full  spectrum of healthcare coverage over the long term, like Medicaid or  other health insurance coverage. The Medicaid expansion under the ACA  has provided the security of reliable healthcare coverage and long-term  stability to help people with chronic conditions such as substance use  disorders seek treatment and turn their lives around. TrumpCare takes  that away.   In addition, people with opioid addiction suffer from other mental  health conditions at twice the rate of the general population and  higher rates of physical health conditions as well, which would still  go unaddressed in this so-called fix. We will be setting people up for  failure if we provide immediate drug treatment services but cut access  to the other mental and physical healthcare services they need.   An opioid fund alone will not solve this public health crisis and, in  fact, would be a drop in the bucket compared to how the rest of this  bill would worsen the crisis.   The cuts to Medicaid under the Senate TrumpCare bill are beyond  repair. The Senate TrumpCare bill fundamentally changes the structure  of the Medicaid Program, making massive cuts, representing a 35-percent  cut over the next two decades. Simply put, this will end the Medicaid  Program as we know it, which will hurt not only those suffering from  the opioid crisis but also seniors, children, and people with  disabilities. We may see Republicans try to spread out this harm over  more years to hide the damage, but do not be fooled. Whether they make  massive cuts to Medicaid in 2021 or 2022 or even 2026, for that matter,  the cuts will be devastating.   In short, no fix can undo the damage this bill will cause. This bill  is a massive tax break for the wealthiest Americans at the expense of  everyone else. No amendment or tweak to the bill will change that.   Sharon from Wakefield, RI, wrote to me just a couple of days ago and  summed this up very well. She said:         I do not support the so-called American Health Care Act       because it is not a health care plan, it is a tax cut for the       rich. I am 67 years old, and I have a mild version of       muscular dystrophy, and I have Medicaid. Since the GOP wants       to end Medicaid, I am asking you to vote NO on the bill.    Republicans must abandon this effort and come to the table to work  with Democrats on a new path forward. Let's have productive  conversations about how we can improve access to care and bring down  costs. Let's harness this interest in improving access to drug  treatment and work together on those efforts. But, coupled with the  TrumpCare bill, those efforts will not mitigate the damage this bill  will inflict on my constituents and those across the country.   I hope those on the other side of the aisle who have expressed  misgivings will oppose TrumpCare in all of its forms so that we can  work together on a bipartisan solution and attempt to do something  positive for our constituents.   With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
