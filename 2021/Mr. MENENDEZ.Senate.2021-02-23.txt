The total estimated cost is       $91.2 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security of the United States by improving the       security of a trusted partner which is an important force for       political stability and economic progress in Europe. It is       vital to the U.S. national interest to assist Finland in       developing and maintaining a strong and ready self-defense       capability.        Finland intends to use these defense articles and services       to modernize its armed forces. Finland intends to expand its       existing army architecture to counter potential threats. This       will contribute to the Finland military's goal to upgrade its       capability while enhancing interoperability between Finland,       the United States, and other allies. Finland will have no       difficulty absorbing these missiles into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be Lockheed Martin       Corporation, Missile and Fire Control, Grand Prairie, TX.       There are no known offsets associated with this potential       sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of U.S. Government or contractor representatives       to Finland.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 21-16       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act, as           amended        (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The ER GMLRS provides a persistent, responsive, all-      weather, rapidly deployed, long range, surface-to-surface,       area- and point-precision strike capability. The AW variant       (XM403, also referred to as M30A2) carries a 200-pound       fragmentation assembly filled with high explosives which,       upon detonation, accelerates two layers of preformed       penetrators optimized for effectiveness against large area       and imprecisely located targets. The Unitary variant (XM404,       also referred to as M31A2) is a 200-pound class unitary with       a steel blast-fragmentation case, designed for low collateral       damage against point targets. The ER GMLRS maintains the       accuracy and effectiveness demonstrated by the baseline GMLRS       out to a maximum range of 150 km (double of GMLRS capability)       while also including a new Height Of Burst (HOB) capability.        2. The highest level of classified information associated       with the sale of this equipment is SECRET.        3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures or       equivalent systems that might reduce weapon system       effectiveness or be used in the development of a system with       similar or advanced capabilities.        4. A determination has been made that Finland can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        5. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the Government of Finland.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.

Jordan will use this asset to enhance training of pilots.       Jordan will have no difficulty absorbing these training       center assets and simulators into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be Lockheed Martin       Corporation Rotary & Mission Systems, Orlando, FL. There are       no known offset agreements proposed in connection with this       potential sale.
