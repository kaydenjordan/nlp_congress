 Mr. Speaker, the President has set a dangerous  precedent by crying wolf in the name of national emergency.   I represent parts of the southern Arizona border. My community knows  the border. We know the further away from the border you live, the more  fictional the border narrative.   Border crossings are down to one-fifth of what they were in 2000, and  apprehensions are at their lowest level in more than four decades.  Those are facts.   Instead of protecting our national security, the President's  declaration makes America less safe. The President is stealing billions  from high-priority military construction projects that ensure our  troops have the essential training and resources they need to keep the  American people safe.   We will not sit by when the President abuses his power. I am  confident that my Republican colleagues will regret supporting this  false national emergency when there is a Democrat in the White House.                            ____________________
