 Madam President, I have great respect for my colleague  from South Carolina. We are going to serve together on the Aging  Committee, leading the committee.   I oppose this amendment for some basic reasons. No. 1 is he cited the  number of deaths in long-term care facilities across the country. More  than 150,000 people are dead in long-term care. The last administration  didn't even count those deaths until May of 2020, despite efforts by  Members of this body to urge the administration to do that.   They never had a plan. They didn't help the States. This is an  effort, an ongoing effort, to blame States when the Federal Government  dropped the ball when it came to long-term care.   I think we can do better than that. We should be helping nursing  homes with the resources they need, like resources for cohorting where  you can separate a resident with COVID-19 from those who don't have it.   We should be providing money for strike teams in ways to help nursing  homes. Let's reduce the deaths instead of pointing fingers.
