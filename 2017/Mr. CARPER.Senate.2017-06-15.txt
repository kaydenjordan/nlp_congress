 Mr. President, I thank my friend, my neighbor from  Maryland, for inviting a number of us to come to the floor today, this  afternoon, to talk a bit about the Affordable Care Act. I am really  honored to stand next to him here as we do sit next to each other on  the Finance Committee and on the Environment and Public Works  Committee. He is a great leader on both of those committees.    Mr. President, it is nice to see the Presiding Officer  again today--again and again. I don't know if I will be your last  speaker, but I will try not to keep you here too long just in case.   I know the Presiding Officer has been through Delaware a time or two  and the Senator from Louisiana has been through my State. I have been  through theirs.   I am going to talk about a 14-year-old young man who lives in  Delaware. I used to say to my friend from Louisiana: Thanks for  working, trying to get us to pull together and do something across the  aisle on healthcare. We will see how it turns out.   If you come up I-95 on your way to Philadelphia, PA, Trenton, NJ, New  York City, Boston, or Maine, you pass through Delaware. As you cross  from Maryland into Delaware heading north, you cross into Delaware and  go through the toll plaza, and then almost immediately you are at the  intersection of a road called State Route 896, a north-south highway.   If you happen to go north on 896, you go into Newark, DE, and you go  right by the University of Delaware, which is there in Newark, DE. We  don't pronounce it Newark. We pronounce it New-ark, as if it were two  words--New-ark. Even though it is one word, we pronounce it as if it  were two words, New-ark.   If you go north, you go on 896, you go right into the University of  Delaware. I took that road over 40 years ago while I was still in the  Navy and on leave with the Navy, trying to figure out where to go to  graduate school. I went north on 896 and ended up falling in love with  the University of Delaware and applied to graduate school there, and I  made my life in Delaware.   If you go south on 896--when you intersect 896 and I-95, you don't go  to the University of Delaware. You don't go to Newark. You go south to  a town called Middletown. It is one word. There are some extraordinary  athletes, high school athletes in Middletown.   For many years, their principal high school was Middletown High  School. They have a couple of other schools there now, but one is  Appoquinimink High School. In Middletown, they are the Cavaliers. The  other is the Jaguars. The Jaguars have a new school; Appoquinimink is a  newer school. Middletown has been around forever. They have a history  of great athletes.   Year after year, they have won championships, including football-- State  [[Page S3550]]  football championships--and men's sports and women's sports. The key to  their successes is that these kids grew up together, and they played  sports when they were Peewees. They played sports when they were in  middle school. By the time they got to high school, they had worked  together, trained together, and knew each other, and they did well as a  team.   I met another athlete from Middletown a couple of weeks ago. He came  by my office with, I believe, his mom. I think it was his mom. We have  a photograph of him right here. He is an unlikely athlete. He is 14  years old. He is from Middletown, DE. His mom's name is Jennifer.   They told me what it was like for Michael--Michael Davis--to grow up  in and live with a disease called cystic fibrosis. Before we talked  much about cystic fibrosis and his preexisting condition, we talked  about something we have a passion about, and that is running.   I am all of 70 years old. I still work out every day. I have been  doing this since I was a brandnew ensign in the Navy and on my way to  Pensacola, FL, to become a naval flight officer and serve our country  around the world.   I like to run every day. This guy does, too--almost every day. There  is a difference. The difference is that he has cystic fibrosis. I will  talk about what that means in a minute, but despite the lung condition  he has, he has defied the odds to be alive today--and not just to be  alive today, but to become quite an athlete.   I don't know how many people in the Chamber--I look at our new pages  who are here, their first week on the job, and I don't know how many of  them have run half marathons. I run have run quite a few in Delaware  over the years, but I don't have cystic fibrosis. This guy can run a  half marathon and beat me into the floor and beat me into the road, at  least. I need to yield to him when he goes by.   We have been joined on the floor today by the majority leader. When  he shows up, along with a guy who is a fast runner, I yield to them. I  will yield to the leader so he can take care of business, and then I  will pick up when he finishes.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Delaware.                            ____________________     Mr. President, earlier, just before the leader came to  give his closing remarks for the day, I was talking about that Michael  Davis is going to be a freshman at Middletown High School about 20  miles south of Newark where 896 intersects with I-95.   I was mentioning that Michael has succeeded in life as an athlete in  ways that a lot of people think could just never happen. He has a  disease called cystic fibrosis, and it was diagnosed very early in his  life, but it is a genetic disease.   I talked with him and his mom Jennifer about that disease and how it  affects our bodies. It is a disease that causes persistent lung  infection. According to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the condition  is caused apparently by a defective gene that causes a thick buildup of  mucus in our lungs and in other organs; and that mucus can clog our  airways and trap bacteria that leads to infection, can lead to  extensive lung damage and, in worst cases, to respiratory failure and  then possibly maybe even likely death.   This is a disease that 14-year-old Michael Davis lives with. I have  heard, for somebody who has cystic fibrosis to run any distance at all,  they--I ran this morning, and I felt like I had some kind of disease.  It was humid out there. I think it was probably higher levels of ozone  than I like to run in.   For folks with cystic fibrosis like Michael, breathing is like they  are breathing through a straw. Imagine that, trying to run 5 kilometers  or a half marathon, which is 13.1 miles, and to be able to breathe  through a straw effectively and still run distances like that is truly,  truly remarkable, but that is what he does.   Earlier this year, he completed, as I said, the New York City half  marathon, and one of the people who ran with him was my son  Christopher, who is a triathlete in his own right. He is 28 years old  and a great runner. He, also like Michael, can run me into the ground,  and I am proud of them both.   Michael was diagnosed during a screening, I think, just 3 weeks after  he was born. He was 3 weeks old, and he was diagnosed with this  disease. His mom said she was shocked. To her knowledge, there weren't  any members of her family on her side or the father's side who had  cystic fibrosis, but this was a diagnosis made 3 weeks into Michael's  life--imagine that, 3 weeks.   After the diagnosis, his mom Jennifer faced some scary unknowns as  she learned more about his condition, including average life expectancy  for those who have cystic fibrosis.   She immediately sought care for Michael at the Children's Hospital  that is up the road from us--I live in Wilmington, DE--but it is up the  road 25 miles north of Wilmington. For the last 14 years, Michael has  been treated at that hospital. Obviously, the fact that he can run a  half marathon with cystic fibrosis suggests that he is getting  exceptional care there.   Michael sees the doctor about every 8 weeks when he is feeling well.  He sees a doctor more often when he is not feeling well, when he is  feeling really sick.   He wakes up every morning at 4:30. I get up around 5:30, and he has  already been up for an hour when I get up in Wilmington, DE. He does it  to use a high-frequency chest wall oscillation device. They call it The  Vest. What it does is, it helps break up the mucus in his lungs, and he  continues to use The Vest several times throughout the day. He must  also take over--are you ready for this--40 medications every day. So  that is his regimen.   He gets up every day at 4:30, straps on The Vest, uses it several  times throughout the day. The Vest shakes up his lungs and the mucus  there so he can live, and he takes all his medications as well.   He told me, when we met with him and his mom a couple weeks ago, that  cystic fibrosis is very frustrating, but he copes by trying to lead a  healthy lifestyle. Just last week, Michael received national attention  when he was named the Boomer Esiason Co-Athlete of the Year. Boomer was  a great football quarterback, if I am not mistaken--I am tempted to say  with the Cincinnati Bengals. I am looking for the pages to tell me  whether I am right or wrong, but I think I am right. The Boomer Esiason  Co-Athlete of the Year is Delaware's own Michael, and we are very proud  of Michael, very proud of Michael.   The fact is, access to these treatments and medications are really a  matter of life and death for people with cystic fibrosis. If something  should happen and Michael and his family would lose healthcare, they  would reach out and try to get coverage. Before we had the Affordable  Care Act, there was a pretty good likelihood that finding that coverage  would be very difficult, and it would be difficult because he has  cystic fibrosis. He is not an inexpensive young man to take care of. To  keep him alive and well and able to go to school and do the amazing  regimen that he does takes money and resources, medicine and medical  technology.   The way healthcare used to be provided in this country, when somebody  had a preexisting condition like cystic fibrosis and they lost their  healthcare--maybe a parent was working, had coverage, and lost the  healthcare, lost the job--the person, in this case Michael, would have  been out of luck because a lot of the health insurers used to say:  Well, we don't want to cover this person because it is going to cost us  a boatload of money.   I know there are problems with the Affordable Care Act. There are  things I would like to change. What I hope we will do at the end of the  day is not get rid of it and not just repeal it, but I hope we will  retain that which is good and fix the things that ought to be fixed.   One of the things that needs to be retained is the idea that there  should be a prohibition against insurance companies simply saying that  if somebody has a preexisting condition and they lose coverage, they  can continue to be denied coverage. They can get the coverage they  need, and that is one of the very, very good things about the  Affordable Care Act.   Our new pages here, you guys are about 2 years older than Michael  Davis. Hopefully, you guys will live to be 100 or more. The only reason  he is alive today is because he has access to the kind of healthcare we  all want for our children and really for our parents.   I am a big believer--our pages hear me. I know they will only be here  for 3 weeks, but they will probably hear me, when they come to the  floor, talk about the Golden Rule. It is something that was impressed  upon me at an early age, about the age of all of you. The Golden Rule  goes something like this: Treat other people the way we want to be  treated. It is pretty simple.  [[Page S3562]]    I grew up in a Protestant Church, but I don't care whether you are  Protestant, Catholic, Jew, I don't care if you are Muslim, I don't care  if you are Buddhist, Hindu--you name it--all of those religions, every  one of them, has something in their Sacred Scriptures something like  the Golden Rule: Treat other people the way you want to be treated.   I think we try to do that in the Affordable Care Act, imperfect as it  is. I think one of the best examples of the Golden Rule in the  legislation, in the law, is the idea that if somebody loses coverage  and they have a preexisting condition, we don't just cast them aside  and say: Well, that is too bad. We give them another shot to get the  coverage they need.   In the case of Michael Davis, the coverage, the access to healthcare,  keeps him alive and not just alive to mope around and feel sorry for  himself but to go out and run circles around the rest of us. He is an  inspiration to me, and I think he is an inspiration to all who know  him.   Mr. President, I think I may possibly be the last speaker. I am going  to bid you good night and see you next week.                            ____________________
