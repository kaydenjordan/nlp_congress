 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of  Congressman   Tom Reed's bill, H.R. 1138, which authorizes funding for  the cleanup of the West Valley demonstration project, the nuclear waste  remediation site in western New York.   Mr. Speaker, advocates are in Washington this week to remind Congress  of the importance of the Great Lakes as a source of clean water for  millions of Americans. The long-term cleanup at West Valley, which sits  30 miles from Lake Erie and at the foot of a tributary stream, will  prevent harmful contamination to the region.   The Department of Energy has an obligation to ensure that 600,000  gallons of high-level radioactive waste are solidified and disposed of  safely and expeditiously. The funding in this bill will allow us to do  just that.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
