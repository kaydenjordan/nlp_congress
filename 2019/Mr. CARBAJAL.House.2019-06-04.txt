 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6, the  American Dream and Promise Act of 2019.   This Nation was founded by immigrants who believed that if you work  hard and play by the rules, you can achieve the American Dream.   When the Trump administration announced its heartless decision to  rescind DACA protections, it turned its back on the core beliefs of our  country and put over 800,000 young immigrants who know America as their  only home in a state of fear.   Dreamers are hardworking and law-abiding Americans. They are our  military servicemen and -women, our neighbors, and our children's  classmates. They make our country a better place for all.   After years of tireless advocacy and living in distress, Dreamers and  TPS recipients deserve clarity. I am proud to support H.R. 6, which  will offer them an earned pathway to citizenship. Now more than ever,  we must stand firmly behind our Dreamers and acknowledge their  countless social, economic, and cultural contributions to the United  States.   Please know that I will not stop fighting for all young immigrants  and Dreamers. I urge my colleagues to support the passage of H.R. 6  this week.                            ____________________
