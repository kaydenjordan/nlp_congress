 Madam Speaker, while we have many different approaches  about restarting our economy, we should all agree the Paycheck  Protection Program has provided a vital lifeline to small businesses  and communities across America, including west Michigan.   For example, media reports are that Macatawa Bank, a community bank  based in Holland, Michigan, was able to process over $300 million in  PPP loans. This will help keep paychecks coming to more than 27,000  hardworking people in west Michigan.   In Wellington, Michigan, I heard from an owner of a bowling alley  whose business was literally saved by the PPP. His employees are  getting paid, he can pay his bills, and his business has avoided  bankruptcy.   Even with these successes, I have heard from employers across my  district waiting to receive their loan. While I am glad that is  happening today, it shouldn't have taken this long.   Now, Madam Speaker, as we discuss the next steps the Federal  Government can take, I encourage the Speaker and my colleagues to  support H.R. 6433, a bill I introduced on April 3, the Heroes Act, as a  way to say thank you to the first responders and medical professionals  risking their lives on a daily basis to save the lives of others.
