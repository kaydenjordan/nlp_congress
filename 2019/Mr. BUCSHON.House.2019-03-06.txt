 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1, the  Democrat politician protection act. This legislation is a radical  attempt to hijack our free and fair election system, and limit the  voices of the American people.   For example, in H.R. 1, Democrats are proposing the public financing  of elections which would force Americans' hard-earned tax dollars to be  subsidizing political campaigns they do not support, limiting  constitutionally guaranteed freedoms of speech and association.   Furthermore, this one-size-fits-all Federal takeover of the election  process will open the door for voting irregularities through Federal  mandates on voter registration and voting practices that will be forced  on the States--a massive Federal power grab.   Last time I checked, voting happens at the State level, and is the  right and responsibility of the State and local governments.   They say this only affects Federal elections, but does anyone really  believe that the States will have two separate systems? I am in full  support of increasing voter registration participation in our election  process. Unfortunately, this legislation goes far beyond increasing  voter participation, and, instead, is a misguided attempt to rig our  Nation's electoral systems for the benefit of the Democratic Party by  telling Americans, once again, that the Federal Government and  Washington bureaucrats know best.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this liberty- and freedom- limiting legislation.
