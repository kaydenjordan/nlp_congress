 Mr. President, section 251 of the Balanced Budget and  Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, BBEDCA, establishes statutory  limits on discretionary spending and allows for various adjustments to  those limits, while sections 302 and 314(a) of the Congressional Budget  Act of 1974 allow the chairman of the Budget Committee to establish and  make revisions to allocations, aggregates, and levels consistent with  those adjustments. The Senate is considering H.R. 244, the Consolidated  Appropriations Act, 2017. This measure provides full-year  appropriations for Federal Government agencies and contains spending  that qualifies for cap adjustments under current statute.   This measure includes $93,470 million in budget authority that is  designated as being for overseas contingency operations/global war on  terrorism pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(ii) of BBEDCA. Of that  amount, $76,985 million is for spending in the security category, and  $16,485 million is for nonsecurity spending. CBO estimates that this  budget authority will result in $41,444 million in outlays in fiscal  year 2017.   Division F includes $6,713 million in nonsecurity discretionary  budget authority that is designated as being for disaster relief  pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(D) of BBEDCA. This designation makes the  spending associated with this provision and its associated outlays of  $336 million eligible for an adjustment.   This legislation includes language that increases nonsecurity  discretionary budget authority by $1,444 million this year and  designates it as emergency funding pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(i)  of BBEDCA. CBO estimates this budget authority will result in $497  million in outlays in fiscal year 2017.   Finally, division H provides $1,960 in nonsecurity discretionary  budget authority for program integrity efforts. This funding is  designated pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(C) and section 251(b)(2)(B) of  BBEDCA. CBO estimates that this budget authority will result in $1,635  million in outlays this year.   As a result of the aforementioned designations, I am revising the  budget authority and outlay allocations to the Committee on  Appropriations by increasing revised security budget authority by  $76,985 million, revised nonsecurity budget authority by $26,602  million, and increasing outlays by $43,912 million in fiscal year 2017.  Further, I am increasing the budgetary aggregate for fiscal year 2017  by $103,161 million in budget authority and outlays by $43,541 million.   I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables, which provide  details about the adjustment, be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                      REVISION TO BUDGETARY AGGREGATES  (Pursuant to Sections 311 and 314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of                                   1974) ------------------------------------------------------------------------                  $s in millions                            2017 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Current Spending Aggregates:     Budget Authority...........................                3,226,128     Outlays....................................                3,224,630 Adjustments:     Budget Authority...........................                  103,161     Outlays....................................                   43,541 Revised Spending Aggregates:     Budget Authority...........................                3,329,289     Outlays....................................                3,268,171 ------------------------------------------------------------------------    REVISION TO SPENDING ALLOCATION TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS FOR                             FISCAL YEAR 2017  (Pursuant to Sections 302 and 314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of                                   1974) ------------------------------------------------------------------------                  $s in millions                            2017 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Current Allocation:     Revised Security Discretionary Budget                        557,015      Authority.................................
