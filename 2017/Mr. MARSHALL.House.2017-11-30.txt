 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome the more than 40  volunteers from 26 States representing Ducks Unlimited who are on the  Hill today.   As an avid outdoorsman and waterfowler myself, as well as a member of  Ducks Unlimited for over 25 years, I have seen the wonderful firsthand  benefits this group provides. Ducks Unlimited has conserved more than  14 million acres of land in its 80-year history, 25,000 of which are in  my home State of Kansas. I send a big thank-you for all those folks up  north of us who have done such a great job raising these ducks.   Work like this is vital to ensuring that the natural resources of our  land are protected and monitored so that our children and grandchildren  can come someday to rural Kansas, from Cheyenne Bottoms to the Quivira  Wildlife Refuge, and enjoy those great outdoor moments.   I thank the folks at Ducks Unlimited for their work, and I welcome  them to Capitol Hill.                            ____________________
