 Madam Speaker, our Nation's economic prosperity and  national security interests are secured due to energy-rich districts  like Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District.   That is why, during the recent August district work month, while in  Montrose, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, I visited Cabot Oil & Gas,  one of Pennsylvania's largest natural gas producers.   On any given day, Pennsylvania's 12th District is well positioned to  help make the United States a net energy exporter by producing as much  as 10 percent of the country's natural gas. Equally important is the  great partner that energy producers have become with local governments  and educational institutions.   As a member of the House Education and Labor Committee, I know the  importance of bringing industry and education together to enhance  workforce development, especially in rural areas. That is why it made  me proud to see Cabot partnering with Lackawanna College School of  Petroleum and Natural Gas as a means to provide career-ready job skills  in the natural gas industry. Thanks to this partnership, students are  able to make family-sustaining wages and have a career in an industry  that will remain in Pennsylvania for generations.   Congress should use this example, set in Susquehanna County and  throughout Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District, for how  partnerships with private-sector job creators can lead to a better  future.                            ____________________
