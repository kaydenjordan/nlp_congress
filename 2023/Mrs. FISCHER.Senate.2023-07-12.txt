 Madam President, when it comes to the economy, we hear  a lot about numbers, the inflation rate, how much more groceries cost,  or how many businesses are struggling to find employees. Those numbers  are important.   They tell us the big picture story of where our economy is and where  it is going. And right now, that is not a pretty picture. But as  elected representatives, we work for our people. It is critical that we  listen to the voices of the people who live in our States and who are  being deeply affected by the numbers we read in Bloomberg or the Wall  Street Journal.   In a speech he made last week, President Biden promised that his  economic policy is helping across the board ``in rural America, the  heartland, all across America.''   He claimed that Bidenomics is the silver bullet for financial  struggles among middle-class Americans around the country.   I don't know who the President is talking to, but my experience  hearing from Americans in the heartland is a lot different than what he  said in that speech. Many Nebraskans are struggling under an  unforgiving load of inflation, kick-started by this administration's  almost $2 trillion stimulus package in 2021.   So today let's zoom in on Nebraska. When I am back in my home State,  I am constantly hearing stories of hardship from my fellow Nebraskans,  whether they are farmers, teachers, or small business owners. It is  truly painful to hear about some of the experiences people are having  due to inflation.   So let me tell you about Bidenomics in Nebraska. When I stopped by a  coffee shop in 2022, the owner told me his electric bill had  skyrocketed from $40 a month to over $300 a month, and that coffee shop  owner is now gone. He couldn't afford Bidenomics, and he closed his  shop. That is Bidenomics in Nebraska.   A year later, not much has changed. As one of our Nebraska farmers  told me a few weeks ago, ``prices take the elevator up, but the stairs  down.''   Inflation causes costs to rise quickly, and they stay up there for a  long time. One big economically irresponsible move from the  administration--well, that sets the stage for years of struggle. That  is Bidenomics in Nebraska.   Several rural businesses in the States shared their struggles with  the local newspaper earlier this year. Many of these business owners  feel ``at a loss'' for what to do as their livelihoods crumble under  the pressure.  [[Page S2339]]    A honey farmer shared that consistently rising prices squeeze his  family into a difficult position when doing things as simple as putting  their honey in jars. Sometimes they could only afford to get the  container; sometimes they could only afford to get the lids--but not  both.   He said:         We're kind of forgotten about way out here.    That is Bidenomics in Nebraska.   That doesn't line up with the President's boasts of an economy that  works for middle-class Americans in the heartland. Instead, while the  Biden administration chatters on about its support for the middle  class, thousands of people in that category are pulling out all the  stops to pay their necessary expenses.   The Salvation Army of Lincoln, NE, reported a couple of months ago  that it has seen a 50-percent increase in service requests in just a  year. People are going to charities to get help paying rent and  utilities as the economy suffers.   A Salvation Army officer said:         For people who are on medical equipment, having their       electricity on is a very important aspect.    That is Bidenomics in Nebraska.   The President has a middle-class problem. Average Americans are  hollowing out their savings, and they are taking on record debt just to  keep up with the stunning levels of inflation--or as the White House  likes to call it, Bidenomics.   The President said last week:         Bidenomics is just another way of saying restoring the       American Dream.    Wrong.   Since when does the American dream include taking a second job just  to be able to afford rent, or having to choose between containers and  lids for honey jars, or racking your brain for ways to catch up on an  electricity bill that will not stop rising?   The President should step off the podium; he should stop delivering  empty promises; and he should actually get down to business fixing the  bloated economy that he has created.   Nebraskans are not listening to the administration's inflated claims  about helping the middle class, but they are listening to the mortgage  increases and to their dwindling savings accounts. Americans know what  Bidenomics looks like, and it looks like failed leadership.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, last week, we celebrated the birth of  our Nation. The first Americans took long, dangerous journeys across  the Atlantic Ocean in search of better lives, far away from a regime  that stripped away their God-given rights and their freedoms all too  often.   Our Founders fought a revolution against absolute power. They chafed  against the control of the British Empire. Americans united against  encroachments on liberty and emerged victorious, just as we have done  many times since then from Great Britain to the Soviet Union.   As we look back on our history, we should consider our future as  well. The United States faces a threat environment growing more  dangerous by the day. Authoritarian adversaries, including China,  Russia, Iran, and North Korea, are accelerating their efforts to chip  away at global stability and undermine America's national security.   A couple of weeks ago, a radio host asked me an important question:  What is the point of modernizing our nuclear deterrents? Don't we  already have the capabilities we need to defend ourselves? And, if we  build up a stronger arsenal of nuclear weapons, doesn't that just  increase the risk of nuclear war?   My answer was related to the history I have just discussed: From the  Revolutionary War to the world wars to the Cold War, Americans have  prioritized a strong national defense and the tools we need to achieve  that when we are faced with existential threats. The character of war  changed after the advent of nuclear weapons. And during the Cold War,  the United States recognized that we needed to have a strong nuclear  deterrent to preserve the hard-fought peace that we had won. We worked  overtime to ensure that our Commander in Chief had every option to  deter and, if necessary, to fight back against threats.    We were successful. We deterred the Soviet Union from using its  nuclear weapons destructively because its leaders knew we could hit  back harder with a push of a button. It is comparable to a game of  chess: You are never going to make a move that leaves your king  threatened on all sides. If the Soviet Union had deployed a nuclear  weapon, it would have quickly been surrounded on all sides by a  retaliatory strike Moscow knew it might not survive.   A diverse and effective nuclear deterrent gives our country the  ability to say: Checkmate. Not today. And it makes other nations think  hard about what moves they might make. In other words, it deters  authoritarian regimes from attacking the United States and attacking  our allies.   During the Cold War, we prioritized the production of nuclear weapons  and delivery systems because we recognized their essential role in  deterring nuclear conflict. We must return to that mindset if we want  to get ahead of today's looming national security challenges.   Our adversaries understand this. Earlier this year, the U.S.  Strategic Command--STRATCOM--publicly confirmed that China possesses  more intercontinental ballistic missile launchers than we do here in  the United States. China is on track to triple--to triple--its nuclear  arsenal by 2035. That is just a decade away. Stated plainly, one of the  most ominous authoritarian regimes in modern history is building a  nuclear force that is fundamentally altering global deterrence  dynamics, and they are doing it at a pace faster than anyone imagined.   As our adversaries race to expand their nuclear arsenals, what are we  doing here in our country? Well, since the fall of the Berlin Wall, our  Nation has sidelined our nuclear enterprise. We have underinvested in  the modernization of our nuclear triad.   That word ``triad'' refers to the three military fronts of land, sea,  and air. The land-based leg of the triad is comprised of our  intercontinental ballistic missile fleet. The sea-based leg of the  triad refers to our ballistic missile submarines, and the air-based leg  of the triad refers to our bomber fleet and certain fighter aircraft.   A full triad expands the number of options that our Commander in  Chief has at his disposal. Each leg of that triad presents unique  advantages. Military planners need diverse capabilities to ensure that  our Nation can act decisively in any scenario. If we can strike from  anywhere at any time, our adversaries will hesitate before taking  aggressive action.   The problem is that we have been too slow to replace and upgrade  those systems. As former STRATCOM Commander Admiral Richard testified  before the Senate Armed Services Committee last year, we have  ``submarines [that were] built in the `80s and `90s, an air-launched  cruise missile built in the `80s, intercontinental ballistic missiles  built in the `70s, a bomber built in the `60s--part of our nuclear  command and control that predates the internet, and a nuclear weapons  complex that dates back to the Manhattan Project.''   Our nuclear deterrent only serves to deter our adversaries so that no  one will ever use a nuclear weapon if that deterrent that we have is  safe, reliable, and effective. To ensure it remains so in the future,  it must be modernized. Underinvesting is a huge mistake, and we need to  tip the scales back in our favor by bringing our systems rapidly into  the 21st century. The good news is that there is big bipartisan support  for modernization.   I am the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee's  Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, and  [[Page S2344]]  our subcommittee overseas STRATCOM, which is headquartered in my home  State of Nebraska. STRATCOM does indispensable work at the helm of our  Nation's strategic nuclear deterrence.   Over the last 10 years, I have worked with my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle so that we can get key modernization provisions into  the annual National Defense Authorization Act. We have continued this  vital support in the fiscal year 2024 NDAA, which the Senate will  consider this month.   This year, I have also fought to keep the Sea-Launched Cruise Missile  Program--or SLCM--fully funded by the NDAA.   In the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, where we have held multiple  hearings and briefings, classified and unclassified, with senior  military and civilian leaders as well as a number of outside experts,  we concluded--again, on a bipartisan basis--that the Biden  administration's attempts to cancel the SLCM Program would make our  nuclear deterrent less effective in the 2030s and beyond. So we have  included a provision in the bill to create a program of record for  SLCM. This will prevent the premature cancelation of the program  without future congressional consent.    I also fought to secure provisions that would support the Sentinel  Program, which will replace our aging ICBMs across the country. This  program is the most significant and complex weapons system in recent  U.S. history, and it will cover an aggregated land area almost as large  as the State of South Carolina.   Both Chambers of Congress are considering their versions of the NDAA  this month. I am proud of the work that my colleagues and I have  accomplished with this legislative package that is coming to the floor.  I urge my fellow lawmakers as well as the President to support the  vital measures that we have included in this bill. I will continue to  support modernization efforts, and I am confident that we will produce  a strong final NDAA to send to President Biden's desk.   But our work in the Senate isn't done when the NDAA passes. We still  have to back our defense priorities up with real dollars through the  appropriations process. I am a member of the Appropriations Committee,  as is the Presiding Officer, and I know that we are committed to  working together to be able to allocate all the funds that are  necessary so that we can maintain a strong national defense.   The world has changed since the fall of the Berlin Wall, and we are  now, for the first time in history, facing two peer adversaries with  significant nuclear arsenals. Now is not the time to shortchange our  national security. It is a time for us to work together to strengthen  our national security. This means that President Biden needs to  cooperate with Congress so that we can get our NDAA passed.   America was born by uniting in defiance of outside threats, and we  have done it many times since then. I am hopeful that we will live up  to our history as new challenges loom.   As a Member of Congress, I will continue working with colleagues from  across the aisle to strengthen our national security. For the sake of  our safety, our legacy, and our freedom, I urge my fellow Members and  the President himself to do the same.   I yield the floor.
