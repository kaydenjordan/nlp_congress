 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am dismayed to be part of this discussion of H.J. Res.  69.   Day in and day out, we have meaningful debate in committees and the  House floor that reflect very real philosophical differences about the  responsibilities and the limits of the Federal Government. These  differences and world views inevitably reflect differences in values.   Today, I can't understand how my Republican friends can defend values  that allow and promote the cruelest possible killing methods.   Humans have hunted for millennia. This hunting traditionally requires  patience, skill, cunning and encourage, but not sugar doughnuts,  helicopters, gasses, or leg traps.   Today's House joint resolution would overturn this incredibly fair  and reasonable U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service regulation that would  rightly prohibit controversial and scientifically justified killing  methods on 76 million acres of Federal wildlife refuge lands--76  million acres that belong to the American people.                                time  1245    The National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act and the Alaska  National Interest Lands Conservation Act authorize--and, in fact,  require--the Fish and Wildlife Service to maintain the natural  diversity of refuges in Alaska, regardless of State wildlife laws. This  includes protecting healthy populations of apex predators like wolves  and bears.   So this rule would prohibit the inhumane and indiscriminate killing  of keystone species in the national wildlife refuges. This does not  interfere with fair chase hunting methods. It doesn't even prevent  inhumane and indiscriminate killing on State and private lands.   Anyone voting to support this Congressional Review Act resolution  today is tacitly supporting using airplanes and helicopters to scout  land and shoot grizzly bears, killing wolves, black bears, coyote  mothers and their pups and cubs in dens, actually gassing them, and the  trapping of grizzly bears and black bears with steel-jawed leg-hold  traps and wire snares, where they are trapped, bleeding, frightened,  slowly dying of thirst and starvation. Statewide polls show that  Alaskans strongly support eliminating these cruel and unsporting  practices.   Alaska also gains over $2 billion in economic activity for wildlife  viewing, which is five times what it earns from hunting. This makes  economic sense. It is a huge driver of tourism. Many come to Alaska for  the unique opportunity to see bears, wolves, and other keystone  species. They are the very ones at risk if we pass this resolution.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this resolution, to oppose these cruel  and  [[Page H1261]]  inhumane practices. They are not sporting practices, and they violate  any understanding of humane values and respect for nature.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Tsongas).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Tsongas).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Tsongas).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Grijalva), the ranking member of the Committee on Natural  Resources.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. DeFazio), the former ranking member of the Committee on  Natural Resources.   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, let's talk about what this rule didn't do.   First off, ANILCA did not grant the State of Alaska any additional  authority to manage wildlife on Federal lands. This rule is totally  compliant with ANILCA. ANILCA actually prioritizes conservation of  these species we are talking about here today, apex predators, on more  than half the refuges in the State.   As required by ANILCA, the rule ensures that national wildlife  refuges--that is what we are talking about here, wildlife refuges-- conserve species and habitats in their natural diversity. That doesn't  mean you kill the predators so that people who don't have good hunting  skills are going to have an easier time getting a caribou or moose.  That is not what this is supposed to be about on the national wildlife  refuges. It actually prioritizes conservation of these species.   I just heard that something about this will severely restrict hunting  and fishing on these lands. Absolutely not true, unless you say  shooting wolves and their pups in the den or gassing them in the den is  hunting--and we are restricting that.   Bears and cubs would be killed during hibernation, hunters crawling  around killing bears during hibernation. No, hunters don't do that.   Brown and black bears would be trapped, snared using steel-jawed  traps, wire snares--again, not hunters, not sportsmen.   Luring and baiting grizzly bears? Wow. Now, that is a real  sportsmanlike hunter with a lot of skills kind of guy or woman who has  to use bait to kill a grizzly bear.                                time  1300    Aerial gunning of bears by State agency personnel, that is hunters?  No, not quite.   Sportsmen? No, don't think so.   And using aircraft to track bears and kill in the same day, those are  the things that would be prohibited. That is what is prohibited.   Subsistence hunting? Absolutely no impact.   Fishing? Fish? I guess the fishing thing would be the grizzly bears  eat the fish, and people who don't have good fishing skills want to  catch the fish. So if we kill the grizzly bears, they won't eat the  fish. So it does impact fishing, I guess, sort of, maybe. No, it  doesn't.   This is absolutely inhumane, unsportsmanlike, and unnecessary. The  State of Alaska is doing this just to decrease the natural balance of  predation, which actually creates healthier herds of caribou and  healthier moose populations.   There was a study done in 2015 by professors from both Alaska and  Washington that showed that actually having these predators present  increases the health and the diversity of the herds of caribou, because  the sick and the lame and the old get killed, but the rest of them  flourish and breed. There would be more than enough still to hunt.   Yeah, maybe you won't be able to drive your pickup truck, stick your  rifle out of the away, blast away, and get one. You might actually have  to get out of the pickup truck. You might actually have to have some  hunting skills and track a little bit to get the caribou or the moose.   But if we kill off all of the grizzlies and the wolves, it will be a  lot easier. They will overpopulate. Actually, what they will do is they  will start going down at the riparian areas, like happened--it is a  different ecosystem--in Yellowstone, and then the streams will not be  as plentiful with fish.   This is about natural balance, it is about Federal lands, it is about  sportsmen and women, and it is about prohibiting the State of Alaska  from using its extreme predator control methods. That is what this is  called: extreme predator control methods. That is all it prevents.   This is a very sad day in this House if this resolution passes, and  it is long-term bad for Alaska.    Mr. Speaker, a quick response to the notion that the fears  of inhumane practices are utterly false. In a Los Angeles Times story  in 2012, the headline is: ``Alaska officials expand aerial shooting of  bears.''   It goes on to say:   ``The controversial `intensive management' moves are the latest in a  series of increasingly aggressive control methods targeting bears and  wolves in Alaska. In some areas, wolf pups can be gassed in their dens,  bear cubs and sows can be hunted, and wolves shot from helicopters.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.  Polis).    I yield the gentleman an additional 15 seconds.    I yield the gentleman an additional 15 seconds.    I yield the gentleman an additional 15 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues and my fellow  Americans can see what is even greater about this country in its far- reaching wildlife and open areas.   I rise in strong opposition to H.J. Res. 69 because I do think it is  important that we be good custodians of what has been given to us. Yes,  to protect those humans who have come to be in places where wildlife  was, but to be good custodians.   The rule that was adopted years ago after public engagement from many  different people is reasonable and rational:   Denning of wolves and their pups, shooting or trapping them while at  their dens in the spring; using airplanes to scout land and shoot  grizzly bears; trapping of grizzly bears and black bears with steel- jawed leghold traps and wire snares--this is what that rule prevents-- luring grizzly bears with rotting meat, sugar, and pet food to get a  point-blank kill; denning of black bear mothers and cubs during  hibernation.   It reminds me of the time that I came to the floor last year to stand  against a horrible killing of Cecil the lion by someone who wanted a  trophy.   So let me tell you about the lesson from Dr. Ed Schmitt, a retired  surgeon, a hunter, who moved to Alaska from Colorado to fish in the  river that flowed by his house, to be able to hunt. He enjoyed fishing  for salmon, casting for salmon, and seeing the brown bears, also known  as grizzly bears. Here is what he said:   ``'Most of us that live in Alaska are here because we recognize that  it has something that the rest of the world doesn't,' says Mr. Schmitt,  president of the Alaska Wildlife Alliance, which is working with the  HSUS to protect animals from trophy hunting abuses. `The wildness can  be destroyed by people. We've stopped seeing the wildlife because we've  made it go away.'''   He further said: ``It's not true that all Alaskans are OK with the  state running rampant on public lands.''   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. `` `It's not true that all Alaskans are OK with the  state running rampant on public lands,' he says. `Only a minority of  Alaskans are hunters, and even fewer kill animals just for a trophy.'  ''   This is Dr. Schmitt, a hunter. This is not a tree hugger. He is a  hunter who moved to this beautiful land that we can call America. So  many Americans on the mainland, in essence, go to this beautiful,  connected Alaska, and so Dr. Schmitt goes on to say, like most hunters  in Alaska, he is appalled at practices that have been raised up to not  save the beauty of these wild animals. ``'The notion that people don't  want any rules is a myth. We want good rules, just like everybody  else.'''   Well, I want to stand alongside of Dr. Ed Schmitt, a healer, a former  doctor, a hunter who moved to Alaska, who understands that what we are  seeking to disapprove is wrong because it was a reasoned response to  all who were engaged in this area.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.J. Res. 69, a  congressional resolution rescinding a final rule promulgated by the  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) to prevent widely criminalized,  cruel, and unsporting hunting methods of killing wolves, grizzly bears,  and other native mammals on 76 million acres of federal lands in  Alaska.   I oppose the disapproval resolution because it subverts the judgment  of professional wildlife managers, and allows appalling methods of  killing animals on public lands designated for wildlife.   The FWS rule does not apply to subsistence hunting or sport hunting  in general; it simply restricts methods of killing that are not suited  anywhere, least of all on national wildlife refuges.   The rule, adopted after years of public engagement and with the  support of many Alaskans, bans the following practices:   1. Denning of wolves and their pups--shooting or trapping them while  at their dens in the spring;   2. Using airplanes to scout, land and shoot grizzly bears;   3. Trapping of grizzly bears and black bears with steel-jawed leg  hold traps and wire snares;   4. Luring grizzly bears with rotting meat, sugar, and pet food to get  a point blank kill; and   5. Denning of black bear mothers and cubs during hibernation.   H.J. Res. 69, if adopted, would prevent the Administration from ever  issuing a rule on this topic, foreclosing our Federal wildlife managers  from regulating these activities in any way under current law.   The decision to ban these cruel hunting practices came directly from  professional wildlife managers from the FWS based in Alaska and is  consistent with science-based wildlife management practices.   In addition, the FWS statutory mandate requires that the agency  conserve wildlife species.   The FWS appealed to the Alaska Board of Game dozens of times to amend  its rules to ensure that the FWS statutory mandate was being followed.   The Board of Game's continued refusal to do so forced FWS to initiate  this rulemaking to ensure that its statutory mandate of conserving  wildlife species on National Wildlife Refuges in Alaska is followed.   Mr. Speaker, a statewide poll conducted in February 2016 showed  Alaskans opposed denning of wolves by more than a 2-to-1 margin.   The poll showed that Alaska voters strongly support eliminating these  cruel and unsporting methods of killing native carnivores on National  Wildlife Refuges in their state.   Additionally, at a series of public meetings on the rule, many  Alaskans turned out to publicly support the rule because they want  these inhumane, unsustainable, unsporting practices to end.   Mr. Speaker, another reason to oppose H.J. Res. 69 is that it would  damage wildlife tourism and hurt the economy of Alaska.   These are federal lands, maintained with federal taxpayer dollars,  and millions of Americans travel to Alaska each year for the unique  opportunity to see bears, wolves, caribou, lynx, and other species on  these lands.   Wildlife watchers contribute over $2 billion to the economy of  Alaska--five times more than the amount generated in Alaska from  hunting activity.   The wildlife within our National Wildlife Refuges is a national  resource and Americans across the country care about protecting it for  future generations of Americans.   For these reasons, I strongly opposed H.J. Res. 69, and urge my  colleagues to join me.   I ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this disapproval and to support  and stand with these beautiful animals.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the article, ``The Fight to  Protect Alaska's Predators,'' and an article regarding Safari Club.          [The Humane Society of the United States, Oct. 19, 2016]                  The Fight To Protect Alaska's Predators                            (By Karen E. Lange)         Ed Schmitt, a retired surgeon, moved to Alaska to       experience the wild. He left Colorado for the Kenai       Peninsula, south of Anchorage, where he could fish in a river       that flowed right outside his house and hunt, he says, in a       way that respects wildlife and the environment. Schmitt       enjoyed casting for salmon and seeing brown bears, also known       as grizzly bears, fishing nearby.        He never wanted to kill them. But over 25 years,       development and new roads ate away bear habitat. And a       different mentality from Schmitt's, one that treats large       predators as  [[Page H1265]]       creatures to be eliminated so populations of moose and       caribou can flourish, took its toll on the Kenai's brown       bears. Schmitt hasn't seen one in three years.        ``Most of us that live in Alaska are here because we       recognized that it has something that the rest of the world       doesn't,'' says Schmitt, president of the Alaska Wildlife       Alliance, which is working with The HSUS to protect animals       from trophy hunting abuses. ``The wildness can be destroyed       by people. We've stopped seeing the wildlife because we've       made it go away.'' A U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service rule       released in August aims to preserve the state's biodiversity       by banning cruel and unsporting hunting methods on the 76       million acres of Alaska's federal national wildlife refuges.       (Last year, the National Park Service issued a similar rule       for the more than 20 million acres of federal preserves       within the state). Under the rule, supported by The HSUS and       a network of scientists and local advocacy groups, hunters       will no longer be able to bait brown bears, trap brown or       black bears or use a plane to find bears from the air and       then immediately land and shoot them. In addition, trophy       hunters will not be allowed to kill black bear mothers and       cubs or wolf and coyote mothers and pups in their dens       (subsistence hunters are exempt). And ``predator control''       programs, which let hunters kill greater numbers of       carnivores in the hope the populations of prey animals such       as caribou will increase, won't be permitted in national       wildlife refuges.        ``This is the first time the federal government has stood       up to the state of Alaska's brutal practices in 37 years,''       says Wendy Keefover, HSUS native carnivore protection       manager, who led meetings on the rule in Anchorage, Juneau       and Fairbanks to encourage constituents to speak out.        An HSUS poll in March showed a majority of Alaskans support       these restrictions, and the Fish and Wildlife Service says       most people who submitted comments favored the rule. The       change came despite well-financed campaigns by the NRA and       Safari Club International against it, and the opposition of       the hunters, trappers and hunting guides on the state's Board       of Game, as well as Alaska's representatives in Congress.        HSUS Alaska state director Michael Haukedalen says the       number of residents who rallied to support the rule shows       there's a constituency for reform. ``It's not true that all       Alaskans are OK with the state running rampant on public       lands,'' he says. ``Only a minority of Alaskans are hunters,       and even fewer kill animals just for a trophy.''        In the 1980s and 1990s, citizen ballot initiatives passed       bans on cruel and unsporting hunting practices. However,       these were later overridden by the state legislature and       governor. In 1994, the legislature enacted a law requiring       the state's Department of Fish and Game to practice       ``intensive management'' of predators if caribou, moose and       deer populations dropped below certain levels.        For 10 years federal officials tried to negotiate with the       Alaska Board of Game to protect wolves and bears from       egregious hunting practices, says biologist Francis Mauer,       retired from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska.        ``It's this ever-increasing fervor to kill predators in       Alaska,'' he says. ``The federal agencies realized these       hunting practices are inconsistent with the purpose for which       the parks and reserves were established, and they had a       responsibility to act.''        The fight against hunting abuses has now shifted to       Washington, D.C., where Rep. Don Young (R-AK) got riders into       House appropriations and energy bills that would undo both       the Fish and Wildlife and National Park Service rules.       Similar language was slipped into a Senate appropriations       bill. The HSUS and other groups are encouraging Congress to       reject these riders before sending the bills to the       president.        Schmitt says he, like most hunters in Alaska, is appalled       by the practices the Fish and Wildlife Service has banned.       ``The notion that people don't want any rules is a myth. We       want good rules, just like everybody else.''                                   ____                       [From the Clarion, Feb. 9, 2017]      Safari Club Sues Over National Park, Wildlife Refuge Regulations                            (By Elizabeth Earl)         The Safari Club International has filed a lawsuit against       the U.S. Department of the Interior, the Fish and Wildlife       Service and the National Park Service over its hunting rules       on federal lands in Alaska.        The nonprofit, one of the largest hunting advocacy       organizations in the country, is challenging a set of rules       the three organizations enacted in 2016 to restrict hunting       and trapping practices on national preserves and on national       wildlife refuges in the state, specifically on the Kenai       National Wildlife Refuge. The rules conflict with the state's       ability to manage wildlife and interfere with Alaskans'       ability to hunt and trap, among other impacts, according to       the lawsuit filed Jan. 19 in U.S. District Court for Alaska.        The federal government owns more than half of Alaska,       managed by a smattering of different federal agencies. The       U.S. Department of the Interior manages national wildlife       refuges through the Fish and Wildlife Service and national       parks and preserves through the National Park Service. Taken       together, NPS manages about 54 million acres of the state,       and Fish and Wildlife manages about 76.7 million acres.        Specifically, the lawsuit takes issue with a rule that bans       predator control activities on national wildlife refuges       ``unless based on sound science and in response to a       conservation concern or is necessary to meet refuge purposes,       federal laws or (Fish and Wildlife Service) policy,''       according to an Aug. 3, 2016 press release about the rule.        The National Park Service's rule, which was finalized Oct.       23, 2015, prohibits the taking of brown bears over bait and       the take of wolves and coyotes between May 1 and Aug. 9,       which is designated as denning season, and eliminating the       ``temporary'' closure category for national preserves in       Alaska, which previously expired after 12 months. The lawsuit       claims these closures allow Alaska personnel ``unlimited       discretion'' to close areas to sport hunting without       providing rulemaking notice or public comment opportunities.        The lawsuit also claims the consequences of the National       Park Service's actions extend beyond its boundaries because       the predators and prey do not remain within the boundaries of       the national preserves.        ``The NPS exceeded its statutory authority in promulgating       the NPS Regulations, as the regulations illegally override       the State's authority to regulate the methods and means of       taking Alaska's wildlife,'' the lawsuit states.        The complaint against Fish and Wildlife's general rule       prohibiting predator control activities on Alaska national       wildlife refuges is for similar reasons. On the Kenai       National Wildlife Refuge specifically, which covers a broad       swath of the Kenai Peninsula between the Russian River and       the community of Sterling and stretches down toward the Fox       River Flats on the southern peninsula, the lawsuit objects to       the public use restrictions that prohibit some plane and       motorboat use and lynx, coyote and wolf hunting within the       Skilak Wildlife Recreation Area and prohibit bear baiting for       brown bears, require a permit for baiting black bears and       prohibit using a dog to hunt big game except for black bears,       with a special use permit, among other rules.        The lawsuit claims that neither the National Park Service       nor Fish and Wildlife completed the proper National       Environmental Protection Act processes for their regulations.        The lawsuit asks for the court to declare all the       regulations as invalid and enjoin the agencies from enacting       the regulations.        The suit was filed less than a week after the State of       Alaska filed its own lawsuit against the same rules. The       state's suit claims very similar grievances against the       rules, saying it breaches the state's ability to manage its       wildlife effectively, according to a news release from Gov.       Bill Walker's website.        The Safari Club International supports the state's lawsuit       but chose to file its own anyway, said Safari Club       International President Larry Higgins in a statement. The       Safari Club's lawsuit focuses more specifically on the rights       of nonsubsistence users than the state's lawsuit and contains       complaints specific to the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge       rules, which the state's lawsuit does not, he said.        ``Safari Club concluded it was necessary to file its own       lawsuit to represent and protect fully the interests of its       members and others who hunt in Alaska for subsistence and/or       for nonsubsistence purposes,'' he said. ``Both lawsuits       challenge regulations adopted by the Obama Administration       that prohibit certain hunting methods on National Preserves       and National Wildlife Refuges.''        The main issue the group has with the rules is state       wildlife management, said Eddie Grasser, the vice president       of the Safari Club's Alaska chapter. All successful wildlife       management in the U.S. is based on state management, he said.        ``The main emphasis for our part, anyway, is the issue of       state management,'' he said. ``We don't feel the federal       government has the authority to manage wildlife because of       the way the system has evolved over time.''        Higgins said in his statement that the club will support       the state's legal efforts as well.        ``To the extent possible, Safari Club will work       cooperatively with the State, and others who may decide to       challenge the regulations, to present the best arguments to       the court,'' he said.        The National Park Service had no comment on the Safari       Club's lawsuit and the Fish and Wildlife Service did not       respond to a request for comment Thursday.     Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, one quick point is that these national wildlife  refuges are U.S. public lands paid for by U.S. taxpayers and should be  managed for the benefit of all. So let me quote former Fish and  Wildlife Service Director Dan Ashe, recently departed, who said these  ``are not game farms managed for a slice of their diversity for the  benefit of a few people who would call themselves hunters.''   Much has been made in this debate this afternoon, Madam Speaker,  about whether ANILCA prohibits this Fish and Wildlife rule. We have  gone back and forth with different cases. Let me just quote a few key  paragraphs.   Section 302 and 303 of ANILCA establishes 16 national wildlife  refuges, and for each one, the purpose is stated for which the refuge  is to be established and shall be managed, including: ``to conserve  fish and wildlife populations in their natural diversity.''   The law doesn't say wildlife should be managed in some alternate  state of unnatural diversity where no wolves, no bears, and  overpopulated moose herds can destroy the landscape.   Both the ANILCA, and the Improvement Act, the 1998 law that  reorganized the National Wildlife Refuge System, managed Alaska's  Federal refuge managers to conserve natural diversity, a value that the  Fish and Wildlife Services correctly noted is incompatible with  indiscriminate predator culls.   Every Federal court to consider the question, including the Ninth  Circuit, which contains Alaska, has held the States lack the authority  to overrule Fish and Wildlife Service management decisions concerning  Federal refuge management. So this has already been before the courts.  The courts, I believe, have already decided.   Madam Speaker, in the few minutes I have left, let me just quote a  few of the letters we received from Alaska residents in opposition to  the resolution before us.   Elizabeth Figus, from Juneau, writes: ``I am an Alaskan. I hunt and  fish, and I support regulations that prohibit cruel killing. This rule  would rightly prohibit controversial and scientifically unjustified  killing methods on over 76 million acres of Federal lands in Alaska.   ``A hunter who cannot comply with humane methods of the trade/sport  is simply lazy and undeserving of the right to harvest the flesh of  another living thing.   ``This is the 21st century, not the 1800s. We must carry out our  hunting in a careful and organized fashion to ensure the safety of  Alaskan residents as well as the sustainability of the wild animal  resources into the future.''   This from Elisabeth Moorehead from Eagle River: ``My husband and I  owned and operated a successful wildlife tourism business in Alaska for  27 years. The business still continues in the capable hands of one of  our guides. . . . I am writing to convey my displeasure over the  content of the joint resolution you recently introduced in response to  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service regulations that ban cruel and  unsporting methods of killing bears, wolves and coyotes on Federal  wildlife refuges in Alaska.''   And from Fran Mauer in Fairbanks: ``Over the last 15 years I have  watched the state hunting regulations for wolves and bears get  progressively more extreme. These methods go far beyond any common  sense, are not supported by science, and have no place in our Alaskan  National Wildlife Refuges. This is the result of the special interest  lobby of extreme pro-hunting groups. . . . I for one, and many other  Alaskan hunters, do not want to see the State of Alaska turn our  National Wildlife Refuges into game farms.''   And, finally, from Jeff Fair from Palmer: ``I write you as a 23-year  Alaskan wildlife biologist . . . Currently 64 years of age, I hunt and  fish and enjoy a permanent license to do so in The Great Land.   ``As a biologist, I recognize that predator control does not work in  the long run to stabilize or maximize cervid populations. I also  recognize that an attempt to repeal U.S. Fish and Wildlife regs on  these lands would be an attempt to circumvent, contradict, overturn, or  simply break the Federal law that establishes the Fish and Wildlife  Service's mission and authority for these lands. And as a hunter I fear  for the reputation of the hunting tradition, including conservation and  fair-chase, when some service anti-predator techniques are allowed  anywhere, including on federal lands.''   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1330     Madam Speaker, just in mild response, I am, I believe,  heartened to know--that may be the wrong verb--but, at least, respect  my friend and colleague from Alaska's notion or assertion that these  terrible, inhumane hunting practices, which we have talked about for  the last hour--whether it is gassing wolves in the den or shooting  bears from the helicopter or using bait for the bears or many of the  iron leg traps--that all these things do not occur in Alaska on the  wildlife refuges; that they are illegal in Alaska. If that is so, that  is an excellent thing.   I wonder why the need for the Congressional Review Act resolution to  overturn the Fish and Wildlife regulations if none of these are, in  fact, happening.   In any case, there is still a legitimate debate about whether the  Fish and Wildlife regulation contravenes ANILCA and the state  establishment act. Hopefully, this doesn't have to go to court in order  to do that, but I think there seems to be enough judicial precedent  that if it did go to court, the Fish and Wildlife regulations would be  upheld.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.                            ____________________
