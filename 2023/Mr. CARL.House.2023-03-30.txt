 Mr. Chairman, I appreciate our colleagues on the other side  of the aisle pointing out all these different rules and regulations  that we have to go through for a vessel to simply come in and out.   This amendment is very simple. It says if you have a permit today and  it expires today, that permit is good until the new permit is issued.  It has nothing to do with further checking of water quality because  that is already set up in the first permit. The layers of government  bureaucracy are already put in place.   All this amendment very simply says is you can continue running your  business until we have time to do our job. It is hard to run a business  based on the Federal Government's time clock because the government  gets in no hurry. The slower they get, the more important they feel.  The business community cannot handle this. We have got to give the  business community some help, and this is help.   Again, all this is simply saying is you carry on the way that you  have agreed to carry on for the last 5 years, and we will get to you as  quick as we can. I think it is a great amendment, and I am here to  support it.
