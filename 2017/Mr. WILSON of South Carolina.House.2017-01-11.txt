 Mr. Speaker, this weekend, I was  grateful to participate in the Stand Up for Life March and Rally in  Columbia, hosted by the South Carolina Citizens for Life during a rare  snowstorm.   I appreciated hearing remarks from Evangelist Alveda King, niece of  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., a dedicated pro-life activist. I was also  grateful to attend the grand opening of Daybreak, a crisis pregnancy  center, hosted by Director Brennan Aschleman.   I thank Lisa Van Riper, president of South Carolina Citizens for  Life, with Holly Gatling and Brenda Cerkez for organizing such a  meaningful event. I was grateful to participate, as well, with Bishop  Robert Guglielmone of Charleston and the Knights of Columbus led by  Thomas Monahan.   Pro-life voters have made a difference with all statewide officials,  both U.S. Senators and six U.S. Members of Congress supporting pro-life  initiatives, along with super majorities in the State house and senate.  I was grateful to begin this new Congress by being an original  cosponsor of H. Res. 354 to provide for a moratorium on Federal funding  to Planned Parenthood, which has disgracefully sold baby body parts.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President, by his  actions, never forget September the 11th in the global war on  terrorism.                            ____________________
