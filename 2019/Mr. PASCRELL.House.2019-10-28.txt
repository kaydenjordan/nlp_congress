 Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Scott for his comments.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of our brave men and  women in blue who put their lives on the line every day to protect our  communities.   In recognition of their service, my co-chair, the co-chair of first  responders and our police, he and I go beyond which side of the aisle  we sit on to do what is right.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Rutherford,   John Rutherford, for  his bipartisan work in this area, a former long-time sheriff. So I am  really talking about the gentleman also in this bill, because he put  his life on the line for quite a few years in Duval County, I believe.   So in recognition of their service, I helped pass the National Law  Enforcement Museum Act very early when I got to Congress. It was signed  into law by President Bill Clinton. He signed it faster than I was able  to get it passed. He signed it on November 9, 2000.   This museum honors the service of local, State, and Federal law  enforcement officers in the United States.   A decade later, construction of the museum began at Judiciary Square  in this great city, right across the street from the National Law  Enforcement Memorial. Construction was just completed last year. This  museum serves as a tribute to the lives, the sacrifices, and the  service of our Nation's law enforcement.                                time  1730    This museum will play a vital role, as was mentioned before by the  gentlewoman, in educating the public on the varied work of our Nation's  law enforcement officers--which I contend most people in the Congress  are ignorant of--as well as promoting the safety of the men and women  in uniform.   To build on this support, I introduced H.R. 1865, the National Law  Enforcement Museum Commemorative Coin Act, to direct the Department of  the Treasury to mint a coin in commemoration of the opening of this  great museum.   Proceeds from the sale of the commemorative coins will provide a  much-needed funding stream to the nonprofit National Law Enforcement  Officers Memorial Fund for educational and outreach programs and  exhibits at the National Law Enforcement Museum. This will ensure our  Nation's finest are recognized properly for generations to come.   Madam Speaker, I would like to take a moment now to recognize those  officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice for their communities. In  2018 and so far in 2019, we have mourned the loss of 266 men and women  who died in the line of duty, three of whom served in the State of New  Jersey.   The first officer that I will mention is Tamby Yagan of the Paterson  Police Department--my town--who spent 13 years of service in the police  department. Officer Yagan tragically died in an automobile crash on  April 22, 2018.   Lieutenant Christopher Robateau from the Jersey City Police  Department passed on January 5, 2018, after being struck by a vehicle.   And New Jersey State Police Trooper Robert Emmet Nagle, who passed on  November 26, 2018, because of a 9/11-related illness.   I grieve for their families and loved ones. I know the House does  also.   I thank Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and Chairwoman Maxine Waters for  bringing this legislation to the floor. I also thank my good friend and  partner in chairing the bipartisan House Law Enforcement Caucus,  Congressman   John Rutherford, a former sheriff, as I said before. He  co-authored this bill.   Finally, I thank Marcia Ferranto, the CEO of the National Law  Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, for her and her colleagues' work on  this bill and the efforts to make the National Law Enforcement Museum a  success.    This bill has strong support from several law  enforcement groups, including Concerns of Police Survivors, the Federal  Law Enforcement Officers Association, the Fraternal Order of Police,  the National Association of Police Organizations, the National  Sheriffs' Association, and the Police Foundation.   Madam Speaker, I strongly support H.R. 1865, and I look forward to  its passage and into law.
