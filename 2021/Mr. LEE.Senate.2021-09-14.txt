 Madam President, the United States lost 13 servicemembers in  Afghanistan on August 26, 2021. The heroic service and the ultimate  sacrifice of these men and women will never be forgotten. They are  Marine LCpl David L. Espinoza from Texas, Marine Sgt Nicole L. Gee from  California, Marine SSgt Darin Taylor Hoover from Utah, Army SSG Ryan C.  Knauss from Tennessee, Marine Cpl Hunter Lopez from California, Marine  LCpl Rylee J. McCollum from Wyoming, Marine LCpl Dylan R. Merola from  California, Marine LCpl Kareem M. Nikoui from California, Marine Sgt  Johanny Rosario Pichardo from Massachusetts, Marine Cpl Humberto A.  Sanchez from Indiana, Marine LCpl Jared M. Schmitz from Missouri, Navy  Hospital Corpsman Maxton W. Soviak from Ohio, and Marine Cpl Daegan W.  Page from Nebraska. Over the next hour, Senators representing many of  these fallen servicemembers and the States from which they hail will  honor their service and their memory.   Utah's SSgt Darin Taylor Hoover was only 11 years old on September  11, 2001. From that moment on, he knew that he wanted to serve his  country. Nearly 21 years later, he was killed in Kabul, Afghanistan,  performing his duty valiantly, as always, as a U.S. marine.   Staff Sergeant Hoover and his fellow marines were on the frontlines  of the operation, securing an entrance to the Hamid Karzai  International Airport and screening vulnerable Afghans on their escape  to safety as the extremist Taliban took hold of their country.   Staff Sergeant Hoover was killed by an ISIS-K suicide attack that  targeted him, his teammates, and the surrounding innocent civilians.   Staff Sergeant Hoover, like all marines, learned the Marine Corps'  values at boot camp. Those values are honor, courage, and commitment.  He was told that being a marine and living these values does not begin  or end with training or service as an Active-Duty marine; these values  forever guide marines' decisions, their service, and, in fact, their  entire lives.   Staff Sergeant Hoover lived these values throughout his entire life.  You see, Staff Sergeant Hoover did, always, what he said he would do.  He was honest, respectful, caring, and compassionate. He dedicated his  life to the service of others, in and out of uniform. He wanted to be  the best and to provide the very best for others, and he was always  willing to work hard to make that happen.   His friends and his family knew him as a loving, thoughtful, hard- working man. He loved and was dedicated to serving those around him,  his family, and his country. As a young man, he made a lasting  impression on those who knew him. They described him as--and these are  their words, not mine--``the best friend,'' ``selfless,'' ``always  levelheaded,'' ``hard-working,'' ``a teammate you could count on,'' ``a  born leader,'' and as ``a good, kind person.'' By being the type of man  he was, he honored those who knew him. He honored the uniform he wore.  And in his service and sacrifice, he honored the United States by  representing and being the best of us.   Staff Sergeant Hoover certainly knew the risks of his duty. He  understood the risks of this deployment in particular. In particular,  he knew what was at stake and on the line on this particular day.   American civilians had been warned not to travel to the airport due  to specific credible threats of an attack. The marines at the gate did  not, of course, have the option of standing down or shirking their  duty; they had a mission to complete. Despite knowing the very real  threat to their lives that day, Staff Sergeant Hoover and his marines  followed orders and did their duty. They stood in close physical  proximity with hundreds as they checked identification and shuffled  people through the gate one after the other. They didn't know if or  ultimately when an  [[Page S6475]]  attack might come; they just knew of the threat. Nonetheless, those  marines carried on, guiding countless innocent civilians to safety.   His father Darin put it best. He said:         That's just the type of man that he was, doing what he       needed to do and getting the job done for those that couldn't       do it for themselves, and he was standing out front leading       his men.    You see, Staff Sergeant Hoover demonstrated uncommon courage in  fulfilling his duty that day, as with all other days in which he  valiantly served.   This was not Mr. Hoover's first deployment to Afghanistan. In fact,  he served three tours of duty there in his 11 years in the Marine  Corps. He knew what war and Afghanistan were like. He decided to carry  on and continue serving because that is what he had committed to do.  Since high school, he knew he wanted to be a marine specifically. His  father said that ``he was dead set on it.''   When the news in Afghanistan developed, Staff Sergeant Hoover told  his family he wanted to be in the action to help with the evacuation  mission. He died doing what he loved: serving his country and leading  his men.   Staff Sergeant Hoover was the oldest of the 13 servicemembers killed  in this attack. His life had been defined by his love of family and of  country. He was committed to serving, and he lived and gave his life,  showing the last full measure of devotion, demonstrating exactly what  it means to be a U.S. marine.   Staff Sergeant Hoover leaves a legacy with his family, the State of  Utah, and our Nation. He represents the best among us and the  commitment of a servicemember and a marine. His dedication to the  values of the Marine Corps and full-fledged devotion to what is right  will remain with us forever. He will never be forgotten.   As the preparations are made to inter him along with other American  heroes at Arlington National Cemetery, he can behold what the Marine  Corps hymn promises and millions of good marines before him have seen:  On Heaven's scenes, you will find the streets are guarded by United  States marines.   Staff Sergeant Taylor Hoover joined the ranks of American heroes  before him, always faithful. May God rest his soul, may God comfort his  family, and may God bless us with the honor, courage, and commitment  that Taylor Hoover truly lived.
