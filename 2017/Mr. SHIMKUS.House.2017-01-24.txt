 Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support H.R. 7,  the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act.   H.R. 7 codifies policies that have been enacted for more than 30  years, on a case-by-case basis, that prohibit the Federal funding of  abortion, including the Hyde amendment, which prohibits funding for  elective abortion coverage through any program funded through the  annual Labor, Health, and Human Services Appropriations Act; the Smith  FEHBP amendment, which prohibits funding for health plans that include  elective abortion coverage for Federal employees; the Dornan amendment,  which prohibits the use of congressionally appropriated funds for  abortion in the District of Columbia; and the restrictions on elective  abortion funding through the Peace Corps and Federal prisons.                            ____________________
