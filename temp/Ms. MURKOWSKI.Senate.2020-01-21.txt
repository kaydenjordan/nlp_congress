 I object.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The clerk will read the amendment.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer] proposes an       amendment numbered 1292.        On page 3, line 8, strike ``4 hours'' and insert ``2       hours''.        On page 3, line 10, strike ``the question of'' and all that       follows through ``rules'' on line 12.        On page 3, line 14, insert ``any such motion'' after       ``decide''.        On page 3, line 15, strike ``whether'' and all that follows       through ``documents'' on line 17.        On page 3, line 18, strike ``that question'' and insert       ``any such motion''.        On page 3, lines 23 and 24 strike ``and the Senate shall       decide after deposition which witnesses shall testify'' and       insert ``and then shall testify in the Senate''.    The CHIEF JUSTICE. The amendment is arguable by the parties for 2  hours, equally divided.   Mr. Manager Schiff, are you a proponent or opponent?   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Proponent.   Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. We oppose it.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Schiff, you may proceed and reserve time for  rebuttal.   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Senators, this amendment makes two important  changes to the McConnell resolution.   The first is, the McConnell resolution does not actually provide for  an immediate vote even later on the witnesses we have requested.   What the McConnell resolution says is that at some point after,  essentially, the trial is over--after you have had the arguments of  both sides and you have had the 16 hours of questioning--then there  will be a debate as to whether to have a vote and a debate on a  particular witness. There is no guarantee that you are going to get a  chance to vote on specific witnesses.   All the resolution provides is that you are going to get an  opportunity to vote to have a debate on whether to ultimately have a  vote on a particular witness. This would strip that middle layer. It  would strip the debate on whether to have a debate on a particular  witness.   If my counsel, my colleagues for the President's team, are making the  point that ``Well, you are going to get that opportunity later,'' the  reality is that under the McConnell resolution, we may never get to  have a debate about particular witnesses.   You heard the discussion of four witnesses tonight. There may be  others who come to the attention of this body who are able to get  documents that we should also call. But will you ever get to hear a  debate about why a particular witness is necessary? Well, you may only  get a debate over the debate. This amendment would remove that debate  over debate regarding particular witnesses.   The other thing this resolution would provide is that you should hear  from these witnesses directly. The McConnell resolution says that we  deposed, and that is it. It doesn't say you are ever going to actually  hear these witnesses for yourself, which means that you, as the triers  of fact, may not get to see and witness the credibility of these  witnesses. You may only get to see a deposition or deposition  transcript or maybe a video of a deposition. I don't know. But if there  is any contesting of facts, wouldn't you like to hear from the  witnesses yourself and very directly?   Now, the reason why it was done this way in the Clinton case and why  there were depositions--and again, in the Clinton case, all these  people had been interviewed and deposed or testified before. The reason  it was done that way in the Clinton case is because of the salacious  nature of the testimony. Nobody wanted witnesses on the Senate floor  talking about sex. Well, as I said earlier, I can assure you that will  not be the issue here.   To whatever degree there was a reluctance in the Clinton case to have  live testimony because of its salacious character, that is not an issue  here. That is not a reason here not to hear from those witnesses  yourself.   This resolution makes those two important changes, and I would urge  your support.   I reserve time.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Cipollone.   Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   Mr. Purpura will argue this motion.   Mr. Counsel PURPURA. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, good  morning. I will be very brief on this.   We strongly oppose the amendment. We support the resolution as  written. We believe, as to the two areas that Manager Schiff discussed,  the resolution appropriately considers those  [[Page S429]]  questions and strikes the impeachment balance in the Senate's  discretion as the sole trier of impeachments.   The rules in place here in the resolution are similar to the Clinton  proceeding in that regard in the sense that this body has the  discretion as to whether to hear from the witness live, if there are  witnesses at some point, or not.   But, more fundamentally, the preliminary question has to be overcome,  which is there will be 4 hours total, with 2 hours for them to try to  convince you, after the parties have made their presentation--which  they will have 24 hours to do--as to the preliminary question of  whether it shall be in order to consider and debate any motion to  subpoena witnesses or documents.   Those were precisely the Clinton rules--actually, stronger than the  Clinton rules. Those rules, as I have indicated before, passed 100 to  0. We think that the resolution strikes the appropriate balance, and we  urge that the amendment be rejected.   I yield my time.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   Mr. Schiff, you have 57 minutes.   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Don't worry. I won't use it.   I will say only that if there were any veneer left to camouflage  where the President's counsel is really coming from, the veneer is  completely gone now. After saying we are going to have an opportunity  to have a vote on these witnesses later, now they are saying: No, you  are just going to have a vote on whether to debate having a vote on the  witnesses.   The camouflage was pretty thin to begin with, but it is completely  gone now.   What they really want is to get to that generic debate about whether  or not to have a debate on witnesses and have you vote it down so you  never actually have to vote to refuse these witnesses, although you had  to do that tonight. I don't see what purpose that serves except, I  suppose, to put one more layer in the way of accountability.   But the veneer is gone. All this promise about ``You are going to get  that opportunity, it is just a question of when''--no, the whole goal  is for you to never get the chance to take that vote. And what is more,  the vote on this resolution is a vote that says that you don't want to  hear from these witnesses yourself. You don't want to evaluate the  credibility of these witnesses yourself. Maybe--just maybe--you will  let them be deposed, but you don't want to hear them yourself. You  don't want to see these witnesses put up their hand and take an oath.   I don't know what the rules of these depositions are going to be.  Maybe the public isn't going to ever get to see what happens in those  depositions. We released all the deposition transcripts from our  depositions--the secret 100-person depositions--but we have no idea  what rules they will adopt for these depositions. Maybe the public will  see them; maybe they won't. Maybe you will get to see them; I assume  you will get to see them. But at the end of the day, this is also a  vote you have to cast that says: No, I don't want to hear them for  myself. No, I don't want to evaluate their credibility for myself.   This is, after all, only a vote, only a case, only a trial about the  impeachment of the President of the United States. If you have a bank  robbery trial or you have a trial where somebody is stealing a piece of  mail, you could get live witnesses. But to impeach the President of the  United States, they are saying: No, we don't need to see their  credibility.   Is that really where we are here tonight? Is that what the American  people expect of a fair trial? I don't think it is.   I yield back.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader is recognized.                               Motion to Table
