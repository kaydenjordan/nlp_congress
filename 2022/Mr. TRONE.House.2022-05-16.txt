 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (S. 3527) to amend title 38, United States Code, to authorize the  Secretary of Veterans Affairs to transfer the name of property of the  Department of Veterans Affairs designated by law to other property of  the Department.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 3527         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. AUTHORITY OF SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS TO                     TRANSFER NAMES OF FACILITIES, STRUCTURES, OR                     REAL PROPERTY OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS                     AFFAIRS.         (a) In General.--Section 531 of title 38, United States       Code, is amended--        (1) in the section heading, by striking ``Requirement'' and       inserting ``Requirements'';        (2) by striking ``Except as expressly provided by law'' and       inserting the following:        ``(a) Naming Limitation.--Except as expressly provided by       law or as authorized under subsection (b)''; and        (3) by adding at the end the following:        ``(b) Transfer of Names.--        ``(1) In general.--The Secretary may transfer the name of       covered property of the Department to other covered property       of the Department if--        ``(A) the original covered property was designated with       that name by law;        ``(B) the Department no longer offers benefits or services       at the original covered property;        ``(C) the other covered property is similar in type and       purpose as the original covered property;        ``(D) the other covered property is located in a different       location or at a different address from the original covered       property within the town, city, or other local government       area specified in the designation made by such law; and        ``(E) such transfer occurs not less than 30 days after the       Secretary notifies the Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the       Senate, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the House of       Representatives, and each member of Congress representing the       State in which the original covered property and other       covered property are located of the intent of the Secretary       to transfer the name of the original covered property to the       other covered property.        ``(2) References.--If the Secretary transfers the name of       covered property under paragraph (1), any reference in a law,       regulation, map, document, paper, or other record of the       United States to the covered property originally named by law       shall be deemed to be a reference to the covered property to       which the name has been transferred under such paragraph.        ``(3) Covered property.--In this subsection, the term       `covered property' means a facility, structure, or real       property of the Department or a major portion (such as a wing       or floor) of any such facility, structure, or real       property.''.        (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the       beginning of chapter 5 of title 38, United States Code, is       amended by striking the item relating to section 531 and       inserting the following new item:  ``531. Requirements relating to naming of Department property.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on S. 3527.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of S. 3527, a commonsense piece of legislation  introduced by the chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee,  Jon Tester.   The purpose of this bill is to ensure the Secretary has the authority  to transfer the name of a facility to another physical property should  VA decide it needs to relocate the facility. Such a relocation could  occur if there is a need to increase clinic space or to move a facility  closer to the veteran population.   I hope my colleagues see the benefit of such authority and will join  me in supporting this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in  passing S. 3527, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (S. 1760) to designate the community-based outpatient clinic of the  Department of Veterans Affairs planned to be built in Oahu, Hawaii, as  the ``Daniel Kahikina Akaka Department of Veterans Affairs Community- Based Outpatient Clinic''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 1760         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF DANIEL KAHIKINA AKAKA DEPARTMENT OF                     VETERANS AFFAIRS COMMUNITY-BASED OUTPATIENT                     CLINIC.         (a) Designation.--The community-based outpatient clinic of       the Department of Veterans Affairs planned to be built in       Oahu, Hawaii, shall after the date of the enactment of this       Act be known and designated as the ``Daniel Kahikina Akaka       Department of Veterans Affairs Community-Based Outpatient       Clinic'' or the ``Daniel Kahikina Akaka VA Clinic''.        (b) Reference.--Any reference in any law, regulation, map,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       community-based outpatient clinic referred to in subsection       (a) shall be considered to be a reference to the Daniel       Kahikina Akaka Department of Veterans Affairs Community-Based       Outpatient Clinic.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on S. 1760.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to offer my strong support for S. 1760, a bill to  designate the veterans' health facility in Oahu, Hawaii, as the Daniel  Kahikina Akaka Department of Veterans Affairs community-based  outpatient clinic, named after the first United States Senator of  Native Hawaiian ancestry, the late Daniel Akaka.   I recognize Senator Mazie Hirono for spearheading this effort to  honor a man of such great esteem. The CBOC in  [[Page H4992]]  Oahu will stand as a lasting testimony to his commitment to the men and  women of the Armed Forces, providing countless services and benefits to  our Nation's veterans for years to come.   Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Kai Kahele, whose constituency  includes parts of Oahu, for leading this effort on the House side. He  grew up the son of a Native Hawaiian mother and a father of Chinese and  Native Hawaiian heritage. As a student of Kamehameha, a high school for  boys, a military school, Senator Akaka's path was forever changed after  having witnessed firsthand Japanese fighter planes attacking Pearl  Harbor in 1941.   Like most patriotic Americans during World War II, Senator Akaka  wanted to join in the U.S. effort to defend our freedom. He ultimately  ended up joining the Army Corps of Engineers and served throughout the  Pacific theater.   After the war, Senator Akaka took advantage of the GI Bill benefits,  and earned both his bachelor's and master's degrees from the University  of Hawaii. After working several years in State government, Akaka was  persuaded to enter elected office to ensure there would be a Native  Hawaiian presence in his State's decisionmaking process.   Elected to the House of Representatives in 1977, Daniel Akaka became  a congressional champion of indigenous and veteran issues. In 1990, he  was elected to represent Hawaii in the United States Senate.   Thanks to Senator Akaka's commitment to recognizing the military  contributions of the AAPI community, more than 30 Medals of Honor were  awarded to Asian and Asian-American World War II veterans; a  recognition of their patriotism and bravery that was long overdue.   When it comes to the question of naming the VA community-based  outpatient clinic in Hawaii, I ask this body: Who better than Daniel  Kahikina Akaka; a Hawaiian-born, Hawaiian-serving veteran whose life  philosophy was sharing aloha and was a true public servant for over  three decades.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters of support from our  colleagues in the Hawaiian Congressional Delegation, the American  Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the Disabled American  Veterans.                                  Congress of the United States,                                  Washington, DC, November 17, 2021.      Hon. Jon Tester,      Chairman, Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Jerry Moran,      Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Tester and Ranking Member Moran: We, the       Hawaii Congressional Delegation, write in support of       legislation to designate the planned outpatient clinic on the       Island of Oahu, Hawaii as the ``Daniel Kahikina Akaka       Department of Veteran Affairs Community-Based Outpatient       Clinic,'' to honor and commemorate Senator Daniel Akaka's       service to his country during World War II and his service to       the people of Hawaii in Congress.        Born in 1924 in Honolulu, Hawaii, Senator Akaka attended       public grade school, but went to Kamehameha School for Boys       and graduated from there in 1942. From 1943 to 1945, after       graduating from high school, he served as a civilian worker       in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. He continued to serve in       the Army Corps of Engineers after being drafted in 1945,       including assignments on Saipan and Tinian, until being       honorably discharged in 1947.        He returned to Hawaii and pursued his education at the       University of Hawaii utilizing the GI Bill. He spent 15 years       as an educator and administrator in public schools before       transitioning into government service. During his time in       government, he was the Chief Program Planner for the Hawaii       Department of Education, Director of the Hawaii Office of       Economic Opportunity, Director of the Progressive       Neighborhood Program, and Special Assistant in the Office of       Governor George Ariyoshi.        Senator Akaka was first elected to the U.S. House of       Representatives in 1976, where he represented the people of       Hawaii for 14 years. In 1990, he was appointed to fill a       Senate vacancy after the death of Senator Spark M. Matsunaga.       He was elected to the seat that fall and continued to serve       as Senator for 23 years until his retirement in 2013. Senator       Akaka was the first U.S. Senator of Native Hawaiian ancestry,       and during his tenure was the only Chinese-American member of       the Senate.        Senator Akaka was a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs       Committee (SVAC) from 1990 through 2013, and was the chairman       of the committee from 2007 to 2011. During his tenure, he       expanded benefits for veterans and worked to ensure those who       had served our country were properly recognized for that       service.        Mr. Akaka sponsored legislation in 1996 to review the       service records of Asian-Americans who had fought in the       442nd Regimental Combat Team and the 100th Infantry Battalion       during World War II. The review resulted in over 30 Medals of       Honor being belatedly bestowed, some posthumously, on Asian-      American veterans. Many of these veterans were of Japanese       heritage, and included his fellow Senator from Hawaii, Daniel       K. Inouye.        As chairman, in 2008, he oversaw the largest increase ever       in funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). At       the time, he said it was important to ensure VA had the       funding needed to respond to veterans' needs. He said at the       time, ``as the ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan       continue, we must recognize that care for those wounded in       combat is part of the cost of war.''        In his farewell speech, Senator Akaka credited the GI bill       with saving him from some of the effects of PTSD after       returning from the war, saying he ``would not be standing       before you today without the opportunity the GI bill gave me,       not only to get an education but to have structure and a path       forward.'' As chairman of SVAC, he worked with Senator Jim       Webb to pass the Post 9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance       Act to update and expand GI Benefits so that Iraq and       Afghanistan war veterans had the same opportunities he was       once afforded.        Senator Akaka and Senator Inouye pursued legislation to       provide one-time compensation for members of the Phillippine       Scouts, an American-led unit of mostly Filipino and Filipino-      American recruits who fought alongside United States troops       but did not qualify for Veterans Administration benefits. The       Senators successfully secured the funding for this       compensation in the 2009 stimulus bill.        While much of what Senator Akaka accomplished benefitted       veterans across the country, he never stopped advocating for       the Native Hawaiian veteran community. Using his roles on       both SVAC and the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, he       highlighted the unique challenges faced by Native Hawaiian       veterans, including holding a field hearing in Hawaii in 2006       in which these specific issues were discussed.        The Daniel Kahikina Akaka Department of Veteran Affairs       Community-Based Outpatient Clinic is an appropriate and a       meaningful way to honor Senator Akaka's lifetime of service       to his country and to the people of Hawaii and continue his       legacy on behalf of veterans. Senator Akaka in his farewell       speech to Congress speak volumes as to his commitment to       veterans:        ``I want to take this moment to urge all of my colleagues       and all of the incoming Senators and Representatives to do       everything they can for our veterans and their families       because we ask them to sacrifice so much for us. They put       their lives on the line while their wives and husbands watch       over their families. Caring for them is one of our most       sacred obligations as a nation.''        Legislation to name the clinic has been introduced in the       Senate (S. 1760) with a companion measure introduced in the       House (H.R. 3406). with the full support of Hawaii       Congressional delegation.        Thank you for your consideration of this legislation.            Sincerely,      Mazie K. Hirono,        U.S. Senator.      Kaiali`i Kahele,        U.S. Representative.      Brian Schatz,        U.S. Senator.      Ed Case,        U.S. Representative.                                   ____                                                 The American Legion,                                            Department of Hawaii,                                     Honolulu, HI, October 20, 2021.      Subject: The proposed legislation to rename the Ewa Plain VA           Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) the DANIEL KAHIKINA AKAKA VA           Outpatient Clinic (CBOC).         The American Legion Department of Hawaii fully supports       legislation proposed by Hawaii US Senator Mazie Hirono to       rename the Ewa Plain VA Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) the DANIEL       KAHIKINA AKAKA VA Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) after the late US       Senator Daniel Akaka.        Senator Akaka was a military veteran who served honorably       in the US Army from 1945-1947 in Saipan and Tinian during       World War II. Following military service, he returned to       Hawaii to attend college, then pursued a career of teaching.       Eventually he entered politics, first as a US Congressman       where he served his Hawaiian constituents for seven terms.       Following Hawaii's US Senator Matsunaga's death, he was       appointed to fill his vacancy in US Senate. Senator Akaka       then served successfully in the US Senate for three more       terms. As Hawaii's junior US Senator, he served on the US       Senate's Committee on Indian Affairs and on the US Senate's       Committee on Veterans Affairs. Two of the more prominent       legislation that he championed and saw passed were:       spearheading awarding nearly 2 dozen Medals of Honor to       soldiers of the famous World War II 442nd/100th ``Go for       Broke'' Battalion; and passing legislation authorizing World       War II Philippine Scouts just compensation for denied       veterans benefits.        US Senator Akaka was a true pioneer, the first native       Hawaiian to serve in the US Senate. He was also a military       veteran who would take care of veterans while serving in the       Senate. It is only appropriate that the Ewa Plain VA       Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) be  [[Page H4993]]       renamed the Daniel K. Akaka VA Outpatient Clinic (CBOC)       honoring a Patriot who served his community, his veterans,       and his nation with distinction.            Always Serving Veterans with Aloha,                                                        Jim Hussey,      Commander.                                   ____                                            Veterans of Foreign Wars,                                            Department of Hawaii,                                        Honolulu, HI, April 6, 2021.      Hon. Mazie Hirono,      U.S. Senator, the State of Hawaii,      Washington DC.        Aloha Senator Hirono: The Veterans of Foreign Wars,       Department of Hawaii, is writing to support your legislation       to name the ALOHA Project VA Clinic the ``Department of       Veterans Affairs Daniel Kahikina Akaka Community-Based       Outpatient Clinic''. We support this effort to celebrate our       fellow veteran for his service in WWII and his service as the       first Native Hawaiian to serve in the U.S. Senate.        During his twenty-three years on the Committee of Veterans       Affairs and also serving as Chairman from 2007 to 2011,       Senator Akaka sponsored legislation expanding benefits,       increasing funding for veteran healthcare, and ensuring       proper recognition for our comrades who served, especially       for those who had served in Iraq and Afghanistan. This       included ensuring that the VA handles both PTSD and TBI       claims with the respect they deserved and expanding the GI       Bill.        In 1996 he cosponsored legislation that reviewed the       records of Asian-Americans including Hawaii's own 442nd       Regimental Combat Team and the 110th Infantry Battalion for       action seen during WWII. As a result, many heroic actions       were properly recognized. This included thirty Medals of       Honor, including for his fellow Senator from Hawaii, Daniel       K. Inouye.        Before leaving office, Senator Akaka initiated the VA Aloha       Project legislation. We believe that is fitting and pono to       name this clinic after him. This action will ensure that his       honor and his dedication to veterans will be remembered for       generations to come. We respectfully request that the Senate       Veterans Affairs Committee quickly consider this important       legislation.      Ron Lockwood,        Veterans of Foreign Wars Department of Hawaii, State       Commander.      George Barlett,        Department of Hawaii Adjutant.                                   ____                                          Disabled American Veterans,                                            Department of Hawaii,                                         Honolulu, HI, May 18, 2021.      Re Support for Renaming the Department of Veterans Affairs           outpatient clinic in Ewa Plain, Oahu, Hawaii, as the           Daniel Kahikina Akaka Department of Veterans Affairs           Outpatient Clinic.         Ms. Hirono plans to introduce the following bill: which is       expected to be referred to the Senate Committee on Veterans'       Affairs: A BILL To name the Department of Veterans Affairs       outpatient clinic in Ewa Plain, Oahu, Hawaii, as the Daniel       Kahikina Akaka Department of Veterans Affairs CommunityBased       Outpatient Clinic.        The Disabled Americans Veterans, Department of Hawaii is       writing this letter in support of legislation introduced by       Ms. Hirono. The proposed legislation would name the       Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Clinic in Ewa Plain,       Hawaii after Senator Daniel Kahikina Akaka.        The Department of Veterans Affairs outpatient clinic in Ewa       Plain, Oahu, Hawaii, shall after the date of the enactment of       this Act be known and designated as the Daniel Kahikina Akaka       Department of Veterans Affairs Community-Based Outpatient       Clinic. Any reference to such outpatient clinic in any law,       regulation, map, document, record, or other paper of the       United States shall be considered to be a reference to the       Daniel Kahikina Akaka Department of Veterans Affairs       Community-Based Outpatient Clinic.        During World War II Senator Akaka served in the United       States Army Corps of Engineers, including service on Saipan       and Tinian. He served from 1945 to 1947.        Akaka was appointed by Governor John Waihee to the U.S.       Senate in April 1990 to serve temporarily after the death of       Senator Spark Matsunaga. During his tenure, Akaka served as       the Chair of the United States Senate Committee on Indian       Affairs and the United States Senate Committee on Veterans'       Affairs.        He attended his final session in the Senate on December 12,       2012. He closed his speech with a traditional Hawaiian       farewell, ``a hui hou'' (until we meet again).        Former president Barack Obama remembered Akaka as ``a       tireless advocate for working people, veterans, native       Hawaiian rights, and the people of Hawaii . . . He embodied       the aloha spirit with compassion and care.''        Akaka died of organ failure in the early hours of April 6,       2018, at the age of 93.            Sincerly,                                                    Gregorrio Alip,                                               Department Comander.     Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support S. 1760, to  designate the soon-to-be-constructed VA community-based outpatient  clinic in Oahu, Hawaii, after our friend and former colleague, Daniel  Kahikina Akaka. In doing so, this body will appropriately commemorate  the significant achievements of America's first Senator of Native  Hawaiian ancestry.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. Case), who serves on the Appropriations  Committee and the Natural Resources Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I am prepared to  close, and I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H4994]]         Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in  passing S. 1760, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (S. 2514) to rename the Provo Veterans Center in Orem, Utah, as the  ``Col. Gail S. Halvorsen `Candy Bomber' Veterans Center''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2514         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF THE COL. GAIL S. HALVORSEN ``CANDY                     BOMBER'' VETERANS CENTER.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) Gail Halvorsen was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, on       October 10, 1920, and spent his youth with his family on       small farms in Utah and Idaho.        (2) After a brief stint at Utah State University, Gail       Halvorsen joined the Civilian Pilot Training Program where he       earned his pilot's license in 1941. During that same year,       Halvorsen joined the Civil Air Patrol as a pilot.        (3) Gail Halvorsen joined the United States Army Air Corps       in 1942 and trained flying fighter jets with the Royal Air       Force. Upon his return from training, he was assigned to fly       transport missions in the South Atlantic Theater.        (4) After World War II and the division of Berlin into       occupation zones, disputes broke out between the Western       Allies and the Soviet Union over the future of Europe.        (5) Negotiations deteriorated, and in June of 1948 Soviet       forces locked down all land routes connecting Western Germany       with the allied portions of Berlin. Approximately 2,000,000       people in West Berlin were left completely isolated.       Starvation, poverty, and desperate want ensued.        (6) In an effort to alleviate the immense human suffering,       the allies decided to drop supplies to people of West Berlin       from the air until a diplomatic solution to the blockade       could be reached. Termed by United States forces ``Operation       Vittles'', the Berlin Airlift began on June 26, 1948.        (7) Gail Halvorsen was assigned to Germany in 1948 to work       as an airlift pilot where he flew C-47 and C-54 cargo planes       as part of Operation Vittles.        (8) While on mission at Tempelhof Airport in Berlin,       Halvorsen noticed a group of German children standing just       outside the barb wire fence.        (9) The children were destitute and clearly had very little       to eat. Halvorsen gave the children two sticks of gum he had       in his pocket, which they split into little pieces to share       among themselves.        (10) Colonel Halvorsen was deeply affected by the       experience and wanted to do more to help. He promised the       children he would drop more candy to them from his plane as       he flew his regular airlift missions.        (11) Halvorsen told the children they would recognize his       plane by a back-and-forth waggle of his wings as he flew       over.        (12) Colonel Halvorsen enlisted his copilot and engineer in       the project and began attaching their candy rations to       miniature parachutes which they dropped from their plane to       the starving children below.        (13) The children of Berlin gave Halvorsen many nicknames       including ``Uncle Wiggly Wings'', ``The Chocolate Flier'',       ``The Gum Drop Kid'', and ``The Chocolate Uncle''. He       eventually became known around the world as ``The Candy       Bomber''.        (14) Lieutenant General William H. Turner, who directed the       Berlin Airlift, learned about Halvorsen's efforts and       officially expanded the idea into a full-blown operation       known as ``Little Vittles'' as a play on the broader       operation's name.        (15) As the candy drops continued, word of Operation Little       Vittles reached the United States. Families, schoolchildren,       and candymakers in the United States began contributing candy       and homemade parachutes that Halvorsen and other pilots could       drop.        (16) When the Berlin Airlift ended, an estimated 250,000       parachutes containing approximately 21 tons of candy had been       dropped by Halvorsen and his fellow airmen as a part of       Operation Little Vittles.        (17) Halvorsen retired from the military in 1974 after 31       years of service and more than 8,000 hours of flying time.        (18) Since his retirement, Halvorson has continued his       humanitarian service. He has voluntarily represented the       United States Air Force and the United States abroad and has       re-enacted his famous candy drops several times in Berlin and       around the world.        (19) Halvorsen has also been a tremendous boon to his       community through church service and other local       contributions.        (20) Gail Halvorsen turned 100 years old on October 10,       2020.        (b) Designation.--The Provo Veterans Center of the       Department of Veterans Affairs located at 360 State Street,       Orem, Utah, shall after the date of the enactment of this Act       be known and designated as the ``Col. Gail S. Halvorsen       `Candy Bomber' Veterans Center''.        (c) Reference.--Any reference in any law, regulation, map,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       veterans center referred to in subsection (b) shall be       considered to be a reference to the Col. Gail S. Halvorsen       ``Candy Bomber'' Veterans Center.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on S. 2514.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to offer my support for S. 2514, a bill to  recognize and remember the life of Colonel Gail Seymour Halvorsen, who  passed away on February 16, 2022, at 101 years old.   I thank Senator Lee and my colleagues from Utah's congressional  delegation for their work to pay tribute to Colonel Halvorsen. Colonel  Halvorsen was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, and in 1942 he joined the  Army Air Corps and trained as a fighter pilot. While stationed in  Germany, where he flew C-47 and C-54 cargo planes as part of Operation  Vittles; Halvorsen noticed dozens of hunger-starved German children  outside of the barbed wire fence. Having two pieces of gum, Halvorsen  broke it into strips and gave it to the children to share amongst them.  Inspired by the children's glee, Halvorsen committed to more frequently  distributing candy from his plane to them.   Earning his nickname ``The Candy Bomber,'' Halvorsen dropped  miniature parachutes of candy rations in the street of Berlin to feed  the children. By the end of the Berlin Airlift, Halvorsen and his  fellow airmen distributed an estimated 250,000 parachutes with over 20  tons of candy throughout Operation Little Vittles.   The Provo Vet Center plays a vital role in the community and provides  important services such as counseling for veterans with PTSD and  confidential counseling sessions to those who have experienced military  sexual trauma--all free to the veterans, reservists, and members of  National Guard--regardless of service connection or VA health  enrollment status.   To rename this important vet center after Colonel Halvorsen would be  a fitting honor for one of the Beehive State's most selfless members of  the U.S. Armed Forces.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters of support from the  Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Disabled American Veterans, the American  Legion, and a letter dated July 28, 2021, from the U.S. Senate.

Dear Chairman Tester, Ranking Member Moran, Chairman       Takano, Ranking Member Bost: We, the members of the Utah       Veterans of Foreign Wars, write to support that the  [[Page H4995]]       Provo Veterans Center located at 360 South State Street       Building C 103 in Orem, Utah be renamed after Colonel Gail S.       Halvorsen, affectionately known as the ``Candy Bomber'', who       performed military service of an extraordinarily       distinguished character during the Berlin Airlift in 1948.        Halvorsen's creativity and compassion helped to heal the       wounds of the Second World War and softened the relationship       between an occupied Germany and the United States. Col.       Halvorsen exemplifies the best of our brave veterans who have       each demonstrated service before self.        Gail Halvorsen was assigned to Germany in 1948 to work as       an airlift pilot where he flew C-47 and C-54 cargo planes as       part of Operation ``Vittles''.

Halvorsen gave the children two sticks of gum he had in his       pocket, which they split into little pieces to share among       themselves. The looks of joy on their faces left an indelible       impression. Colonel Halvorsen was deeply affected by the       experience and wanted to do more to help. He promised the       children he would drop more candy to them from his plane as       he flew his regular airlift missions.

He eventually became       known around the world as ``The Candy Bomber''.        As the candy drops continued, word of ``Operation Little       Vittles'' reached the United States. American families,       schoolchildren, and candymakers began contributing candy and       homemade parachutes that Halvorsen and other pilots could       drop.        When the Berlin airlift ended, an estimated 250,000       parachutes with 21 tons of candy had been dropped by       Halvorsen and his fellow airmen as part of Operation Little       Vittles. Halvorsen's candy drops had a significant impact on       Berliners' public perception of America. He retired from the       military in 1974 after 31 years of service and more than       8,000 hours of flying time. Since his retirement, Halvorsen       has continued his humanitarian and community service. He has       voluntarily represented the U.S. Air Force and the United       States abroad and has re-enacted his famous candy drops       several times in Berlin, the Middle East, and around the       world in an effort to bring peace and relief. He was awarded       the Congressional Gold Medal, a German Order of Merit, an Air       Force Commendation Medal, and a Medal for Humane Action.       Halvorsen has also been a tremendous boon to his community       through his church service.        His non-profit organization, the Gail S. Halvorsen Aviation       Education Foundation, advances aviation education, promotes       youth leadership development, enhances community capacity for       emergency response, and encourages humanitarian on macro- and       micro-levels. The Foundation also provides education by       giving free lectures and multimedia presentations on       aviation, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics       (STEM) topics at local schools, community groups, and at its       own facility at the Spanish Fork Airport in Spanish Fork,       Utah.        Renaming the Provo Vet Center in Orem, Utah after Colonel       Halvorsen is a fitting and deserved recognition for such an       exemplary U.S. Air Force veteran and American hero. Thank you       for your consideration of this important matter.            Sincerely,      David Johnson,        Commander.      Terral Curtis,        Sr. Vice Commander.

Dear Chairman Tester, Ranking Member Moran, Chairman       Takano, and Ranking Member Bost: We ask you to accept this       letter on behalf of Utah Department of Disabled American       Veterans, in supporting the recommendation to change the name       of the Provo Veterans Center in Orem, Utah to be renamed to       honor Colonel Gail S. Halvorsen, exemplifying his compassion       for humanity in a time of War.        Colonel Halverson is one of the focal points to our       Americanism program here in Utah. In our program, we       highlight local military heroes and their impact in service       militarily and civically. He makes such an impact on our       youth when they hear of his compassion for the children of a       war-torn country. The simple act of caring became more than       an isolated incident. His action locally started an action       that was heard throughout the world. The exposure was so       great that American candy companies, children and families       got involved in supplying candies and homemade parachutes.        I have met Col. Halvorson on several occasions. He is a       very caring and humble man, and not only a local treasure but       a National Treasure as well. Gail had never thought that one       simple act could make such an impact on a nation or the world       stage.        Please help us here in Utah and the Nation by giving back a       little to an American Icon and National Treasure in the       renaming of the Provo Veterans Center to the ``Colonel Gail       Halverson Veteran Center''.            Sincerely,                                                    Jerry Estes,                                                          Commander,                                        Disabled American Veterans,      Department of Utah.                                   ____                                                   November 3, 2021.

Dear leaders of the Senate and House Veterans Affairs       Committees: On behalf of the Utah American Legion I write to       express our unconditional support for renaming the Provo Utah       Vet Center after Col.

Halvorsen is a beloved figure here in Utah and has been named       in the Hill Air Force Base aviation Hall of Fame.        We urge the Senate & House to pass this measure honoring       this great American.

(12) Construction of a new critical care center in West Los       Angeles, California, in an amount not to exceed $115,790,000.        (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized       to be appropriated to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for       fiscal year 2022 or the year in which funds are appropriated       for the Construction, Major Projects account, $3,403,613,000       for the projects authorized in subsection (a).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 7500.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7500, the Fiscal Year  2022 Veterans Affairs Major Medical Facility Authorization Act.   I thank my colleague from Texas (Mr. Allred) for his work on this  bill. I also thank the chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs  Committee, Senator Tester, for introducing the Senate companion to this  important legislation.   Each year, the Department of Veterans Affairs submits an annual  budget request to Congress, and it is our job to authorize and  appropriate the funding the VA needs to care for America's veterans and  their families.   Within that larger funding request is the VA's request for funds to  replace and modernize its medical facilities. This year's major  construction requests total just over $3.4 billion. It will build a  much-needed spinal cord injury center in Dallas, Texas; erect a new  surgical intensive care unit and renovate operating rooms in Oklahoma  City; construct a new critical care center in West Los Angeles; and  allow for the seismic retrofit and renovation of buildings in Portland,  Oregon, among other things.   Mr. Speaker, this Congress, the committee has highlighted VA's aging  infrastructure. During our oversight efforts, the committee has learned  that in order to fully recapitalize the Department's portfolio, the VA  would need roughly $90 billion.  [[Page H4997]]    Delivering 21st century healthcare in buildings that were built  during the latter half of the 19th century is far from ideal and  certainly not what our veterans deserve.   Given the severity of underfunding as it relates to the VA's capital  assets, we cannot afford to wait until the AIR Commission provides  recommendations to Congress and the White House, as my colleagues  across the aisle would advocate for. Life-safety and seismic issues  across the portfolio must be recognized now. Regular maintenance should  not be delayed because of budgetary concerns, nor should we delay  retrofitting facilities to meet the VA's fastest-growing population,  women veterans, or delay addressing the lessons learned from this  Nation's first pandemic in more than 100 years.   If we are going to build back veterans' trust in the VA, we have to  start making serious investments in the outdated infrastructure meant  to serve them, and nearly three-fourths of Americans agree.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support and pass this  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in  passing H.R. 7500. I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 5754) to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve the  ability of veterans to electronically submit complaints about the  delivery of health care services by the Department of Veterans Affairs.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5754         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Patient Advocate Tracker       Act''.       SEC. 2. SYSTEM FOR ELECTRONIC SUBMISSION OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT                     THE DELIVERY OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES BY THE                     DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.         Section 7309A(c) of title 38, United States Code, is       amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:        ``(3) Beginning not later than 18 months after the date of       the enactment of this paragraph, the Director shall establish       an information technology system that will allow a veteran       (or the designated representative of a veteran) to       electronically--        ``(A) file a complaint that will be received by the       appropriate patient advocate; and        ``(B) at any time view the status of the complaint,       including interim and final actions that have been taken to       address the complaint.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 5754.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5754, the Patient  Advocate Tracker Act, sponsored by the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs.  McClain).   This bill will require VA to create a system to allow veterans to  electronically submit complaints about the delivery of VA healthcare  services and to track the resolution of those complaints by local VA  patient advocates through an online system in real time. VA's existing  IT system only allows VA employees to track complaint resolution, but  not patients.   This bill has garnered the bipartisan support of an impressive 115  cosponsors since it was introduced 7 months ago. H.R. 5754 is also  endorsed by numerous veterans service organizations, including the  Veterans of Foreign Wars, Disabled American Veterans, Paralyzed  Veterans of America, and Student Veterans of America.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in  passing H.R. 5754, the Patient Advocate Tracker Act, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 6604) to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve the  method by which the Secretary of Veterans Affairs determines the  effects of a closure or disapproval of an educational institution on  individuals who do not transfer credits from such institution, as  amended.  [[Page H4998]]    The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6604         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

CHARGE TO ENTITLEMENT TO EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE FOR                     INDIVIDUALS WHO DO NOT TRANSFER CREDITS FROM                     CERTAIN CLOSED OR DISAPPROVED PROGRAMS OF                     EDUCATION.         Section 3699(c)(2)(A) of title 38, United States Code, is       amended--        (1) by striking ``An individual'' and inserting ``(i) An       individual'';        (2) by designating the second sentence as clause (iv) and       indenting appropriately; and        (3) by inserting after clause (i), as designated by       paragraph (1), the following new clauses:        ``(ii) In carrying out clause (i), the Secretary shall--        ``(I) require an individual to certify in writing that the       individual has transferred fewer than 12 credits as described       in such clause;        ``(II) require an individual who makes a certification       under subclause (I) to acknowledge in writing that if the       individual transfers 12 or more credits as described in such       clause (i)--        ``(aa) the individual may not be deemed under such clause       to be an individual who did not receive such credits; and        ``(bb) the Secretary shall rescind the certificate of       eligibility provided under subclause (IV);        ``(III) accept a certification under subclause (I) as proof       of the individual transferring fewer than 12 credits; and        ``(IV) provide to the individual who makes a certification       under subclause (I) and makes the acknowledgment under       subclause (II) a certificate of eligibility that the       individual may provide to an educational institution as proof       of the individual being covered by this paragraph.        ``(iii) The Secretary shall notify individuals described in       subparagraph (B) of being eligible to be covered by this       paragraph.''.

Section 3319(e) of title 38, United States Code, is       amended--        (1) in paragraph (1), by adding ``and'' after the       semicolon;        (2) in paragraph (2), by striking ``; and'' and inserting a       period; and        (3) by striking paragraph (3).       SEC. 4. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 6604, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I wish to speak in strong support of H.R. 6604, as  amended, the Veterans Eligible to Transfer School (VETS) Credit Act.   This bipartisan legislation is a product of work from the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Buchanan) and the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.  Murphy) that, together, will make it easier for veterans and their  dependents to use their earned benefits.   Representative Buchanan's legislation would provide students that  qualify a new provisional certificate of eligibility for benefits that  may have been unfairly lost due to circumstances outside of their  control. That means if a student veteran is left in the unfortunate  situation where their school closes, they will be provided detailed  information from the VA on how to reserve their benefits or have their  benefits restored or transferred to a new institution.   H.R. 6604, as amended, would also ensure that clerical errors don't  rob veterans of transferring their benefits to a dependent. Under  current law, if a servicemember accidentally makes a mistake on their  paperwork, such as indicating an expiration date for the benefits, and  the servicemember passes away before the benefits are used, there is no  way for the paperwork to be changed to allow the dependent to use the  benefits.   This bill clarifies existing law and ensures that clerical errors do  not prevent dependents from receiving educational assistance.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hard work of the members of the  committee on this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am prepared  to close.    Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in  passing this important piece of legislation, H.R. 6604, as amended, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 2687) to provide the Inspector General of the Department of  Veterans Affairs testimonial subpoena authority, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2687         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Strengthening Oversight for       Veterans Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. TESTIMONIAL SUBPOENA AUTHORITY OF THE INSPECTOR                     GENERAL OF THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.         (a) In General.--Section 312 of title 38, United States       Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new       subsection:        ``(d)(1)(A) In addition to the authority otherwise provided       by the Inspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. App.) and in       accordance with the requirements of this subsection, the       Inspector General, in carrying out the provisions of this       section, may require by subpoena the attendance and testimony       of witnesses as necessary in the performance of the functions       assigned to the Inspector General by the Inspector General       Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. App.) and this section, which in the       case of contumacy or refusal to obey, such subpoena shall be       enforceable by order of any appropriate district court of the       United States.        ``(B) The Inspector General may not require by subpoena the       attendance and testimony under subparagraph (A) of--        ``(i) any current Federal employee; or        ``(ii) any witness as part of any criminal proceeding.        ``(2) The authority to issue a subpoena under paragraph (1)       may not be delegated.        ``(3)(A) The Inspector General shall notify the Attorney       General of the intent to issue a subpoena under paragraph       (1).        ``(B) Not later than 10 days after the date on which the       Attorney General is notified pursuant to subparagraph (A),       the Attorney General may object in writing to the issuance of       the subpoena if the subpoena will interfere with an ongoing       investigation and, if the Attorney General makes such an       objection, the Inspector General may not issue the subpoena.        ``(C) If the Attorney General does not object in writing to       the issuance of the subpoena during the 10-day period       described in subparagraph (B), the Inspector General may       issue the subpoena.        ``(4) Before requiring by subpoena under paragraph (1) the       attendance and testimony of a witness, the Inspector General       shall, to the degree practicable--        ``(A) notify the witness of the intent of the Inspector       General to issue the subpoena; and        ``(B) provide the witness an opportunity to attend and       testify voluntarily.        ``(5) Whenever requiring by subpoena under paragraph (1)       the attendance and testimony of a witness, the Inspector       General shall, to the greatest extent practicable, travel to       residence of the witness, the principal place of business of       the witness, or other similar location that is in proximity       to the residence of the witness.        ``(6)(A) Along with each semiannual report submitted by the       Inspector General pursuant to section 5(b) of the Inspector       General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. App. 5(b)), the Inspector       General shall include a report on the exercise of the       authority provided by paragraph (1).        ``(B) Each report submitted under subparagraph (A) shall       include, for the most recently completed six-month period,       the following:        ``(i) The number of testimonial subpoenas issued and the       number of individuals interviewed pursuant to such subpoenas.        ``(ii) The number of proposed testimonial subpoenas with       respect to which the Attorney General objected under       paragraph (3)(B).        ``(iii) A discussion of any challenges or concerns that the       Inspector General has encountered exercising the authority       provided by paragraph (1).        ``(iv) Such other matters as the Inspector General       considers appropriate.        ``(7)(A) The authority provided by paragraph (1)(A) shall       terminate on May 31, 2025.        ``(B) The termination of authority by subparagraph (A)       shall not affect the enforceability of a subpoena issued       under paragraph (1)(A) before the date of such       termination.''.        (b) Effective Date.--        (1) In general.--Subsection (d) of section 312 of title 38,       United States Code, as added by subsection (a), shall take       effect on the date of the enactment of this Act.        (2) Semiannual report.--Paragraph (6) of subsection (d) of       such section, as so added, shall apply beginning on the date       that is seven months after the first day of the first fiscal       year beginning after the date of the enactment of this Act.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material on S. 2687.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this bipartisan bill, S. 2687,  the Strengthening Oversight for Veterans Act, introduced by Senator  Tester. I thank Representative Rice and Delegate Radewagen for  introducing the House companion to this bill.   This bill seeks to strengthen the VA Office of the Inspector General  by granting the office testimonial subpoena authority, an essential  tool for conducting oversight.   Too often, individuals with important information relevant to an  investigation retire or move to a position in another agency, thereby  evading OIG investigations. Currently, the inspector general cannot  require testimony of these former employees. Questioning these  individuals could shed light on wrongdoing or mismanagement that puts  the care and safety of our veterans and their families at risk.   This bill has bipartisan support in Congress as well as from Veterans  of Foreign Wars, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, and the  Project on Government Oversight.   Again, Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation. I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in  passing S. 2687, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7375) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to update  the payment system of the Department of Veterans Affairs to allow for  electronic fund transfer of educational assistance, administered by the  Secretary, to a foreign institution of higher education.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7375         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. PAYMENT OF VA EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE VIA                     ELECTRONIC FUND TRANSFER TO A FOREIGN                     INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION.         Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of       this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall update the       payment system of the Department of Veterans Affairs to allow       for electronic fund transfer of educational assistance,       administered by the Secretary, to a foreign institution of       higher education that--        (1) provides an approved course of education to an eligible       recipient of such assistance; and        (2) does not have--        (A) an employer identification number; or        (B) an account with a domestic bank.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material on H.R. 7375.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7375, introduced by  Representative Mikie Sherrill.   This legislation directs VA to finally update its student payment  systems to allow for educational assistance funds to be transmitted  electronically to a foreign institution of higher education, as long as  the institution is providing an approved course of study. Our committee  has heard from students and schools about the impact of VA's inability  to modernize its systems for student payments.   The bill has bipartisan support as well from Disabled American  Veterans, Student Veterans of America, Veterans Education Success, and  the Veterans of Foreign Wars.   Madam Speaker, Representative Sherrill's legislation is a response to  strong advocacy for our student veterans studying abroad who are often  unsure how their benefits will translate overseas.   Madam Speaker, I thank her for offering this legislation, I urge  support and passage, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in  passing H.R. 7375, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6376) to amend title 38, United States Code, to extend  eligibility for a certain work-study allowance paid by the Secretary of  Veterans Affairs to certain individuals who pursue programs of  rehabilitation, education, or training on at least a half-time basis,  and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6376         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Student Veteran Work Study       Modernization Act''.       SEC. 2. PILOT PROGRAM TO EXPAND ELIGIBILITY FOR A CERTAIN                     WORK-STUDY ALLOWANCE PAID BY THE SECRETARY OF                     VETERANS AFFAIRS TO CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS WHO                     PURSUE CERTAIN PROGRAMS ON AT LEAST A HALF-TIME                     BASIS.         (a) Pilot Program.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall       carry out a pilot program under which the Secretary shall       expand eligibility for the work-study allowance under section       3485 of title 38, United States Code, to individuals who are       pursuing programs of rehabilitation, education, or training       specified in subsection (b) of such section at a rate equal       to at least half of that required of a full-time student.        (b) Relationship to Other Work-study Individuals.--In       carrying out the pilot program under subsection (a), the       Secretary shall ensure the provisions of section 3485 of       title 38, United States Code, apply with respect to the       individuals specified in subsection (a) of this section in       the same manner as to the individuals specified in subsection       (b) of such section 3485, except with respect to the       requirement of at least three-quarter-time student status.        (c) Duration.--The Secretary shall carry out the pilot       program under subsection (a) during the five-year period       beginning on the date of the commencement of the pilot       program.       SEC. 3. ANNUAL REPORT REGARDING VETERANS WHO PARTICIPATE IN                     WORK-STUDY.         Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of       this Act and annually  [[Page H5001]]       thereafter, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall submit to       the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and House       of Representatives a report regarding veterans who       participate in work-study. Such report shall include the       following elements:        (1) The number of such veterans.        (2) The percentage of such veterans who obtain a four-year       degree.        (3) The number of such veterans who obtain full-time work       at the Department of Veterans Affairs.       SEC. 4. ADJUSTMENTS OF CERTAIN LOAN FEES.         The loan fee table in section 3729(b)(2) of title 38,       United States Code, is amended by striking ``January 14,       2031'' each place it appears and inserting ``January 23,       2031''.       SEC. 5. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  insert extraneous material on H.R. 6376, as amended.                                time  1615     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I strongly support H.R. 6376, as amended, the Student Veteran  Modernization Act, which would make much-needed improvements and  modernizations to the VA work-study program.   This legislation will create a pilot program to allow part-time  student veterans to access VA work-study programs for the next 5 years,  ensuring they can complete their certification or degree without taking  on unmanageable amounts of student debt and still care for themselves  and their families.   I would prefer this be a permanent change in the law, but I  understand the need to review these changes in a pilot program. I hope  that when this pilot program concludes, and we have an idea of how many  veterans were helped, Congress will make this change permanent.   Currently, student veterans must maintain a full class load to be  eligible for work-study, which is not feasible for many veterans who  are balancing families or other work obligations. With this change,  part-time student veterans will be able to earn a paycheck while also  earning workforce skills.   I thank Representative Axne for her hard work on the introduction of  this bill. I also thank student veterans and the Department of Veteran  Affairs for their feedback, which improved the bill and will bring more  student veterans into the work-study program.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to join me and pass  H.R. 6376, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7153) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to submit  to Congress a plan to modernize the information technology systems of  the Veterans Benefits Administration, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7153         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Department of Veterans       Affairs Principles of Benefits Automation Act''.       SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of Veterans       Affairs should increase automation in the processing of       claims for benefits under the laws administered by the       Secretary in accordance with the following principles:        (1) The purpose of automation should be to increase the       speed and accuracy of claims processing decisions.        (2) Automation should be conducted in a manner that       enhances the productivity of employees of the Department of       Veterans Affairs.        (3) Automation should be carried out in a manner that       achieves greater consistency in the processing and rating of       claims by relying on patterns of similar evidence in claim       files.        (4) To the greatest extent possible, automation should be       carried out by drawing from information in the possession of       the Department, other Government agencies, and claimants for       benefits.        (5) Automation of any claims process or determination       should not be end-to-end.        (6) Employees of the Department should continue to make       decisions with respect to the approval of claims and the       granting of benefits.        (7) Automation should not be carried out in a manner that       reduces or infringes upon--        (A) the due process rights of claimants for benefits under       the laws administered by the Secretary; or        (B) the duties of the Secretary to assist and notify       claimants.        (8) Automation should be carried out while taking all       necessary measures to protect the privacy of claimants and       their personally identifiable information.        (9) Automation of claims processing should not eliminate or       reduce the Veterans Benefits Administration workforce.       SEC. 3.

(a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs       shall submit to appropriate congressional committees a plan       for the modernization of the information technology systems       of the Veterans Benefits Administration. The plan shall cover       the first fiscal year that begins after the date of the       enactment of this Act and the subsequent four fiscal years       and shall include each of the following:        (1) An identification of any information system to be       modernized or retired, if applicable, during the period       covered by the plan.        (2) A description of how the Secretary intends to       incorporate the principles referred to in section 2 into the       modernization of such information systems.        (3) An identification of targets, for each fiscal year, by       which the Secretary intends to complete the modernization of       each information system or major component or functionality       of such system identified under paragraph (1).        (4) Cost estimates for the modernization of each       information system identified under paragraph (1) for each       fiscal year covered by the plan and in total.        (b) Appropriate Congressional Committees.--In this section,       the term ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--        (1) the Committee on Veterans' Affairs and the Subcommittee       on Military Construction, Veterans' Affairs, and Related       Agencies of the Committee on Appropriations of the House of       Representatives; and        (2) the Committee on Veterans' Affairs and the Subcommittee       on Military Construction, Veterans' Affairs, and Related       Agencies of the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate.   [[Page H5002]]      Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material on H.R. 7153, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7153, as amended, the  Department of Veterans Affairs Principles of Benefits Automation Act,  introduced by Ranking Member Bost.   This bill provides clarification on the sense of Congress on the  automation of benefits claims and requires the VA to submit to Congress  a plan for modernization of the information technology systems of the  Veterans Benefits Administration.   As the VA moves toward greater automation, we must ensure that the VA  does automation the right way for all stakeholders, including both  veterans and the workforce. It is also important for the VA to identify  systems in need of modernization to support successful implementation  of bills, such as the PACT Act, and important initiatives such as the  Secretary's announcement of several new presumptions.   I will reinforce that. On the topic of automation, it is not the  intent of Congress or the VA to use automation on claims to eliminate,  reduce, or contract out the duties of the VBA workforce. We intend to  conduct close oversight of the use of automation and potential  expansion. This bill is part of those efforts.   When implemented in the right way, automation has the potential to  reduce the day-to-day burden of employees by diminishing menial tasks  and allowing the dedicated VA staff to focus on the kind of work that  truly needs a human touch. Such an approach stands to benefit the  ultimate consumer of the VA: our veterans.   Madam Speaker, I support this bill and encourage my colleagues to  support it as well, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to join me in  passing H.R. 7153, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.
