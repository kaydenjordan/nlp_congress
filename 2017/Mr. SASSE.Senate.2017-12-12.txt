 Mr. President, I rise today in continued support of Steve  Grasz's nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.   Some of those who have been attacking Mr. Grasz have claimed that he  doesn't have the character or the temperament to treat litigants fairly  and decide cases based on the facts and the law.   In evaluating those claims, I hope my colleagues in this body will  listen to the hundreds of Nebraskans of all partisan and ideological  stripes who have stood up in support of Steve's nomination. I urge  everyone to listen to what those Nebraskans have to say specifically  about his character and about his temperament.   One Nebraskan wrote to Mrs. Fischer, the senior Senator from  Nebraska, and to me, as well as to the Judiciary Committee:         I was the plaintiff in a First Amendment defamation and       political speech action against the Nebraska Republican       Party. . . . Mr. Grasz represented the Nebraska Republican       Party. I was not successful in my lawsuit. However, I did       have the opportunity to meet and interact with Mr. Grasz       during the case and found him to be . . . a consummate       professional. Based on my observations I believe his judicial       temperament would be of the highest quality and all parties       would be given equal opportunity. . . . I can think of no one       better qualified or suited to be appointed to this       prestigious judgeship than Steven Grasz.    Another Nebraskan wrote to us:         I know Steve personally having served as opposing counsel       to him on cases. . . . Steve was a formidable opponent. . . .       While he zealously advocated for his clients, he did so in a       level-headed and even-keeled manner.    Yet another Nebraskan writes:         I . . . have . . . represented clients in cases where Mr.       Grasz was opposing counsel. In all circumstances he       demonstrates the utmost professionalism. . . . I am a       registered Democrat and, quite frankly, am not a strong       supporter of the current administration. However, as a       practicing attorney dealing with complex litigation and       appearing regularly in the federal courts of appeals, I want       intelligent, thoughtful individuals appointed to the Bench       who will administer the law and apply existing precedent. I       have no doubt that Mr. Grasz can do that very effectively.    Also, consider the words of this Nebraskan:         Steve does not allow his role as an advocate to cloud his       analyses and judgment. He reviews statutes, regulations, rule       and common law with a clear eye, and he applies these       authorities to the facts presented to him. . . . [H]is       respect for precedent and his high regard for the works of       other branches of government show his dedication to following       the Constitution and our nation's laws as they are written.    Steve Grasz is a Nebraskan through and through. As I said here on the  floor yesterday, Steve bleeds Husker red, but he is a guy who is well  suited to take on the black robes of the judge, for he understands that  we do not have blue or red partisan jerseys on our article III branch  of government, the independent judiciary.   Steve is well suited to serve as a judge on the Eighth Circuit. I  think that not just Nebraskans but folks across all the States  represented in the Eighth Circuit are going to find a man of  unbelievable temperament.   The ABA is a liberal advocacy organization. That is absolutely their  right. What is not OK is for the ABA to masquerade as a neutral arbiter  of professional qualifications.   Attacks on Steve's character have come out of this process because  the two reviewers from the ABA cite again and again and again anonymous  sources of his supposed rudeness. We have seen none of that in  Nebraska. Again, hundreds of people have written to the senior Senator  and to me and now to the Judiciary Committee in support of the  President's decision to nominate Steve Grasz to the Eighth Circuit  Court of Appeals.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  the specific letters I have just cited.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                   Moats Law Firm, P.C., L.L.O.,                                    Elkhorn, NE, September 21, 2017.      Re Nomination of Steven Grasz for 8th Circuit Appellate           Judgeship.       Chairman Chuck Grassley,      Senate Judiciary Committee,      Washington, DC.      Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein,      Senate Judiciary Committee,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senators Grassley and Feinstein: Steven Grasz has been       nominated as an appellate judge for the United States Court       of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. I write this letter of       recommendation in support of his nomination and confirmation.       I am a lifelong member of the Democratic party.        I have known Mr. Grasz since 2009 when we were involved in       common litigation to the Nebraska Supreme Court (Moats v.       Republican Party of Nebraska, 281 Neb. 411, 796 N.W.2d 584       (2011)) which was subsequently appealed to the United States       Supreme Court where certiorari was denied. I was the       plaintiff in a First Amendment defamation and political       speech action against the Nebraska Republican Party arising       out of a non-partisan office I sought in the Nebraska       Unicameral in the fall of 2008. Mr. Grasz represented the       Nebraska Republican Party.        I was not successful in my lawsuit. However I did have the       opportunity to meet and interact with Mr. Grasz during the       case and found him to be polite and courteous and extremely       well informed and educated on this complicated subject       matter. At no time did  [[Page S7956]]       he ever show any inappropriate actions or behavior towards me       or my family and was a consummate professional. Based on my       observations I believe his judicial temperament would be of       the highest quality and all parties would be given equal       opportunity.        In life there is always another chapter to each of our       collective stories. I am pleased to inform you, that my       dealings with Mr. Grasz and his family extended beyond the       case we were involved in. Our children were involved in       competitive dance for the pest four years and my wife and our       children had the opportunity to interact with Mr. Grasz and       his family in a social setting. My observations and       interactions with him were always positive and productive       notwithstanding him haying been on opposite side of a very       emotional case. He is a terrific husband and father, a       brilliant legal scholar and oaring human being. I can think       of no one better qualified or suited to be appointed to this       prestigious judgeship than Steven Grasz.            Sincerely,      Rex J. Moats.                                   ____                                                 September 18, 2017.      Re Nomination of L. Steven Grasz.       Chairman Chuck Grassley,      Senate Judiciary Committee,      Washington, DC.      Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein,      Senate Judiciary Committee,      Washington, DC.        Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Feinstein: I write in       support of the nomination of Steve Grasz to the United States       Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. I know Steve       personally having served as opposing counsel to him on cases.       I also know him by reputation in the Omaha legal community       through his work on significant litigation.        Steve was a formidable opponent. He was willing to go the       extra step to advance his clients' interests. While he       zealously advocated for his clients, he did so in a level-      headed and even-keeled manner. I've never seen him raise his       voice. He listens and asks good questions. His temperament is       well suited for the position to which he has been nominated.        There is no question Steve has the intellect to do the       important work of a federal appellate court judge. He has       published multiple law review articles which have contributed       to the practice of law. Steve's pleadings and briefs are       clear, thoughtful, and well written. He did not attempt to       advance frivolous claims. In my experience with him, he works       diligently and was always well prepared.        Unfortunately, with some lawyers, every conversation has to       be memorialized in a letter out of fear that the lawyer will       reverse course. That was not the case with Steve. His word       was good.        Steve has both represented the government and represented       individuals in claims against the government. He has valuable       litigation experience in cases involving Section 1983 claims       and qualified immunity which make up a significant portion of       the cases handled by federal appellate judges. His experience       will serve him well while sitting on the other side of the       bench.        I believe Steve is committed to upholding the laws and       Constitution of the United States, and will do so as a member       of the Eighth Circuit. I urge the Judiciary Committee to       advance his nomination.            Respectfully Submitted,      Timothy J. Thalken.                                   ____                                                  September 9, 2017.      Re Confirmation Hearing for L. Steven Grasz for Judge of the           United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.       Chairman Chuck Grassley,      Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.      Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein,      Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Grassley and Senator Feinstein: I am writing       to express my support for Steven (Steve) Grasz to be       confirmed as judge for the United States Court of Appeals for       the Eighth Circuit. I have been a lawyer for twenty-one       years, and had the good fortune to spend five of those years       working with Steve on a variety of matters spanning from       local litigation to federal regulatory and administrative       actions. While Steve ably represented clients in state and       federal venues, I observed firsthand the qualities that would       make him an outstanding federal appellate court judge.        Steve possesses admirable analytical skills an ability to       grasp complex and often highly abstract concepts in a manner       that allows to communicate these concepts in a plain,       understandable way. From a practical perspective, this is       very important skill for any judge to possess because it is       the vanishingly rare lawsuit in which the underlying dispute       is so very narrow that the judge's ruling is limited only to       the parties before the Court. Instead, judges' resolutions of       disputes serve as guidelines for many other lawyers and their       respective clients to follow in future transactions. This is       especially true for Circuit-level opinions, which are widely       disseminated. Well-reasoned, cogent judicial opinions are an       invaluable resource for lawyers to turn to when advising       Clients who may or may not be overly familiar with our       justice system. Lawyers rely upon judicial opinions when       advising clients about the relative risks and benefits of a       particular course of action. Steve's ability to communicate       difficult, often abstract concepts in plain terms will       contribute greatly to this very important function of our       legal system.        Importantly, Steve does not allow his role as advocate to       cloud his analyses and judgment. He reviews statues,       regulations rule and common law with a clear eye, and applies       these authorities to the facts presented to him. Steve       advises clients and develops strategies based upon existing       authorities, showing his respect for our system of governance       and for each branch's contribution to it. His ability and       willingness to evaluate particular facts in light of various       authorities is a critical skill for judges to possess, and       shows his deep respect, for precedential law. Similarly, his       respect for precedent and his regard for the works of other       branches of government show his dedication to following the       Constitution and our nation's laws as they are written. This       quality is critically important for a judge to have following       the Constitution and our nation's laws as they are written is       part and parcel of the development and application of clear,       lasting legal principles upon which all members of the       public--not only lawyers and their clients--may rely in       conducting the transactions of everyday life.        Finally, Steve has a temperament very well-suited in the       bench. He is levelheaded and unfailingly courteous to       opposing lawyers their respective clients, and to judges. I       have seen Steve involved in challenging, stressful       situations, yet his demeanor consistently remains composed       and polite. He does not engage in personal criticism of       judges, fellow lawyers, or litigants, nor does he allow the       behavior of others to be anything other than courteous and       professional. While certainly not every lawyer possesses this       ability, it is a vital one for judges to have because our       system of justice depends upon judges' ability to maintain       decorum even when attorneys or litigants are not doing so.       Through trying situations, Steve has consistently shown his       ability and willingness to treat all attorneys and parties       with respect, and he has conducted himself in the       professional, composed manner that lawyers hope to see in       judges at every level. His treatment of others ultimately       honors the truth-seeking function our system of justice is       intended to fulfill since he does not engage in       obstructionist tactics or gamesmanship intended to drive up       litigation costs or designed to deny other parties access to       information bearing upon matter in dispute. As a lawyer,       Steve sets an excellent example of someone working toward       fair and just resolutions of disputes. This attribute would       serve him very well as a judge and would directly benefit all       persons impacted by the court's decisions.        Thank you for taking the time to review my letter of       support for Steve. If you have any questions or concerns       about my standpoint regarding his ample qualifications for       being confirmed as judge for the United States Court of       Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, please let me know.            Sincerely,      Tim Dolan.                                   ____                                                        Omaha, NE,                                                 September 20, 2017.      Re Nomination of Steve Grasz, United States Court of Appeals           for the Eighth Circuit.       Hon. Chuck Grassley,      U.S. Senator,      Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Grassley: I am writing to indicate my strong       support for President Trump's nomination of Steve Grasz to       the United State Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.        Mr. Grasz was employed by the Kutak Rock law firm when I       began working there right after law school. Mr. Grasz is very       intelligent and has the legal background and skill to be an       asset to the Court of Appeals. I have maintained my       acquaintance with Mr. Grasz and have also represented clients       in cases where Mr. Grasz was opposing counsel. In all       circumstances he demonstrates the utmost professionalism.        I have no hesitation in stating that litigants could       present to him the most complex legal issues and he would be       able to analyze them intelligently and coherently. I have       also had the opportunity to read materials he has written.       Opinions by him would be a credit to the judiciary.        Although I personally believe that an individual's personal       political, social, or religious practices and beliefs are       irrelevant to qualifications for a judicial position, I       realize that such considerations have been injected into       judicial confirmation proceedings over the past few years. I       expect that certain factions may attempt to raise such issues       regarding Mr. Grasz who has actively served both his       government and his community.        I am a registered Democrat and, quite frankly, am not a       strong supporter of the current administration. However, as a       practicing attorney dealing with complex litigation and       appearing regularly in the federal courts of appeals, I want       intelligent, thoughtful individuals appointed to the Bench       who will administer the law and apply existing precedent. I       have no doubt Mr. Grasz can do that very effectively.        I appreciate your consideration of my recommendation. If       there is any interest in further information, please feel       free to have your staff contact me.            Sincerely,                                                     Diana J. Vogt,                                                      For the Firm.   [[Page S7957]]          I urge all of my colleagues to listen to all of the  Nebraskans, again, of all backgrounds and across the partisan spectrum,  as they have urged us to confirm Mr. Grasz today.
