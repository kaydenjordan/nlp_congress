 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 290-- the Commercial Remote Sensing Amendment Act of 2023.   This bill would provide for transparent licensing of commercial  remote sensing systems and renews the requirement that the Department  of Commerce send an annual report to Congress on the status of  commercial remote sensing applications.   Commercial remote sensing systems can be used to improve operations  in a variety of industries.   Remote sensing is crucial for agricultural production, weather  forecasting, and emergency response efforts.   The Aeronautical Survey Program (ASP), the Coastal Mapping Program  (CMP), and emergency response efforts all benefit from the ocean data  that has been collected by using remote sensing systems.   This data enables the provision of a regularly updated national  coastline for marine navigation, establishing territorial limits, and  managing coastal resources.   Cities like Houston that are close to coastlines and experience  frequent flooding and hurricanes greatly benefit from commercial remote  sensing systems.   A study done by the Texas State Climatologist Office at Texas A&M  University warned that Texans should brace themselves for more extreme  weather in the coming years.   The study found that, as a direct consequence of climate change,  Texas should expect the severity of hurricanes and flooding to increase  through the year 2036.   In recent years, Texans have experienced the devastating effects of  climate change.   On August 25, 2017, Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas, just  north of the city of Corpus Christi, as a category 4 storm.   Hurricane Harvey dropped 21 trillion gallons of intense rainfall on  Texas and Louisiana, most of it on the Houston Metroplex.   The volume of water that fell on Houston and other affected areas of  Texas and Louisiana could fill more than 24,000 Astrodomes or supply  the water for Niagara Falls for 15 days.   Hurricane Harvey caused damage to more than 204,000 homes of which 99  thousand were in Harris County.   With commercial remote sensing systems, scientists would have been  able to monitor the storm prior to landfall and would have been able to  collect information and data from inaccessible areas.   Remote sensing systems provide warnings to locals and prepare them  for storms, saving lives and managing potential risks.   The information gathered by these remote sensing systems, such as  elevation data, is utilized to create management plans for the  restoration, monitoring, and maintenance of the environment and the  planet.   Over the last 50 years, the number of disasters has increased by a  factor of five worldwide.   With the increase in climate disasters, lawmakers need to protect the  American public by passing legislation that would manage risks and save  lives.   I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation that can  save lives as we navigate our everchanging climate.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 342--``The  Cost-Share Accountability Act of 2023.''  [[Page H498]]    H.R. 342 requires the Department of Energy to report quarterly to  Congress on the use of the department's authority to reduce or  eliminate cost-sharing requirements for various research, development,  and demonstration projects.   Specifically, this bill aims to establish the necessary requirements  to effectively set the standards for quarterly reporting to Congress in  order to ensure proper management of capital allotment between energy  departments.   Mr. Speaker, The Energy Policy Act (EPAct) of 2005 (Public Law 109- 58), the underlying statute of H.R. 342 which provides the background  history for H.R. 342, calls for the development of grant programs,  demonstration and testing initiatives, and tax incentives that promote  alternative fuels and advanced vehicles production and use.   H.R. 342--``The Cost-Share Accountability Act of 2023'' will provide  advancements towards energy innovations that will benefit both the  state of energy independence of the United States as well as critical  energy advancements for the future.   The Secretary of Energy has the authority to reduce or eliminate cost  sharing requirements for applied research and development as necessary  and appropriate.   Moreover, the Secretary may reduce cost sharing requirements for  demonstration and commercial application activities as necessary and  appropriate, taking into consideration any technological risk relating  to the activity.   Mr. Speaker, based on the S&P Global macroeconomic model completed on  January 5th, it is expected that the U.S. real GDP will grow by 0.5  percent in 2023, with economic growth returning after contraction in  the first quarter of 2023.   In 2024, the estimated real GDP will grow by 1.9 percent, driven  primarily by an increase in household consumption. This means that  there will be relatively flat economic growth in 2023 resulting in  total U.S. energy consumption falling by 0.9 percent in the forecast.  However, total energy consumption then rises by 1.0 percent in 2024.   This evidence provides us a basis for making sure we have the proper  standards in place for effective accounting for key departments  performing various research, development, and demonstration projects.   As a senior Member of the Budget Committee, I understand the  importance of providing clarity and transparency to the American people  on the allocation of funds.   I urge all my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of H.R. 342,  ``The Cost-Share Accountability Act of 2023'' so we can provide  transparency to the American people while addressing the proper  implementations towards efficient allotment of cost-sharing.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 500--the  Financial Exploitation Prevention Act of 2023, to amend the Investment  Company Act of 1940 to postpone the date of payment or satisfaction  upon redemption of certain securities in the case of the financial  exploitation of specified adults.   H.R. 500 would allow a registered open-end investment company to  better protect seniors by delaying the redemption period of any  redeemable security if it was reasonably believed that such redemption  was requested through the financial exploitation of a security holder  who is a senior or individual unable to protect their own interests.   The legislation would also require the Securities and Exchange  Commission to submit a report to Congress that includes recommendations  for regulatory and legislative changes that would address financial  exploitation of older adults.  [[Page H501]]    16.9 percent of the United States population are adults 65 years and  older. The nations' population is aging, and it is predicted that one  in five Americans will be 65 years or older by 2040.   As our population gets older, it is imperative that we continue to  protect ourselves against those who take financial advantage of our  elders.   According to the Department of Justice, there were more than 92,000  victims of elder fraud in 2021. These 92,000 cases accounted for $1.7  billion in losses in 2021.   Financial exploitation refers to financial crimes committed against  older adults. Financial abuse is typically committed by someone that  the senior knows and trusts, whereas financial fraud is committed by a  stranger.   The median income of seniors 65 years and older is $47,620, while the  average annual expenses for this age group is $48,872.   With this budget mismatch, many seniors are already on strict  budgets, and with the risk of financial exploitation, it is essential  that this age group is protected by legislation that makes it more  difficult for unscrupulous individuals--whether a family member or a  stranger--to take their hard-earned money from them.   In 2021, Texas ranked number three in the number of victims of  financial exploitation. Almost 6,800 seniors were impacted, and the  total losses were over $150 million.   This legislation would help our seniors by requiring that financial  institutions delay the redemption period for redeemable securities if  it is believed that the request was made under financial exploitation.   As the number of elders increases in our Nation, the risk of  financial exploitation increases. Lawmakers must work together to  ensure that we are protecting Americans and their investments, and this  legislation would do just that.   This common sense, bipartisan legislation passed the House in the  117th Congress, and shows that the two parties have the ability to come  together to work on legislation that positively impacts the American  public.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the isle to support H.R. 500-- the Financial Exploitation Prevention Act of 2023.   As we grow older as a nation, we must work to protect our elders.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 582,  the ``Credit Union Board Modernization Act'' which would give credit  unions more flexibility in their governance by not mandating monthly  board meetings.   H.R. 582 would allow credit unions to dedicate more time and  resources to serving their members by reducing the frequency that the  board of directors of a federal credit union would be required to meet  each year.   In the modern world, with increased connectivity from today's  technology, boards of Credit Unions should not be subjected to mandated  minimum meetings but should be provided with the flexibility to  determine the frequency of their meetings as provided within the  guidelines outlined in this bill.   By modernizing Credit Unions, we are ensuring that working class  people who are exercising their right to choose what financial service  they want, get the most from their chosen service.   This bill would be helpful to small credit unions, especially those  that are closest to individual communities and whose boards may not be  able to meet every month.   For years, I have supported Credit Unions by supporting their tax- exempt status in 2004 and 2011.   In 2012, I recognized and supported the Texas Dow Employees Credit  Union full-service center, which was an important asset to the  community.   Credit unions provide a critical resource to many working families by  allowing them to have access to our financial system when they might  otherwise be restricted from such access.   My constituents and many Americans rely on credit unions as a  reasonable and trustworthy financial service.   According to the CUNA (Credit Union National Association), nationally  there are over 135 million Americans who are members in a credit union.   In Texas alone, credit unions have 422 credit unions headquartered in  the state and over 10 million members' total as of 2022.   If we require credit unions to dedicate resources to meetings instead  of providing service to their members, we are failing our constituents.   America's credit unions are a central part of our Nation's financial  prosperity and must be supported and uplifted through shifting times of  essential modernization.   I support this bill and urge my colleagues to join me.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 298-- the Expanding Access to Capital for Rural Job Creators Act.   H.R. 298 requires the Advocate for Small Business Capital Formation,  an entity within the Securities and Exchange Commission to submit an  annual report on the various challenges small businesses in rural areas  face when attempting to secure capital.   This bill was first introduced in 2017 and continues to be  reintroduced into congress with the sole hope of helping the small  businesses that truly are the backbone of our economies.   The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 was originally created to  regulate securities transactions in the secondary market in order to  promote more financial integrity, transparency and to reduce fraud and  manipulation.   Over the years, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 has been amended  in response to various needs of our capital markets.   The Office of the Advocate for Small Business Capital Formation was  established in January 2019 as an independent SEC office.   Among other things, this office is responsible for advancing the  interests of small businesses and their investors at the SEC.   The office also facilitates the expanded access to capital for rural  area small businesses.   Rural businesses in Texas and around the nation frequently encounter  significant challenges when attempting to raise funds to expand and  improve their operations.   Lack of capital or funding, a faulty infrastructure or business  model, and ineffective marketing efforts are a frequent cause of  failure for small businesses.   This legislation would support our rural economies by assisting rural  small businesses in overcoming these obstacles.   It is crucial for Congress to support small and rural businesses if  it wants to help this country continue to prosper and grow.   In 2022 Texas had a population of about 30 million, with 3.8 million  of them residing in rural areas.   And in 2022, between 13 and 14 percent of all jobs in the United  States could be found in rural areas, a rate that is only anticipated  to increase over time.   These continuing increases in employment and population indicate a  developing trend and the requirement for new businesses to develop in  rural areas with easier access to capital which provides new employment  opportunities.   With more than 13,000 unemployed Texans and 6 million Americans  throughout the USA, it is essential that we, as elected members of  Congress, support the economic growth of our rural populations.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remind my colleagues of  the scourge of human trafficking and its impact on children.   It is well known that human trafficking is more profitable than drug  trafficking because the vicious cycle of using someone over and over  again is both profitable and obviously devastating for that human  being.   In children and youth, they are used for sex trafficking. It is well  known that you are apt to be trafficked from your school, from your  primary or secondary school, online.   So I have introduced H.R. 30. I ask my colleagues to join me in the  Stop Human Trafficking in School Zones Act, in which I am joined by my  colleague, Congressman McCaul, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs  Committee.   We have seen human trafficking go beyond the borders of this Nation.  It is international. It is dastardly, as I said. It is in airports. It  is in bathrooms in public transit places.   I want to congratulate the NTZ operation in my own community that has  stopped human trafficking at sports arenas.   Let's protect children. Join H.R. 30, the Stop Human Trafficking in  School Zones Act.                            ____________________
