 Mr. Speaker, it would be inaccurate to say that this is a  vote about process. It is a vote about substance.   In fact, Mr. Quigley's amendment is about one of the most pressing  issues of our time. The Director of National Intelligence has said that  there is a flashing red danger signal similar to the one that happened  before 9/11.   This amendment responds by providing for us to partner with our  States to slam the door in the face of the Russian bear or any other  adversary who seeks to steal the integrity of our elections.   The flashing red light calls us to action. Surely we can rise above  pandering to party and Putin to act on behalf of our freedom and our  security.   We have sworn an oath to defend our Constitution and our liberty  against all enemies foreign and domestic.   Mr. Speaker, you have the opportunity to do that today. Do so. Vote  ``yes'' on this amendment for your country.    Mr. Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of the  majority leader the schedule for the week to come.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy),  my friend, the majority leader.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his exposition of  the schedule.   I want to speak briefly to the appropriations process.   I think the Appropriations Committee is fairly close to the  completion of its bills. Can the gentleman tell us when the balance of  the appropriations bills might be coming to the floor and when we can  perhaps expect the next appropriations bill on the floor?    I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his observation. I  share his delight that the Senate is moving bills. I would observe that  they appear to be moving them in a bipartisan fashion, which I think is  positive for an outcome on the appropriations process.   In that vein, I know we are in conference on the MILCON and  Legislative Branch minibus. Does the gentleman have any idea when that  might conclude and we might be considering that conference?   I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, let me just mention, we just had a vote, and,  obviously, I was disappointed in the outcome. I was the sponsor,  probably as the gentleman knows, of the Help America Vote Act, which  created the Election Assistance Commission. The Election Assistance  Commission bill, the HAVA bill, passed with a big bipartisan vote and  was signed, as the gentleman knows, by President George W. Bush in a  very bipartisan effort.   The premise was that, for 200 years, the Federal Government had not  participated in assisting the States in running Federal elections. I  will repeat that. The vote for President, the vote for Senate, and the  vote for the House were all done through State administrations with no  participation by the Federal Government.   In 2002, the Congress and the President made a determination that we  would contribute to making sure that our elections ran correctly. The  gentleman will remember the issue of hanging chads and the question of  whether or not votes were properly counted. It was of great concern  across the aisle. So we passed the legislation.   Unfortunately, however, we have not continued to pursue that. And  today's vote, we have a greater challenge today. The challenge in the  2000 election was inappropriate administration, domestically, of our  election. The problem in 2016, as Speaker Ryan pointed out and the  Intelligence Committee found and the intelligence community has found,  was that there was clearly an outside attack on America by Russia, and  perhaps others, to undermine the integrity of our elections.  [[Page H6573]]    The vote that we held just a few minutes ago was about the Federal  Government continuing to partner with the States to ensure the  integrity of our election system and its safety from outside attack,  interference, and undermining.   I hope, Mr. Leader, that we could visit that issue. I hope the Senate  visits that issue. Perhaps we can visit it in conference, and,  together, Republicans and Democrats could join together in an effort to  work with our partners in the States to ensure the integrity of the  administration of our election and to ensure that votes are cast  correctly, counted correctly, and reported correctly.   As the sponsor of that bill that was cosponsored, as the gentleman  may remember--no, you weren't here in '02--by Bob Ney of Ohio, but  overwhelmingly supported on both sides of the aisle, I hope that we  could move ahead, in the weeks ahead, as we move toward the November 6  election, to make sure that Americans--Democrats, Republicans,  independents, all others, and not only in this country but around the  world--have confidence in the results of our election.   Mr. Speaker, I don't know whether the gentleman wants to respond to  that. I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his observation.   I would simply be constrained to say, I listened to Mr.  Frelinghuysen. I listened to his opposition to the MTR. The pretense  that the amendment that was offered is somehow a procedural or  nonconsequential amendment is incorrect. Mr. Frelinghuysen didn't even  try to make the argument. He said it was a good bill; we ought to pass  it. Fine. The amendment would have not undermined the bill in any way.   Now, there is a provision in that bill, as the gentleman knows, to,  in effect, undermine the agreement that was made last year, with  respect to the funding levels, by putting $500 million into a  grandchild's or a children's fund by the chairman of the subcommittee.  It is a little bit like your rescissions.   The gentleman who put that in voted for a $2 trillion deficit- creating document and put $500 million in a trust fund to bring down  that deficit. I know my friend is happy that that will, at that rate,  take 4,000 years to fill that $2 trillion hole.   So I disagree with my friend that the amendment would have had any  adverse effect on the bill that was passed.   Now, I voted against the bill, but the bill passed the House of  Representatives. Nothing would have adversely affected that bill. I  appreciate what the gentleman said about last year's action, which I  supported, which I thought was correct, and which I appreciated the  Congress taking.   Next, Mr. Speaker, we had a vote on ICE. The gentleman can argue it  one way or the other. I know you criticized us; we criticized you. The  fact of the matter is, what it did not deal with--and you will indicate  that there was a bill that dealt with this in a fashion. But, again, I  would remind you that your pledge, through your Speaker, was to take  issues head-on, one at a time, discretely, not confuse them.   I would urge the leader, the Speaker, and the majority party to bring  a bill to the floor that deals simply with an issue with which we  believe the overwhelming majority of Americans agree: Do not rip  children from the arms of their parents. Do not estrange children from  their parents for weeks and months. Do not traumatize children, perhaps  permanently, by this policy of separating children.    I would hope and urge the majority leader to bring a bill to the  floor that would deal with that discrete issue.   Mr. Nadler has a bill, H.R. 6135, to prohibit the Department of  Homeland Security from pursuing this policy of separating families.  John McCain has said that that policy of separation offends the dignity  and decency of the American people. That is John McCain, former  candidate for President in your party, Mr. Leader, and I would agree  with him on that issue.   I would urge the leader to bring a bill to the floor to deal with  this issue directly, and I believe--perhaps I am wrong--that it would  receive a very significant majority of support in this House.   I would ask the gentleman, is there any plan to bring such a bill to  the floor in the near future?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.    The omni last year? Yes.    I am going to reclaim my time, Mr. Leader, for this.    Of course, I supported that policy. Now, the reason I was  going to reclaim my time, very frankly, Mr. Leader, I have done some  research on bills you voted against. I could go through them and pick  out this, that, and the other that everybody in the world was for, and  I could say you voted against it. I have not done that.   The reason I have not done it is because I don't think that would be  intellectually honest on my part, because I know that there are things  I would pick out that you clearly supported but you didn't support some  parts of the bill and, therefore, indicated your objection by voting  against them, which is exactly what I did in the omni. The gentleman,  my friend, knows that to be the case.   My friend brings up CHIP all the time. My friend knows that I have  supported CHIP at its very inception and in every step of the way of  its development and reauthorization. My friend knows that, but he  continues to pretend, because I voted against the omni, that I voted  against CHIP. I didn't like the omni. I thought the omni was wrong.  Very frankly, I think I was correct in that vote.   Now, the omni passed, and it passed with a very substantial number of  Democratic votes. I didn't lobby against the omni with my Members. I  did indicate that I did not agree with things you had left out and did  not put in the omni, and I, frankly, did not agree with some things  that were in the omni.   Having said that, let's not go back and forth. I can get a lot of  bills the same way and show that you voted against motherhood and apple  pie in this bill, that bill, and the other bill. You know that to be  the case. I would hope we can stop doing that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.    You are correct.    I will do that. I will tell you, you are correct in saying  that I did not support the omni, but I did support the proposition.    Separating children from their parents.    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman talks a lot about law  enforcement, correctly so. We ought to honor those who protect us and  who put their life and limb at risk daily to do so. We ought to honor  them whether they are ICE agents, whether they are Border Patrol  agents, whether they are DIA agents, whether they are members of the  Armed Forces, whether they are members of the sheriff's departments or  police departments in our various communities around the country. We  ought to have compassion for those who are victims whom they are  protecting and compassion for those whom we lose in the performance of  their law enforcement duties.   There is not a Member of Congress who has been at more memorial  services for law enforcement officers that we have lost through the  centuries than I have, period.   Yesterday's vote was because of the patently political nature of the  resolution that was offered. The majority leader says he wanted to  offer a bill of one of our Members who suggested the elimination of  ICE--small number. And that Member, apparently, according to the  majority leader, told him: Look, I am going to vote ``no'' on that if  you bring it to the floor, obviously trying to raise a point about  wanting to stop the policies and practices--not the ICE agency, but the  policies and practices of ripping, literally ripping children from the  arms of their fathers and mothers and estranging them at places that  neither knew where the other was.   The gentleman talks about the opioid epidemic being on the front  page. It is there, and properly so, because it is a crisis, and we have  dealt with it in a bipartisan way, which was correct to do so. We  believed it was underfunded for some period of time. We have come up  with some more funds. We are glad about that.   But he did not answer my question, and he distracted us from the  focus. There was a bill, which we didn't like, because the bill had a  lot of other stuff in it, which is why the Speaker said we ought to  consider things discreetly, individually, one at a time. Don't confuse  and obfuscate the issue.   So bring a bill to the floor that says that the policy that the  President was pursuing, that he then changed--and the courts have now  interjected themselves; we don't know for how long--to say that we  ought not, that is not who we are as Americans, Mr. Speaker.   These 2- and 3- and 4-year-old children whom we see on the front  pages of our paper, they are not MS-13. There is not a Member on this  floor who will defend MS-13. There is not a Member on this floor who  does not want to see the folks who gain some status by being an MS-13  caught, stopped, and taken out of our country if they are not citizens  of this country, not a one of us. So that is a red herring dragged  across this floor back and forth yesterday and today.   Mr. Speaker, you would think that we could say that America's values  do not support taking children, small children, infant children. An  instance was cited on the floor yesterday where a mother was nursing  her child and that child was taken from her and the mother was put in  handcuffs.   Is that America? Is that the compassionate country of which George  Bush talked? Is it that bright and shining city on the hill of which  Ronald Reagan spoke? I think not, Mr. Speaker.   Lastly, I know that flood insurance is going to expire July 31. I see  the ranking member, Ms. Maxine Waters, on the floor. I know she has  been working on this with Mr. Hensarling. Does the leader know whether  or not that bill might be coming to the floor or some extension coming  to the floor next week?   I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, the gentleman knows damn  well that is not the case, and I am tired of hearing him demagogue  about that. I expect him to do it between now and the election, but the  gentleman is not honest when he does it, and he knows that, Mr.  Speaker.    He says something about the Democratic Socialist Party--it  is my time. It is my time, Mr. Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, it is my time.   This is the most autocratic Congress in which I have served. It has  had the most closed rules. And the majority leader brings to the floor  his version of what he wants to say and how he wants to characterize  it. No consultation with us, no amendments allowed, and then we say we  are not going to vote against ICE agents. We honor the work that they  do. We honor the sacrifices they make. We honor the critical role they  play in defending our country and enforcing our laws.                                time  1145    But, Mr. Leader, we are not going to take it or leave it. We are not  going to vote ``no'' on a resolution that purports simply to honor our  ICE agents. If it were simply that, it may have been a different  matter.   But, Mr. Speaker, I would hope that the majority leader would stop  talking about--there are some people in his party who say absolutely  absurd things at the very highest level of his party, and I haven't  brought them up.   Mr. Speaker, I asked a simple question. The Speaker of this House  said he was going to bring issues to this floor individually, vote them  up or down. I asked the leader: Will you bring a bill to the floor  which will stop the separation of children from their parents? He says  he did. 113 of his colleagues on his side of the aisle thought it was a  bad bill and voted ``no.''    I yield to the gentleman from California.    Mr. Speaker, they didn't vote ``present.'' I voted  ``present'' because I wanted to say to the leader, Mr.  [[Page H6576]]  Speaker, I am not going to take it or leave it.   He wants to make me look like I am not for law enforcement when I  have been for law enforcement in the 50 years I have been in public  office, without fail--without fail.    I yield to the gentleman from California.    I voted ``present,'' Mr. Speaker, because I was not going  to take it or leave it. I was not going to just take what the majority  leader wanted to shove down my throat and the throat of others.  Because, Mr. Speaker, the rhetoric in that bill--and let me say to the  leader, Mr. Speaker, he and I worked on a lot of resolutions regarding  Israel, and we want to keep the Congress united on Israel, and we keep  the Congress united on Israel.   How do we do it, Mr. Speaker? We work on the language. We work on the  language of the whereas clauses and the resolved clauses so that we can  create a broad majority. We could have done that with the ICE bill,  easily--easily--an overwhelming support for their role and for their  courage and for their character.   Now, Mr. Speaker, I asked about the bill that deals with flood  insurance. I think the gentleman has told me that that is going to come  to the floor, and I am prepared to yield back the balance of my time.    I yield to the gentleman from California.    Mr. Speaker, I don't know who ``we'' is. Somebody who  introduces a bill on either side of the aisle doesn't make it a ``we''  bill.   And the reason they brought the nonbinding resolution to the floor,  when they really wanted to bring the bill to the floor, is because it  wouldn't have served their political purposes because everybody on our  side of the aisle would have voted ``no.'' He knows it. That is why he  didn't bring it to the floor, for politics; not for principle, for  politics.    And to his credit, I understand the Speaker didn't want to bring it  to the floor either. At least that is what is reported in the papers.   Now, Mr. Speaker, my question has still not been answered.   There have been more closed rules in this Congress than any Congress  in recent memory, during the time I have served. Now, there have been a  lot of bills passed, and we passed them on bipartisanly. We had about  six, seven, eight, or nine naming a post office the other day.    I yield to the gentleman from California.    Isn't that wonderful.   I voted for all of them, either by voice vote or by card. They were  bills that we all agreed with.   But more closed rules on this floor, including today's bill that we  passed, than any Congress in recent memory.   My question to the majority leader was: Will he bring to the floor a  free-standing bill which provides that children will not be separated  from their parents--which John McCain says is inconsistent with the  decency of the American people--so that we can vote on that proposition  and that proposition only. The majority leader has not answered that  question.   He talks about voting ``present,'' which he didn't like. I am sorry  he didn't like it, but I would vote ``present'' again to express my  opposition, the only way it was possible to do, because, unlike his  characterization, I did not want to say to ICE agents, ``I do not  respect you.'' Therefore, I did not want to vote against a resolution,  the resolved clause of which I agreed with.   But it didn't deal with the most critical issue. It could have--it  didn't--and it is nonbinding. To argue about that is to dissemble about  the question that I asked.   I am prepared to end this because I don't think we are going  anywhere. I don't think I am going to get an answer from the majority  leader, and I don't think he will bring it to the floor, free-standing,  any more than he will bring a comprehensive immigration reform bill,  which is so necessary to this country, to the floor, no more than he  will bring a Dreamers protection act to this floor.   He is gesticulating, Mr. Speaker, as if: What do you mean by that?   He brought a bill to the floor that he said solved the problem that  113 of his Members voted against. It got over 300 votes against. That  is not a viable option to bring to the floor. He knew it was going to  fail. He knew it was another message bill.   So I asked him: Will he bring that bill to the floor individually,  discretely, to protect these children, or not? I haven't gotten an  answer to that.   The second thing I asked him, which he did answer, is that we are  going to bring a bill to the floor, apparently, hopefully, to protect  those who live in flood zones and who are going to have trouble getting  flood insurance on August 1. He says he will bring that to the floor.   Now, I am prepared to close and to yield back the balance of my time.    I yield to the gentleman from California.    Mr. Speaker, this has gone on longer than it should have.  But it has given us time to look at a MILCON-VA vote on May 15, 2008,  in which the majority leader, on a substantive vote, not a resolution  that was nonbinding, but a substantive appropriations bill, voted  ``present.''    I yield to the gentleman from California.    Voted ``present,'' Mr. Speaker, voted ``present.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
