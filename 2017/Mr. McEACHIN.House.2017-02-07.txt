 Mr. Speaker, the BLM's Planning 2.0 initiative has made  important, overdue updates to our process for drafting resource  management plans.   These plans govern our use of more than 175 million acres of public  lands. The way in which we use those lands deeply affects the  environmental quality, public health, and all Americans' quality of  life. It is vitally important that we get our planning right.   This rule promotes transparency and consensus, creating more and  earlier opportunities for public involvement in the planning process.  It encourages greater use of high-quality scientific information, and  it provides for a big-picture, landscape-level response to challenges  like wildfire management and invasive species. The effect is to  strengthen, streamline, and democratize a process that had previously  bred litigation and delay.   Mr. Speaker, I have to wonder: Which of these changes does my friend  across the aisle oppose?   Mr. Speaker, in the last week, the House voted to disapprove three  other rules that protect public health and environmental quality. I am  disturbed by that pattern, and I am disturbed by the haste with which  we have moved, especially since all of these rules took years to create  and craft.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues in the majority to think of their  children, their grandchildren, and all the generations to come. They  deserve to inherit a rich, healthy, and sustainable world. If we  continue down this reckless path, I fear they will not.
