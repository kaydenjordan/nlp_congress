 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy  of Dr. Martin Luther King, today being his actual birthday, 91 years  ago, in 1929.   Dr. King has become synonymous with the civil rights movement and the  right to ensure each and every one of us is treated equally, regardless  of our background and upbringing.   His strong Christian beliefs helped him inspire positive social  change through peaceful protests and demonstrations.   In a nation plagued by identity politics, his pursuit of liberty is  as relevant now as it was during the 1960s. Dr. King demonstrated to  the world that it is not the color of a person's skin that mattered  but, rather, the nature of their character. Indeed, it is one of my  favorite quotes and one to live by.   The work of Dr. King is not yet done. He remains a shining example of  the right way to lead, the right way to peacefully protest, and the  right way to inspire.   I look forward to joining the celebration at the Southside Community  Center in Oroville, California, this coming Monday, where his legacy is  celebrated and even brought forward by scholarships for the young  people who will be there.

In the 47 years since Roe v. Wade, more than 60 million unborn  children's lives have ended too soon. Life is the most fundamental  human right, and I believe that life begins at conception.   Science continues to build a case for this, and as technology  develops, women are getting a clearer view of the lives of their babies  when they go to the doctor's office. At just 6 weeks, an ultrasound can  detect a child's heartbeat. At 20 weeks, a baby, we know, can feel pain  in the womb. Unfortunately, many States still allow abortions after  this stage.   There is no fooling anyone anymore on this. These are true lives  inside the womb, not just clumps of cells. Science and medicine make  clear that life exists in the womb. If this is true, as I believe it  is, those 60 million unborn babies deserved to have the most basic  right, the right to live.   Mr. Speaker, I thank all those pro-life freedom fighters who will be  here this month at the March for Life and those who are doing it at  home in their communities, at those clinics, at those pro-life centers.  They have to endure a lot of harsh rhetoric from people on the other  side of this. They, indeed, are doing the Lord's work. May God bless  them, and I thank them for being part of this.
