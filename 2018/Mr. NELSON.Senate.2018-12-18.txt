 Mr. President, I rise on behalf of S. 756, the FIRST STEP  Act. It is a first step, and it is a mighty important first step.  Hopefully, this bill is going to pass later today.   This revised FIRST STEP Act is long overdue. I am proud to see that  the House, the Senate, and the President are all working together, as  they should, to pass this important bill. This country of ours  incarcerates more people than any other country in the world. The  Federal prison population has grown by over 700 percent since 1980, and  it consumes one quarter of the Department of Justice's budget. No one  questions that some people deserve to go to prison for the crimes they  commit--sometimes for a long time. Yet it is time to bring some common  sense back into our criminal justice system.   This legislation will allow judges to do the job that they were  appointed to do--to use their discretion to craft an appropriate  sentence to fit the crime. There are numerous stories of judges who are  forced, by strict mandatory minimums, to sentence people to decades in  prison for low-level drug offenses. How many times have we heard of a  judge who says, ``I don't think that this sentence ought to be imposed,  but I have no other choice for this is what the sentencing guidelines  say''?   We have seen examples of people who have been sent to prison for more  than 50 years for selling $350 worth of marijuana--a drug that is now  legal in some States. In my State of Florida, the use of marijuana for  medical purposes is legal. It was passed by three-quarters of the  people in a constitutional amendment. These rigid sentences that do not  fit the crimes ought to be turned around, and that is exactly what this  legislation does. If we don't start this first step of turning it  around, it will be so wasteful, so unfair, so costly. It is not how our  criminal justice system was intended to work. I am sure the senior  Senator from Illinois has already told you about the wide swath of  groups, people, and organizations from across the political spectrum  who understand that the system is broken and want it to be repaired.    In addition to the much needed sentencing reform, this legislation  includes prison reform ending cruel and inhuman practices in our  Federal prison system. It is Federal juvenile solitary confinement, a  practice that now the psychiatrists tell us gives long psychological  damage. It also prohibits the shackling of pregnant prisoners. Doctors  have told us about the harm that can come to a pregnant female and  serious harm to the fetus if she is not appropriately looked after, and  shackling can interfere with that appropriate medical care. The  American Medical Association and the American College of Obstetricians  and Gynecologists strongly oppose the shackling of women who are  pregnant.   This FIRST STEP Act also requires prisoners to be incarcerated closer  to their home so family members can visit them. After all, don't we  want to rehabilitate prisoners?   It provides opioid treatment to inmates that suffer from addiction-- something that probably led to their incarceration in the first place.   There is more to do certainly. That is why this is just a first step.  It is a bipartisan first step. It is a concrete improvement of our  current system.   I am proud to support this legislation. This Senator gave his  farewell address last week, but because of this very important  legislation, which this Senator has wanted to see come to life and be  enacted into law for such a long time, it was important for me to come  to this floor and to speak on its behalf, as well as to thank the  managers of the bill who have brought it through this long and  torturous path.   It is finally going to become a reality. This, indeed, is an example  that when people of goodwill put their minds to it and come together in  a bipartisan fashion, in fact, you can get something done.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, Dr. Thomas Kent ``T.K.'' Wetherell  was a distinguished public servant, educator, and a great man who  leaves behind a tremendous legacy of service to the State of Florida.  Dr. Wetherell is recognized as one of the best speakers in the history  of the Florida House of Representatives, as well as a transformative  and effective president of Florida State University, FSU, and  Tallahassee Community College. He loved the State of Florida and worked  his entire career to improve higher education in the State.   As a student at FSU from 1963 to 1968, T.K. was a star football  player. In fact, he still holds the record for the longest kickoff  return in the school's history. Off the field he succeeded in  academics, earning bachelor's and master's degrees in social studies  education in 1967 and 1968 and a doctorate in education in 1974. A  third-generation Floridian, T.K. became the first alumnus to serve as  the president of his alma mater. His tenure as president of FSU from  2003 to 2010 marked a transformative time for the university. Among his  many accomplishments, Dr. Wetherell launched the Pathways of Excellence  initiative, which elevated the research profile of FSU and brought  hundreds of millions in investments to campus. He brought the Applied  Superconductivity Center to FSU, where it became the materials research  division of the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. FSU's brand  new College of Medicine graduated its first class under Dr. Wetherell's  tenure and opened six new regional campuses. He established the Office  of National Fellowships and the Office of Undergraduate Research and  Creative Endeavors, both of which improved the national academic  profile of FSU. Even this University of Florida Gator can appreciate  that he made FSU a stronger university.   His time in the Florida House of Representatives was no less  impressive. He chaired the Appropriations and Education Committees,  where he transformed the lessons he learned working at State  universities into commonsense legislation that improved the State's  university system for all students. It's no wonder the Miami Herald  named him one of the Top Ten Legislative Leaders in the body for five  straight years.   Beyond T.K.'s many professional accomplishments, I counted him as one  of my best friends. He was a man of integrity who didn't shy away from  challenges and was passionate about improving higher education in our  fine State. My thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Ginger, and  their children and grandchildren.                            ____________________
