 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  allowed to complete my remarks prior to the recess.    Mr. President, I rise again to call for this entire  body to vote and consider the Military Justice Improvement and  Increasing Prevention Act. This commonsense reform would ensure that  people in the U.S. military who have been subjected to sexual assault  and other serious crimes get the justice that they deserve.   I began calling for the full floor vote on this bill on May 24. That  was 24 days ago. Since then, an estimated 1,344 servicemembers will  have been raped or sexually assaulted. Two in three of those survivors  will not even report it because they know that they are more likely to  face retaliation than receive justice.   This is a scourge that we have been looking at for over 8 years. We  have passed nearly 250 measures to address sexual assault in the  military, to address retaliation, to address prevention, and none of  them have dented the numbers. In fact, our estimated cases are at about  20,000 cases, and among those, only about 200 have gone to courts- martial and ended in conviction. It is not enough. We aren't moving the  numbers in the right direction. They are, in fact, going in the wrong  direction.   We also have a reform that we have looked at for 8 years. It creates  a bright line at all serious crimes to handle two issues: one, the bias  we see in sexual assault in the military; that if you are a  servicemember who reports sexual assault, it is unlikely that you will  get justice, and it is likely that you will be retaliated against.   And after we have made retaliation a crime three times in a row, we  have only seen one court-martial for retaliation. That is outrageous.   And so now is the time that we bring this measure to the floor. It  does not cost a lot of money. It is something that uses the existing  infrastructure, the existing lawyers, the existing infrastructure  around the lawyers.   Two, it does not take a long time to implement because, in fact,  after the military police complete their investigation and have their  recommendation, basically, they send that recommendation to the  prosecutor, as opposed to the commander. So after the review by the  prosecutor, it goes right back to the commander if that prosecutor  declines to prosecute.   So, ultimately, it changes the system in a very small but powerful  way, and the reason why this change is recommended by all military  experts is three reasons: One, the bright line creates a justice system  for all plaintiffs and all defendants. And since we have bias with  regard to women in the military and we have bias with regard to Black  and Brown servicemembers, this change will remove bias and  professionalize the system for everyone.   Second, our allies have done this. Our allies have done it--UK,  Israel, Germany, Australia, Netherlands. They have done it over the  last 40 years for defendants' rights, to make sure we have a system  that is fair to everyone. When they put this change in place, they  reported to our panel that, No. 1, they saw no diminution in command  control; and, No. 2, they saw no undermining of good order and  discipline. So for those reasons, that is why we need to pursue this  legislation, a bright line.   And then, last is the question that the chairman always raises, that  this must go through the committee. The committee has been looking at  this for 8 years. We have had multiple hearings on this topic. We have  had the data. We have talked about it with every service Secretary for  the last decade I have been on the committee. We have talked about it  with each of the services for the last decade that I have been on the  committee, and we have tried to get a vote on this measure,  unsuccessfully, for the past 5 years. We have been denied a vote every  time in the last 5 years.   So to say now that only the committee can have jurisdiction is not  true. They have had their chance, and they have passed close to 250  measures. Those measures have not moved the needle. Those measures are  ones that the DOD was comfortable with. They have never wanted this  measure. Now we have agreement by the chairman, by this panel, by many  of the service Secretaries that, OK, fine, we are with you; we will  take sexual assault out of the chain of command.   While that is good, it is not enough because it will create two  systems of justice, and you should not privilege just one set of  plaintiffs to have a positive, professional, unbiased system.   And given all of the data we have about race and bias against Black  servicemembers and Brown servicemembers being punished up to 2.5 times  more than White servicemembers, you need to fix the system for  everybody.   So back to the argument of our allies, that is why they did their  bright line at serious crimes--the equivalent of felonies--so that they  could have a justice system that is worthy of the sacrifices that the  men and women in our armed services make.   So I ask once again that we can have a vote on this floor. We now  have 66 cosponsors of this legislation, widely bipartisan. How many  bills in this Chamber are supported by Liz Warren and Ted Cruz at the  same time? How many pieces of legislation have been voted on by both  Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell? Very few. But the reason we have  such bipartisan support is we have two female command veterans in this  body. One is a Republican, Joni Ernst. One is a Democrat, Tammy  Duckworth. They are both on this legislation. They have served as  commanders, and they understand the importance of the commander's  roles. But they also have seen that nothing has gotten better. They saw  the report from Fort Hood that said the command climate was so toxic  that it was permissible for sexual assault and sexual harassment. And  so they have said enough is enough.    And so when you have so many former commanders and sexual assault  survivors from this Chamber supporting this legislation, it is time  that  [[Page S4609]]  it does not need to go through the committee. More than half of our  committee supports this. But when we take issues like this to the  committee, they have been taken out in conference.   Despite winning the vote in the Senate, despite winning the vote in  the House, our bill in 2019 to make sure that a servicemember could  come forward and not be prosecuted for minor related offenses, like  drinking or being off base--that bill passed in the Senate, passed in  the House, and was taken out in conference because the DOD didn't like  it.   So I promise you, if we pass this bill in our committee, in the House  and the Senate--I promise you--it would be narrowed just down to sexual  assault because that is what the DOD will agree to.   I am tired of doing only what the DOD will agree to. It is not our  job to defer to the DOD. It is our job as U.S. Senators to provide  oversight and accountability over the administration and over the  entire Department of Defense.   When we abdicate that responsibility, what we have is what we had for  the last 10 years, failure--failure in the committee because we only  put forward items the DOD was comfortable with.   I just don't know how much longer we want survivors to have to wait.  We have considered this legislation together. We have, every year, sat  down, discussed it--pros, cons. Are other reforms working?   I have done that with every one of the 100 Senators in this Chamber  every year for the last 10 years. It has been intensely considered, and  I spend an extra amount of time with committee members because they are  interested.   So this is not new. It doesn't need to go through the committee. We  have been denied a vote and filibustered a vote for 8 years and denied  a vote for the last 5 years. So I don't know why the committee gets  sole jurisdiction. I don't understand.   And, again, how many measures does this Chamber have that have 66  cosponsors?   It is also a generational shift. And when you have something of such  import, it comes to the floor. We repealed don't ask, don't tell on the  floor. We had two floor votes. The majority leader at the time gave us  those votes, and it passed on the floor. It did not go through the  committee.   It is time to bring a justice system that is worthy of the sacrifice  that the men and women make every day. And you need to have that bright  line so it is a justice system that works for women and servicemembers  of color because right now we have data and evidence that there is bias  against those individuals.   Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  that at a time to be determined by the majority leader in consultation  with the Republican leader, the Senate Committee on Armed Services be  discharged from further consideration of S. 1520 and the Senate proceed  to its consideration; that there be 2 hours of debate, equally divided  in the usual form; and that upon the use or yielding back of time, the  Senate vote on the bill with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, two issues: First, the op-ed by Jeh  Johnson was not in reference to my legislation. In fact, he conflated  my legislation with recommendations from the IRC. He mentioned lawyers  in Virginia having to make the decisions. That is not what my bill  says. It has never said that, and it is not how it is organized. In  fact, my bill is organized by services to adjudicate these cases, as  they are doing today.   Right now, prosecutors prosecute these cases, and the decision making  of whether to proceed to trial would be given to them in the first  instance. If they decline to prosecute, it goes right back to the  commander. So, for example, if there wasn't enough evidence to  prosecute the case, it would go back to the commander, who could then  use a special court-martial or he could use nonjudicial punishment for  related or lesser offenses. That is typically what the commanders do in  these cases.   So very little changes. But what does change is the perception of the  victim who is asking for unbiased review by someone who is highly  trained to do that review. It also gives assurance to defendants'  rights that the person making the decision is unbiased and is highly  and professionally trained.   Those changes change everything. It changes the perception that our  military justice is blind, fair, and professional. And that is not the  impression of servicemembers today. Both women and men and survivors of  sexual assault do not believe that justice is possible for them, and  Black and Brown servicemembers do not believe the justice system is  fair to them either.   This solution makes sense, and I do not think that we should defer  again our responsibility to one op-ed by one former SecDef. That is not  our job, and that is not how we should be responding.                            ____________________
