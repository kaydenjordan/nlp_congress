 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of  H.R. 1858, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Post  Office located at 4514 Williamson Trail in Liberty, Pennsylvania, as  the Staff Sergeant Ryan Scott Ostrom Post Office.   Born in Wellsboro, Pennsylvania, in 1979, Mr. Ostrom graduated from  high school and then joined the Pennsylvania Army National Guard while  beginning his studies at Mansfield University. A sports lover, Ryan  could frequently be found playing and coaching basketball in his free  time.   In 2002, Ryan joined his father, Scott Ostrom, on a peacekeeping  mission in Bosnia, and he later deployed to Iraq with the 109th  Infantry Regiment.   Staff Sergeant Ryan Ostrom tragically made the ultimate sacrifice in  August of 2005, when he sustained fatal wounds from enemy small-arms  fire in Iraq. He was, as mentioned, awarded the Bronze Star, Purple  Heart, Good Conduct Medal, and Combat Infantryman Badge from the  Department of the Army, as well as the Pennsylvania Meritorious Service  Medal from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.   Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to recognize the bravery and  selflessness of the honorable service of Staff Sergeant Ryan Scott  Ostrom.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 1858, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of  H.R. 452, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Post  Office located at 324 West Saint Louis Street in Pacific, Missouri, as  the Specialist Jeffrey L. White, Jr. Post Office.   A native of Missouri, Jeffrey White, Jr. graduated from Pacific High  School in 2008, and joined the United States Army. After graduating  from basic and advanced training at Fort Benning, Georgia, Specialist  White was assigned to the 25th Infantry Division at Joint Base  Elmendorf-Richardson.   He deployed to Afghanistan in 2011, and tragically lost his life in  April of 2012, after insurgents attacked his unit with an improvised  explosive device. Specialist White was just 21 years old.   Specialist White is remembered for his love of the St. Louis  Cardinals, as well as his distinguished service, for which he received  many awards, including a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart.                                time  1715    As an avid Dodgers fan, I think Specialist White would get a kick out  of the fact that I am here and that the St. Louis Cardinals are still  beating the Dodgers.   Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to commemorate the life of  Specialist Jeffrey White, Jr., who selflessly sacrificed his life in  defense of his country.   I urge the passage of H.R. 452, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of H.R. 2254, a  bill to designate the facility of the United States Post Service  located at 2635 Napa Street in Vallejo, California, as the Janet  Capello Post Office Building.   H.R. 2254 was introduced this year by my colleague and friend from  California, Mr. Thompson. Unfortunately, Mr. Thompson is unable to be  here today, as he has remained in his district in California this  evening to assist in wildfire relief and recovery efforts. I am, along  with the entire House of Representatives, praying for Mr. Thompson and  our fellow Americans in this time of need.   A lifelong resident of Vallejo, California, and granddaughter of  Italian immigrants, Janet Capello took great pride in her heritage. Her  deepest passion was the Sons of Italy, an organization where she served  as a dedicated member of Lodge Number 1626 for over 63 years.   She held two of the organization's most prestigious posts--vice  president of the Grand Lodge of California, and Secretary of the United  Lodges--and led efforts to bring the group's scholarship program to  Vallejo. In doing so, she helped hundreds of young men and women attend  college.   Ms. Capello oversaw a number of charity efforts, and helped raise  thousands of dollars each year for Alzheimer's research in conjunction  with the University of California-Davis. Ms. Capello's dedication to  these causes earned her the Dr. Vincenzo Sellaro Award, the highest  honor granted by the Sons of Italy.   In addition to these accomplishments, Janet Capello was an active  participant in local Vallejo politics, serving on the city's Planning  Commission, the Civil Service Commission, and the Charter Review  Committee, and others, and was an active member of the St. Vincent  Ferrer Catholic Church until her passing in 2012, at the age of 77.   Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to commemorate the life of  Janet Capello, and recognize the lasting contributions she has made to  the Vallejo community.   I urge the passage of H.R. 2254, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of H.R. 294, a  bill to designate the facility of the United States Post Office located  at 2700 Cullen Boulevard in Pearland, Texas, as the Endy Nddiobong  Ekpanya Post Office.   Endy Ekpanya reflected the best of America. Born in Nigeria in 1985,  Endy immigrated to the United States in 1996. Here, he obtained U.S.  citizenship, a college education, and two master's degrees.   Endy's deep love of family and community inspired him to join the  police force so he could help those in need. He hoped that his hard  work in the classroom and the field would help him be a role model for  his young son, Julian.   As a rookie member of the Pearland Police Department, Officer Ekpanya  took his duty to protect his community seriously but always found a way  to brighten his fellow officers' days. Tragically, on June 1, 2016,  Officer Ekpanya was killed when a drunk driver struck his police  cruiser as he was responding to a call.   Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to honor Officer Endy Ekpanya's  dedication to his education, family, and community, and to remember the  sacrifices he made while working to protect those he loved.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 294, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
