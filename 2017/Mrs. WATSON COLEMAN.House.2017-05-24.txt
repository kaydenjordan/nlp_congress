 Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to announce  that my foster shadow, Shaderra Riddick, who is a Rutgers student  studying anthropology, is with me today in the gallery. I am delighted  to have her with me, and I offer these remarks on her behalf.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask a simple question to my colleagues  here who support President Trump's budget proposal: What kind of  America do you envision?   What kind of America do you envision when you support proposed tax  plans that line the pockets of Wall Street investors, yet raise taxes  for the working men and women struggling to make ends meet.   What kind of America do you envision when you support rewarding  corporations that willfully and admittedly evade American tax laws by  stashing profits overseas and, even with proposed tax amenities, still  punish their rank-and-file employees that can't save because they are  paid below a living wage?   What kind of America do you envision when you proudly support the  elimination of Federal agencies that protect our workers from  discrimination or subject our children to an environment that is  unhealthy and harmful to their health?   The President's budget proposal released yesterday is built on  heartless cuts to Medicaid; SNAP; Social Security disability insurance  benefits; additional income for poor seniors, disabled adults, and  children; and public assistance for needy families.   It threatens regular Americans' ability to buy a home and the ability  for that home to even be an investment worth the risk.   Mr. Speaker, sadly, this budget is the latest in a series of actions  that begs  [[Page H4515]]  the question: What kind of America do my Republican colleagues and the  President envision for our future? One where the investor class  thrives, but the majority of working-class Americans suffer? One where  our environment provides temporary profits, but irreparable harm? One  where we make a promise to seniors while they work hard to build and  sustain our economy, but, upon retirement, snatch away their  investments, along with any safety net?   Mr. Speaker, I envision a different America. I envision an America  where an honest day's work, no matter where you clock in, deserves a  living wage. I envision an America where my granddaughter, Kamryn, will  make the same amount as your grandson for the same work. I envision an  America where we double down on our investment in public education, and  where we double down on our investment in this country's future. I  envision a country where commonsense gun legislation limits the  opportunity for tragedy to strike in our schools and churches at the  hands of hatred and bigotry.   The America I am working toward is an America that celebrates the  richness of our diversity, seeks to right past wrongs, an America to be  envied.   Mr. Speaker, I refuse to concede that we were too divided along this  aisle that we can't create new, good-paying jobs, educate our kids,  train our workers, create jobs for those workers, and create an America  ripe with new opportunity for all.   Mr. Speaker, the America I envision, the America I believe in, the  America that we deserve is within our reach. Unfortunately, that  America is threatened, ignored, and displaced with this President's  budget proposal.   So, again, I ask this question of the President and of my Republican  colleagues who will support this callous and shameful budget proposal:  What kind of America do you envision, and when will you stand up and  fight for the America we all deserve?    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the  opportunity to discuss this bill, and I want to thank the colleague  from across the aisle here who has illuminated the future as it relates  to undertaking this whole issue.   It is with that in mind that I want to speak to the value of the use  of official time.  [[Page H4532]]                                     time  1430    While I am not concerned so much about the collection of the  information as to what is happening, I am concerned with how it is  being translated and will be used in the future.   For decades, both Republicans and Democrats alike have strongly  supported the use of official time because it streamlines the  efficiency and quality of government. We should be thanking our union  representatives who use official time to address workplace problems and  operational issues within our government.   Within our Federal Government, official time leads to swift conflict  resolutions that would otherwise require costly litigation, improves  the relationship between labor and management, and protects  whistleblowers who have exposed government waste and abuse. In some  cases, it has even saved lives, as in the issue of AFGE local president  Kathleen Dahl, when there was a breakout of Legionnaires' disease.   Furthermore, official time costs one-tenth of 1 percent of the cost  of salaries and benefits for all Federal employees. That is a fraction  of employee compensation. Ultimately, it saves taxpayers dollars and  ensures transparency.   So while we may be discussing today simply a bill that will record  the time that is spent in such a noble and important function, it is  simply a precursor to the disparaging of union workers and Federal  workers as we move forward. Mr. Speaker, I oppose any movement in that  direction.
