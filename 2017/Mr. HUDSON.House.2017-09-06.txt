 Mr. Chairman, I would like to begin by expressing my  appreciation to Chairman Frelinghuysen and Interior Subcommittee  Chairman Calvert for their strong leadership and good work on this  legislation and to thank them for this opportunity to speak today.   I rise to advocate on behalf of the U.S. national forests and their  upkeep, specifically through the capital improvements and maintenance  program. This program provides funding to pave our national forest  roads, such as those within the Uwharrie National Forest located in my  district.   Each year, the U.S. Forest Service is given funding to maintain  roadways across our Nation. While they do their best to sustain  roadways and trail access points, they can only do so much with the  resources they are given. These roadways are an integral part of  ensuring critical public access to our U.S. forestlands.   Unfortunately, many of our national forest roadways have become  severely eroded from travel, age, and the elements. The erosion has  created problems for those who visit the Uwharrie National Forest as  well as those who access these roads to travel to and from their homes.  First responders have also not been able to reach residents in  emergencies due to road conditions in recent years, causing major  safety risks for people who live along these roads.   I emphasize this is more than just a headache for these residents, it  is a real safety issue. I have seen roads firsthand after storms, and  there is no way fire trucks and ambulances can access these roads in  their current condition, and I believe it is completely unacceptable.   I have been advocating on behalf of the Uwharrie National Forest  since my first term in Congress, and I will continue to engage with  local, State, and Federal stakeholders on this issue.                                time  1730    I appreciate Chairman Calvert's attention to this issue and his  support for  [[Page H6842]]  the Capital Improvement and Maintenance program. I look forward to  working together with the chairman to find a long-term solution to this  issue.
