 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand before you as a Member  of the most diverse freshman class in our Nation's history, sent to  Washington to inspire collaboration and rebuild the American people's  faith in their elected leaders. But much of our tenure in Congress has  been spent under a shutdown, proving the American people were right to  demand change.   This dynamic must stop. To that end, Representatives Houlahan,  Slotkin, Allred, and I rallied an energetic group of 22 freshman  Members, nearly one-third of the entire class, behind the Shutdown to  End All Shutdowns Act, known as the SEAS Act.   As we near agreement and the fear and immediacy of a shutdown fades,  I will not forget the conversations I had with Federal employees,  parents, and business owners in my district--the real human stories of  the shutdown.   It would be irresponsible and unforgivable for us to betray them once  again. They are not political pawns, and many provide the very safety  and security we cherish in this country. That is why I stand here to  urge the passing of the SEAS Act, to eliminate this destructive tactic  from the negotiation toolbox forever.                            ____________________
