 Madam Chair, I thank Chairman Smith and Ranking Member  Thornberry for including amendment No. 341 in the en bloc package.   Madam Chair, I rise in strong support of amendment No. 341. This  bipartisan amendment introduced by Representative Schneider and me will  fully authorize the Boots to Business program, which ensures that our  veterans and their spouses receive essential education on how to start  and grow their own small businesses.   In the same way that we give our troops the tools that they need for  service, we must also prepare our veterans for civilian life. This  program has received broad support from many  [[Page H5697]]  of our veterans, and I strongly encourage my colleagues from both sides  of the aisle to come together in support of this bipartisan amendment  and give our veterans the training that they deserve.
