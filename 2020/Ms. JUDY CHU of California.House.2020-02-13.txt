 Madam Speaker, since women gained the  right to vote 100 years ago, we have made incredible progress--rolling  back laws like those that kept us from serving on juries, owning land,  or even getting our own credit card--and this Congress has more women  than ever.   But true equality is still a goal, not a reality. The fact is women  are still paid less than men for the same work, and we still have men  passing laws that dictate our choices about our bodies.   It is clear, if we want equality, we need the ERA, and the people  agree. We saw that at women's marches across the country and in the  groundswell of the #MeToo movement.   That energy is leading to change. The people are speaking. It is up  to us to listen. Arbitrary deadlines are no reason to silence our  voices.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' and give women  the same rights as men.
