 Madam Speaker, I have spoken before about President  Biden's and House Democrats' flawed economic record. I continue to hear  from constituents from across Michigan's First District who feel cast  aside by the policies of this administration.   Inflation has hit a high of 8.6 percent, and this President continues  to blame everyone but himself. High inflation isn't an act of God. High  inflation isn't solely an act of the Federal Reserve. High inflation  certainly isn't an act of Putin, either.   President Biden said the buck stops with him, but maybe he has  changed his mind. Don't be deceived; his stated plan to address  inflation is a farce.   The President and his advisers told the American people inflation was  transitory, all while passing trillions in new spending. Instead of  taking responsibility, this President continues to push tax-and-spend  legislation that worsens inflation while leaving working families to  pick up the tab.   I am asking the President and my colleagues to listen to the American  people, stop the spending, and confront inflation head-on.                            ____________________
