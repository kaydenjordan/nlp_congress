 Mr. Speaker, my Democratic colleagues have made public  the details of the so-called Green New Deal. Among other things, if  implemented over the next 10 years, it would eliminate the use of  fossil fuels and nuclear power. That means our gasoline-powered  vehicles and implements would be useless, and there would be no air  travel.   It would also require that virtually all building structures would be  rebuilt or need to be remodeled. Every facet of life would be forced to  change.   The most frightening thing about this is that my colleagues  sponsoring it are actually serious.   Furthermore, the architects failed to explain how they are going to  rebuild the economy they would decimate.   Mr. Speaker, I would suggest the architects of this legislation  change the color of the Green New Deal and call it the Red--as in stop  sign red--New Disaster.                            ____________________
