 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, my amendment would stop the Army Corps of  Engineers from moving forward with their flawed environmental impact  statement for the proposed Pebble Mine.   Now, the Pebble Mine is a massive project that would be located in  the headwaters of the Bristol Bay watershed in southeast Alaska. It  threatens the entire Bristol Bay region: its people, its salmon, and  its multimillion-dollar economy.  [[Page H4747]]    The Bristol Bay watershed supports 25 federally recognized Tribes  that depend on salmon for food and their local economy and on a healthy  watershed for their clean water.   Bristol Bay's wild salmon have sustained Alaska's indigenous  communities for thousands of years by providing subsistence food,  subsistence-based livelihoods, and the foundation for their culture and  community. Salmon are the economic driver in Bristol Bay, and the  region supplies half of the world's sockeye salmon and 83 percent of  the country's salmon overall.   At about this time each year, commercial fishermen go to Bristol Bay  to harvest that amazing sockeye salmon run. The commercial harvest  results in more than $1 billion in economic impact, $500 million in  direct income, and 14,000 jobs.   Bristol Bay is also one of the most sought after sportsmen's  destinations. Hunting and recreational fishing draws visitors from  around the world, resulting in over a thousand jobs and nearly $80  million in direct spending.   The EPA has previously said the impacts of mining on fish populations  in the region could be catastrophic and irreversible. Over 3,500 acres  of wetlands and over 80 miles of stream, which are all connected to  salmon habitat, would be directly impacted by this mine and its  infrastructure.   The proposed project would also generate an average of 6.8 billion  gallons per year of wastewater during operations, 11.8 billion gallons  during closure, and all of it would require capture and treatment.   This is unprecedented. There is no other U.S. hard rock mining  operation that captures and treats such a massive volume of  contaminated mine water, which is harmful to fish and to public health.   We know that mines are not invincible. Things go wrong. And if any of  the negative impacts on waterways and ecosystems that have resulted  from other mine failures were to happen in Bristol Bay, the way of life  for Alaska Tribes, fishermen, businesses, and residents would be  devastated.   Bristol Bay already provides enough for a thriving economy and  supports a way of life that is sustainable for future generations. The  Pebble Mine puts all of that at risk, at risk of significant  irreversible damage. That is why the majority of Bristol Bay residents  and Alaskans oppose the project. It is why 53 other Members of Congress  have joined me in telling the Army Corps they should not permit this  mine.   While a thorough and rigorous review would clearly show that it is  the wrong mine and the wrong place, the Federal permitting process for  the Pebble Mine has been wholly insufficient. Tribal input is not being  incorporated, nor are Tribal governments being meaningfully consulted.  The Army Corps, itself, acknowledges numerous data gaps, and the review  fails to analyze economic feasibility and disaster scenarios or provide  comprehensive reclamation and mitigation plans.                                time  2045    The rushed environmental review process has sparked wide-scale  opposition from throughout the country.   Fishermen, Tribes, sportsmen groups, businesses, conservation  organizations, all of them have weighed in in opposition to this  shoddy, wrongheaded Corps project.   My amendment would stop the Pebble Mine. It would stop this flawed  process. It prohibits funding to complete the process because there are  fundamental flaws with the Army Corps' current analysis.   Bristol Bay is a national treasure. We have to do this right or risk  losing an incredible resource. I urge support for my amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, what we do know about this process is that  the Army Corps, itself, has acknowledged serious data gaps.   What we do know is that Tribal input has not been seriously  incorporated into this process, and we know that the National Marine  Fishery Services, which is the agency that should be there at the table  as a participating agency to protect this iconic fishery, is not  participating in this process.   So what this amendment would do is stop this deeply flawed process.  If the administration wants to try to start over and get it right, I  have just identified some of the ways in which this terribly flawed  process could be repaired and they could move forward in the next  budget.   But there are too many red flags waving. Bristol Bay and its salmon  are too important to the people of that region and to this country.
