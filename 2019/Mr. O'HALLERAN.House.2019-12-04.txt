 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Pallone and  Ranking Member Walden for bringing us together on this bipartisan bill.   I rise today to speak in support of the TRACED Act. There is nothing  more frustrating than receiving robocall after robocall to our  landlines and cell phones. I receive countless robocalls every week,  often from a phone number that seems to be just down the road.   Even worse, many of these calls are scams designed to prey on our  seniors and vulnerable populations that may be more susceptible to this  kind of fraud.   This year I have held 26 town halls across Arizona's First District.  Time and time again, I have heard from citizens about scam and spoof  calls they have encountered, putting their private information and  their hard-earned dollars at risk.   I cosponsored the TRACED Act to crack down on scammers and bad  robocalls by creating real penalties for violators and requiring voice  service providers to develop call authentication techniques.   This is an issue on which we can all agree. I urge my colleagues to  come together to pass this commonsense legislation that will benefit so  many.
