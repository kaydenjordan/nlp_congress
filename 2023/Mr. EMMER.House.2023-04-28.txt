 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Dale  Schneider, who passed away last week at the age of 76.   Born in St. Cloud, Minnesota, Dale took over the family-owned Sal's  Bar and Grill in St. Joseph, Minnesota, from his parents in 1971. Sal's  is at the crossroads of St. John's University and the College of St.  Benedict, where all things Johnnies and Bennies reign supreme.   For over 50 years, Dale kept thirsty students, faculty, and community  members well hydrated and fed. Dale had a steel trap of a memory that  helped to remember names of college  [[Page H2092]]  alumni years after graduation. In some cases, he also remembered their  outstanding bar tabs.   I had the pleasure of getting to know Dale during my many visits to  Sal's over the years. No trip to a Johnnies football game was complete  without a post-game beer at Sal's. There is some solace in the fact  that the next time I am at Sal's, I will likely see his son, Kyle,  tending bar just like his dad.   To Dale's wife, Diane, and the rest of the family, we pray that  Dale's lasting memory gives you comfort during this difficult time. A  great life lived.                            ____________________
