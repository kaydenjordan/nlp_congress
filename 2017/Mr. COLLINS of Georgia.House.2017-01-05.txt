 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on  Rules, I call up House Resolution 22 and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                 H. Res. 22         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 26) to amend chapter 8 of title 5, United       States Code, to provide that major rules of the executive       branch shall have no force or effect unless a joint       resolution of approval is enacted into law. The first reading       of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate       shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour       equally divided and controlled by the Majority Leader and the       Minority Leader or their respective designees. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. The bill shall be considered as read. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. No       amendment to the bill shall be in order except those printed       in the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this       resolution. Each such amendment may be offered only in the       order printed in the report, may be offered only by a Member       designated in the report, shall be considered as read, shall       be debatable for the time specified in the report equally       divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent,       shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject       to a demand for division of the question in the House or in       the Committee of the Whole. All points of order against such       amendments are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions.        Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order without intervention of any point of order to consider       in the House the resolution (H. Res. 11) objecting to United       Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 as an obstacle to       Israeli-Palestinian peace, and for other purposes. The       resolution shall be considered as read. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the resolution and preamble       to adoption without intervening motion or demand for division       of the question except one hour of debate equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Foreign Affairs.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for  1 hour.    Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only,  I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may  consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is  for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only,  I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may  consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is  for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on House Resolution 22, currently  under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Georgia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring forward  this rule on behalf of the Rules Committee. The rule provides for  consideration of H. Res. 11, a resolution regarding United Nations  Security Council Resolution 2334. It provides for 1 hour of debate on  H. Res. 11, equally divided between the chairman and ranking member of  the House Foreign Affairs Committee.   Additionally, this rule provides for consideration of legislation  that I introduced, H.R. 26, the Regulations from the Executive in Need  of Scrutiny, or REINS, Act. It makes in order 12 amendments from  Members on both sides of the aisle, and provides for 1 hour of debate  equally divided and controlled by the majority leader and the minority  leader.   Yesterday, the Rules Committee received testimony from the Judiciary  and Foreign Affairs Committees.   Mr. Speaker, the beginning of this new Congress is a time of hope and  a time to establish clear priorities and goals. This is a time to show  the American people that we, as their elected representatives, will  have the courage to stand on principles that made us worthy of their  trust. This rule provides for two pieces of legislation that represent  our commitment to the integrity and transparency of this institution.   H. Res. 11, introduced by Chairman Royce and cosponsored by Ranking  Member Engel, objects to United Nations Security Council Resolution  2334 as an obstacle to Israeli-Palestinian peace. It calls for the  resolution's repeal and makes clear that the current administration's  failure to veto the U.N. resolution violated longstanding U.S. policy  to protect Israel from such counterproductive U.N. resolutions.  Importantly, it also provides a foundation for the next administration  to take action to counteract the damaging effects of the U.N. Security  Council resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I support H. Res. 11, yet it shouldn't be necessary.  President Obama's refusal to veto the U.N. Security Council's  resolution was a radical and dangerous departure from U.S. precedent.   Prior to this most recent Security Council resolution, President  Obama has exercised the veto power of the United States on every  resolution relating to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. His failure to  do so this time jeopardizes and undermines our relationship with our  strongest ally in the Middle East, and it has the potential to undercut  the peace process.   I stood in this Chamber numerous times before and demanded support  for Israel, and I am going to do so here again today. I refuse to sit  idly by and watch misguided anti-Israel policies take root.   We have to take a stand. The administration's failure to act, to even  participate in the vote, was an act of cowardice. It can't be erased,  and we must take steps to address it. This resolution is a step in the  right direction.   As a new President is sworn in this month, I am hopeful that we, as  the House of Representatives, and the United States will reaffirm our  support  [[Page H114]]  of Israel and return to policies that strengthen the relationships  between our two nations.   Mr. Speaker, as the new Congress starts, we also must look at  domestic policies and how to grow our economy. We are going to do that  right here in the House by taking the lead on regulatory reform to help  lift the burden of an intrusive government by jump-starting the  economy.                                time  1245    As part of this effort, I introduced H.R. 26, the REINS Act. This  bill was originally authored and introduced by former Congressman Geoff  Davis in 2009. Last Congress, now-Senator Todd Young introduced the  bill in the House. This Congress, I am proud to carry the torch for  this commonsense legislation. I also thank Chairman Goodlatte and his  staff for all of their hard work on this bill.   Article I, section 1 of the United States Constitution grants  legislative powers to Congress--we read about that right here on the  floor this morning--but, for too long, Congress has ceded that power to  the executive branch, which has resulted in an onslaught of regulation.  This is a problem that we have seen under the administrations of both  parties, and Members on both sides of the aisle should be concerned.   In recent years, this problem has exploded. In 2015 alone, the  executive branch issued over 3,000 rules and regulations, and 76 of  these regulations were major regulations. Let me explain that.  Unelected bureaucrats, without input from the American people or their  Representatives in Congress, issued 76 major regulations that would  impact our economy by more than $100 million each in 1 year alone. The  consequences of these rules are massive. Even worse, we have seen this  administration promote regulations with burdens that far outweigh their  benefits. The REINS Act would require Federal agencies to submit major  rules to Congress for approval. Under this bill, major rules would have  to be accepted by both Chambers and signed by the President to become  effective.   This bill restores accountability to the legislative process and  ensures that lawmakers, not nameless bureaucrats, are the ones making  the laws, just like our Constitution outlines. We have seen the harm  that can come from an out-of-control regulatory regime. Right now,  hardworking Americans across the country are paying the price. In fact,  on average, each U.S. household is bearing an annual economic weight of  $15,000 in regulatory burdens. The oppressive costs of regulation,  coupled with the impact on jobs, demand action.   One regulation, put forth by the Environmental Protection Agency in  2015, would have cost my home State of Georgia over 11,000 jobs; and we  are all familiar with the waters of the United States rule, which,  essentially, asserted authority over all groundwater in the country. If  you have been to northeast Georgia, you know that water collects in  pools and puddles and streams at certain times of the year. If all of  that were to be regulated under this rule, it would be a disaster for  not only my district but for all of the country, but that is what this  administration has tried to do. That rule has been halted by a court,  but were it to go into effect, it would cut farmers, ranchers,  Realtors, and small businesses off at the knees.   With the number of major rules this administration has propagated, I  could far exceed my time in just illustrating the problems these  regulations can create; but, with the REINS Act, we have a chance to  carve out a better way in going forward. The American people elected  us, in this body, to represent them. The REINS Act allows their voices  to be heard more clearly.   Again, Mr. Speaker, it doesn't matter what party is in the executive  branch because the legislative branch is the one that makes and accepts  the bills, not the unelected bureaucrats. This bill creates a sensible  way to move forward with legislative business while better protecting  our economy from suffocating regulations that Americans never voted to  enact.   I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)   Mr. McGOVERN. I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins) for  yielding the customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, before I speak on today's legislation, I want to take a  moment to express my continued deep concern and uneasiness about the  Russian hacking in order to influence the outcome of the 2016  Presidential election and the deeply troublesome response from our  President-elect.   American democracy was attacked, in 2016, by Russian hackers who  sought to tip our Presidential election in favor of Donald Trump. That  is not I who is speaking--that is the CIA, the FBI, and 14 other United  States intelligence agencies that have reached a clear consensus on  this matter. Yet, even in the face of the overwhelming evidence,  President-elect Trump has continued to sow seeds of confusion by  publicly attacking and trying to discredit our country's intelligence  agencies and the brave men and women who risk their lives every day to  keep us safe.   Today, intelligence officials are testifying before the Senate on  this matter. In one of his most alarming actions yet, President-elect  Trump has said that he would rather trust the words of WikiLeaks  founder Julian Assange--an accused sex offender, who is holed up in the  Ecuadorian Embassy in the U.K.--than the consensus of the Directors of  the U.S. intelligence agencies. When Speaker Ryan was asked about  Julian Assange, he called him a sycophant for Russia who leaks, steals  data, and compromises national security. Yet, America's next President  puts more faith in him than in the 16 U.S. intelligence agencies that  he will soon oversee.   This is not normal behavior by a President-elect, let alone by a  President, and we cannot allow it to become normal. I appeal to my  fellow Members of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats--and  especially the Republican leadership--to reach out to the President- elect and ensure that there is a clear understanding about how damaging  these statements and actions are to America's credibility, to our  national security, and to the morale and responsibilities of our  intelligence agencies. I appeal to my colleagues to get him help now.   America faces serious threats across the globe, and we cannot afford  to have a Commander in Chief at war with the very intelligence agencies  that are responsible for keeping our country safe. Whatever his  motivation, President-elect Trump must clearly and unequivocally join  Republicans and Democrats who seek answers. We need a bipartisan,  independent commission to uncover the truth about Russian hacking, and  we need all of our leaders to support it.    It is time Mr. Trump's Twitter sideshow comes to an end. It only  confirms what many of us feared during the campaign--that he is  temperamentally unfit to be President. We must be united in protecting  the integrity of our elections against Russians and all foreign  influence.   Now, Mr. Speaker, let me get to the underlying bills.   I rise in strong opposition to this rule, which provides for the  consideration of H.R. 26, the REINS Act, under a structured process,  and for H. Res. 11, a resolution objecting to a recent United Nations  Security Council resolution on Israel, under a completely closed  process.   Before I get into discussing the merits of the bill, Mr. Speaker, I  would like to first express some serious concern with the process used  to rush this legislation to the floor. The deadline for amendments to  be submitted to the Rules Committee was 10 a.m. on Tuesday. That is 2  hours before Members were sworn in and before the 115th Congress  officially began. Now, it is true that some of the amendments that were  received after the deadline were made in order for consideration on the  floor. But, really, is this the way we want to begin the consideration  of legislation in this session of Congress? All Members should have had  the opportunity to review the legislation and offer thoughtful  amendments to the REINS Act. Wouldn't it have been something to have  considered this bill under an open process? If you hadn't wanted to  have done that, maybe you could have waited a couple of days before you  brought it to the floor so that everybody, especially the freshmen,  [[Page H115]]  would have had an opportunity to evaluate it, and maybe they would have  had some good ideas that they would have wanted to offer. But, here we  are, right out of the gate, limiting the process and prohibiting  Members from offering their ideas on the floor.   Mr. Speaker, we have a process for reviewing rules promulgated by the  executive branch. Congress should--and, indeed, can--examine  regulations. Not all regulations are perfect. There are such things as  bad regulations, and we should get rid of the ones that don't work.  There is no debate on that. We have the ability to override regulations  with new laws, and we have reauthorizations, appropriations, spending  limitations, oversight hearings, investigations, GAO audits and  studies, and the Congressional Review Act, just to name a few. We have  a process that can and should work, but, because my Republican friends  don't always get what they want, they want to undermine that process.   I don't think my Republican colleagues are really interested in a  thoughtful review of these regulations. In fact, I find it hard to  believe that this Republican Congress even has the capacity to utilize  the process that is outlined in this bill so as to consider the 100 or  so regulations--some of which are highly technical and would require  experts in specialized fields to analyze--that could come up in any  given year; but I guess that is the point. This bill would make it  nearly impossible to implement much-needed regulations that ensure  consumer health and product safety, environmental protections,  workplace safety, and financial protections, just to name a few.   It would be a dream come true for industry and the wealthy, well- connected Republican donor class who, for example, are interested in  blocking all attempts to rein in Wall Street, to combat climate change,  or to protect workers and their public health. One simply needs to look  at the intensive lobbying that has gone into fighting these regulations  and supporting antiregulation legislation like the REINS Act--groups  like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Koch brothers, the American  Petroleum Institute, just to name a few.   Industry groups already use their seemingly unlimited resources to  delay and prevent commonsense regulations from taking effect by tying  rules up in court. This bill is just one additional tool for the  wealthy and powerful to delay and destroy commonsense consumer  protections.   In short, this bill is not about creating jobs, so nobody should be  fooled. It is about rewarding special interests, plain and simple. It  is about making it more difficult to rein in Wall Street, to control  polluters, or to protect workers. But this is in keeping with the  philosophy of the Republican majority, so no one should be surprised. I  urge my colleagues to strongly oppose this effort.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, let me just say a few words about the closed  rule on H. Res. 11, the resolution condemning U.S. abstention on Israel  at the U.N. Security Council.   The peace and security of the State of Israel are priorities for  every Member of Congress. Let us not try to obscure or confuse that  truth. I can't think of any Member of this House who doesn't support  peace in the Middle East and a safe and secure Israel. We may disagree  about how to achieve those goals. Most of us believe that a two-state  solution that provides peace, security, and prosperity to all of the  peoples of the region--Israeli, Palestinian, and their Arab neighbors-- is the best option to securing a just, lasting, and durable peace.   I have always voted in support of economic and military aid for  Israel, but this does not mean that I always agree with the policies of  a particular government in Tel Aviv. Sometimes I have been critical of  the Israeli Government just as I am often critical of my own government  and of other governments in the region.   For the past four decades or more, the United States, under  Republican and Democratic Presidents alike, has strongly opposed the  expansion of settlements and the demolition of Palestinian homes. This  has been a bipartisan consensus. We oppose the settlements as a  violation of basic human rights; we oppose them as creating obstacles  to a lasting two-state solution; and we oppose their rapid expansion as  potentially creating a reality on the ground that, therefore, closes  any possibility of a two-state solution.    Since 1967, under Presidents Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan,  George H. W. Bush, Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama, the United  States has voted in favor or has abstained on more than 50 U.N.  Security Council resolutions that are critical of Israel, including  resolutions on settlements or the demolition of Palestinian homes. Of  the more than 30 abstentions that have been cast by the U.S. over  nearly five decades, only one was cast by the Obama administration-- just one.   H. Res. 11 does not precisely express that fact accurately. It  implies that the U.S. always opposes or vetoes such regulations when  that is hardly the case, nor does U.N. Security Council Resolution 2334  impose a solution on Israel outside of direct bilateral negotiations to  end the conflict. Some of us who are strong supporters of Israel have  difficulties with some of the wording in H. Res. 11 on a  straightforward factual basis.   Yesterday, in the Rules Committee, I offered an amendment to allow  this House to debate a substitute offered by our colleagues,  Congressman David Price, Congressman Eliot Engel, who is a cosponsor of  H. Res. 11, and Congressman Gerry Connolly. The Price-Engel-Connolly  amendment expresses the House's strong support for Israel, a two-state  solution, and direct negotiations between the parties to the conflict.  It is reasonable and balanced and is very much deserving of debate and  this House's attention.   Regrettably, the Republican majority on the House Rules Committee  rejected allowing that amendment to be brought before the House and  debated. Instead, it decided to begin this new year and this new  Congress with yet another closed rule--in fact, the second closed rule  this week with no debate, with no thoughtful alternatives, and with no  ability of the Members of this body to deliberate such serious issues  and choose between alternative proposals--just politics, politics,  politics, politics as usual.   I urge my colleagues to reject this rule and to please send a clear  message to House leaders that we would like to be able to debate  reasonable alternatives and amendments to bills, like the Price-Engel- Connolly amendment. If we don't start out the year demanding fairness  and openness in our debates of important issues then I don't want to  even speculate as to what the rest of the year will look like.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I do appreciate my colleague's  concerns. I think it is interesting to note, though, that, if he were  concerned about a closed rule, there were many of us who were very  concerned about a closed voice from America at the U.N. Security  Council in not defending Israel.   Also, on the other subject here, when we look at this going forward,  there was a substitute that was actually offered in support of a  resolution that does take a stand against what happened. It was not  even mentioned in the substitute resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Alabama  (Mr. Byrne), a fellow member of the Rules Committee.                                time  1300     Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions), the distinguished chairman of the  Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions), the distinguished chairman of the  Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions), the distinguished chairman of the  Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Barr).    Mr. Speaker, I am so glad that the  gentlewoman just got a chance to debate herself on the floor and to use  that freedom of speech. That is what this floor is for.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Ross).    Mr. Speaker, I am privileged to yield 1  minute to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Messer).    Mr. Speaker, I am privileged to yield 1  minute to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Messer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock).   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I support the REINS Act and the rule that brings it to  us, but I want to underscore the point made earlier by Mr. Barr.   The REINS Act says that any regulation--that is, an act with the  force of law--adopted by the executive branch and costs more than $100  million must then be approved by Congress to take effect.   As necessary as this bill is in the current environment, I am afraid  it has got it completely backwards. Under the Constitution read on this  floor today, it is not the role of the executive branch to make law and  for the legislative branch then to approve or veto it. Quite the  contrary, making law is the singular prerogative of the legislative  branch; the executive then approves or vetoes that law.   The REINS Act is necessary solely because for years Congress has  improperly ceded its lawmaking powers to the executive, and it is time  we restored the proper role of the legislative branch to make law and  for the executive branch to faithfully execute it.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Connolly).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mast), who is a great new Member.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mast), who is a great new Member.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Hollingsworth), who is another freshman  that we welcome to the floor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Gaetz), who is another new face that is  looking forward to making a difference here.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Royce), who is the distinguished  chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   It is amazing to me some of the stuff that I have just heard, Mr.  Speaker, just in the last few minutes. And I appreciate my friend  across the aisle, but the debate that we have been having here is  amazing. So that is something I want to talk about, but also something  that came up, just to take a few steps down the road.   It had been mentioned many times here on the floor today that a  unanimous vote by the Security Council in some way implies that it was  right or that it was proper. I am sorry, the groupthink of the United  Nations Security Council on this issue was wrong.   The one that was left silent was the beacon of freedom to the world,  the United States, and instead of engaging, instead of working as we  have in the past abstained or voted against, there have been times when  we actually, as my friend said a moment ago, Mr. Speaker, worked  together. When that did happen in the past, there were times in which  Israel and the U.S. worked together to soften or change, and we had, at  that point in time, something that--not liked, but something that could  be lived with. In this case, it was nothing Israel said. This is bad.  America turned its back.   Where was the voice? It was silent. Where was the voice? We voted  absent. That is not what the leader of the free world should do. That  is not what the leader of the free world should do to his closest ally  in the Middle East. That is why we are talking about this.   There are other things we can discuss today. There are other  discussions on two-state solutions on another case on the settlement,  but the bottom line here is that it goes deeper than the other issues.  The deeper part here is that we simply sat silent while the world  mocked and criticized our strongest ally, Mr. Speaker.   So don't talk to me about working together. I get it. But where was  the working together on this? It was absent. A unanimous vote,  especially of the United Nations Security Council, using that as your  justification, I think we need to talk.   But also, Mr. Speaker, when we come to the end, regulatory  environment, the REINS Act is simply saying: Congress, do what Congress  is supposed to do. Congress, work as the voice of the American people.  Work for the voice of helping companies start and create jobs. Work  with the American people to relegate them forward instead of moving  backward.   The REINS Act simply says: let's do our job here. Not the ones who  are closed off from input but the folks who are elected to come to this  place, to come to these hallowed halls and debate what we are talking  about today: debate the regulatory environment, debate the environment.  When we do that, then that is what we need to do.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the  underlying bill.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the rule  and the underlying bill.   I oppose this rule because it makes in order H.R. 26, the Regulations  from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act, which is a radical  measure that could make it impossible to promulgate safety regulations  to protect the public.   I oppose this rule because it would effectively shut down the entire  U.S. regulatory system, amending in one fell swoop every bedrock  existing regulatory statute.   The legislation is clearly designed to stop all regulation dead in  its tracks--no matter the threat to health, safety or the economy.   It would neuter the current system's reliance on science, expertise,  and public participation in developing regulations.   H.R. 26 would reshape the regulatory system to work as it did in the  19th Century, before the abuses of the robber barons led Congress to  create a modern and more efficient system to protect public health and  safety.   The REINS Act would require both houses of Congress to approve any  major rule within a limited period of time in order for it to take  effect.   Effectively, this would allow either house of Congress to block rules  simply through inaction, even when an existing statute required action.   The legislation would disempower every federal agency, effectively  rendering their rulemaking activities advisory opinions with no force  of law.   Under REINS, even rules to handle emergencies could be in effect for  only 90 days absent Congressional approval.   H.R. 26 is so grossly slanted against regulation that it will allow  lawsuits to proceed against any regulation Congress could actually  manage to approve.   And the latest version of the bill delays its effective date for a  year so that any Trump Administration efforts to repeal existing  regulations would not get caught up in the REINS Act trap--another  indication that the REINS Act would be expected to stop any regulatory  action from moving forward (because repealing regulations must be done  through regulation, so repeals would in fact trigger REINS.)   In addition to representing an overwhelming threat to the public,  H.R. 26 is also bad for business.   The legislation would require businesses to have to lobby Congress  for each and every significant regulatory change they wanted--no matter  whether those were new regulations, changes in regulation or repeal; no  matter whether the regulatory issues involved disputes between  different industries; no matter how technical the issues involved.   H.R. 26 would, in fact, make the regulatory system less predictable  for industry and would disadvantage any industry that did not have a  large political presence.   It is difficult to exaggerate how fundamentally this alarming piece  of legislation would change American government and how hard it would  make it to protect the public.   This legislative effort is the ultimate giveaway to special  interests.   Under H.R. 26, any special interest could simply use its political  clout in one chamber of Congress to sideline such vital public  protections as limiting the amount of lead in children's products,  preventing salmonella contamination in eggs, reducing emissions of  toxic air pollutants or banning predatory banking practices.   The REINS Act constitutes the ultimate overreach as well, not only  because of the impact it would have, but because Congress already has  ample tools to control the regulatory system.   Congress is already vested with the authority to vote to block a  specific regulation at any time.   And regulation is permitted only pursuant to statutes that Congress  has passed and can amend or repeal.   Under current law, agencies must keep a record of their interactions  with industry and other entities interested in the regulatory process  and provide a clear record of their decision-making (which often must  be able to hold up in court).   Because agencies often take years to review the scientific and  technical evidence relevant to a decision, throwing every final  decision to Congress would undermine this entire process.   In addition, courts can review regulations and an elaborate public  process that can stretch out for years must be followed to issue a  regulation.   Instead, under this legislation, Congress would have to make  relatively rapid decisions, often behind closed doors, and it would not  be legally held to any standard of technical review.   Businesses would no longer have an incentive to cooperate with  agencies and provide  [[Page H122]]  arguments and evidence because they could just take their chances with  the political process, which they would no doubt try to influence with  campaign contributions.   Ultimately, decisions on regulations would be determined solely by  political horse-trading among Members of Congress.   Agencies issue 50 to 100 major rules a year dealing with everything  from Medicare reimbursement to railroad safety to environmental  protection.   But, under H.R. 26, Congress would have 70 legislative days to  second-guess each and every decision covered by the Act.   Because failure to take action would kill any safeguard, Congress  would be forced to hold hearings in a short time on technical issues-- or worse, forgo hearings and race the 70-day clock with even less  information and debate.   This body has already allowed backlog to clog the channels of its  current docket, and this legislation would require that as many as 100  additional measures come to the floor.   This is not an effort to drain the swamp; this is a divisive and  manipulative tactic employed to clog the drain.   Mr. Speaker, make no mistake about it, this merry-go-round  legislative scheme and the irresponsibility of the House majority in  wasting time trying to shut down the entire regulatory system (because  it cannot win through time-honored, Constitutional legislative  processes) entirely disregard the administrative public support efforts  in place to protect food safety, air and water quality and to limit the  manipulation of our economic system by special interests.   The REINS Act is tantamount to a coup--a right-wing takeover to block  future agency actions regardless of public desires.   The exceptional Americans we serve deserve a Congress that does its  job and keeps our time-honored institutions functioning.   For these reasons and more, I oppose this rule and the underlying  bill.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:    An Amendment to H. Res. 22 Offered by Mr. McGovern of Massachusetts         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 3. Immediately upon the adoption of this resolution       the House shall proceed to the consideration, without       intervention of any point of order, in the House of the       resolution (H. Res. 23) expressing the sense of the House of       Representatives and reaffirming long-standing United States       policy in support of a negotiated two-state solution to the       Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The resolution shall be       considered as read. The previous question shall be considered       as ordered on the resolution and preamble to adoption without       intervening motion or demand for division of the question       except one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by       the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Foreign Affairs.        Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of House Resolution 23.          The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous  question.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair  will reduce to 5 minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote on  the question of adoption of the resolution.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 235,  nays 188, not voting 10, as follows:                                [Roll No. 9]                                 YEAS--235       Abraham      Aderholt      Allen      Amash      Amodei      Arrington      Babin      Bacon      Banks (IN)      Barletta      Barr      Barton      Bergman      Beutler      Biggs      Bilirakis      Bishop (MI)      Bishop (UT)      Black      Blackburn      Blum      Bost      Brady (TX)      Brat      Bridenstine      Brooks (AL)      Brooks (IN)      Buchanan      Buck      Bucshon      Budd      Burgess      Byrne      Calvert      Carter (GA)      Carter (TX)      Chabot      Chaffetz      Cheney      Coffman      Cole      Collins (GA)      Comer      Comstock      Conaway      Cook      Costello (PA)      Cramer      Crawford      Culberson      Curbelo (FL)      Davidson      Davis, Rodney      Denham      Dent      DeSantis      DesJarlais      Diaz-Balart      Donovan      Duffy      Duncan (SC)      Duncan (TN)      Dunn      Emmer      Farenthold      Faso      Ferguson      Fitzpatrick      Fleischmann      Flores      Fortenberry      Foxx      Franks (AZ)      Frelinghuysen      Gaetz      Gallagher      Garrett      Gibbs      Gohmert      Goodlatte      Gosar      Gowdy      Granger      Graves (GA)      Graves (LA)      Graves (MO)      Griffith      Grothman      Guthrie      Harper      Harris      Hartzler      Hensarling      Hice, Jody B.
