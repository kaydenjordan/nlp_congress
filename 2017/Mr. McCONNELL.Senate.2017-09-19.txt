 Mr. President, later today, the Senate will vote on  the nomination of Noel Francisco to become our Nation's next Solicitor  General.   The Office of Solicitor General is responsible for representing the  United States in litigation before the Supreme Court. It is a very  important office, and Mr. Francisco is very well qualified to lead it.  His private sector resume is impressive, and his public sector service  is remarkable.   He clerked for a towering figure on the Supreme Court, the late  Justice Antonin Scalia. During the administration of President George  W. Bush, he worked in the White House Counsel's office. He is currently  serving as a senior advisor in the Justice Department, after having  served as Acting and Principal Deputy Solicitor General earlier this  year.   Mr. Francisco has successfully argued a number of complex cases  before a number of courts, including, notably, the case of the National  Labor Relations Board v. Noel Canning before the  [[Page S5826]]  Supreme Court. In that matter, he represented the plaintiff, Noel  Canning, in its successful challenge to President Obama's unlawful so- called recess appointments.   That case is especially important for this body because the Supreme  Court's unanimous 2014 decision in favor of Noel Canning reaffirmed  that the Senate, not the President, possesses the clear constitutional  authority to prescribe the rules of its own proceedings.   Noel Francisco is a great choice for this tough job, and I urge  colleagues to join me in supporting him.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, at 4 p.m. today, there be 2 minutes of  debate, equally divided between the managers or their designees, and  that following the use or yielding back of that time, the Senate vote  on the motion to invoke cloture on the Emanuel nomination.    Mr. President, I listened carefully to Chairman McCain  talking about his long association with Joe. I thought maybe it was  appropriate, I would say to my colleague from Arizona, to point out  that he eliminated an awful lot of my earmarks over the years.    I will have fond reflections as well, in a sense. I  want to join you, Senator McCain, in congratulating Joe for a great job  for you and for our country for a very long time.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, today I wish to remember the life of  Fran Jarrell, of Paintsville, KY, who passed away on August 27, 2017,  at the age of 72.   For many years, Fran was a driving force in her community. She served  on numerous public committees and boards, supporting the efforts of  organizations from the mentoring committee for Community of Hope to the  Paintsville Garden Club. She also was a member of the Paintsville City  Council for many years, dedicating herself to making the community a  better place to live and work. Most recently, Fran was the executive  director of the Paintsville/Johnson County Chamber of Commerce, where  she was committed to bringing economic development and opportunity to  the area. In her numerous roles, Fran worked to bring out the beauty  and possibilities of her city.   The Paintsville community mourned Fran's passing. Flowers decorated  the entire downtown area as a tribute to her life, her passion, and her  dedication to others. Elaine and I send our condolences to Fran's  children, sisters, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding the passage of H.R. 2810, as amended, that amendment  No. 545 be considered and adopted.
