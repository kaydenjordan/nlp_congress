 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of Israel and H. Res.  771.   Israel is our most important partner in fighting terrorism. In fact,  they are the first line of defense for the U.S. when it comes to  terrorism because the sources of that terrorism are the same for both  of us.   Israel is a fabulous intelligence partner. I liken them to a giant  antenna in the Middle East that serves and provides information to  America.   As the only true democracy in the Middle East, Israel is a beacon for  the American ideals of freedom, personal liberty, and market economy.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stand together and support  Israel and H. Res. 771.
