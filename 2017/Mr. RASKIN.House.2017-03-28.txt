 Mr. Speaker, every American who loves freedom, democracy,  and public integrity this week is expressing solidarity with the  hundreds of thousands of anticorruption protesters in Russia who took  to the streets on Sunday. That huge throng of brave Russians, including  hundreds arrested and jailed by agents of Vladimir Putin, were  protesting the autocrats and kleptocrats running their country, a key  target being Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, who has amassed vineyards,  luxury yachts, and mansions worth more than $1 billion.   We should be standing with the protesters, but the corrupt autocrats  of Russia have found good friends in the billionaire Cabinet of  international businessman Donald Trump, whose administration is  administering a spreading staph infection: disgraced former National  Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who was paid by Russian companies to  appear at Russian events; Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, former CEO  of ExxonMobil and a close friend of Vladimir Putin who was awarded in  2013 a title of nobility called the Russian Order of Friendship; Paul  Manafort, the former Trump campaign manager who collected $10 million a  year to advance the agenda of Russia and Russian oligarchs.   We should be standing with the protesters. Two-thirds of Americans  want to see a complete, independent 9/11-style investigation into the  Russian connection, and we owe them no less.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, nobody takes the speech and debate clause  more seriously in this body than Mr. Garamendi. He speaks in debate  pretty much every day, and that is what the Founders wanted us to do,  not to just come here in a kind of naked exercise of power politics and  see who can get more votes, but really try to learn from each other and  engage in a dialogue so we are advancing public policy.   It was a pleasure to receive the gentleman's invitation to join this  Special Order on Alzheimer's disease. I am delighted to join him. I am  also delighted to see at the dais this evening the Speaker pro tempore,  my friend Congressman Smucker from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. He  is just a freshman, but he is already wielding the gavel. I would say  that seat suits Congressman Smucker just fine. It is good to see him up  there tonight.   Congressman Garamendi, I am the Congressperson from Montgomery  County, Frederick County, and Carroll County, Maryland, the 8th  Congressional District, which includes the NIH, the National Institutes  of Health; so I have the great fortune and honor and responsibility of  representing thousands of people who work at NIH and who live in  Rockville and in the neighborhood. So I see this as not just a national  treasure and resource, but also a vibrant and vital part of my  community that I represent.   I speak tonight not just as a politician, but I speak also as someone  who has--I guess what we call around here--a preexisting condition  because when I was in the Maryland State senate and as a professor of  constitutional law at American University, I was given a diagnosis in  the year 2010 of colon cancer.                                time  1845    I learned something very interesting going through the experience  about the difference between misfortune and injustice. Because if you  have a job that  [[Page H2509]]  you love and a family that you love and constituents that you love and  it is a beautiful day and you are told that you have got stage III  colon cancer, that is a misfortune. It can happen to anybody--liberal,  conservative, Democrat, Republican, Independent, old, young, every  race, every ethnicity. It can happen to anybody. It is a misfortune.   At the time, I was the floor leader in Maryland on marriage equality  legislation, and it struck me that the misfortune can happen to  anybody. But if you can't get health insurance because you love the  wrong person or because you are unemployed or because you are too poor,  that is not just a misfortune. That is an injustice because we, as a  society, can do something about that.   So when we think about Alzheimer's disease or cystic fibrosis or lung  cancer or diabetes 1 or 2, in a democratic society, our obligation is  not to compound the misfortunes of life with governmental injustice;  our job is to try to reduce misfortune because we are all citizens  together.   So that is why I am so proud to represent NIH because, as has been  said very eloquently by a number of speakers tonight, the NIH is in the  forefront of defending our population against disease and serious  illness.   So let's talk about Alzheimer's for a little bit.   More than 5 million Americans are living today with Alzheimer's  disease. That is about the population of my State--everybody in  Maryland, from Baltimore to Rockville, to Silver Spring, to Bethesda,  to Chevy Chase, to Middletown and Frederick County, to Sykesville, all  over Carroll County, from the eastern shore to western Maryland,  millions of people. That is how many people across the land are  suffering from Alzheimer's disease. And it is a number that is rapidly  increasing. It could be as high as 16 million people by 2050 is what  the experts at NIH are telling us.   Since 2000, deaths from Alzheimer's have increased a startling 89  percent. You have shown us what the graphs are, Mr. Garamendi. One in  three senior citizens today dies from Alzheimer's or another form of  dementia. For victims of this disease, it is demoralizing, devastating,  debilitating, and draining for the whole family.   In Maryland, Alzheimer's affects 100,000 people, and it costs us  around $1 billion in Medicaid dollars every year.   In 2017, it is estimated that, across the country, we will spend $259  billion caring for people with Alzheimer's and other kinds of dementia,  with $175 billion being borne by Medicare and Medicaid, alone. This  means nearly one out of every five Medicare dollars is spent on  Alzheimer's.   So we have got to move quickly and effectively to address the crisis  and to solve the puzzle of Alzheimer's disease; otherwise, these costs  are going to continue to grow even more sharply, and Alzheimer's could  overwhelm our healthcare system.   We need a cure, which is why the good people at the Alzheimer's  Association are asking Congress to support a $414 million increase in  the research budget at NIH for Alzheimer's in FY 2018. But President  Trump has proposed a $5.8 billion cut to the NIH, which is a 19 percent  reduction in the NIH budget.   Why?   Well, it is very hard to know. It is part of a proposal to slash $60  billion in science research, environmental protection, housing, the  human needs budget, and to shift it into the Pentagon. Now, that is at  a time, Mr. Garamendi, when a committee I serve on, Oversight and  Government Reform, just had hearings where Democrats and Republicans,  alike, were outraged to learn that $125 billion in waste, fraud, abuse,  and contractor overruns is happening right now in the Pentagon.   We could save $125 billion just by taking seriously the problems in  contracting and fraud and abuse that is taking place with the beltway  bandits. But instead of going after that corruption and waste, they  want to take $60 billion out of the human needs budget and shift it  over to the Pentagon.   Well, that is going to have a disastrous effect on our ability to  make progress. That is the point I think you are making tonight,  Congressman Garamendi. You are saying that, when we invest in basic  research on the diseases, we make progress.   Look what we have done with AIDS. It is amazing. Look what is  happening with cystic fibrosis. We are making real progress because we  are investing. We have got to not cut back on any of the research that  is taking place. We have got to double down and invest, and we really  need to do that with Alzheimer's.   So this move to slash the human needs budget, the medical research  budget, and put it in the Pentagon is an assault on science, on  medicine, and on the health care of our people. These are our people  whose lives are at stake that we are talking about. These are our  families that are suffering the savage repercussions of Alzheimer's  disease. It is a terrible infliction on the land.   So I think that the idea of slashing $6 billion from research for  serious diseases like Alzheimer's, like the doomed repeal-and-replace  legislation that crashed and burned on Friday of last week, is totally  counterproductive and destructive of the true needs and priorities of  our people.   We spend more money on the military than the next five or six  countries combined, and the Pentagon is swimming in a deep pool of  waste, fraud, abuse, and contractor overruns today.   Let's focus on helping our own people right now, the way mature  democracies do, not enriching beltway bandits and plutocrats and  insiders the way that authoritarian governments do. The question of  Alzheimer's is an urgent question for our time, just like the research  into all of the other killer diseases that are afflicting our people.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Garamendi for making me part of this Special  Order hour.
