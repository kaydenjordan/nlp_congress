 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, on Inauguration Day, our border was secure. The Trump  policies had slowed illegal immigration to a trickle. That afternoon,  Joe Biden reversed these policies, and in the last 27 months the  Democrats have deliberately admitted into our country more than 2.1  million illegal aliens.   Now that is larger than the entire population of the State of  Nebraska, and while the Border Patrol was overwhelmed, more than 1\1/2\  million known got-aways entered as well. That is an additional  population larger than that of Hawaii. All of this occurred in 27  months.   As we can see at this very moment, this was only a prelude to the  mass invasion now unfolding before our eyes. The Border Patrol Union  warned us yesterday: ``Field reports from agents across the southern  border verify the enormity of this tidal wave of illegal aliens coming  now. Huge groups are overwhelming stations, and it is completely out of  control. Massive releases beginning and it's going to get much worse.''   Now for Americans, this means classrooms packed with non-English  speaking students, hospitals flooded with illegals demanding  uncompensated care, violent criminal cartels and gangs introduced into  our communities, fentanyl killing an average of 300 Americans every  day, suppressed wages for working Americans, and the collapse of the  social safety net that was supposed to take care of Americans in need.   For the millions of illegal migrants, it means exposure to hazardous  conditions that have claimed 2,000 lives that we know of. Many arrive  sick, traumatized, starved, brutalized, raped, and deeply in debt to  the cartels.   These are not asylum seekers. Asylum is a specific refuge for those  singled out by their government for persecution because of race,  religion, or political beliefs. Asylum is achieved by crossing the  first international border that separates you from that government.  Asylum is not an open invitation to bum-rush our borders, but the  Democrats have made it precisely that.   If you make a fraudulent asylum claim, you are now guaranteed to  receive immediate admission into our country, you get cash, a range of  free goods and services, indefinite residency, and indefinite work  authorizations. Then, when your claim is ultimately rejected by a  clogged court system years in the future, you will not be deported, and  you only need to wait for the next amnesty.   This makes a mockery of legitimate asylum, the sovereignty of our  Nation, and the rule of law. Our bill removes the incentives to break  our laws by reinforcing the existing requirement that forbids releasing  asylum claimants into the country until their claim is resolved.   This bill also returns unaccompanied minors safely home as we already  do with children from Mexico or Canada, but this administration sends  all other children to poorly vetted so-called sponsors in this country  with little concern or follow-up over the conditions into which we have  abandoned them. Many become indentured servants, slaves to the cartels  and their gangs, forced into sex trafficking, labor trafficking, and  drug trafficking under horrific conditions.   The only way to stop this trafficking is to return these children  safely home. The cartels are paid thousands of dollars to bring them to  the United States, and that will stop the moment we return these  children to their homes. Every Border Patrol agent I have talked to  tells me that this is the only way to stop this heartbreaking tragedy.   For those crossing as families, this measure keeps them together. It  allows them to make their asylum claim and then to wait in Mexico or in  a family residential center until their claim is heard.   This measure removes the incentives for cartels to traffic children  to pose as families in order to be automatically released into our  country as the Democrats are doing.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Biggs, Mr. Roy, Mr. Calvert, Mr. Carter of  Texas, Mr. Johnson of Louisiana, Mr. Tiffany, and Mr. Moran for their  work that comprises the judiciary section of this bill and my thanks to  the many Members who helped craft it into its current form.   Yes, we are a nation of immigrants. We are also a nation of laws.  Millions of immigrants come to our country legally every year. They  obey our laws. They wait patiently. They do everything our country asks  of them. Meanwhile, millions of illegal immigrants are cutting in line  in front of them aided, abetted, encouraged, and rewarded by Democrat  officials.   It has been said that this bill has no chance in the Senate and if it  did pass that it would be vetoed by the President. Well, that is a  question that the American people must ultimately decide before it is  too late.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I am ready to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, we know how to secure our borders and protect our  country. We had done so under the Trump administration. The remain in  Mexico policy slowed illegal immigration and phony asylum claims to a  trickle. The border wall was nearing completion. ICE was actually  enforcing court-ordered deportations.   All of that changed when the Democrats seized control of our  government and reversed all of these policies, and the result we can  now see all around us. It is affecting our schools, hospitals, law  enforcement, working families' wages, and social services that are now  strained to the breaking point and soon beyond the breaking point.   This bill simply restores those policies that worked and makes it  more  [[Page H2274]]  difficult for a future President to refuse to faithfully execute the  laws.   I ask the American people to watch the catastrophe that is unfolding  right now on our collapsing southern border. What we are seeing is  something historic. It is a mass, illegal migration on a scale the  world has never seen and that no civilization has ever survived.   At this hour, history is screaming this warning at us that countries  that cannot or will not protect their borders simply aren't around very  long.   Without enforcing our immigration laws, we have no immigration laws.  Without immigration laws, we have no borders. Without borders, we have  no country.   Let that not be the epitaph of the American Republic, what Lincoln  called ``the last best hope'' of mankind on this Earth.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
