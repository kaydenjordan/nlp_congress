 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1232, I call  up the bill (H.R. 8373) to protect a person's ability to access  contraceptives and to engage in contraception, and to protect a health  care provider's ability to provide contraceptives, contraception, and  information related to contraception, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and add extraneous material on H.R. 8373, the Right to Contraception  Act.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  [[Page H6929]]    Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 8373, the Right to  Contraception Act introduced by Representative Manning.   When the Supreme Court overruled a woman's constitutional right to  abortion last month, it also called into question all the other  fundamental freedoms that Americans cherish under the 14th Amendment's  right to privacy, including the right to contraception.   In his concurrence, Justice Clarence Thomas went so far to even  contend that the Court should reconsider Griswold, the landmark case  that first recognized the constitutional right to use contraceptives.   This has opened the door for Republican legislators in States like  Idaho, Louisiana, and Mississippi to try to ban certain contraceptive  methods. These extreme proposals build on decades of Republican efforts  to restrict access to essential reproductive healthcare services. They  have tried to gut the Title X Family Planning program, which provides  access to contraceptives and family planning services for low-income  and uninsured individuals. They have also repeatedly tried to  invalidate the Affordable Care Act's contraceptive mandate, which  ensures coverage for contraception free of charge.   Contraception is basic preventive healthcare and is crucial to the  health and human rights of all people. Millions of people rely on  contraception not only to prevent unintended pregnancies but to prevent  and treat a wide range of medical conditions. Access to contraception  is essential to achieving gender equality as it advances women's health  and economic empowerment.   H.R. 8373 ensures that Republicans cannot limit people's access to  contraceptives. It also ensures that healthcare providers can provide  contraceptives and information about them free from political  interference.   Madam Speaker, while the right to contraception is legal today, we  must act to ensure this remains true in the future. This legislation  does exactly that, by enshrining the right to contraception in Federal  law.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from North Carolina (Ms. Manning), the sponsor of this legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Eshoo), the chairwoman of the Energy and Commerce  Health Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), the chairwoman of the Consumer Protection  and Commerce Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Matsui), a member of our committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from California.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Castor), who is a member of our committee and chairs the  Select Committee on the Climate Crisis.     Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster), a member of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. Craig), who is the co-lead on this legislation.    Madam Speaker, in response to the previous speaker, this  bill defines contraceptives as those legally marketed under the Federal  Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Nothing prevents the FDA from removing  unsafe products from the market.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Washington  (Ms. Schrier). Dr. Kim Schrier is a member of our committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Mrs. Fletcher), who is a member of our committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), our majority leader.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to the time that remains  on both sides?    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Jacobs) who is a co-lead on this legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee), the co-chair of the Pro-Choice Caucus.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute now to the gentlewoman  from Massachusetts (Ms. Clark), our Assistant Speaker.  [[Page H6936]]         Madam Speaker, may I ask, again, about the time  remaining?    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Colorado (Ms. DeGette), the chairwoman of the Subcommittee on  Oversight and Investigations.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Lois Frankel), co-chair of the Democratic Women's Caucus.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the Speaker of the House.    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Madam Speaker, they weren't suggesting that there was a  legislative hearing, just that the Energy and Commerce Committee worked  to get this bill drafted with Ms. Manning and her staff.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Chu).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  North Carolina (Ms. Adams.)    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Mrs. Trahan), a member of our committee.    Madam Speaker, I ask you one more time how much time  remains on each side.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I have heard many unfounded claims from the Republicans today, claims  that this bill would prevent the FDA from acting to remove unsafe  products or somehow direct funding for abortion.   This bill simply provides a right to contraception. Republicans are  trying  [[Page H6939]]  to distract from their poor record on women's health. The half-measures  that Republicans are purporting to bring forward today do not establish  a right to contraception, nor do they ensure that hostile State  legislators can't take away birth control in the future.   Only the Right to Contraception Act ensures that. That is why I  support this legislation, and I hope my colleagues will, as well.   Madam Speaker, I urge everyone to vote ``yes'' on this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
