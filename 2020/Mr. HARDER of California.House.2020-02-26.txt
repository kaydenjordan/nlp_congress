 Madam Speaker, people see swamp rats all  the time roaming the halls of D.C., but I believe this is actually the  first time in American history that we have a taxidermied swamp  creature on the actual floor of the House of Representatives.    This here is my good friend, Nellie the Nutria. She has nacho-cheese  colored teeth, can weigh up to 40 pounds, she can eat 25 percent of her  body weight every single day, and she has an exponential rate of  growth.   She may look cute to some people, but Nellie and her friends are a  real menace, and farmers across California's Central Valley and  residents of the Louisiana swamp can tell you, too, how serious of a  threat these giant swamp rats pose.   Nutria can destroy crops, irrigation canals, wetlands and native  species. And their exponential growth rate makes them a real problem.  One female, like Nellie here, can lead to 200 offspring in a single  year. The State of California estimates that if we don't do something  about this problem, there are going to be 250,000 nutria in our State  within the next 5 years.   Nellie's family in Louisiana have already caused an immense amount of  damage over the last 100 years. And my Republican colleagues on this  bill, Mr. Graves and Mr. McClintock, can attest to the real havoc these  swamp rats cause.   My bill would simply revive a program that the State of Maryland used  to almost entirely eliminate the infestation in the Chesapeake Bay,  where Nellie here came from originally. That program uses a variety of  strategies to control and eradicate this invasive species. It ended up  saving a lot of money in the long run, and my bill is going to bring  back that proven program and make more States eligible for help.   This is a tiny investment compared to what will be necessary if we  wait any longer.   I want to thank all my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who  joined me on this bill and ask for support in stopping this invasion.   There is a lot of bickering that goes on in this Chamber, but I am  proud that this is something Mr. Graves, Mr. McClintock, and myself  could find something that unites us, which is draining the swamp, not  just in Washington, but also in California and Louisiana, and the rest  of the country.                                time  1345
