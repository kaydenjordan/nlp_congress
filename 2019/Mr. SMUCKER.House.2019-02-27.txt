 Mr. Speaker, I rise today during Black History Month to  honor an Olympic champion and truly one of the greatest athletes my  district has ever produced: Mr. Henry Norwood, otherwise known as  ``Barney,'' Ewell.   Mr. Ewell was born into poverty and grew up in Lancaster. He attended  McCaskey High School and later went on to attend Penn State. He served  his country for 4 years, from 1941 to 1945, during World War II.   He became known as the fastest man in the world after he broke the  world record for the 50-yard dash in 1940. He went on to win one gold  and two silver medals at the 1948 Olympics in London.   I know people who still recall cheering on the streets in Lancaster  City after Barney Ewell returned from London, having won the medals for  our country and for our community.   Mr. Ewell was an inspiration to Lancaster City, and it is an honor to  highlight his story today.                            ____________________
