 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up  to 1 minute.    Madam President, I appreciate this broad support we have  seen for plugging the holes in our ability to evaluate foreign  investment with regard to national security risks in the United States.  We know China, for example, has been quite explicit about what it is  trying to do to surpass the United States economically and militarily,  and it has been very aggressive and very strategic in the way it has  tried to acquire intellectual property and know-how through foreign  investment in the United States. That is why this legislation is so  important.   I admire the Senator from Pennsylvania as one of the most principled  conservatives in this body and in Congress, but he and I differ over  whether the REINS Act, which would require up-or-down votes on  implementing regulations, should be a part of the implementation of  this national security legislation. I never dreamed we would do that in  a national security context as opposed to doing it in economic and  environmental legislation. Reluctantly, I oppose the amendment of the  Senator from Pennsylvania and encourage all of our colleagues to do the  same.   I conclude by saying, I share his concerns when it comes to using  national security as a pretext on economic legislation and trade  issues, and I look forward to continuing to work with him and all of my  other colleagues outside of the national security context to make sure  we support free and fair trade--trade that protects U.S. interests.  With the overstepping of the regulatory bounds by the executive branch  on occasion, I am all for rolling that back when we can but not in a  national security context like this.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the  Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain) and the Senator from Ohio (Mr.  Portman).   Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Ohio (Mr. Portman)  would have voted ``yea.''  [[Page S3934]]         The following Senators are necessarily absent: the  Senator from Idaho (Mr. Crapo) and the Senator from Arizona (Mr.  McCain).   Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Crapo)  would have voted ``yea.''    Mr. President, I am glad we are making such great  progress on the Defense authorization bill. I know some additional work  needs to be done. I wanted to come to the floor and comment briefly on  the historic meeting that occurred this last week with North Korean  officials in Singapore.   President Trump, Secretary of State Pompeo, National Security Advisor  Bolton, and the rest of the American delegation are to be congratulated  for having this meeting. It was a historic first step, and I applaud  President Trump for taking it. But I reiterate: It was a first step.   To me, it reminds me of boxers entering the ring and touching gloves  before the fight begins. It is a warmup for something longer and much  more difficult. We need to remain clear-eyed about who we are dealing  with and not assume that there isn't hard work to be done.   As one commentator recently put it, North Korean duplicity is normal.  We need to remind ourselves of our own history of negotiating with  North Korea and our counterpart's record of saying one thing and simply  doing another.   The joint agreement signed by President Trump and Kim Jong Un set  broad goals whereby the United States made unspecified ``security  guarantees'' and Kim Jong Un recommitted to work toward the complete  denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. This agreement set the stage  for future engagements between our Secretary of State and his North  Korean counterpart.   By saying it is a first step--or, like two boxers, touching gloves  before the fight begins--I don't want to suggest in any way that this  was unimportant. I think it is dramatically important because I can't  think of any other place in the world where a misstep or a  miscalculation could lead to so much bloodshed, heartache, and  conflict. While we know that the military option must always be the  last option, diplomacy is always welcome and is facilitated by a strong  military and preparedness. But now the followup negotiations will be  led by Secretary Pompeo, and I have every confidence that he will ably  lead those.   He has said that the United States hopes to achieve ``major  disarmament'' of North Korea's nuclear arsenal during the next 2\1/2\  years but added emphatically that we will resume joint military  exercises with South Korea if the talks stall.   I think this represents the right approach. Aim for the best, while  remaining vigilant and preparing for all possible obstacles and  outcomes.   President Trump has said that sanctions against North Korea will  remain in effect until we are sure that nuclear weapons are no longer a  factor. I applaud this stance of maximum pressure. We shouldn't take  our foot off the gas at this point because that is what brought us to  this historic meeting in the first place.   I believe the United States should remain committed to the permanent,  verifiable, and irreversible dismantling of North Korea's weapons of  mass destruction, and I wish Secretary Pompeo luck as he continues  followup discussions in South Korea to help accomplish the goal that we  seek.   As Speaker Ryan said last week, President Trump has now ``disrupted  the status quo.'' I like the way he expressed that. President Trump--if  nothing--is good at disrupting the status quo, but here, when it comes  to North Korea, it is enormously positive when the status quo includes  a brutal dictatorship that commits flagrant human rights violations,  has a state-controlled economy, is starving its own people in order to  build nuclear weapons, and has shown contempt for international norms  and global diplomacy. I would say that the careful and cautious kind of  ``disruption'' is exactly the right thing to do.   Our colleagues across the aisle seem to agree, and I am grateful for  that. Not everything needs to be a partisan issue here in Washington,  DC. In a statement, the junior Senator from Vermont called the summit  earlier this week ``a positive step in de-escalating tensions.'' I saw  that former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper made  similar positive remarks. We will have to wait and see how this story  unfolds, but the President is to be commended, first for ensuring that  the summit took place at all and, then, for providing us with hope for  a path forward.                                  Farm Bill    Mr. President, another item of business today is the farm bill, which  I hope we will take up promptly here in the Senate. Fortunately, it  passed the Senate Agriculture Committee yesterday by a vote of 20-to-1.  Thanks to Chairman Roberts and Ranking Member Stabenow, this bipartisan  compromise is a fair and equitable bill that does not favor one region  of the country over another. I have found in my time in the Senate that  agricultural issues and the farm bill don't pit Democrats against  Republicans so much as it pits one region of the country against  another, which makes it even more challenging--kind of like a Rubik's  Cube to figure out. But the near unanimous vote is a testament to the  collaboration and bipartisanship of the leaders of the committee. They  deserve the respect and appreciation of us all, especially those of us  who hail from States where agriculture has such a dominant presence,  like my State  [[Page S3937]]  and like the State of the Presiding Officer.   The farm bill is always a significant piece of legislation because it  helps to ensure that Americans, and many other people who depend upon  our food supply, enjoy access to the safest, most affordable, and most  reliable food supply in the world. We have to remember that in many  non-Western countries, you can't just walk up to a store and know that  what you want will be there on the shelf or that it will be affordable  or that it will be safe to even eat. The farm bill helps to ensure that  we continue to enjoy each of those things, knowing that we can walk  into a store, that we will find what we want, that it will be  affordable, and that it will be safe to eat.   This year's farm bill will be hugely impactful for farmers and  ranchers in my State of Texas. Among its most noteworthy provisions are  protecting seed cotton eligibility for the farm bill safety net. In the  supplemental funding bill we passed last February, we worked hard to  include this language, returning cotton to the safety net. This helped  cotton growers compete on a level playing field after years of  depressed prices.   So I want to thank Chairman Roberts and Ranking Member Stabenow, as  well as the rest of the committee, for ensuring that this policy  continues and that cotton farmers have the long-term predictability  they deserve under the farm bill.   This year's bill also retains and strengthens the Price Loss Coverage  Program to help provide Texas producers with predictability throughout  unstable weather and natural disasters. That comes as great news this  year, especially, when we are all well aware that much of the Texas  Panhandle, as well as much of the rest of my State, remains under  severe, or even exceptional, drought conditions.   Additionally, the bill promotes animal health and reauthorizes  disease research programs, including a crucial one that will help the  U.S. Department of Agriculture research and contain the spread of  cattle fever tick. This is a parasite-carrying insect with the  potential to wipe out cattle herds and cause devastating financial  losses.   The research programs that we are promoting will help farmers and  ranchers all across the country. I know the senior Senator from  Minnesota, for example, has been concerned about avian influenza in her  State, and I am glad that we were able to work together to ensure that  these important research programs, with all of their implications, are  authorized in the bill.   On top of that, the farm bill will strengthen crop insurance and  other crop management tools and enhance incentive programs that help  the agriculture community conserve soil and water.   Finally, the bill encourages the U.S. Department of Agriculture  research partnerships, including those at Texas A&M, Texas Tech, and  Prairie View A&M, to promote more productive and profitable farming,  and it will assist Texas farmers and ranchers in placing and selling  their products in foreign markets.   I know Senator McConnell intends to take the farm bill up on the  floor as soon as possible, and I look forward to supporting its swift  passage.   I yield the floor.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the  Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain) and the Senator from Kansas (Mr.  Moran).
