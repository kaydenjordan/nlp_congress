 Mr. Speaker, over the past few months, we  have seen remarkable progress in the fight against COVID-19. Our small  businesses, manufacturers, and even schools have stepped up to produce  necessary PPE for their communities and frontline providers.   As of last month, Wilkes Community College Ashe Campus--located in my  district--delivered over 741 3D-printed face shields to various  locations in the High Country. Originally, this 3D printing endeavor  was going to support Ashe Memorial Hospital, but now it has turned into  a regional resource for healthcare providers across western North  Carolina.   To Mike Windish and Chris Kearley--the two engineering instructors at  Wilkes Community College--and their colleagues who are spearheading  this effort, thank you, and keep up the good work.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Gohmert), my colleague and my classmate, for yielding time  to me this evening.   Mr. Speaker, at such a pivotal moment in the history of our country,  Democrats are choosing posturing over progress. Yesterday, Senate  Democrats blocked consideration of the JUSTICE Act, and claimed it did  not go far enough to address their issues with regards to police  reform.   One of the most puzzling pieces to this story that even after Senator  Scott offered to increase the allotment of amendments on the bill,  Senate Democrats turned around and walked out of the room. They had the  opportunity to work in the spirit of bipartisanship, but they ignored  it. Are they genuinely afraid of bipartisan collaboration, or are they  more focused on scoring political points with their own base? You be  the judge.   Mr. Speaker, over the past few weeks, we have heard dangerous  rhetoric regarding the defunding of law enforcement, and it is  downright concerning. The men and women of law enforcement lay down  their lives every day in the line of duty.   And this course of action that Democrats are championing is an  affront to health, safety, and security of our communities. Law and  order are fundamental tenets of a free society, but when anarchy is  assigned a higher value than protecting the American people, the lines  become blurred and discord will prevail.   Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss if I did not address imprudent  comments made on Tuesday by the Speaker of the House. She asserted that  Republicans are trying to get away with the murder of George Floyd. Let  her words sink in for a moment.   Two weeks ago, Democrat leadership called passing police reform ``a  life-or-death situation.'' But now that we have introduced legislation  that addresses this issue, they have changed their tune entirely.   Republicans stand at the ready to deliver this reform while Speaker  Pelosi is looking for the next media sound bite. Her rhetoric is  nothing short of disgraceful. Instead of sowing seeds of division and  resorting to crafting legislation behind closed doors, it is time that  she and our colleagues across the aisle come to the table to work  alongside of us. Maybe it is too daunting of a task for them. Forsaking  bipartisanship in favor of a my-way-or-the-highway approach will not  move us closer to enacting meaningful police reform.   Mr. Speaker, we are ready to work with our Democrat colleagues, and  all they need to do is pull a seat up to the table and join us.
