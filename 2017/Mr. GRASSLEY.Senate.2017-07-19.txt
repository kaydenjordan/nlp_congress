 Mr. President, on June 20, 2017, I notified the  majority leader of my intent to object to any unanimous consent request  relating to the nomination of Steven A. Engel, of the District of  Columbia, to be the Assistant Attorney General for the U.S. Department  of Justice Office of Legal Counsel, until he adequately responded to my  questions regarding his views on the OLC's May 1, 2017, opinion,  ``Authority of Individual Members of Congress to Conduct Oversight of  the Executive Branch.''   As I have previously noted, the opinion erroneously states that  individual Members of Congress are not constitutionally authorized to  conduct oversight. It creates a false distinction between oversight and  what it calls nonoversight requests. It relegates requests from  individual Members for information from the executive branch to Freedom  of Information Act requests. I have written a letter to the President  requesting that the OLC opinion be rescinded. The executive branch  should properly recognize that individual Members of Congress have a  constitutional role in seeking information from the executive branch  and should work to voluntarily accommodate those requests.   My June 12, 2017, letter to Mr. Engel asked him several questions  about the opinion, including whether the opinion  [[Page S4078]]  met the OLC's own internal standards requiring impartial analysis,  whether individual Members of Congress are ``authorized'' to seek  information from the executive branch, and what level of deference the  executive branch should provide to individual Member requests.   Mr. Engel promptly responded to my letter on June 23, 2017, and to a  second June 27, 2017, followup letter on July 12, 2017. I ask unanimous  consent that Mr. Engel's responses be placed in the Record following my  remarks.   I also met with Mr. Engel in my office on July 19, 2017, to further  discuss and clarify his views on the authority of individual Members to  request information from the executive branch. Mr. Engel's responses,  both in writing and in person, indicate that he agrees each Member,  whether or not a chairman of a committee, is a constitutional officer  entitled to the respect and best efforts of the executive branch to  respond to his or her requests for information to the extent permitted  by law. He also agreed: No. 1, that the May 1, 2017, OLC opinion on  this topic failed to consider adverse legal authority, specifically  Murphy v. Dep't of the Army, 613 F.2d 1151 (D.C. Cir. 1979); and No. 2,  that, if confirmed, he would review the opinion; and No. 3, consider  whether a more complete analysis of the issue is necessary.   I am satisfied that Mr. Engel understands the obligation of all  Members of Congress to seek executive branch information to carry out  their constitutional responsibilities and the obligation of the  executive branch to respect that function and seek comity between the  branches. Therefore, I agree a vote should be scheduled on his  nomination, and I wish him the very best in his new role.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                      Washington, DC, June 23, 2017.      Hon. Charles E. Grassley,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Grassley: I write in response to your June       12, 2017 letter concerning the May 1, 2017 letter opinion of       the Office of Legal Counsel (``OLC''). I appreciate your       interest in ensuring that Members of Congress are able to       obtain the information necessary to fulfill their       constitutional responsibilities, as well as your attention to       ensuring that OLC opinions provide candid, independent, and       principled legal advice. If I am confirmed as Assistant       Attorney General, I will be committed to ensuring that OLC       complies with these principles.        I provide here my responses to the seven questions in your       June 12 Letter.        1. Are you familiar with the May 1, 2017 OLC opinion?        Response: I am not currently at the Department of Justice,       but I read the May 1, 2017 opinion shortly after it was       published.        2. In your view, does this opinion meet the standards       described in OLC guidance that require impartial analysis of       competing authorities or authorities that may challenge an       opinion's conclusions? If so, can you please point to the       portion of the opinion which you believe fully discusses       contrary authority or arguments for non-Chairmen's need for       information from the Executive Branch to carry out their       constitutional function?        Response: Because I am not currently at the Department of       Justice, I have not had occasion to review all of the       underlying precedents that may bear upon the May 1, 2017       letter opinion. I agree that an OLC opinion should candidly       and fairly address all relevant legal sources, and there are       judgment calls that must be made in determining what should       be included, particularly with respect to letter opinions       (which tend to be shorter and less formal). With respect to       the May 1, 2017 opinion, I do agree that Murphy v. Dep't of       the Army, 613 F.2d 1151 (D.C. Cir. 1979), which was cited in       your June 7, 2017 letter to the President, may bear upon the       issues addressed in the May 1, 2017 opinion. I understand       that in 1980, and again in 1984, the Department of Justice       advised that, with respect to FOIA practices, the Murphy       decision did not eliminate the legal distinction between       requests made by Committee Chairmen and those made by       individual Members of Congress. In my opinion, it would have       been useful for OLC's letter opinion to address the       Department's current understanding of the Murphy decision in       the context of congressional oversight.        3. Do you believe that individual Members of Congress, who       are not Chairmen of committees, are ``authorized'' to seek       information from the Executive Branch to inform their       participation in the legislative powers of Congress? Do you       believe they are authorized by the Constitution? Why or why       not? Do you believe that they are authorized by Congress? Why       or why not?        Response: The D.C. Circuit has recognized that each member       of Congress has a ``constitutionally recognized status'' that       includes a legitimate need ``to request such information from       the executive agencies as will enable him to carry out the       responsibilities of a legislator.'' Murphy, 613 F.2d at 1157.       I believe that individual Members are ``authorized'' to seek       such information in their roles as constitutional officers.       The question whether Congress has separately authorized such       requests would turn upon the rules of each House of Congress.       In my view, the Executive Branch should seek to satisfy the       legislative interests reflected in the information requests       of individual Members, to the extent practicable and       consistent with the confidentiality obligations of the       Executive Branch,        4. In your experience, what percentage of congressional       requests for information are answered by the Executive Branch       on a voluntary basis?        Response: In my experience at the Department of Justice,       the Executive Branch seeks to answer the majority of       congressional requests for information on a voluntary basis.       Congress rarely seeks the compulsory disclosure of       information from a Department or agency.        5. In your view, what is an appropriate reason for       withholding information requested by an individual Member of       Congress?        Response: Traditionally, the Executive Branch has sought to       provide Members of Congress with requested information except       where there is a need to protect important confidentiality       interests, such as those involving national security       information; materials that are protected by law (such as       grand jury information, taxpayer information, or materials       restricted from disclosure by the Privacy Act); information       the disclosure of which might compromise open law enforcement       or civil enforcement investigations; presidential       communications; or information involving agencies'       predecisional deliberative communications.        6. In your view, does the Executive Branch have any       Constitutional responsibility to respond to requests for       information from individual Members of Congress as part of a       process of accommodation in order to promote comity between       the branches? If not, why not?        Response: The Department of Justice has recognized that the       accommodation process ``is an obligation of each branch to       make a principled effort to acknowledge and if possible to       meet, the legitimate needs of the other branch.'' Opinion of       the Attorney General for the President, Assertion of       Executive Privilege in Response to a Congressional Subpoena,       5 Op. O.L.C. 27, 31 (1981). At the same time, the courts and       others have distinguished between official requests from       Committees and those from individual Members. See, e.g.,       Exxon v. FTC, 589 F.2d 582, 592-93 (D.C. Cir. 1978)       (recognizing that the ``principle is important that       disclosure of information can only be compelled by authority       of Congress, its committees or subcommittees, not solely by       individual members . . .''); Alissa M. Dolan et al., Cong.       Research Serv., RL 30240, Congressional Oversight Manual 65       (Dec. 19, 2014) (``[N]o judicial precedent has directly       recognized an individual Member's right, other than a       committee chair, to exercise the committee's oversight       authority without the permission of a majority of the       committee or its chair.''). In my view, the Executive Branch       should seek to satisfy the legislative needs of Members to       the extent practicable and consistent with the       confidentiality obligations of the Executive Branch.        7. Is a request from an individual, elected Member of       Congress entitled to any greater weight than a FOIA request,       given the Member's broad Constitutionally mandated       legislative responsibilities? Why or why not?        Response: In view of the constitutional responsibilities of       individual Members of Congress, the Executive Branch may well       provide information to Members that goes beyond the       requirements of the FOIA statute, and the Executive Branch       has the discretion to provide information or documents even       if it would be exempt from mandatory public disclosure under       FOIA. I understand that the Executive Branch does not treat       individual Member requests as requests under FOIA, and thus,       the Executive Branch may provide more information about       Executive Branch programs than it provides to FOIA       requestors, who are entitled to receive only documents.        I appreciate your attention to these important questions.       Please let me know if I may be of any more assistance on       these issues, or on any other matters in the future.            Sincerely,      Steven A. Engel.                                   ____                                      Washington, DC, July 12, 2017.      Hon. Charles E. Grassley,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Grassley: I write in response to your June       27, 2017 letter, which continues our correspondence       concerning the May 1, 2017 letter opinion of the Office of       Legal Counsel (``OLC''). I understand your concerns with the       legal opinion, as well as with recent reports concerning       Executive Branch policies governing congressional oversight.       Because I am currently in private practice, I had no role in       drafting the May 1 opinion, and I likewise have no       familiarity with the Administration's internal policies       concerning congressional oversight requests. If I am       confirmed as Assistant Attorney General for the Office of       Legal Counsel, I will review the May 1 opinion and ensure       that OLC's legal advice reflects my best judgment of the law       and established practice in this area.        I provide here my responses to the six additional questions       raised in your letter.  [[Page S4079]]             1. You acknowledged that the OLC opinion did not examine       key additional authorities which recognize the constitutional       role of individual Members to seek information from the       Executive Branch. If confirmed, will you commit to a more       careful study of this issue and other questions I have       raised?        Response: Yes.        2. Will you commit to modifying this OLC opinion to be       consistent with your own recognition that individual Members       ``are `authorized' to seek . . . information [from the       Executive Branch] in their roles as constitutional       officers?'' If not, why not?        Response: If I am confirmed, I will review the May 1       opinion and come to my best judgment of the law and       established practice in this area, including with respect to       any further guidance or clarifications to the May 1 opinion       that may be appropriate.        3. You note in your response to Question 3 that ``the       Executive Branch should seek to satisfy the legislative       interests reflected in the information requests of individual       Members.'' As I wrote in my June 7, 2017, letter to the       President, the May 1 OLC opinion draws a distinction between       ``oversight'' and ``non-oversight'' requests. I have never       sent or seen a letter requesting information for ``non-      oversight'' purposes, and I still do not understand what it       means. As you know, courts have recognized that ``oversight''       is inherent in the legislative power and just as broad. As       the Court recognized in McGrain v. Daugherty, 273 U.S. 135       (1927):        A legislative body cannot legislate wisely or effectively       in the absence of information respecting the conditions which       the legislation is intended to affect or change; and where       the legislative body does not possess the requisite       information--which not infrequently is true--recourse must be       had to others who do possess it.        Id. at 175. This power of inquiry ``encompasses inquiries       concerning the administration of existing laws as well as       proposed or possibly needed statutes.'' Watkins v. United       States, 354 U.S. 178, 187 (1957). Congressional oversight       encompasses a myriad of legislative tools, processes, and       purposes, and is not simply limited to investigations of       waste, fraud, and abuse conducted by a Committee Chairman.        How exactly can a congressional inquiry be distinguished on       the basis of whether it is an ``oversight'' or a ``non-      oversight'' inquiry, to borrow the language from the May 1       opinion? More importantly, by what authority can the       Executive Branch purport to make such a determination absent       explicit direction from the Legislative Branch?        Response: If confirmed, I will review the distinction       between ``oversight'' and ``non-oversight'' inquiries, as       those terms are used in the May 1 opinion. The May 1 opinion       appears to draw a procedural distinction between information       requests made by ``a committee, subcommittee, or chairman       exercising delegated oversight authority'' and those made by       individual Members who are not acting pursuant to explicit       authorization of the Standing Rules of the Senate or the       Rules of the House of Representatives. See Office of Legal       Counsel, Letter Opinion for the Counsel to the President,       Authority of Individual Members of Congress to Conduct       Oversight of the Executive Branch at 3 (May 1, 2017). In       support, the May 1 opinion quotes the Congressional Research       Service's Congressional Oversight Manual, which advises that       when individual Members request agency records ``they are not       acting pursuant to Congress's constitutional authority to       conduct oversight and investigations.'' Alissa M. Dolan et       al., Cong. Research Serv., RL30240, Congressional Oversight       Manual 56 (Dec. 19, 2014)).        As we have previously discussed, the D.C. Circuit has       recognized that individual Members have a ``constitutionally       recognized status'' that includes a legitimate need ``to       request such information from the executive agencies as will       enable him to carry out the responsibilities of a       legislator.'' Murphy v. Dep't of the Army, 613 F.2d 1151       (D.C. Cir. 1979). This would be true, no matter whether those       requests are called ``oversight'' inquiries or something       else. If confirmed, I will consider these issues in       connection with my review of the May 1 opinion.        4. The Inspector General Empowerment Act of 2016 explicitly       authorizes any member of Congress upon request to obtain       information related to Inspector General reports that is not       otherwise prohibited from public disclosure. Do you agree       that such requests from individual Members are ``oversight''       requests? Why or why not?        Response: I have not previously studied the referenced       provision of the Inspector General Empowerment Act. As a       general matter, if a statute calls for the Executive Branch       to provide information in response to a request from a Member       of Congress, then the Executive Branch should respond--no       matter whether the Member's request would be characterized as       ``oversight'' or something else--in a manner consistent with       the Department's other statutory and constitutional       obligations, including its law enforcement, litigation, and       national security responsibilities.        5. I asked in my June 12, 2017, letter whether the       Executive Branch has any Constitutional responsibility to       respond to individual Members of Congress. You noted, as the       OLC opinion notes, that requests from individual Members       cannot be compelled. But I did not ask whether individual       Members have the power to compel responses. They clearly do       not. As you noted in your response to question 4, ``Congress       rarely seeks the compulsory disclosure of information from a       Department or agency.'' Your experience matches my own. As I       noted in my June 7, 2017 letter to the President, most       responses to requests for information--from Chairmen or not--      are received voluntarily. I also believe it is important to       remember that many of the relevant case precedents examining       questions related to congressional oversight arise in a       compulsory context. By virtue of the fact that most responses       are voluntary, a court has never had occasion to consider       them.        What I want to understand is not whether the Executive       Branch will pay a legal penalty for refusing to answer       individual Member requests, but whether such requests, made       as part of their wide-ranging Constitutional       responsibilities, are due the best efforts of the Executive       Branch given the nature of those responsibilities and the       need and desire for comity between the branches. Do you       agree? Is this what you mean by your response: ``In my view       the Executive Branch should seek to satisfy the legislative       needs of Members to the extent practicable''?        Response: I agree that in the interest of comity, the       Executive Branch should give due weight and sympathetic       consideration to requests from individual Members of       Congress, even where the executive official is not faced with       a legal penalty for refusing to answer, and that is what I       meant in my prior response.        6. I asked you whether an individual Member request was       entitled to any greater weight than a Freedom of Information       Act (FOIA) request. You responded that ``the Executive Branch       may well provide information to Members that goes beyond the       requirements of the FOIA'' and that you believe ``the       Executive Branch does not treat individual member requests as       requests under FOIA, and thus, the Executive Branch may       provide more information about Executive Branch programs than       it provides to FOIA requestors, who are entitled to receive       only documents.'' However, in my experience, FOIA requestors       with ready access to judicial review and experienced FOIA       litigators often get more information even than Congressional       Committees, let alone individual Members. Unlike FOIA       litigants, a Member must first convince an entire House of       Congress to hold an executive branch official in contempt       before obtaining judicial review of an information request.       Should the Executive Branch strive to meet a higher standard       for voluntary cooperation with Congress, given its       constitutional duties, than merely disclosure of that which       could be judicially mandated? If so, what would you do to       ensure that Executive Branch officials understand the       Constitutional basis for the importance of voluntary       cooperation with Congressional information requests?        Response: Yes, I agree that the measure of the Executive       Branch's cooperation should not be simply what could be       judicially mandated. I believe that, in the interest and       spirit of comity, the Executive Branch should seek to satisfy       the legislative needs of Members, as indicated by my prior       response. That may well include providing additional       information about Executive Branch programs beyond what would       be available to FOIA requestors. If confirmed, I will ensure       that the Office of Legal Counsel's legal advice in this area       would be consistent with such principles.        I appreciate your interest in these important questions.       Please let me know if I may be of any more assistance on       these issues or on any other matters in the future.            Sincerely,      Steven A. Engel.                            ____________________
