 Mr. President, I would like to have printed in the  Record an article that was published in the Miami Herald, ``These Miami  special ed teachers brought the party to students on the last day of  school.'' I commend Ms. Coco-Molina and Ms. Lara for their dedication  to Florida's students, and the memories they created that will never be  forgotten.   The material follows:                               [June 3, 2020]   These Miami Special Ed Teachers Brought the Party to Students on Last                               Day of School                            (By Colleen Wright)         Special education teachers Jen Coco-Molina and Jacquelyn       Lara couldn't have their last day of school party at South       Miami Senior High as usual, so they brought the party to       their students.        They pulled up in front of Cristin Baez-Alvarez's apartment       building blasting Cristin's favorite song. From the ``mobile       party'' in Coco-Molina's trunk, the teachers pulled out a       goody bag just for 15-year-old Cristin: M&Ms, a daisy pen, a       Disney Puppy Dog Pals coloring book and a smile balloon on a       stick.        ``It's a happy balloon, like you, always smiling,'' said       Lara.        Cristin took the goody bag and a bite out of a red frosted       Publix cupcake. She's nonverbal, but her unflinching       frosting-stained smile said it all. And what she couldn't       express, her mother said in Spanish.        ``She's emotional. She's afraid that when she goes back       upstairs, she'll start crying,'' mom Cristina Baez told Lara.        Like Coco-Molina and Lara, teachers everywhere have been       adapting since the coronavirus pandemic catapulted them into       online distance learning March 13. Wednesday was       unceremoniously the last day of school for Miami-Dade County       Public Schools.        But the pair couldn't let the school year end like this.       Coco-Molina teaches math and Lara teaches English and science       to 11 ninth- and tenth-graders with varying disabilities. All       but one of the students they visited Wednesday will have a       different pair of teachers next year.        ``We're their second moms,'' said Coco-Molina. ``We're not       just their teachers.''        Coco-Molina's trunk was draped with a green plastic       tablecloth. There were turquoise and pink paper lanterns,       shiny streamers, and a letter board read ``Enjoy your       summer.'' Next to the goody bags were cupcakes for the       students, mini cupcakes for their families.                           Teachers get a surprise         Max Ortiz waited on his front porch for his teachers with a       surprise of his own. His  [[Page S2731]]       mother made summer-themed gift bags for each teacher with       beach bags, metal tumblers and makeup wipes.        And he had assignment packets to turn in to each teacher.        The 16-year-old dashed up to the car. ``Hi miss! How you       doing?'' he said as he took a vanilla cupcake. ``I've been       good, miss. It's been a while.''        ``You have been an ideal student,'' Lara said through       tears. ``I wish I could have you as a student for the rest of       your life.''        Coco-Molina couldn't hold back, either. ``He came to us as       a boy, and now he's a freaking man,'' she said. ``He always       needed our approval and now he's so independent.''                            ____________________
