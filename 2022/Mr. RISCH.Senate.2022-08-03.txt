 Mr. President, today, I rise and urge my colleagues to  vote in favor of the Accession Protocols for Finland and Sweden to join  NATO. This is probably one of the easiest votes I will ever make in the  U.S. Senate.   I have listened to arguments about Asia, somehow that it comes in  here. Look, we can walk and chew gum at the same time. Certainly, we  need to look at what is going on in Asia, pay attention to what is  going on in Asia, but what we are talking about here is the defense of  the North Atlantic.   This organization was put together many years ago. It has grown over  those years to be 30-strong. And now we are going to add two more.   I have characterized NATO as the most successful political and  military alliance in the history of the world; certainly the most  powerful alliance in the history of the world. And today we have the  opportunity to expand the alliance by including Finland and Sweden.   Over the years, we have added various countries, and debates could be  had about those countries as to whether or not they are sufficient to  join NATO and be part of the article 5 ``an attack on one is an attack  on all'' alliance. But on Finland and Sweden, there really is little,  if any, argument. These are two very successful countries.   This accession process is an important chance for the United States  to demonstrate leadership in NATO--we have over the years, and we will  continue to do so--and the United States' commitment to its  modernization and to its future.   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has carefully consulted and  coordinated with our NATO allies, the Governments of Sweden and  Finland, and with the administration to ensure this process could move  as efficiently as possible. I can tell you that, personally--and others  have done the same over recent years and particularly over recent  months, have pressed Finland and Sweden to change their view as to  [[Page S3897]]  whether or not they should remain neutral and instead move into the  NATO alliance.   On February 24, we all know the world shook. Things changed  dramatically. After Putin's unprovoked attack on Ukraine, Sweden and  Finland, I am sure, woke up and said: You know, that could be us next,  but it won't be us if we join NATO. So their polling in their country  changed dramatically on February 24 as to whether or not NATO  membership was appropriate for them. They have now enthusiastically  said that NATO is appropriate for them, and we have shown in this body  bipartisan support for Finland and Sweden joining NATO.   Finland and Sweden will make model members of the NATO alliance. Both  have strong and capable militaries in place now and are already net  contributors to the security alliance. As was pointed out earlier by  Senator Collins here, they have been very active in NATO, even though  they are not members of NATO, by participating in various drills that  have taken place and also by participating in the duties that NATO does  strengthening the eastern flank of NATO. They have also demonstrated  interoperability with NATO, which is extremely important, and the  commitment necessary to join the alliance.   I would say that today, with what is going on in Ukraine, Finland and  Sweden joining the alliance is even more important. When the shooting  is over in Ukraine, it won't be over. NATO is going to reexamine what  they need to do to strengthen themselves, and certainly one of those  will be an examination of hardening the eastern flank. Finland and  Sweden, obviously, are on the eastern flank and will add considerably  to that. Not only that, it is going to cost more to defend the eastern  flank simply because of what Russia has done. Finland and Sweden will  be a contributor, as will everybody.   Adding these two nations as full members of our alliance will further  deter any temptation by Russia to engage in military adventurism in the  Baltic and Arctic regions. I believe Russia is already deterred when we  say and our NATO allies say and European nations say to Putin: Not one  square inch. Whether it is on the eastern border of one of the Baltic  States or whether it is downtown London or in the United States, an  attack on any of the NATO countries is an attack on all of them, and  the response will be swift.   Today's ratification of Finland and Sweden as new members of NATO  will both send a strong message of transatlantic unity to Putin and  strengthen NATO against Russia's ongoing threat. NATO has pulled  together regionally to push back on Russia, and it is obvious that need  has not gone away.   I want to urge my colleagues to vote yes. This is a really easy vote.   I yield the floor.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, as a member and former chairman of  the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each month  I recognize and celebrate the American entrepreneurial spirit by  highlighting the success of a small business in my home State of Idaho.  Today, I am pleased to honor Rudy's A Cook's Paradise as the Idaho  Small Business of the Month for August 2022.   Constructed in 1904, the oldest continually operating retail store in  Twin Falls first housed Price Hardware. Rudy Ashenbrener purchased the  store after returning from his time as a fighter pilot instructor in  World War II. It remained a hardware store until 2002, when Rudy's son  Tom and his wife Megan took over the business, renamed it Rudy's A  Cook's Paradise, and turned it into a world of gourmet cooking.   Today, Rudy's offers one of the largest selections of kitchen gadgets  in the northwest, including cooking utensils and cookware, wine, beer,  and more. The store features a test kitchen where they offer classes on  food techniques, artisanal bread baking, and how to throw a dinner  party. The 118-year-old building also boasts a vast collection of wine  and beer in its lava rock cellar. Rudy's beloved staff goes beyond  serving aspiring chefs, providing southern Idaho with opportunities to  experience new products, tastes, and techniques. From its home on Main  Avenue, Rudy's has found its way into the hearts of many Idahoans.   Congratulations to Tom and Megan Ashenbrener and all of the employees  [[Page S3913]]  at Rudy's A Cook's Paradise for being selected as the Idaho Small  Business of the Month for August 2022. Thank you for serving Idaho as  small business owners and entrepreneurs. You make our great State  proud, and I look forward to your continued growth and success.                            ____________________
