 Mr. Chair, I thank Ranking Member Kaptur for  her leadership in yielding the time and I thank the gentleman from  Tennessee and all the professional staff who have been working hard  over the past day and a half to get appropriations back on track in the  people's House.   Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 4394.   In the midst of all the turmoil across the globe and weeks of GOP  chaos here on Capitol Hill, there is good news to share with the  American people. It is a story of American innovation that is  benefiting our neighbors and communities all across this great country.  Innovation that is putting money back into people's pockets at a time  they really need it.   Over the past year since Democrats passed and President Biden signed  historic laws investing in infrastructure and clean energy and American  workers, the American economy has been booming and our neighbors are  enjoying some lower costs, good-paying jobs are being created, and  folks back home are building safer, healthier, more resilient  communities.   Infrastructure and clean energy are reducing pollution. They are  improving our health. They are countering China's push to control  supply chains, and that is why this GOP bill must fail.   The GOP bill takes America backwards. The GOP bill is a gift to  China. This GOP bill is a recipe for higher energy bills.   The Democrats simply are not going to let the GOP take us backwards.  It has been about 1 year since I stood by President Biden as he signed  the historic clean energy law, the Inflation Reduction Act, and let me  tell you it has been difficult to keep up with all of the announcements  of new American factories and jobs in Ohio, in Tennessee, in Kentucky,  Georgia, South Carolina, Pennsylvania.   I keep a list here. Suniva, a U.S. solar manufacturer in Norcross,  Georgia, announced 240 jobs. They are the ones who fought cheap Chinese  exports.   Stellantis and Samsung are building an EV battery plant in Kokomo,  Indiana, 1,400 workers.   Polaris is building in Huntsville, Alabama, electric utility vehicles  for the Army.   LG Energy Solution and Honda, $3.8 billion for EV battery plants. The  list goes on and on.   America is the envy of the world because we have a clean energy law  that is creating jobs. Along with the infrastructure and the CHIPS and  Science Act, in Florida, we have seen about $500 million in new  investments and about 1,700 jobs. Across the country at the lowest  estimate, there are about 170,000 new jobs.   America is the envy of the world because of our clean energy laws. I  will  [[Page H5142]]  say it again. Our economy is booming, and we are not going to let the  Republicans take us backwards.   Just this morning, it was announced that U.S. gross domestic product,  a measure of all goods and services produced in the United States, rose  at 4.9 percent which was much better than anyone expected. Private  sector investment is flocking to clean energy and infrastructure  projects in your districts and mine.   Clean energy projects don't just create new good-paying jobs. They  also lower energy costs for our neighbors back home and all American  families and we sure do need it.   In the Tampa-St. Pete area that I have the privilege of representing,  electric bills are out of sight. They are astronomical.                                time  1445    In a single year, this past year, the average Tampa Electric Company  customer saw an increase by a whopping $492. Why? Because they generate  electricity based on oil and gas, primarily.   Thankfully, cleaner, cheaper energy, and energy efficiency is on its  way to lower people's electric bills, and we cannot let the Republicans  gut what we are doing in clean energy to lower electric bills.   Here is another good, new report that Floridians and all Americans  needed.   Yesterday, the Biden administration announced help for consumers to  afford these high energy bills. Florida will receive $106 million in  Federal funds to lower home energy bills. I haven't even mentioned the  high cost of extreme weather. Extreme heat across the country is  hurting farmers. It is fueling fires and costly extreme weather events,  and it is creating higher insurance premiums. Indeed, we just lived  through the hottest summer on record. It was roasting. We have to  reduce pollution that is causing this overheating and the higher cost  on communities.   Mr. Chair, at the appropriate time today, I will offer this motion to  recommit to send this bill back to committee. If the House rules  permitted, I would have offered the motion with an important amendment  to this bill. My amendment would strike two sections, 311 and 312.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record the text of my amendment.         Ms. Castor of Florida moves to recommit the bill H.R. 4394       to the Committee on Appropriations with the following       amendment.        Strike sections 311 and 312.     Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote  ``yes.'' Please tank this bill which takes us backwards.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at  the desk.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
