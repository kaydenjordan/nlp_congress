 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of U.S. Navy  Lieutenant Ridge Alkonis, a sailor currently stationed abroad in Japan.  While the U.S. and Japanese naval forces have long maintained a strong  bond, the relationship is deteriorating as a result of Japanese  injustices against U.S. military members.   The case of U.S. Navy Lieutenant Ridge Alkonis, who is of American  Samoan descent, exemplifies the disparate treatment American sailors  receive in Japan.   While driving his wife and three children to get ice cream during a  family outing, Lieutenant Alkonis suffered a sudden and unforeseen  medical emergency which resulted in a tragic car accident causing the  death of two Japanese citizens. While indeed a tragedy, this was an  accident in every sense of the word.   At the scene of the accident, Lieutenant Alkonis was immediately  arrested by Japanese authorities, without receiving any medical care,  and imprisoned. He was systematically deprived of sleep, denied legal  counsel, and pressured to sign false accusations.   The Tokyo High Court rejected the majority of evidence submitted by  Lieutenant Alkonis, and last week, his appeal was dismissed.   I am deeply troubled by Japan's mistreatment of Lieutenant Alkonis.  These abuses are hurting the U.S.-Japan alliance exactly when it needs  to be strengthened.   I call on President Biden and Ambassador Rahm Emanuel to bring  Lieutenant Alkonis home.                            ____________________
