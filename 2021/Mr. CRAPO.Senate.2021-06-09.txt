 Madam President, along with my colleague Senator  Jim Risch, I congratulate Jack Buell, of St. Maries, ID, on his  extraordinary 46 years of public service as Benewah County  commissioner. We thank him for contributing his time, talent, and  resources to the people of St. Maries, Benewah County, and to Idaho.   Throughout his time in leadership, Jack has earned deep respect and  admiration for his unwavering commitment to the community and county he  loves. Jack Buell was first elected Benewah County commissioner nearly  five decades ago in 1974, and he served steadily as commissioner until  December 2020. Jack is known as someone who can be counted on to help  meet the needs of the community. For example, Jack made his own  property available to the U.S. Forest Service to use as a fire base.  There are many other examples of his generosity and outstanding  service, as he seems to never tire of doing what needs to be done.   Jack is truly a stalwart of our great State. He and his wife Eleanor  own Jack Buell Trucking based in St. Maries. This business has long  been a pillar in the community, providing jobs that support families  and contributing to Benewah County's economic base. In addition to his  business and service as Benewah County commissioner, Jack has supported  and served on boards for many local and State organizations. He has  been formally recognized for his contributions to the community and  State, including his 2012 induction into the Idaho Hall of Fame and  receiving the Idaho Distinguished Service Medal in 2021.   Jack is someone with great integrity, dedication, experience, wisdom,  and institutional knowledge. He adds humor, curiosity, know-how,  humility, and hard work to the countless challenges he has faced  throughout his remarkable career. Jack has led by example for decades,  and despite all he has done, he is not resting from service. We  understand his ongoing efforts include increasing safety on the roads  of St. Maries.   Thank you, Jack, for all you have done and continue to do for  Idahoans. We are honored to join many others in expressing our  gratitude to you for a lifetime of exceptional service.                            ____________________
