 Madam Speaker, 6 years ago yesterday, Westland firefighter  Brian Woehlke made the ultimate sacrifice when he died courageously  battling a blaze at a local strip mall.   Brian, who was born in Detroit, certainly was courageous, and he lost  his life after the 29 short years he had been on this Earth.   On the sixth anniversary of his tragic passing, let us remember him  and his loving family that survives him, including his wife, Jennifer,  and his daughter, Ava. We thank them for their selflessness and  bravery, and we honor them by offering unwavering support for the men  and women who continue to serve as our first responders across the  country.                            ____________________
