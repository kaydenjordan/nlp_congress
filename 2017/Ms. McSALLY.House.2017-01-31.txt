 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 505) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to  strengthen accountability for deployment of border security technology  at the Department of Homeland Security, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 505         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Border Security Technology       Accountability Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. BORDER SECURITY TECHNOLOGY ACCOUNTABILITY.         (a) In General.--Subtitle C of title IV of the Homeland       Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 231 et seq.) is amended by       adding at the end the following new section:       ``SEC. 434. BORDER SECURITY TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM MANAGEMENT.         ``(a) Planning Documentation.--For each border security       technology acquisition program of the Department that is       determined to be a major acquisition program, the Secretary       shall--        ``(1) ensure that each such program has a written       acquisition program baseline approved by the relevant       acquisition decision authority;        ``(2) document that each such program is meeting cost,       schedule, and performance thresholds as specified in such       baseline, in compliance with relevant departmental       acquisition policies and the Federal Acquisition Regulation;       and        ``(3) have a plan for meeting program implementation       objectives by managing contractor performance.        ``(b) Adherence to Standards.--The Secretary, acting       through the Under Secretary for Management and the       Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, shall       ensure border security technology acquisition program       managers who are responsible for carrying out this section       adhere to relevant internal control standards identified by       the Comptroller General of the United States. The       Commissioner shall provide information, as needed, to assist       the Under Secretary in monitoring proper program management       of border security technology acquisition programs under this       section.        ``(c) Plan.--The Secretary, acting through the Under       Secretary for Management, in coordination with the Under       Secretary for Science and Technology and the Commissioner of       U.S. Customs and Border Protection, shall submit to the       appropriate congressional committees a plan for testing and       evaluation, as well as the use of independent verification       and validation resources, for border security technology so       that new border security technologies are evaluated through a       series of assessments, processes, and audits to ensure       compliance with relevant departmental acquisition policies       and the Federal Acquisition Regulation, as well as the       effectiveness of taxpayer dollars.        ``(d) Major Acquisition Program Defined.--In this section,       the term `major acquisition program' means a Department       acquisition program that is estimated by the Secretary to       require an eventual total expenditure of at least       $300,000,000 (based on fiscal year 2017 constant dollars)       over its life cycle cost.''.        (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents of the       Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended by inserting after       the item relating to section 433 the following new item:  ``Sec. 434. Border security technology program management.''.       SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON ADDITIONAL AUTHORIZATION OF                     APPROPRIATIONS.         No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to       carry out this Act and the amendments made by this Act. This       Act and such amendments shall be carried out using amounts       otherwise authorized for such purposes.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include any extraneous material in the Record.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 505, the Border Security  Technology Accountability Act.   This bill seeks to improve the management of border security  technology projects, safeguard taxpayer dollars, and increase  accountability for some of the Department of Homeland Security's  largest acquisition programs.   As a subcommittee chair with responsibility for the entire 2,000-mile  Southern border, and as a Member whose district in southern Arizona  represents 80 miles of the border, I have spent countless hours meeting  with border residents, local law enforcement, ranchers, and men and  women who tirelessly patrol the border every day.   I know firsthand that when our border technology projects lack the  proper oversight and accountability, it is bad for taxpayers, those who  defend our border, and those who live along our border.   That is why this bill is so important.   The Government Accountability Office has repeatedly included DHS  acquisition management activities on its high-risk list, demonstrating  that these programs are highly susceptible to waste, fraud, abuse, or  mismanagement.                                time  1515    The Secure Border Initiative, also known as SBInet, is a prime  example of acquisition mismanagement. Initial plans developed in 2005  and 2006 call for SBInet to extend across the entire U.S.-Mexico land  border; however, SBInet deployment in Arizona was fraught with  mismanagement, including a failure to adequately set requirements so  the system would meet the needs of its users: our border patrol agents.   After spending nearly $1 billion of taxpayers' money with minimal  results, DHS canceled SBInet in 2011, showing the high cost of failing  to properly oversee new border acquisitions. With a renewed focus from  the administration and this Congress on improving border security, this  bill helps ensure Americans' dollars are used as efficiently and  effectively as possible. It requires that border security technology  programs at the Department have an acquisition program baseline: a  critical document that lays out what a program will do, what it will  cost, and when it will be completed.   The bill also requires programs to adhere to internal control  standards and have a plan for testing and evaluation, as well as the  use of independent verification and validation resources. Being proper  stewards of our limited resources requires that programs are on time,  on budget, and follow sound management procedures. We cannot afford to  waste another minute or another dollar. We must put into place strong,  effective technology programs to secure our border.   I urge all Members to join me in supporting these basic commonsense  cost-control mechanisms so that we can responsibly secure our border.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 505 to  have transparency, accountability, and efficiency of vital border  security technology projects.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 677) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to establish  chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear intelligence and  information sharing functions of the Office of Intelligence and  Analysis of the Department of Homeland Security and to require  dissemination of information analyzed by the Department to entities  with responsibilities relating to homeland security, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 677         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``CBRN Intelligence and       Information Sharing Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR                     INTELLIGENCE AND INFORMATION SHARING.         (a) In General.--Subtitle A of title II of the Homeland       Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 121 et seq.) is amended by       adding at the end the following new section:       ``SEC. 210G.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 677, the CBRN  Intelligence and Information Sharing Act of 2017.   We know that terrorist groups have long sought to employ chemical,  biological, radiological, and nuclear, or CBRN, materials in their  attacks. In his 2016 Worldwide Threat Assessment, Director of National  Intelligence James Clapper noted that weapons of mass destruction  continue to pose a threat to the United States, whether from North  Korea's nuclear tests or the dual-use nature of biological materials  that make threats difficult to detect.   In addition, last year, the Organisation for the Prohibition of  Chemical Weapons completed a year-long investigation that found both  Syria and ISIS have used chemical weapons. ISIS' interest in using  weapons of mass destruction material in its attack against the West is  also well documented.   H.R. 677 will enhance intelligence analysis and information sharing  and will work to ensure that State and  [[Page H786]]  local officials get the actionable intelligence information necessary  to stop or mitigate a CBRN attack.   As the previous chairwoman of the Emergency Preparedness, Response,  and Communications Subcommittee, I held a number of hearings on the  threat posed by terrorist attacks using CBRN agents. Many national  security experts, first responders, and members of the law enforcement  community have testified to the need of increased information sharing  with appropriate State and local officials and emergency responders.   This budget-neutral bill seeks to address these findings. It requires  the Office of Intelligence and Analysis at DHS to support homeland  security-focused intelligence analysis of CBRN threats, including  emerging infectious diseases. It directs the Office of Intelligence and  Analysis to share information with State, local, tribal, and private  entities and get their feedback to improve two-way sharing of  information. Finally, H.R. 677 directs the Secretary of DHS to report  annually for 5 years on the Department's intelligence and information  sharing activities and DHS' activities in accordance with relevant  intelligence strategies.   The House passed a nearly identical bill I introduced last Congress  by a vote of 420-2. I urge Members to join me in supporting this bill.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 677,  this legislation that will enhance the sharing of CBRN-related threat  information.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 678) to require an assessment of fusion center personnel  needs, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 678         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Department of Homeland       Security Support to Fusion Centers Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. FUSION CENTER PERSONNEL NEEDS ASSESSMENT.         Not later than 120 days after the date of the enactment of       this Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall       conduct an assessment of Department of Homeland Security       personnel assigned to fusion centers pursuant to subsection       (c) of section 210A of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6       U.S.C. 124h), including an assessment of whether deploying       additional Department personnel to such fusion centers would       enhance the Department's mission under section 101(b) of such       Act and the National Network of Fusion Centers. The       assessment required under this subsection shall include the       following:        (1) Information on the current deployment of the       Department's personnel to each fusion center.        (2) Information on the roles and responsibilities of the       Department's Office of Intelligence and Analysis intelligence       officers, intelligence analysts, senior reports officers,       reports officers, and regional directors deployed to fusion       centers.        (3) Information on Federal resources, in addition to       personnel, provided to each fusion center.        (4) An analysis of the optimal number of personnel the       Office of Intelligence and Analysis should deploy to fusion       centers, including a cost-benefit analysis comparing deployed       personnel with technological solutions to support information       sharing.        (5) An assessment of fusion centers located in       jurisdictions along land and maritime borders of the United       States, and the degree to which deploying personnel, as       appropriate, from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S.       Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Coast Guard to       such fusion centers would enhance the integrity and security       at such borders by helping Federal, State, local, tribal, and       territorial law enforcement authorities to identify,       investigate, and interdict persons, weapons, and related       contraband that pose a threat to homeland security.        (6) An assessment of fusion centers located in       jurisdictions with large and medium hub airports, and the       degree to which deploying, as appropriate, personnel from the       Transportation Security Administration to such fusion centers       would enhance the integrity and security of aviation       security.       SEC. 3. PROGRAM FOR STATE AND LOCAL ANALYST CLEARANCES.         (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that       any program established by the Under Secretary for       Intelligence and Analysis of the Department of Homeland       Security to provide eligibility for access to information       classified as Top Secret for State, local, tribal, and       territorial analysts located in fusion centers shall be       consistent with the need to know requirements pursuant to       Executive Order No. 13526 (50 U.S.C. 3161 note).        (b) Report.--Not later than two years after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Under Secretary of Intelligence       and Analysis of the Department of Homeland Security, in       consultation with the Director of National Intelligence,       shall submit to the Committee on Homeland Security and the       Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and       Governmental Affairs and the Select Committee on Intelligence       of the Senate a report on the following:        (1) The process by which the Under Secretary of       Intelligence and Analysis determines a need to know pursuant       to Executive Order No. 13526 to sponsor Top Secret clearances       for appropriate State, local, tribal, and territorial       analysts located in fusion centers.        (2) The effects of such Top Secret clearances on enhancing       information sharing with State, local, tribal, and       territorial partners.        (3) The cost for providing such Top Secret clearances for       State, local, tribal, and territorial analysts located in       fusion centers, including training and background       investigations.        (4) The operational security protocols, training,       management, and risks associated with providing such Top       Secret clearances for State, local, tribal, and territorial       analysts located in fusion centers.       SEC. 4. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT.         The Under Secretary of Intelligence and Analysis of the       Department of Homeland Security, in collaboration with the       Chief Information Officer of the Department and       representatives from the National Network of Fusion Centers,       shall conduct an assessment of information systems (as such       term is defined in section 3502 of title 44, United States       Code) used to share homeland security information between the       Department and fusion centers in the National Network of       Fusion Centers and make upgrades to such systems, as       appropriate. Such assessment shall include the following:        (1) An evaluation of the accessibility and ease of use of       such systems by fusion centers in the National Network of       Fusion Centers.        (2) A review to determine how to establish improved       interoperability of departmental information systems with       existing information systems used by fusion centers in the       National Network of Fusion Centers.  [[Page H787]]         (3) An evaluation of participation levels of departmental       components and offices of information systems used to share       homeland security information with fusion centers in the       National Network of Fusion Centers.       SEC. 5. MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING.         Not later than one year after the date of the enactment of       this Act, the Under Secretary of Intelligence and Analysis of       the Department of Homeland Security shall enter into a       memorandum of understanding with each fusion center in the       National Network of Fusion Centers regarding the type of       information such fusion centers will provide to the       Department and whether such information may be subject to       public disclosure.       SEC. 6. AMENDMENTS.         Section 210A of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C.       124h) is amended--        (1) in subsection (d), by striking ``and tribal'' each       place it appears and inserting ``tribal, and territorial'';        (2) in subsection (e), by striking ``and tribal'' each       place it appears and inserting ``tribal, and territorial'';        (3) in subsection (g)(1), by striking ``or tribal'' and       inserting ``tribal, or territorial'';        (4) in subsection (i)--        (A) in paragraph (3), by striking ``and tribal'' and       inserting ``tribal, territorial''; and        (B) in paragraph (6), by inserting ``territorial,'' after       ``tribal,''; and        (5) in subsection (j)(1), by striking ``or tribal'' and       inserting ``tribal, or territorial''.       SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Fusion center.--The term ``fusion center'' has the       meaning given such term in subsection (j) of section 210A of       the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 124h).        (2) National network of fusion centers.--The term       ``National Network of Fusion Centers'' means a decentralized       arrangement of fusion centers intended to enhance individual       State and urban area fusion centers' ability to leverage the       capabilities and expertise of all such fusion centers for the       purpose of enhancing analysis and homeland security       information sharing nationally.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 678, the Department of  Homeland Security Support to Fusion Centers Act of 2017.   Ensuring that the Federal Government is sharing intelligence and  homeland security information with State and local officials is a vital  component of U.S. national security and our counterterrorism efforts.   I have seen firsthand the important work of fusion centers, which  disseminate Federal threat and intelligence information to local law  enforcement and emergency responders. These centers also collect State  and local information and fuse it with Federal intelligence. There is  no doubt that this effort enhances terrorist investigations and creates  a more complete domestic threat picture.   To help break down information sharing stovepipes, my State's fusion  center, the Arizona Counter Terrorism Intelligence Center, or the  ACTIC, and the 77 other fusion centers across the country need greater  access to information, particularly from the Department of Homeland  Security and its components.   While personnel from the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis have  been deployed to most fusion centers, one remaining challenge is access  to DHS component personnel and information, particularly ICE, CBP, and  TSA. To address this issue, this bill requires GAO, the Government  Accountability Office, to conduct an assessment of the DHS personnel  detailed to fusion centers and whether deploying additional personnel  will enhance threat and homeland security information sharing. This  third-party assessment of DHS personnel deployments will be valuable  when making staffing decisions moving forward.   Additionally, this bill supports ongoing DHS efforts to sponsor top  secret clearances to appropriate State and local analysts in fusion  centers. The committee has received countless testimony from State and  local law enforcement about the value additional clearances will  provide.   The bill also directs the DHS to review current information  technology systems used to share information with fusion centers and  make enhancements to ensure systems, such as the Homeland Security  Information Network, are user friendly and meeting the needs of States  and locals.   Lastly, the bill requires the Under Secretary of the Office of  Intelligence and Analysis to sign a memorandum of understanding with  each fusion center. The purpose of the MOU is to lay out what type of  information will be shared between DHS and the fusion centers and how  that information will be protected. A critical element of the  Department's relationship with the thousands of State and local first  responders working in fusion centers is trust. The MOU process will  help improve this important connection.   Our country is at its highest threat posture this 9/11 given the  large number of foreign fighters and ISIS-inspired plots. This bill  will help ensure our State and local law enforcement officers as well  as fire and EMS personnel are getting access to the information needed  to protect our communities.   I urge all Members to support this bill.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, one of the core missions of the Department of Homeland  Security is to share threat information with State and local first  responders. Fusion centers are a key mechanism for that process. As  fusion centers continue to mature into national assets, Congress must  ensure that the Department of Homeland Security is supporting fusion  centers with the resources that are needed to keep our communities  safe.   I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 678.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
