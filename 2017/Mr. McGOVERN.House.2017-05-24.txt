 Mr. Speaker, yesterday President Trump released the  most reckless and heartless budget I have ever seen in my life. It  slashes virtually every worthwhile program: programs that help the  middle class, seniors, and veterans. But what I find particularly  offensive and troubling is that his budget is a radical assault on  people living in poverty or right on the edge. It guts Medicaid,  housing assistance, and Social Security disability insurance benefits.   The Trump budget also decimates the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance  Program, known as SNAP, our Nation's first line of defense against  hunger. It cuts the program by $193 billion over 10 years. That is a 25  percent reduction. President Trump makes these ruthless cuts by cutting  eligibility and reducing benefits. He also adds a new requirement that  States pay 25 percent of the cost of the benefits.   It may be a nice sound bite to suggest that States should share the  cost of providing SNAP benefits to their residents, but the reality is  that State budgets are already stretched incredibly thin, and  communities are already suffering from a decrease in Federal investment  in States. The Trump budget compounds this problem by eliminating  dozens of programs that families in States across the country rely on.  This will only exacerbate the stress on State budgets to deliver basic  services to their residents.   If that isn't bad enough, President Trump would allow States to cut  benefit levels to manage the costs they would incur under this cruel  budget. This means that families living in certain States would see  their already too-modest benefits drop through no fault of their own.   At the same time, President Trump is proposing new fees on retail  stores applying to accept SNAP benefits. We know access to food is a  huge concern, especially in rural areas and in cities, and such a  wrongheaded approach will further limit the ability of families on SNAP  to shop for nutritious food.   In addition, President Trump's budget makes it even more difficult  for able-bodied adults without dependents to receive modest food  benefits. Current law allows States to waive the time limits imposed on  these vulnerable adults, which include veterans, by the way, but  President Trump wants to severely limit the ability of States to  request these waivers. Estimates suggest that in any given month, this  proposal would restrict access to SNAP for up to 1 million Americans  struggling to find work. Mr. Speaker, kicking people off of SNAP  doesn't help them find a job. It only makes them hungrier, weaker, and  even less likely to qualify for work. It is simply a rotten thing to  do.   Now, quite frankly, I was a little surprised by the magnitude of  these cuts given the fact that President Trump's Secretary of  Agriculture, Sonny Perdue, testified before the House Committee on  Agriculture last week in strong defense of SNAP. He said: `` . . . we  have no proposed changes. You don't try to fix things that aren't  broken.''   How are we to trust this administration's promises on anything when  they tell us one thing on Wednesday and release a budget that does the  exact opposite not even a week later?   During the past 2 years, the House Committee on Agriculture has held  21 hearings on SNAP. As the ranking member of the Subcommittee on  Nutrition, I have participated in each one of them. What we have  learned from our witnesses, both Democrats and Republicans, is that  SNAP works. It is one of the most effective and efficient programs run  by the Federal Government. It expands in times of economic hardship and  contracts as our economy recovers.   With a modest food assistance benefit of about $1.40 per person per  meal, SNAP alleviates hunger and reduces poverty. It supplements the  food budgets of families and helps them make ends meet. Innovations in  the program have helped to spur the consumption of healthier food. I  would like to remind my colleagues that two-thirds of the people on  SNAP are children, seniors, or disabled. The majority of people on the  program who are able to work do work.  [[Page H4508]]    If you want to talk about reforming the program and how do we look to  the future, we need to focus on how to make the program even better. We  need to make sure that anyone who needs this benefit has access to it.  We need to support and expand innovative programs that help increase  the purchasing power of SNAP. We need to increase SNAP benefits so that  families that are helped by the program can actually access more  nutritious food that lasts through the month.   Mr. Speaker, Donald Trump is used to dining with billionaires at Mar- a-Lago and Trump Tower, so I am not at all shocked by his lack of  knowledge about our antihunger safety net or by his lack of interest in  helping the most vulnerable in our society. It is clear from his budget  that he does not have a clue.   I urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting this reckless and  heartless proposal that will devastate so many families that we  represent. We must, instead, support efforts to strengthen SNAP and end  hunger now. We are supposed to end hunger now, not make it worse.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I am opposed to the bill in its current  form.    Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill,  which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted,  the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.   Mr. Speaker, I regret to say the Republicans are again bending over  backwards to help corporations and the wealthiest among us while  ignoring science and leaving hardworking American families to suffer  the consequences. This administration's decisions have placed special  interests and their financial contributions ahead of  [[Page H4551]]  the health and the safety of our citizens, and this Republican-led  House has been complicit.   Earlier this year, a toxic chemical manufacturer convinced the Trump  administration to discard decades of scientific research just so they  could continue to profit off of chlorpyrifos, a pesticide that has been  proven to be harmful to human beings, especially infants and children.  The pesticide was well on its way to being banned by the EPA, which  said, in 2015, that it could not be declared safe for human health and  for the environment; but the pesticide manufacturer wrote a check for  $1 million to President Trump's inaugural committee, and just weeks  later, the proposed ban on the pesticide was magically reversed. It is  amazing how that worked out.   What I am wondering is: Did President Trump and the Republicans in  Congress think we wouldn't notice? Did they think the American people  would be okay with them knowingly allowing a dangerous pesticide to be  used on farms and affect our food supply? Republicans should be ashamed  of this blatant disregard for the health of the families they were  elected to represent.   In 2000, the EPA banned most home uses of the chemical, citing risks  to children, yet it continues to be used in agriculture production  across this country. Does this really sound like something that should  be used on the food we feed our kids?   On the campaign trail into the White House, President Trump has made  clear that he will always side with deep-pocketed polluters and  corporations over the health and safety of families.   In January 2017, Dow Chemical was reported to have contributed $1  million to President Trump's inaugural committee. The CEO of Dow  Chemical was a frequent guest of President-elect Trump, including at an  appearance at a postelection rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan. In March  2017, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt signed an order reversing the ban  on the pesticide.   Also in March 2017, Scott Pruitt signed an order reversing the ban on  this pesticide suggesting, in a statement, that ``by reversing the  previous administration's step to ban one of the most widely used  pesticides in the world, we are returning to using sound science and  decisionmaking rather than predetermined results.'' Public health  advocacy groups strongly disagreed, not to mention conservation  organizations.   Mr. Speaker, you know what? I think I trust public health experts  when it comes to protecting our families over Administrator Pruitt, who  sued the EPA at least 14 times as Oklahoma's attorney general opposing  important protections for our air and our water. Talk about the fox  guarding the henhouse.   Mr. Speaker, we were not sent here to auction off the health and  safety of millions of Americans to the highest bidder. Every day the  Trump administration gets more brazen with their giveaways to special  interests, raising serious questions about corruption and conflicts of  interest.   Donald Trump promised to drain the swamp. He has created a cesspool.  We are talking about people's lives here, Mr. Speaker. This pesticide  has been shown to harm women, children, and families. It has no place  on our farms or in our food system. Our health should not be for sale.   It isn't hard to connect the dots here. The EPA abruptly reversed its  efforts to ban a toxic chemical just weeks after the chemical's  manufacturer made a political contribution to the newly elected  President. And we know their decision wasn't based on science. The  former head of the EPA's Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution  Prevention suggested that the Trump EPA is ``ignoring the science that  is pretty solid'' and putting farmworkers and exposed children at  unnecessary risk.   Now, I can see how people might start to wonder whether this  administration is on the side of special interests or the American  people. This amendment fights back against the corrupting influence of  political contributions from pesticide companies. It would ensure that  existing science-based protections for our families and our environment  cannot be overturned by a well-timed contribution to President Trump or  to those in his administration charged with implementing the law.   The American people deserve to know that their leaders will stand up  to protect their health and their safety rather than protecting the  bottom line of wealthy special interests. Mr. Speaker, I urge my  colleagues to do the right thing and adopt this amendment and show the  American people that our government is not for sale.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
