 Mr. President, I rise to congratulate Mr. Ray  Petersen on a remarkable career of indispensable service to the great  State of Utah. By virtue of Ray's enduring commitment to overseeing  proper land management practices, Emery County flourishes with beauty  and opportunity. The residents of Emery County and the countless  visitors who enjoy the region have Ray to thank for his 18 years as  Emery County's Public Lands Administrator and his lifetime of public  service to rural Utah.   Ray has dedicated his career to addressing critical rural issues. As  a fourth-generation resident of Emery County, Ray understands well the  challenges facing rural communities and the profound impact that  Federal, State, and local policy decisions have on the livelihoods of  so many. In his role as Emery County Public Lands Administrator, Ray  was consequential in assisting policymakers, from the county commission  to the Federal Government, reconcile differences and find solutions for  the county's land management, whose expansive plans fall heavily under  State and Federal domain.   Sustained opportunity and access to Emery County's lands are  paramount for its economic vitality, particularly to its agriculture,  recreation and tourism industries, and its local mining, gas, and oil  development. Ray has helped these key local industries navigate the  challenges and opportunities of land management issues, to find  compromise and success.   A fitting final accomplishment to his career, Ray was instrumental in  helping Utah's congressional delegation secure a victory for Emery  County and the State's public lands as the Emery County Public Lands  Management Act was signed into law. This legislation marked the  culmination of years of collaboration and cooperation with local  partners and officials, ensuring ongoing uses will be enjoyed in Emery  County without fear of a potential national monument designation from  DC and consolidation of Utah trust lands that will generate millions in  revenue for our school kids. It also included long-sought local land  transfers to meet city government needs while expanding Goblin Valley  State Park, a truly unique place that will now be better managed for  future generations.   Ray Petersen has championed rural lands issues of extraordinary  significance to Utah throughout his esteemed career. Our great State  owes him a debt of gratitude for three decades of selfless public  service.   Thank you, Ray.                            ____________________
