 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Red  Raiders of Texas Tech and a new standard of excellence in west Texas.   Sports teaches us a lot about the game of life. It teaches us that  anything worth doing is worth working hard for. It teaches us the  virtue of competition, the value of setting ambitious goals, and the  necessity of making sacrifices to achieve them.   Through sports, we learn how to work as a team, how to be resilient  in the face of adversity, and how to display grace in victory as well  as defeat.   No one embodies these traits better than Coach Beard and the Texas  Tech men's basketball team who have earned their first trip to the  Final Four.   Coach Beard says the tough times pass, but the tough people last. Let  me tell you, these Red Raiders are as tough as west Texas.   To the team, listen to the coach: Four to one, four parts mental, one  part physical.   To my fellow Americans, get your guns up because Texas Tech is in  Minneapolis, and we are coming home with the national championship.   Go Tech.                            ____________________
