 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 876, the Aviation Employee  Screening and Security Enhancement Act for 2017.   Mr. Speaker, last month, the Transportation Security Administration  issued a directive prohibiting travelers flying out of 10 airports in  eight countries from carrying laptops and other large electronic  devices aboard airplanes. That decision was informed by intelligence  that ISIS and other terrorist organizations may have developed  innovative ways to plant explosives in electronic devices that TSA may  not be able to detect. This swift action highlights the importance of  TSA's being able to adapt quickly in response to the ever-evolving  terrorist threat landscape.   Here, in the United States, we have been fortunate that there has  never been a case where an airport worker has exploited their position  to carry out a deadly attack on an airport, but we have seen such  incidents abroad.   Accordingly, Congress has given particular attention to the airport  insider threat risk, and, in the 114th Congress, we enacted measures to  enhance access controls at airports and improve security vetting for  airport workers.                                time  1715    Today, we consider H.R. 876, a bill that seeks to address this risk  by requiring TSA to carry out a cost and feasibility study of  incorporating new approaches to bolster access controls to a diverse  range of airports.   In an effort to help airports better understand the effectiveness of  their current airport worker screening systems, the measure also  directs TSA to increase covert testing of such systems.   One feature of the bill that I want to highlight is a provision  targeted at fostering greater vigilance and awareness among airport  workers regarding the insider threat risk.   Specifically, it directs TSA to work with airport operators, air  carriers, and unions to develop insider threat security awareness  training for airport workers within 180 days of enactment of the bill.   H.R. 876, which was introduced in February and approved by the full  committee in March, has bipartisan support, including the support of  Representative Bonnie Watson Coleman, the top-ranking Democrat on the  Homeland Security Committee's Transportation Security Subcommittee.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 876, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1372, the Homeland  Security for Children Act.   Mr. Speaker, children are not tiny adults, as was stated, but too  often that is how the Federal policy treats them when there is not a  deliberate effort to do otherwise.   The Department of Homeland Security, through its components,  interacts with children regularly, and its policies have a direct  impact on them. That is why I introduced H.R. 1372, the Homeland  Security for Children Act.   H.R. 1372 would make integrating the unique needs of children a  priority at the Department of Homeland Security. The bill directs the  DHS Under Secretary for Strategy, Policy, and Plans to solicit and  incorporate feedback from children's organizations into Department-wide  policies and activities.   Additionally, H.R. 1372 would formally authorize the existing  children's technical expert position at the Federal Emergency  Management Agency. The position was established by former Administrator  Fugate in response to a March 2015 recommendation by the FEMA National  Advisory Council.   At the time, the National Advisory Council had concluded that FEMA  had made progress integrating the unique needs of children into  disaster plans since Hurricane Katrina, despite the fact that it did  not have a technical lead to emphasize and address children's issues.  As a result, State and local governments and emergency managers were  unaware of guidance related to children's needs at the State and local  level, leaving children vulnerable.   According to Save the Children, 80 percent of the National Commission  on Children and Disasters' recommendations from 2010 still remain open.  Whatever progress has been made in integrating the needs of children in  disasters, it is clear there is still work left to be done.   H.R. 1372 will ensure FEMA and DHS has the expertise necessary to do  its part to ensure the unique needs of children are integrated into  relevant activities, plans, and policies.   The legislation has been endorsed by Save the Children, and former  Administrator Fugate has said he supports efforts to authorize the  children's needs technical expert at FEMA.   Mr. Speaker, the Homeland Security for Children Act is commonsense,  bipartisan legislation that will ensure that the needs of the most  vulnerable among us are adequately integrated into homeland security  and disaster policies planning.   I would like to just state, Mr. Speaker, that this bill has been a  long time coming. I was just reminded of its importance by a program  that I watched on television the other day about the tornadoes in  Oklahoma, where we lost 7 children in a school building that fell. It  showed the disarray in the rest of the parents being able to be  reunited with their children. This is a timely bill.   Before I yield back, I would like to thank Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member DeFazio  for agreeing to exchange letters to expedite consideration of H.R. 1372  on the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, 100,000 people in South Sudan are at risk of  starvation. Turmoil in the country could push another 5.5 million  people into life-threatening hunger by summer. This hunger crisis in  Sudan is manmade, the result of a civil war that has decimated the  agriculture and destroyed the economy, and it will take humanitarian  action to fix it.   I am proud to be a cosponsor of H. Res. 187, introduced by  Congresswoman Karen Bass. This resolution aids the people of South  Sudan by increasing emergency assistance to address the famine, and it  calls on the Government of South Sudan to allow unrestricted  humanitarian access to displaced and starving populations.   I urge my colleagues to pass this resolution. It is essential that  the South Sudanese Government and opposition forces cease their  inhumane blocking of humanitarian workers and permit the delivery of  assistance to the South Sudanese. Millions of lives are at stake.   As my late father, Donald Payne, the Member in this seat prior to me,  fought for this Nation to exist over a decade of work here in the  Congress, to now see what is going on, he was able to get the situation  in Darfur labeled a genocide. I hope the next generation of Paynes does  not have to do the same thing in South Sudan.
