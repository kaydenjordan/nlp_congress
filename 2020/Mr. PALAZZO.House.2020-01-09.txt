 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this  resolution.   Let's be clear with the American people: Democrats wrote this bill  before being briefed by senior intelligence officials on the strike  that eliminated Soleimani, a well-known terrorist.   At the end of the day, we all know that this man was responsible for  the death of thousands of individuals, including over 600 American  servicemembers. President Trump was absolutely right to respond and  acted within his constitutional authority to protect American citizens.  He owes no one an apology. Feelings can be healed, but dead Americans  cannot be resurrected.   My question for those on the other side of the aisle who are hellbent  on undermining this President over political differences is: How many  more Americans did you want to die before President Trump acted?   Let's reflect. President Obama authorized over 540 drone strikes,  killing over 3,700 people and more than 320 civilians. Not a single one  was authorized by Congress.   As a veteran and member of our United States military, I am ashamed  of the behavior I am witnessing now. Our military deserves better, and  so do the American people. During a time when our country should unite  behind our Commander in Chief, this resolution turns us against  ourselves. I support our men and women in uniform and hope my  colleagues on the left will come to their senses to do the same.
