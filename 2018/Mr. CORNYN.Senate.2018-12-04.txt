 Mr. President, I join my friend, the Senator from  Tennessee, in saying a few words about the service of George Herbert  Walker Bush. I would note the difference between him and me, though, is  he, having served as Education Secretary and worked here under Howard  Baker and having had a chance to work with and watch and listen to  George Herbert Walker Bush firsthand, has the advantage over me.   I certainly know the Bush family and President Bush ``41'' from my  experience in Texas. They were the dominant family and influence in  politics in Texas--certainly during the time I grew up in politics.   I appreciate the comments the Senator from Tennessee has made. He and  I had a conversation about what our side of the aisle needs, which is  to do more in the area of supporting public education and which is, I  think, probably at the top of the list of most people's concerns.    Certainly, when you look at what happened in the midterm elections-- particularly in the suburbs--and you talk to people about what  motivated them one way or the other, education had to be way up high on  that list. We simply need to find a way of working together and coming  up together with creative ways to demonstrate our support for public  education, and I think our constituents will respond very well to that.   Certainly, the Senator from Tennessee, as chairman of the Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, who is responsible for a lot  of the healthcare-oriented legislation that emanates from this body-- and that is another area where, frankly, we didn't do as good a job as  we could or should have done, explaining what we were for and what we  could do actually to help bring premiums down and make healthcare more  accessible. So I appreciate the contributions of the Senator from  Tennessee to this body and his comments particularly about this great  man. I think it is important to say he was not just a great man but a  good man, George Herbert Walker Bush.   We know, to his family, he was a loving and caring father,  grandfather, and great-grandfather. To his country, he was a devoted  public servant who fought to defend our freedoms and led the Nation at  the end of the Cold War and at the fall of the Berlin Wall.   Every time I think about the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, I think  about my dad who was a B-17 pilot in World War II. He was shot down on  his 26th bombing mission over Nazi Germany. He was stationed in  Molesworth, England. He and his fellow crew in the 303rd Bomb Group in  the Eighth Air Force would fly their bombing missions from England--in  this case, Molesworth Air Force Base across the English Channel and  drop their bombs in Germany in an effort to bring an end to that  terrible, terrible war.   Unfortunately, my dad died before the Berlin Wall came down. That is  one of my regrets; that he was unable to see what ultimately happened  as a result of that terrible war in World War II. One expert--I read  one of his books recently--calculated that 31 million people died in  World War II. It is a shocking number. We need to be reminded of what  the horrible wages of war can be--20 million people died in the Soviet  Union alone. I know that staggers our imagination. We need to remember  our history or, in the words of a wise man, we will be condemned to  relive it. Certainly, George Herbert Walker Bush's contribution to  ending the Cold War and bringing down the Berlin Wall are one of his  most notable achievements.   He served first as a war hero. He actually enlisted in the Navy after  the attack at Pearl Harbor. He, like a lot of other young men, decided  this was the time to come to the aid of their country. After nearly  losing his life after being shot down but being saved by rescuing  forces, he came back home and, like so many of the ``greatest  generation,'' he went to work and raised a family.   In my dad's case, he, too, was part of the ``greatest generation.''  Fortunately, he got out of the prisoner of war camp and met my mother  and married and had a family. He continued his education and, like so  many of the ``greatest generation,'' made enormous contributions to  this country in the post-World War II era that we are benefiting from  even today.   We also know George Herbert Walker Bush represented his fellow  Americans starting as a Congressman in Houston, TX. Then he moved on to  be Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. He was Vice President.  He was President.   It has been said that George Herbert Walker Bush was the best  prepared person ever to have served as President by virtue of his  experience and his resume. I think there is a lot of truth to that.   Alluding to the time in the Navy, you can say he was an anchor for  our country during tumultuous times--steady and strong.   While he was a fierce defender of his principles and ideals, he was  sometimes seen as a quiet soldier. Some people even commented that he  was too nice a person to be President. I think that is a misconception.  He was, it is true, both a good man and a great leader, but I think he  showed us you could be both. Not all great leaders are good men. We are  all flawed, of course, but he showed that you could be both a good man  and a great leader.   President Bush carried the lessons he learned in the Navy with him.  Specifically, we heard from the Vice President yesterday at the  ceremony in the Rotunda talking about a concept known to Navy pilots as  the acronym CAVU, which stands for ``ceiling and visibility  unlimited.'' I only mention this again after the Vice President talked  about it yesterday because President Bush mentioned it on his 80th  birthday. He said it summed up his attitude about his life perfectly.   He said:         But, you see, that is where my life is now. Thanks to my       family and my friends, my life is CAVU.    Through all he did, his compassion, his love of country, his basic  humanity, and strong optimism shone through, which made him such an  attractive political figure. One reason for his tremendous success was  because people liked him, and they believed in him. They believed he  was doing what he did for the right reasons.   After a long and tough campaign for his second term as President--a  campaign which he lost--he left a letter to newly elected President  Bill Clinton. There has been some social media circulating this letter,  but I think it is worth noting because it is a snapshot into his  character and the type of man he was.   He wrote to President Clinton:         Your success now is our country's success. I am rooting       hard for you.    It takes a big man to say that to your competitor after a tough,  losing campaign, but, again, this is a window into the character of a  good and great man. Just like everything else he did, it was gracious  and sincere. This letter conveyed the same sense of ``it is not about  me, it is about the country.'' In a word, it is about patriotism--a  word that embodies President Bush so well. He was the type of man who  makes us look at our own lives and ask, what more can I do for my  country and for my country men and women we all love?    After graduating from college, he went to Midland, TX. It was kind of  an improbable place to go in those days, but he wanted to get involved  in the oil business. Later, after his successes in Midland, TX, in the  Permian Basin, which continues to be one of the greatest reserves of  oil and gas in the United States, he went on to Houston and grew his  business and ultimately, as I said earlier, ran for Congress.   Even though Texas was an adopted home for him, Texans loved and  embraced him, as we did the entire Bush family. We were privileged to  have President Bush as one of our own. He once said: ``I am a Texan and  an American . . . what more could a man ask?'' I don't think anyone  could have said it better. Throughout his time in public service and  even afterward, he could have moved anywhere in the world, but he chose  to live his life in Texas and in  [[Page S7272]]  the warm embrace of the State and the people he loved.   President Bush felt a kindred spirit in Texas A&M University,  choosing it first to bear his legacy through his Presidential library  and a graduate school of government and public service and then later  to be his and Barbara Bush's final resting place. I think President  Bush identified with the university's unique culture, including its  inculcation of patriotic values and the emphasis it places on hard work  and public service.   President Bush taught us all that there is nothing more powerful in  life than the power of a good example. He challenged all of us, and he  still does by the standards he set for himself.   Joined today by my colleague from Texas, Senator Cruz, we introduced  a resolution recognizing the nearly 30 years of public service  President Bush devoted to our State and our Nation.   President Bush is in the Nation's Capital one last time, where many  have and will continue to have the opportunity to pay their respects  and give their thanks for his extraordinary life.   President Bush once wrote in a letter to his mother: ``Tell the  truth. Don't blame people. Be strong. Do your best. Try hard. Forgive.  Stay the course.'' President Bush never chose the easy road to  sacrifice doing what he thought was just and right. In the words of  Scripture, he fought the good fight, he finished the race, and he kept  the faith.   In his book ``All the Best,'' he writes that he wanted a plain  gravestone like the ones in Arlington Cemetery, with his Navy number on  the back. He also requested that a quotation be placed there as well:  ``He loved Barbara very much.'' This is the man he was. I know he has  gone on to join the love of his life, Barbara, and their daughter  Robin. A truly honorable and gracious man has gone home to God.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
