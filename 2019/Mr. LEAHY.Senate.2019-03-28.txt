 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I thought it was exceptionally good news  on Sunday that Special Counsel Robert Mueller did not implicate our  President in a criminal conspiracy with Russia to attack our elections.  The alternative, of course, would have been nothing short of  catastrophic for our Republic.   I also want to express my appreciation to Mr. Mueller and his team  for their service to our country for determining the facts of what  happened during what was an unprecedented attack on our democracy. This  investigation endured relentless attacks during its 22-month existence.  In fact, the investigation by Mr. Mueller was attacked 1,100 times by  President Trump alone during this time according to the New York Times.   These attacks may have tried to politicize and undermine Mr.  Mueller's investigation, but they didn't deter his course. Anybody that  knows Robert Mueller would know that he would not be intimidated by  anybody, Republican or Democrat. In fact, far from being deterred, Mr.  Mueller obtained 37 indictments, including against numerous close aides  of the President. That marks this special counsel's investigation as  one of the most productive and consequential in our history. The  American people and their representatives in Congress now deserve to  see the special counsel's work.   The oversight authority of this body is deeply rooted in the  Constitution. We would be derelict in our duties if we did not do  everything within our power to obtain a full report and its underlying  evidence. We already know from the 37 indictments, and from the  testimony received by the Judiciary Committee, that this investigation  has uncovered serious misconduct. We know the Trump campaign was  informed that Russia had stolen Democratic emails months before anybody  else. We know that a senior member of the campaign enthusiastically  accepted an offer from the Russian Government to provide  ``incriminating'' information on Hillary Clinton, and, afterward, he  and President Trump blatantly misrepresented that meeting. We know from  Roger Stone's indictment that the President was told about a coming  release of stolen emails, and the campaign asked Stone to keep them  apprised of developments with future releases. And we know that during  all of this, the President was hiding his pursuit of a lucrative  business deal in Moscow.   Now, these activities may not amount to a crime, but they certainly  amount to serious misconduct that reached the highest levels of the  campaign and this administration, and they certainly raise questions  about the President's baffling relationship with Russia and Vladimir  Putin. This relationship has been baffling to both Republicans and  Democrats.   That doesn't even touch on obstruction of justice. Attorney General  Barr's letter revealed that there is still nonpublic evidence of the  President's attempts to interfere with this investigation. The special  counsel did not conclude whether the President's obsessive interference  in this investigation qualifies as obstruction. Yet he stated that his  report does not exonerate the President--does not exonerate the  President. That is an extraordinary statement.   Apparently, Attorney General Barr believes there is insufficient  evidence to charge obstruction, but Mr. Barr also believes that it is  not obstruction for a President to interfere with an investigation by  exercising his Article II powers. Regardless, he believes that the only  mechanism for holding a sitting President accountable is through  Congress.   Let's accept all of that. I don't necessarily accept all of it, but  let's assume he is accurate in that. Then I would hope he would agree  that it is the judgment of Congress and of the American people that is  of the utmost importance in this moment. There is simply no  justification for hiding even a portion of the Mueller report. The  President has claimed it totally exonerates him.   With respect to the collusion investigation, grand jury secrecy can  be waived by the courts when there is a particular need that outweighs  the interest in secrecy. With respect to the obstruction investigation,  executive privilege cannot be used to hide evidence of a potential  crime. In fact, if you want to hide evidence of a potential crime under  executive privilege, all they have to do is look at a Supreme Court  case where that was tried called United States v. Richard Nixon. Any  claim would likely not survive a challenge under United States v.  Nixon. It is hard to imagine that such hypothetical claims were not  waived when administration witnesses talked to the special counsel's  office.  [[Page S2066]]    Transparency is really the touchstone of our democracy. Any attempt  to hide swaths of the Mueller report from public scrutiny is only going  to fuel suspicions that President Trump's Justice Department, which  represents not President Trump but all the United States, is instead  playing the role of President Trump's defense team. If no person,  however powerful, is truly above the law, then no person should be  permitted to conceal the results of such a critical national security  investigation from public view.   I hope that in the days and weeks ahead, the Senate has something to  say about that. Everyone, Republican and Democrat alike, has a stake in  knowing what is in that report and seeing the whole report. After  months and months of work and all the investigations, all the  indictments, and all the grand jury hearings, to say we have to rely on  just a four-page summary is not enough. I don't accept that. I would  hope that no Senator, Republican or Democrat, would accept it.   I note that the House of Representatives voted unanimously--every  Republican and every Democrat--to have the report released. I note that  when we tried to have a similar resolution here, it was blocked by the  Republican leader. I think the Republican leader should turn to all of  us and say: Let the American people know the facts.                                   H.R. 268    Madam President, I do not see anybody else seeking recognition. I  would note, on another matter, the disaster supplemental appropriations  legislation has been filed, and there will be discussions on that. The  House of Representatives has a bill which does a great deal for the  disaster relief for all Americans who were hurt by the recent disasters  in our country. I proposed some modification of it, which would include  all Americans and believe the House would have accepted it.   I am concerned now that we have before us a bill that excludes a  large number of Americans, those in Puerto Rico, people who served  nobly in our military and helped this country and other Americans. They  should not be excluded for whatever reason. So we will have a debate on  that next week.   I hope very soon, for the American people, that we can have an honest  and clear resolution that will bring relief to those who suffered from  disasters such as fires, hurricanes, and floods throughout our country.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Owen Gomory  from my office be granted floor privileges for the remainder of today.
