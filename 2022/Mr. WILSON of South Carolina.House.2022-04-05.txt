 Mr. Speaker, the civilized world is  shocked at the discovery of mass murder by Putin in Bucha, Ukraine.   It is inspiring the leadership of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and  the immediate responses by Germany to Italy for expelling Putin's  murder-complicit diplomats.   With innocent civilians discovered having their hands tied behind  their backs, shot in the head, it is clear, war criminal Putin must be  stopped with immediate military aid.   Biden is correct to recognize this as part of the worldwide conflict  of democracy with rule of law versus autocracy with rule of gun.   An undisputed atrocity is the Putin murder of the mayor of Motyzhyn  and her family.   I have faith in the Russian people with a great culture betrayed by  the war criminal, Putin. There is legislation for defecting Russian  troops, diplomats, and Duma members to be provided expedited refugee  status to America and up to $100,000 for any Russian military equipment  turned over to Ukraine.   Ukraine will achieve victory. God bless Ukraine. God save Ukraine.  Long live Volodymyr Zelenskyy.   Congratulations to Mayor Dan Rickenmann and the city of Columbia for  sending aid to Ukraine.                            ____________________
