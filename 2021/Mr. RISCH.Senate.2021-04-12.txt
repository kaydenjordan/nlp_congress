 Mr. President, as a senior member and former  chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and  Entrepreneurship, each month I recognize and celebrate the American  entrepreneurial spirit by highlighting the success of a small business  in my home State of Idaho. Today I am pleased to honor Dave's Bike Shop  in Idaho Falls as the Idaho Small Business of the Month for April 2021.   Dave's Bike Shop is a family-owned small business located in historic  downtown Idaho Falls. Founded by longtime biking enthusiasts David and  Emily Wilding, the couple saw a need for a bike shop in their local  community and found a small space in the historic downtown area. After  months of renovations, they opened their doors in September of 2011.   Since its founding, Dave's Bike Shop has been a family effort. Dave  and Emily's four sons have been an integral part of the shop's success,  working after school and through the summers to finish two extensive  building remodels and assist in day-to-day sales and service. Through  the Wilding family's hard work, the business grew and sales increased  with each successive year, enabling Dave and Emily to relocate to a  larger facility and expand their services.   Like other small businesses across Idaho, Dave's Bike Shop had to  adapt to the challenges of the pandemic. When global shutdowns closed  factories and limited access to their supply chain, the business  quickly changed its procurement strategy by sourcing new products from  other manufacturers and placing larger orders whenever possible.  Despite these obstacles, the shop has remained successful and continues  to serve the Idaho Falls community.   Congratulations to Dave, Emily, and all of the employees of Dave's  Bike Shop on being selected as the Idaho Small Business of the Month  for April 2021. You make our great State proud, and I look forward to  your continued growth and success.                            ____________________
