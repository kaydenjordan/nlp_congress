This division is designated as an emergency requirement       pursuant to section 4(g) of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act       of 2010 (2 U.S.C. 933(g)).       SEC. 5202. DESIGNATION IN SENATE.         In the Senate, this division is designated as an emergency       requirement pursuant to section 403(a) of S. Con. Res. 13       (111th Congress), the concurrent resolution on the budget for       fiscal year 2010.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill, as amended, shall be debatable for  1 hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority  member of the Committee on Appropriations.   The gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Frelinghuysen) and the gentlewoman  from New York (Mrs. Lowey) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to present H.R. 4667, a bill making  emergency appropriations for hurricane and wildfire recovery.   Parts of our Nation have been devastated by multiple back-to-back  hurricanes and wildfires that have caused tremendous loss of life,  livelihoods, and property.   Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria are three of the top five most  expensive hurricanes in the last 25 years. Combined with the horrific  wildfires that continue to rage in California, the toll that these  disasters have taken is unprecedented.   We must stand by our fellow Americans to get them the help and  resources they need to recover. To this end, this legislation provides  a total of $81 billion for crucial Federal programs that support  ongoing relief, recovery, and rebuilding.   This includes $27.5 billion for FEMA to provide relief and recovery  assistance; $26.1 billion for Community Development Block Grants for  shelter and housing and infrastructure improvements, and the means to  help large and small businesses recover; and $12.1 billion for the Army  Corps of Engineers to repair and rebuild infrastructure projects that  help protect against future disasters, building in resiliency.   The bill also includes $3.8 billion for the Department of  Agriculture, which will support critical agriculture disaster  assistance for massive crop and livestock loss.   Funding is also included to repair Federal highways and local transit  systems, to help children displaced by the storms of Puerto Rico get  back to school, and for small business disaster loans, which will allow  businesses to reopen their doors as quickly as possible.   Our Committee on Appropriations will continue to monitor these  recovery efforts to ensure accountability, transparency, and that every  dollar is spent wisely. From Florida and Texas, to Puerto Rico and the  U.S. Virgin Islands, to California, and all areas dealing with major  disaster declarations, this Congress is committed to helping you.   Congress has already provided $51.75 billion in two separate  supplemental bills for these ongoing efforts. With this third tranche  of emergency funding, it will bring the total funding for fiscal year  2018 emergency response to $132 billion. This funding is desperately  needed by thousands of American families, individuals, and communities  to rebuild their homes and businesses, restore electric power and  critical infrastructure, and to protect against further damage. It is  the duty of Congress to provide this help to our fellow Americans in  their times of need.   Mr. Speaker, before I close, I would like to thank everyone who came  to leadership and to the Appropriations Committee to make sure that  Congress is getting the assistance to those hurricane and wildfire  victims that they urgently need.   I would also like to thank the clerks and professional staff and the  chairs of the 12 Appropriations Subcommittees for their working  tirelessly to bring this bill to the floor and, may I say, nearly 30  others this year.   It is time to get this emergency aid to those who need it. I urge my  colleagues to support this bill and this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Culberson), the chairman of the Commerce, Justice, and  Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to  the gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to  the gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to  the gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Carter), the chairman of the Homeland Security  Subcommittee on Appropriations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to  the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to  the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Calvert), chairman of the Interior, Environment,  and Related Agencies Subcommittee on Appropriations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart), the chairman of the Transportation,  Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.   Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Speaker, let me first thank the chairman of the  committee for his spectacular work on this bill.   Look, this bill provides much-needed relief and resources to Texas,  Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands, California, and Puerto Rico. I have  heard a lot in this debate, but let's be very clear. This bill treats  Florida, the folks in Florida, Texas, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin  Islands, and California exactly the same--exactly the same.   Significant portions, Mr. Speaker, of my district were hit hard by  Hurricane Irma. Communities are still working to get back on their  feet, communities like Everglades City, Chokoloskee, Plantation Island,  Immokalee, and Montura Ranch.   This bill helps meet our Federal obligation to ensure the full,  appropriate Federal commitment is there for long-term recovery.   Mr. Speaker, for highways, this bill funds repairs for the 2017  storms and clears the backlog of prior years.   On the housing side, this bill provides $26.1 billion for Community  Development Block Grants. Of that, $13.6 billion is provided to meet  all remaining unmet housing, business, and infrastructure needs for  those hurricanes, and, yes, that includes the Virgin Islands and Puerto  Rico.   The remaining $12.5 billion is provided for mitigation grants, again,  also to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands and Florida and California  and Texas. All of those are treated exactly the same. So, again, these  grants provide resources to our communities so that they can rebuild.   Additionally, I am pleased that $3.8 billion is allocated for the  Department of Agriculture. This will go a long way to help those  affected, those farmers, like the ag industry and the citrus industry  in the State of Florida.   So, again, I strongly urge a ``yes'' vote on this important  supplemental.   I once again want to thank the chairman, Chairman Frelinghuysen, for  his leadership, for his courage, for bringing forward a good bill that  helps the folks in our country and that treats everybody equally,  equitably, and fairly.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster), the chairman of the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Louisiana (Mr. Graves), the chairman of the Water Resources and  Environment Subcommittee of the Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis).   Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, my congratulations go out  to Chairman Frelinghuysen and to Chairman Shuster for putting these  FEMA reforms into law that were long overdue. I thank the gentlemen for  their support.   I rise in support of H.R. 4667, the critical disaster assistance  legislation to help those affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and  Maria this year.   I have said on the floor of this House numerous times that I believe  it is important for Congress to come together when disaster strikes to  help those impacted. Helping our fellow Americans after a disaster is  the right thing to do.   And, don't forget, you never know when a disaster may hit your State.  That is why I am thankful to Chairman Frelinghuysen and Chairman  Shuster for including language important to my home State of Illinois  in this bill. My bill, the Disaster Declaration Improvement Act,  requires FEMA to place greater weight and consideration on the severe,  localized impact of the damage following a disaster.                                time  1530    I want to thank my colleague, Congresswoman Cheri Bustos, for working  with me on this bipartisan bill.   FEMA currently takes into account several factors when determining  the need for public and individual assistance. However, there is no  standard to determine which factor is more important than another,  which leads to a highly subjective process, and one that has left rural  counties in very populated States, like Illinois, left without help  from the Federal Government.   It is because one major factor used by FEMA is a State's population.  Currently, FEMA multiplies a State's population by $1.39 to use it for  the threshold to determine need, meaning, for Illinois to receive  assistance, damages would have to be $18 million or more.   As you can see by this chart, that is more than or nearly double that  of all  [[Page H10391]]  of our neighboring States. There have been multiple times where a storm  hits both Illinois and our neighbors, but Illinois is the only one  denied assistance.   One of the most recent examples is, 2 years ago this Christmas, flood  damage throughout 16 counties cost $15 million in damages. Missouri,  who was also impacted by this same storm, received assistance, but  Illinois did not.   This is wrong. My constituents pay into the Disaster Relief Fund to  help other States. It should be there when they need it.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from California (Mrs. Mimi Walters).   Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, California is  experiencing the worst fire season in its history. Tragically, these  fires have taken 46 lives, including one of our brave Cal Fire  firefighters, Cory Iverson.   California has lost nearly 10,000 homes and structures since the  start of the October wildfires. The need for relief and assistance is  immediate.   Mr. Speaker, I support the swift passage of the Emergency Disaster  Aid Package, which includes legislation I introduced, the California  Wildfire Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2017.   These specific provisions will allow victims to deduct property  damages and access retirement funds without penalty, as well as  encourage charitable giving.   Passage of this bill will help mitigate the burden of these  devastating wildfires and allow people to begin rebuilding their lives.   Mr. Speaker, California faces a long road to recovery and rebuild  from this devastating fire season. I urge my colleagues to aid in that  recovery by voting for the Emergency Disaster Aid Package.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from New Jersey (Mr. Smith).   Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for  yielding time to me and for his tremendous bill. It is a great  bipartisan piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, after Superstorm Sandy, I and others saw how leaders and  volunteers of churches, synagogues, and other religious centers helped  feed, clothe, and shelter tens of thousands of victims, yet they were  left out and left behind when it came to repairs of their own  facilities.   The FEMA policy was and is unfair, unjustified, and discriminatory.  Over 4 years ago, the House came together in the wake of Superstorm  Sandy and passed legislation that I authored by 354-72. Surprise,  surprise, the Senate never acted, so the policy continues to this day.   I want to thank the chairman for including a provision in this bill  that will ensure that houses of worship, churches, and synagogues get  the kind of help they need on an equal basis with other nonprofits. I  also want to thank him for including language that will get rid of this  misnamed duplication of benefits clause.   Imagine this: men and women who are victimized by Superstorm Sandy or  any other storm, they go to FEMA, they are advised to take out an SBA  loan, then a little later in the recovery time, they are told that  there is a HUD grant available, and they are precluded from getting  that grant to even pay off the SBA loan.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Rutherford).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from California (Mr. McCarthy), the majority leader.   Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to  me and for his work.   Mr. Speaker, it is only 4 days until Christmas. I look forward to  going home and being with my family. I know every single Member in this  body looks forward to that, too. I count my blessings that my family is  safe and that I have a community and home to head back to.   There are people in this country who don't have that. Their homes  were destroyed by wind, flood, and fires. Their communities were torn  apart by hurricanes and flames.   Mr. Speaker, I had the somber privilege of traveling to these places.  I went to Texas and spent time with Members from both sides of the  aisle, seeing the flooded homes and streets filled with water. We  visited NRG Stadium to meet the people forced to evacuate their homes.   I stood with Representatives like Sheila Jackson Lee, Al Green, Randy  Weber, and Brian Babin. These folks don't often agree on much in  politics. But you know what we did that day? We all promised to help  the people of Texas.   I flew to the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico with Minority Whip Steny  Hoyer, and I would like to thank Delegate Stacey Plaskett and Resident  Commissioner Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon for welcoming us and opening the  eyes of the Nation to what was happening.   In the Virgin Islands, we visited a hospital. The storm left half of  it unusable. No dialysis machines. They had to come to the mainland.  Nurses and doctors were working, doing the best they could to help  people in the most difficult of circumstances.   In Puerto Rico, we were the first congressional delegation to visit  the interior after the storm. We were with Members like Jeff Denham,  Anthony Brown, and Norma Torres. We met people without power for weeks,  low on food, low on medicine. We saw schools and homes destroyed and  completely washed away.   We then went to Florida to see the other towns hit by Hurricane Irma,  places that face storms year after year.   I returned to my home State of California with Congressmen Mike  Thompson and Jared Huffman during the worst wildfire season our State  has ever seen. We saw the fires rage up north, where it destroyed  entire communities. Forty-six people have lost their lives in the fires  in California this year.   You could see the devastation, block after block. Ash heaps of homes  and trees, standing like barren pillars.   I met with firefighters down south, still battling what may become  the largest wildfire in California's history. As it looks right now,  they will still be standing on the front lines of those fires come  Christmas day.   Every single place I went, Democrats and Republicans stood together.  We saw the devastation together. We spoke to the suffering that the  people were having together, and together we made a promise that we  would return here to Washington and work hand-in-hand to help them as  soon as possible.   That is why you heard Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, on September 26, say  that he would ``work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  ensure Congress provides all funding necessary to ensure that all  Americans affected by these storms can recover and rebuild.''   That is why he said on November 2 that he believes ``we can work  together in a bipartisan way to ensure that the affected areas receive  the resources they need from Congress.''  [[Page H10392]]    That is why I appreciated joining him in an op-ed piece that was in  The Washington Post on November 8, where we wrote: ``We are determined  to ensure that there is strong bipartisan support for the next  supplemental emergency funding package so that affected areas, such as  those we visited, have the resources they need.''   Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi spoke similarly. She signed a letter  with Members across California saying to President Trump that: We look  forward to working with you to ensure that all Americans who have been  severely impacted by recent natural disasters across the United States  receive the Federal support they need and deserve.   She told the Appropriations Committee that: Congress has an urgent  responsibility to the California families, whose lives have been  upended by disastrous wildfires.   I couldn't agree more with these statements. In the past few weeks  and months, we did--we worked together. We analyzed the damage. We  studied the requests from Governors and legislators. We even made  significant reforms to respond to disaster in the most effective and  responsible way possible.   The legislation today is the result. It provides funding for every  single State and territory affected by natural disasters.   I remind all my friends from California that this legislation  accommodates exactly what our entire delegation requested.   In all this work, we did it together in a bipartisan way; the way the  American people expect this body to work.   Now, I know it is the habit of this town to play politics. Mr.  Speaker, I do want to tell my friends on the other side: If they feel  like they have to, play politics on tax cuts. Call it whatever you want  to call it. Play politics on all the other legislation that comes to  this floor.   But if I can request one thing: Please don't do it here. Don't play  politics on a vote to give aid to the people of Texas; to the people of  Puerto Rico; to the people of the Virgin Islands; to the people of  Florida, and to the people of California, who are still fighting the  fires.   Don't play politics on a bill that you are going to hope to maybe  stop another. That would be the worst of any politics I have seen  played here.   Mr. Speaker, I beg my friends on the other side: Please don't do what  they did 2 weeks ago when they whipped against the funding bill to shut  the government down. If they don't like tax cuts, I understand;  vot against them. If they don't want to vote for the funding of the  government and they want to shut it down, fine, take that vote.    But here and now, right before Christmas, don't vote against aid for  Americans who just lost everything. They don't understand the politics  in it. Don't vote against aid we promised to deliver. Don't vote  against aid we worked so hard together to put on this floor.   Washington, D.C., can be far from our homes. We may all be dreaming  of being home with our kids, eating Christmas dinner, opening presents,  and enjoying time with our family and friends; but what we do here and  now has consequences. What we do here and now will either give tens of  thousands of people something to hope for this Christmas, or take that  hope away.   We can deliver that hope if those who stood with me on the flood  plains of Texas and on the burnt hills of California keep the promise  they made. We can deliver that hope if those who worked with us for so  long continue to work with us today.   People need our help. Vote to give them the help they need, the help  we all promised.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to address their  remarks to the Chair.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, this bill--put together after eight public hearings,  input from all Governors, all Members of Congress, and all Delegates,  especially those who represent Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Puerto Rico,  the Virgin Islands, and California--represents a fair and a  compassionate treatment of all hurricane and fire victims.   Like the first two emergency supplementals put together by our  leadership, our committee, and Congress, we acted within days to help.  I ask that we do it again this afternoon without delay. Get this $81  billion disaster package into the hands of the States, the territories,  and the communities that continue to suffer.   Let me associate myself with the remarks of our majority leader.  Let's get the money into those communities that have been suffering.  That money is going to the Virgin Islands, it is going to Puerto Rico,  and it is going to Florida, Texas, and California. There has been no  discrimination at all.   This bill has been put together with the cooperation of all the  chairs and ranking members, and it deserves to be acted on promptly.  People are suffering. Let's get the money out the door to help them as  we have done in the past on the first two supplementals.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of Division B of this  bill, which has bipartisan, bicameral support of the leadership of the  Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of  Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental  Affairs of the Senate. It includes H.R. 4460, the ``Disaster Recovery  Reform Act'', and several other Federal Emergency Management Agency  (FEMA) bills that passed the House earlier this year.   While there are many good provisions in Division B, I will focus my  comments on a few provisions that I believe will have the most impact  in making the United States a leader in disaster recovery. Under  Division B, the Nation will be on the right track to build stronger and  more resilient communities and it will encourage better behavior before  and after disaster strikes.   We know that for every dollar invested in mitigation to make our  communities stronger before disaster strikes, the taxpayer saves $3 to  $4 in future disaster costs. Section 2036 of this bill furthers the  goal of investing in mitigation before disaster strikes by establishing  a steady funding stream for FEMA's Predisaster Mitigation (PDM)  program.   Under Section 2036, the President must provide a specific amount of  additional funding from the Disaster Relief Fund for the PDM program.  The specific amount of additional funding is equal to six percent of  the estimated amount of disaster assistance provided for each major  disaster. The President will then distribute these funds in accordance  with existing law, with a certain amount provided to each State and the  remainder made available through a competitive grant process.   Section 2036 uses language similar to language in the Robert T.  Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act)  authorizing FEMA's Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP), which is  mandatory funding provided post-disaster with each disaster  declaration. Although Section 2036 uses the term ``may'', the intent is  that FEMA will set aside funds for the PDM program, just as they do for  HMGP. We have had several bipartisan conversations with FEMA confirming  that FEMA understands the intent of this section and will interpret the  ``may set-aside'' language included in section 2036 as mandatory. The  mandatory funding for the PDM program from the Disaster Relief Fund  required under this section will provide consistency to a program with  a proven record of saving taxpayers money.   In addition, section 2036 authorizes FEMA to withdraw and  redistribute funds that remain unobligated three fiscal years after  FEMA awarded the funds to the grantee. The intent of this provision is  to provide FEMA with discretionary authority to move funding that is  not being used to States and projects that will use it. However, FEMA  is not required to withdraw these funds from grantees and shall make  these decisions on a case-by-case basis. For instance, a grantee may  have commenced work on a project or is actively working on a project  but the project is not at the point where funds need to be obligated.  In this instance, we would not expect FEMA to withdraw the funds.   In addition, while this section will apply to PDM funds awarded prior  to enactment of this Division, the intent is to give grantees three  fiscal years from the date of enactment of this Act to obligate these  funds. Grantees with existing PDM funds are now on notice that they  have three years to obligate these funds or at least be actively  working on projects that will allow those funds to be obligated shortly  thereafter.   I have noted time and time again how nonsensical it is that the  Federal Government pays to rebuild communities after a disaster to  inadequate standards only to have those facilities destroyed again by a  later disaster, with the Federal Government once again on the hook for  the cost of rebuilding. Under this legislation, this nonsense will  finally stop. Section 2037 requires communities to rebuild to the  latest consensus-based, design standards and in a more resilient  manner, thereby ensuring stronger, smarter facilities going forward.  The cycle of repeatedly rebuilding and repairing disaster-damaged  public infrastructure will end under this measure.   Although FEMA must define ``resilient'' and ``resiliency'' pursuant  to regulations within two years of the date of enactment of this Act,  FEMA is required to adopt guidance to immediately implement the  ``resiliency'' requirements of this legislation. The need for resilient  construction has become even more apparent after the 2017 disaster  season. FEMA must use this opportunity to invest taxpayer funds wisely  while saving lives and reducing injuries. FEMA has the ability to  ensure that the United  [[Page H10394]]  States leads the way in disaster recovery and I urge FEMA to seize this  moment.   Accordingly, as FEMA works to develop the definition of ``resilient''  and ``resiliency'', the agency needs to ensure that it takes into  account the extent to which the improved facilities:   reduce deaths and injuries during and after a major disaster;   sustain minimal damage allowing the facility to continue to provide  the primary function and services of the facility during and after a  natural hazard;   prepare for and withstand all hazards that could result in a major  disaster; and   reduce the magnitude or duration of a disruption to the facility's  primary function and services to a facility.   In addition, any ``resilient'' facility should be constructed:   in consideration of current and future environmental conditions based  upon the best-available science, changes in demand, and extreme weather  events;   to reduce potential disruptions to the facility, including by  building in operational redundancies, and increasing the ability of the  facility to recover more rapidly; using techniques and materials that  have the absorptive capacity, adaptive capacity, and recoverability to  withstand a potentially disruptive event;   to the maximum extent practicable, using durable and sustainable  material; and   to incorporate, to the maximum extent practicable, natural and  nature-based measures and energy efficiency improvements.   Currently, FEMA provides HMGP funds when a State receives a disaster  declaration, but HMGP funds are not provided when a State receives a  Fire Management Assistance Grant to respond to wildfires on non-Federal  lands. Unfortunately, wildfires destroy the landscape often causing  mudslides and flooding that then result in a disaster declaration.  Under Division B, States will receive HMGP funds if they have received  Fire Management Assistance Grants to respond to wildfires. With HMGP  funds, States will be able to restore landscapes and vegetation  destroyed by wildfires and make the land less susceptible to future  mudslides and floods. This legislation also clarifies that wildfire- related mitigation activities are eligible under both the PDM and HMGP  programs. Together, these provisions will help prevent wildfires and  related disasters and I commend our colleague from California (Mr.  Ruiz) for his leadership on these issues.   Division B also clarifies that earthquake-related activities are  eligible for mitigation assistance. The West Coast faces the most risk  from multiple and extreme earthquakes, and Oregon is long overdue for  an earthquake and tsunami on the Cascadia Subduction Zone. Yet, the  United States' earthquake early warning system lags behind those of  other nations. Clarifying for grantees that mitigation funds are  available for earthquake-related activities will save lives and reduce  injuries in a future disaster.   Finally, important to the State of Oregon, section 2029 clarifies  that for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), FEMA  is not responsible for privately funded actions taken by private  parties on private land. Under actions proposed by the National Marine  Fisheries Service, the entire State of Oregon would become a critical  habitat, seriously impeding economic development. The proposed  requirements, are so onerous, the State of Oregon, which already has  strict land use regulations, would have difficulty implementing them,  as they violate federal and state property rights. This provision will  help ensure that FEMA implements the NFIP in a manner that is  consistent from state-to-state and does not become a land use  regulatory agency.   I support all of these important provisions and urge their adoption.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.   Pursuant to House Resolution 670, the previous question is ordered on  the bill, as amended.   The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.

In the case of any amounts       redistributed under this subclause to a State that is not an       emergency shortfall State, such amounts shall be determined       in accordance with clause (i).        ``(II) Emergency shortfall state defined.--For purposes of       this clause, the term `emergency shortfall State' means, with       respect to a month beginning during the period beginning       October 1, 2017, and ending March 31, 2018, a shortfall State       for which the Secretary estimates, in accordance with       subparagraph (A) (unless otherwise specified in this       subclause) and on a monthly basis using the most recent data       available to the Secretary as of such month, that the       projected expenditures under the State child health plan and       under section 2105(g) (calculated as if the reference under       section 2105(g)(4)(A) to `2017' were a reference to `2018'       and insofar as the allotments are available to the State       under this subsection or subsection (e) or (m)) for such       month will exceed the sum of the amounts described in clauses       (i) through (iii) of subparagraph (A) for such month,       including after application of any amount redistributed under       paragraph (1) for a previous month for fiscal year 2018 in       accordance with this clause, to such State. A shortfall State       may be an emergency shortfall State under the previous       sentence without regard to whether any amounts were       redistributed to such State under paragraph (1) for a       previous month in fiscal year 2018.        ``(III) Funds redistributed in the order in which states       realize funding shortfalls.--The Secretary shall redistribute       the amounts available for redistribution under paragraph (1)       to emergency shortfall States described in subclause (II) in       the order in which such States realize monthly funding       shortfalls under this title for fiscal year 2018.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 670, the motion  shall be debatable for 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the  chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations.   The gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Frelinghuysen) and the gentlewoman  from New York (Mrs. Lowey) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to present the House amendment to the  Senate amendment to H.R. 1370.   This legislation keeps the government fully open, funds important  national security priorities, and temporarily extends critical  government programs like the Children's Health Insurance Program, the  National Flood Insurance Program, and section 702 of the Foreign  Intelligence Surveillance Act.   Our duty to the American people is to keep them secure and to ensure  they have access to the government programs and services they depend  on.   The House must pass this bill now, today.   Without acting on this bill, existing government funding will expire  tomorrow, and the government will shut down. This legislation provides  a simple, clean extension of current funding levels through January of  2018.   This additional time will allow House and Senate leadership to  complete their negotiations on overall spending levels. Once that is  determined, my committee will complete negotiations with the Senate on  all 12 appropriations bills for the rest of fiscal year 2018.   In the meantime, it is essential that Congress maintain government  programs and services--for our Nation's stability, the stability of our  economy, and for the security and well-being of the American people.   This bill also supports national security by providing an additional  $4.7 billion in emergency funding to bolster missile defense, to  protect against growing threats, and to repair damaged Navy ships.   In addition, the bill also includes $2.1 billion in mandatory funding  for the VA Choice Program. This funding will guarantee that our  veterans continue to have access to the medical care they need and  deserve.   Along with important funding for our Armed Forces and veterans, this  bill contains temporary extensions of several critical programs that  millions of Americans rely on. These include the Children's Health  Insurance Program, the National Flood Insurance Program, and section  702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.   Mr. Speaker, before I close, again, I would like to thank the 12  Appropriations chairs, our 12 clerks, and the very professional staff  of the Appropriations Committee for working overtime to bring this bill  and others before the House today.   We cannot delay on passing this critical legislation, funding the  government, protecting our Nation, and extending essential programs  that hardworking Americans rely on every day.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Oregon (Mr. Walden), the chairman of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Oregon (Mr. Walden), the chairman of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1  minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1  minute.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Tennessee (Mr. Roe), the chairman of the Veterans' Affairs  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote  ``yes'' to keep the government open for business, and I yield back the  balance of my time.   Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this  Continuing Resolution because we can't keep kicking the can down the  road, and that is all this CR will do.   Since Republicans took control of the House in 2011, their approach  to governing has been to pass short term extensions and Continuing  Resolutions that merely delay the hard work of making decisions on the  big issues facing our country.   Eventually, after not completing their work on time, Republicans  regularly force through an extension in order to deal with another  crisis of their own making. This has happened over . . . and over . . .  and over.   And here we go again. We passed a CR in September and another one two  weeks ago, and now we are being asked to give Republicans even more  time to get the job done.   Governing by repeated CRs means federal agencies can't plan for the  future or begin new initiatives. This undermines our national security;  endangers our homeland security, restricts investments in  groundbreaking research to treat and cure diseases, and threatens the  accuracy of the next decennial Census.   This repeated inaction means we must now worry about keeping our  government open at the same time we are trying to address several other  large national challenges. For example, we are about to hit the  nation's debt limit; Americans need help recovering from the hurricanes  that hit Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Florida, and Texas and the  wildfires that have ravaged California; people who depend on community  health centers and the Children's Health Insurance Program are about to  lose their healthcare; and we must protect the hundreds of thousands of  Dreamers whose immigration status has been thrown into question.   President Trump himself created this particular crisis for the  millions of Dreamers living in this country. These young men and women  are American in every way but their citizenship, and due to the  President's actions, nearly 13 thousand of them have lost their DACA  protections, an average of 122 per day. Tens of thousands more Dreamers  will eventually lose their jobs and their protection against  deportation if we do not take action.   As the author of the Dream Act in the House, I believe it is inhumane  to force Dreamers to live in fear and uncertainty for longer than  absolutely necessary. We must act now. We can't afford to wait until  the last minute for a solution, as Republicans have done so often while  running Congress.   We cannot keep kicking the can down the road. I oppose this CR and  urge my colleagues to vote no so we can get the job done now.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, this 15- minute vote on the motion will be followed by 5-minute votes on:   Passage of H.R. 4667;   The motion to suspend the rules and pass S. 1532; and   The motion to suspend the rules and pass S. 1766, if ordered.
