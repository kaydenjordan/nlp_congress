 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3094) to designate the National Pulse Memorial located at  1912 South Orange Avenue, Orlando, Florida, 32806, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3094         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF NATIONAL PULSE MEMORIAL.         (a) In General.--The Pulse Memorial located at 1912 South       Orange Avenue, Orlando, Florida, 32806, is designated as the       ``National Pulse Memorial''.        (b) Effect of Designation.--The national memorial       designated by this section is not a unit of the National Park       System and the designation of the National Pulse Memorial       shall not require or permit Federal funds to be expended for       any purpose related to that national memorial.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, on June 12, 2016, a gunman shot and killed 49 people  and injured 53 others in the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando,  Florida. It was the single deadliest known violent attack on the LGBTQ  community, the deadliest violent attack in America at that time, and an  attack on our Latino community, our African-American communities, and  so many others.   After this tragedy, our city came together. Doctors, first  responders, and friends rushed to save the wounded; others donated  funds, supplies, even their blood. Countless works of art, gifts, and  letters were left at impromptu memorial sites paying tribute to the  victims and survivors.   We came together in candlelight vigils across the globe to grieve and  remember. We became truly Orlando Strong in the face of adversity for  the whole world to see.   As we continue to honor 49 angels, we remind the world that love will  always conquer hate in the end. The designation of the Pulse nightclub  as a national memorial honors the lives taken, as well as the  survivors, first responders, and an entire central Florida community.  Together, we will open minds and hearts and make the Pulse Memorial a  national symbol of hope, love, and change.   I thank my Orlando area colleagues, Congresswoman Val Demings and  Congresswoman Stephanie Murphy, for joining me in leading this  important bipartisan legislation.
