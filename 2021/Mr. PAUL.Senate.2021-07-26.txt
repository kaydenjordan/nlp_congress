 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize Bird  Dogs Coffee, a family-owned small business in Owenton, KY, as the  Senate Small Business of the Week.   Located in the heart of Owenton, Kasey Craigmyle Towles opened Bird  Dogs Coffee in 2015. Kasey, who grew up in Owenton and was the founder  and operator of ``Kasey's Corner,'' a successful gift shop, decided to  pursue a different business venture that would uplift her hometown and  foster a sense of community. When Bird Dogs Coffee opened its door,  Kasey and her husband, Randy, were seizing the opportunity to fill a  gap in the Owenton market since there was not a coffee shop in town.  Together, Kasey and Randy created a welcoming cafe with delicious food,  friendly service, and a hospitable atmosphere.   Today, Bird Dogs Coffee has become a local favorite and has  consistently received high praise and glowing reviews in local and  regional publications for its outstanding service and homemade cuisine.  Bird Dogs Coffee welcomes customers from all over northern Kentucky by  providing a place for both locals and travelers to catch up over a cup  of coffee. Kasey and Randy host a number of events at their coffee  shop, including live music and wine and beer tastings. Moreover, Bird  Dogs Coffee provides a meeting space for local organizations like the  Owenton Rotary Club. Entrepreneurs at heart, Kasey and Randy have  continued seeking ways to grow their business while serving their  community. They have purchased buildings next to Bird Dogs Coffee's  original location and plan to open an event space and expanded gift  shop to meet the needs of their hometown.   Like many small business owners, Kasey and Randy are actively  involved in their community. Bird Dogs Coffee is a member of the Owen  County Chamber of Commerce and is an enthusiastic supporter of the Owen  County Tourism Commission. For several years, Bird Dogs Coffee has  sponsored Owen County School District sports teams and contributed to  multiple fundraisers for local organizations. Additionally, Kasey and  Randy regularly donate to Owen County Project Graduation, which  provides an alcohol- and drug-free graduation celebration for local  high school seniors. With Owen County High being close to their hearts,  Kasey and Randy are also actively involved with the Owen County High  School Alumni Association.   Bird Dogs Coffee is a remarkable example of how hard work, ingenuity,  and discipline can turn a dream into reality. Small businesses like  Bird Dogs Coffee form the heart of towns across Kentucky, regularly  stepping up to support their communities. Congratulations to Kasey,  Randy, and the entire team at Bird Dogs Coffee. I wish Bird Dogs Coffee  the best of luck and look forward to watching this small business's  continued growth and success in Kentucky.                            ____________________
