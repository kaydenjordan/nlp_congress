 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 440 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 440         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for further       consideration of the bill (H.R. 2810) to authorize       appropriations for fiscal year 2018 for military activities       of the Department of Defense and for military construction,       to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal       year, and for other purposes.        Sec. 2. (a) No further amendment to the bill, as amended,       shall be in order except those printed in the report of the       Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution and       amendments en bloc described in section 3 of this resolution.

(c) All points of order against the further amendments       printed in the report of the Committee on Rules or amendments       en bloc described in section 3 of this resolution are waived.        Sec. 3.  It shall be in order at any time for the chair of       the Committee on Armed Services or his designee to offer       amendments en bloc consisting of amendments printed in the       report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution       not earlier disposed of. Amendments en bloc offered pursuant       to this section shall be considered as read, shall be       debatable for 20 minutes equally divided and controlled by       the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Armed Services or their designees, shall not be subject to       amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand for division       of the question in the House or in the Committee of the       Whole.        Sec. 4.  At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for       amendment pursuant to this resolution the Committee shall       rise and report the bill to the House with such further       amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except       one motion to recommit with or without instructions.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Alabama is recognized for  1 hour.    Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Alabama?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 440 provides for a complete  consideration of H.R. 2810, the National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2018. The rule allows for consideration of 122 amendments  in addition to the amendments made in order by yesterday's rule.   This brings the total number of amendments made in order for full  consideration to 210. When you add in the 275 amendments offered during  the Armed Services Committee markup, we will, in total, have considered  485 amendments to this year's NDAA.   Just as important, there is a clear bipartisan split between the  number of majority and the number of minority amendments made in order.   Mr. Speaker, this has been an incredibly open process that allowed  Members of this body from both sides to have their input on this  critical national security legislation.   Like other years, the NDAA is a great example of the House working  through regular order in the authorizing process and getting the job  done.   Thanks to this rule and the one we passed yesterday, the House will  debate a number of issues where Members of this body have diverse  views. From the future of GTMO to the future of the New START, the two  NDAA rules provide for a robust debate on many important topics. That  is a good thing, and I look forward to the debate.  [[Page H5775]]    Before I continue, I want to briefly thank the staff in both the  Armed Services Committee and the Rules Committee for their hard work on  this rule. Dealing with this large number of amendments takes a  considerable amount of time, and I know I speak for the entire body,  both the majority and minority, in expressing our gratitude for their  time and work in helping the members of the Rules Committee come to  this product.   Yesterday, I outlined my strong support for this year's NDAA, which  will help keep the American people safe and secure, so I won't rehash  all those points. But I want to share some numbers that highlight the  readiness crisis facing our military. This crisis has been caused by  cuts to defense spending. This bill authorizes funding for the military  at $688.3 billion, which is 16.8 percent of total Federal outlays and  3.4 percent of projected gross domestic product.   As a guiding point, 30 years ago, the fiscal year 1988 NDAA  represented 27.3 percent of total Federal outlays. This year, 16  percent; back then, 27 percent. And 5.2 percent of projected GDP. This  year, 3.4 percent; back then, 5.2 percent.   We are spending less proportionately today on our military, despite  the fact that we face a wider range of threats across the globe. That  should be troubling to every American.   Let's think about the threat environment we faced 30 years ago: the  Soviet Union. That was about it. There was no ISIS or al-Qaida or other  radical Islamic terrorist organizations threatening the United States  30 years ago. Iran was not an existential threat to the American people  30 years ago. North Korea wasn't developing nuclear weapons and  ballistic missiles 30 years ago. China was not on the radar as it  relates to a military power 30 years ago. We weren't worried about  cyber attacks or cyber espionage 30 years ago.   It is safe to say the world was a lot different 30 years ago, yet we  were devoting a greater portion of our Federal budget to the military.  We must make that same or an even greater commitment today. For too  long, we, in Congress, have allowed our military to steadily atrophy,  bringing us to a readiness crisis. Providing for our national defense  is the most important job of this Congress, and this bill helps  rebuild, repair, and reform our military.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 440 and  the underlying bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Alabama  for the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, last night, the majority on the House  Rules Committee once again decided to exclude from debate 230  amendments to H.R. 2810, the National Defense Authorization Act. That  means that half of the amendments submitted were rejected.   I can never understand why these amendments are denied the chance to  be debated by the full House. When I first came to Capitol Hill as an  aide to our former friend and colleague, Congressman Joe Moakley, the  Defense Authorization bill would often take up to a week for debate.  But even back then, it was one of the largest and most complex bills  debated, and certainly one of the most important from a national  security point of view.   The NDAA rule was also structured back then, but more in terms of the  amount of time permitted for debate. And many amendments receive 1  hour, half an hour, 20 minutes, even 2 hours of debate. Why? Because  they were about the important decisions and priorities facing our  national defense policy at the time.   But that is not the case today. Amendments are lucky to get 10  minutes of debate equally divided if they are lucky enough to be  debated at all. And the Defense bill takes up a total of maybe 2 days'  worth of debate, if that. No wonder, no wonder Members are frustrated  by this process.   This year, like every year for the past several years, important  issues, especially on war and peace, were left on the chopping block by  the Republicans.   They decided that the House should not debate two bipartisan  amendments that would make sure that nothing in the NDAA could be  construed as authorization to use force against the governments of  North Korea or Syria.   The Republican majority decided it is okay to debate a bigoted  amendment that prohibits medical treatment for transgender  servicemembers who are in transition, but they will not let the House  debate an amendment that just calls for a study, Mr. Speaker, on blood  donations from gay men.                                time  1245    Mr. Speaker, did you know that there is a provision in the NDAA that  sets up an entire new military service branch, the Space Corps? The  Pentagon doesn't want it; the Air Force doesn't want it; they say it is  premature, but an amendment by Mr. Turner, a Republican, to require the  Pentagon to report on the need to establish a Space Corps is not  included in this rule. I guess the Republican leadership doesn't want  the House to have a say and a debate on such a major change.   Mr. Amash led a bipartisan amendment to block the sale of cluster  munitions to Saudi Arabia. Last year, this amendment failed by just a  handful of votes. I guess that is why the Republicans on the Rules  Committee aren't about to let it come up for a debate and a vote this  year.   When it comes to sending our uniformed women and men into war, into  danger, where their very lives are at risk, the Rules Committee decided  that such amendments were not worth the House's time to debate.   Last night, Republicans on the Rules Committee denied the opportunity  for debate on a bipartisan amendment offered by myself and  Representatives Walter Jones, Barbara Lee, Tom Massie, John Garamendi,  Dan Kildee, and Peter Welch.   The amendment is very straightforward. If the President decides to  increase the level of U.S. troops deployed in Afghanistan in fiscal  year 2018, then he would report to Congress on the purpose and mission  of those troops, how many were required, and how long they would be  there, and then Congress would vote to approve or disapprove that  escalation.   This would give the American people the voice they deserve when it  comes to sending our men and women in uniform into battle.   Mr. Speaker, the President and General Mattis just decided to send an  additional 4,000 troops to Afghanistan to fight the Taliban, on top of  the 8,400 U.S. troops already there. That will bring the total number  of American troops there to more than 12,000.   Now, if they should decide that they want even more troops in  Afghanistan in fiscal year 2018, Congress should know why, and vote on  it.   We can't keep giving the administration a blank check and allow  America once again to go down the slippery slope of incremental  escalation over the next year or two. Congress needs to step up to the  plate and either approve or disapprove any renewed escalation in  Afghanistan. Isn't that amendment worth debating?   We are in year 16 of the war in Afghanistan. It is the longest war in  American history. Let me repeat that, Mr. Speaker. Afghanistan is the  longest war in U.S. history. The costs are already in the hundreds of  billions of dollars, and the human cost to our troops, our veterans,  and their families have been enormous, yet Congress has not taken a  single vote, has not taken a single stand on this war for 16 years.  Most of the Members of this House weren't even here when that one and  only vote was taken.   So in the absence of debating an updated AUMF for Afghanistan, the  very least we can do is debate whether we will once again escalate our  military footprint in Afghanistan, but the Republican leadership of  this House doesn't agree.   Each year, the Republican leadership does everything it can to stop  any debate on these wars, and this year is no different. They will  allow some amendments on reports and a sense of Congress here and  there, but any amendment of substance that requires Congress to act is  denied.   Mr. Speaker, I want to advise my colleagues of one thing, and that  is, we are not an advisory commission. We are a legislative body. We  need to start doing our job.  [[Page H5776]]    Mr. Speaker, I have no problem with a report, but it won't be the  first time we have seen a report, whether on Afghanistan or Iraq or  Syria. Even the underlying bill calls for a strategy report on  Afghanistan and other conflicts, but Congress avoiding taking any  responsibility for continuing to send our servicemen and -women into  harm's way is absolutely shameful. Mr. Speaker, it is cowardice.   Every day, military families say good-bye to their loved ones as they  go into battle, placing themselves in harm's way to keep our country  safe, and Congress does nothing. All we do is kick the can down the  road and call for another report and then another report.   Mr. Speaker, we don't even act when the President actually does send  us an AUMF, the way President Obama did on Iraq and Syria and the war  against ISIS. We did nothing. We said we didn't like it, but we did  nothing. The Republican leadership complained that they didn't like it,  but then they never even tried to act on it or to write their own AUMF.  They would rather just stand on the sidelines, complain and criticize,  but do nothing, absolutely nothing, except stop other Members from  taking any action that might require the House to debate these wars.  Shame on all of us for allowing this to continue over and over and over  and over again.   Now, I am guessing that whenever the House takes up the Defense  appropriations bill, the Republican leaders will find a way to make  sure that the bipartisan-supported provision in that bill to sunset the  2001 AUMF on Afghanistan and vote on a new one within 8 months will  somehow disappear without a single Member of the House at large having  a chance to vote on it. Maybe we will get another report. And so it  goes on and on.   Mr. Speaker, there is nearly $700 billion authorized in this bill for  wars, for weapons systems, for military equipment, and for personnel,  all because Congress refuses to make hard choices. We can never seem to  find the money to take care of our own neighborhoods and schools. We  can't find the money to provide our citizens with better, more  affordable healthcare, or make sure that all our families can put food  on the table. We don't invest nearly enough in our roads and our  bridges, railways and transit systems. There is never enough money to  invest in a 21st century manufacturing base, provide training to  support the jobs of the future, or raise the Federal minimum wage to a  livable wage. We are told we don't have the money to take care of our  parks or to make sure that our air and water are drinkable and  breathable. We can't even seem to find the money to take care of our  senior citizens and our children, but when it comes to spending on war  or building more nuclear weapons, then magically we find trillions of  dollars to operate and spend.    We need to pay more attention, Mr. Speaker, to the choices we make  each year on how much spending our Nation really requires for its  national defense. I believe, at a minimum, Mr. Speaker, that Congress  needs to debate and vote on whether to keep sending more and more of  our military men and women to fight in endless wars.   And I have to say, Mr. Speaker, to my colleagues, what the Rules  Committee did last night by shutting out debate was shameful.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, now that the gentleman's motion to adjourn has been  defeated by a wide, bipartisan majority, the House can get back to work  and do the people's business. I want to go back over some statistics we  talked about earlier. This rule makes in order for floor consideration  210 amendments which are on top of the 275 amendments that were offered  in the Armed Services Committee.   Now, let's go back to the days when the NDAA was considered on this  floor and this floor was under the majority's control on the other side  of the aisle. Let's start with 2007. 135 amendments were offered; only  50 were made in order.   In 2009, 129 amendments were offered; only 58 were made in order.   In 2010, 129 were offered; only 69 were made in order.   In 2011, 193 were offered; only 82 were made in order.   And we are making in order in this rule, and yesterday's rule, 210.  This has been an open process by any measure.   The gentleman also referred to the fact that there are other needs in  America that are not being met because we are spending money on  defending the United States of America.   Let me go back and remind what I said earlier. Only 16.8 percent of  next year's Federal outlay will go to defending America if we adopt the  National Defense Authorization Act as passed by the committee, less  than 20 percent. That means almost 85 percent of Federal outlays are  going to go to every other thing that we do in government. If there is  a problem with something not being paid for, it is not because of the  money we are spending on national defense.   Then finally, the gentleman's comments about the need for us to make  sure that we are properly authorized as we engage in military  activities abroad; I do agree with him. We have had some mission creep  over the last several years. We have gone from Iraq and Afghanistan,  under President Obama, to Syria, to Libya, to Yemen, and many of us on  both sides of the aisles decried the fact that we did that.   It is, indeed, our responsibility, not the President's  responsibility, to declare war, to authorize the use of military force.  That is why this rule makes in order an amendment by the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Cole) that will set in place a process that will lead to  the consideration on this floor of the Authorization for Use of  Military Force.   So I believe this rule does exactly what the people of America expect  us to do, and that is to stay in this room, stay on this floor, and act  on the National Defense Authorization Act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Kelly).    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman is right. Workforce training is  very important, and that is why we passed on this floor a few weeks ago  the reauthorization of the Perkins Act--not by a bipartisan majority,  by a 100 percent vote.   We have other bills that we are considering in the Education and the  Workforce Committee that will deal with that because it is important  that we build the workforce in America. But you don't do that in the  National Defense Authorization Act. That is what we are here today  about.   I am afraid my colleagues on the other side have forgotten what this  bill is about. It is about making the people of America safe and  secure. We will deal with those other issues, as important as they are,  in other legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr.  Marshall).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Messer).     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Messer).     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Messer).     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Messer).     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Messer).     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Messer).     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Messer).     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Messer).     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Messer).     Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's comments. I  think that his issue comes within the broader question about the  authorization of military force in various parts of the Middle East. I  think he raises an important point. There is an amendment made in order  under this rule that will put in place a process to get us to that  debate.   I appreciate what he just said. I hope that he will hold that idea,  and when we have that debate on the floor, will bring it back so we can  consider it among those other items we will consider at that time. I  appreciate what he just said. This is not the place or the time to take  that up.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to just take 1 minute to address something  the gentleman from Alabama raised a while ago, and that is: Why would  we be raising the issue of apprenticeships and workforce training as  part of the Defense Authorization bill.   There are a couple of reasons why. One is because we are routinely  blocked from bringing any meaningful legislation to the floor, and we  are routinely blocked from bringing amendments to the floor that I  think can help with this issue.   The gentleman mentioned the action we took in a bipartisan, unanimous  way on the issue of Perkins loans and a few other programs. Those are  important. But it is the beginning. We need to do much, much more in  this country. We need to be able to prepare a workforce that can meet  the needs of our manufacturers and be there for the jobs of tomorrow.  That is why we brought this up. That is why we are bringing it up in  this fashion.   I would just go one step further to say, when we talk about national  security, I think we ought to broaden that definition to include not  just the number of bombs we have, but the quality of life that our  people in this country enjoy: whether or not people have the security  of a job, whether they can afford a college education for their kids,  whether they can afford to buy a home, whether they can afford to put  food on the table.   We live in the richest country in the world, and there are 42 million  Americans who are hungry, and yet we somehow can't get the political  will to address that problem or fix some of these challenges.   We are going to take any opportunity we have to bring to the floor  serious ideas that we think will benefit the American people, uplift  the American people, and that is why I think that this bill that we are  trying to bring up, H.R. 2933, authored by my colleague, Mr. Pocan, is  appropriate.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I really believe very strongly we need to do  more in workforce training in America. I am a former chancellor of  postsecondary education, former chair of workforce development for the  State of Alabama. It is something that is very near and dear to me. I  know that we are working very hard on these issues and have already  produced this one bill, the Perkins bill that we passed in the  absolutely 100 percent vote here on the floor. There will be more  coming.   But the National Defense Authorization Act authorizes what our  military does and doesn't do and how it does it around the globe. This  is a separate, different vehicle designed to provide for the defense of  the American people.   I appreciate the gentleman's comments. We need to take those comments  up at another time as we take into consideration other bills that work  on our workforce development.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, there is a theme that is developing on the Republican  side. We can always take it up at another time, at another time in the  future. We can do the NDAA bill and this. That is the whole point of  defeating the previous question. You can still debate the National  Defense Authorization Act, and you can bring up this other thing that  we think is of great value to workers in this country. It doesn't have  to be one or the other.   It is that same thinking when it comes to war. As I began this debate  talking about the war in Afghanistan and the fact that it is the  longest war in American history, we don't even talk about it here. We  don't even debate it here.   We ought to respect the men and women who we put in harm's way enough  to make it a priority in this Chamber, and we don't even talk about it.  We can't even bring amendments to the floor to deliberate on that. What  we are told is: Well, we will vote on a study, another study. After 16  years? That is the best we can do? Or we are told that it falls under  the jurisdiction of another committee.   Well, my friends on the Republican side are in charge. I am sorry to  say that, but you are.                                time  1345    And I don't know what is standing in your way from asking the  committees of jurisdiction or multiple committees to come together and  to actually present to this Chamber an AUMF for these wars. There is  nothing, other than the fact that you want to avoid an uncomfortable  vote for your Members.   Well, that is just too bad. War is a big deal. It ought to be a big  deal, and we ought to treat it more seriously than we are. And I will  repeat what I said at the beginning of this debate: What the Rules  Committee did last night was shameful; blocking germane amendments,  blocking serious amendments, to address an issue that, quite frankly,  we should have been talking about a long time ago.   Again, I regret that this is the rule that my Republican friends have  come up with. They can say they are proud of it. Quite frankly, I am  ashamed of it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I remind all of us that the war in Afghanistan was authorized by an  AUMF that was passed by Congress in 2001. So while we can have a debate  about the other conflicts in other places, that conflict is, indeed,  authorized, and has been authorized from the very beginning. So I would  take exception to the gentleman's comments with regard to Afghanistan.   There are provisions in the underlying bill that this rule makes in  order and in those provisions that do things to help with that war  effort, help the men and women over there fighting that war effort for  us.  [[Page H5780]]    So I think that this rule and the bill that underlies it are doing  exactly what they should do with regard to Afghanistan, because  Afghanistan is authorized.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, with all due respect, the war and the authorization that  the gentleman was talking about is 2001. We have been there for 16  years. In 2001 we were going after al-Qaida. Al-Qaida is gone. We are  now fighting the Taliban and propping up one of the most corrupt  governments in the world. Our mission continues to change.   The idea that we should be operating in Afghanistan under an AUMF  from 2001, that somehow nothing has changed, is ludicrous. And the idea  that we are using that authorization to justify our military operations  in Syria and a whole bunch of other places in the world is ludicrous.  Enough. Enough.   This Chamber needs to do its job, and this leadership needs to get  out of the way, and Members of Congress--Democrats and Republicans-- need to come together and debate these issues seriously.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Speier), a distinguished member of the Armed Services Committee's  Subcommittee on Military Personnel.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.    I appreciate the gentlewoman's comments. Most of those issues, if not  all of them, were brought up in committee when this bill was considered  as amendments, and they were defeated in virtually all cases by a  bipartisan vote.   I appreciate the fact that she voted for the overall bill, as did  everybody but one Member after you take it all into consideration,  because that is what this bill is about. We are authorizing a broad  swath of the defense of this country. There are a lot of moving parts  to it.   Not everything in a bill this big is going to be satisfactory to  everybody on the committee. I can pick out one or two things I don't  like about it. But as a whole, it does the job that needs to be done  for the people that we depend upon to defend America.   So I appreciate the gentlewoman's comments, but most of all, I  appreciated her vote at the end of the day when we approved that bill  after markup in committee.   Now, I do want to respond to one thing that the gentleman from  Massachusetts said. He talked about, we are still there fighting the  Taliban. The 2001 AUMF specifically references the Taliban.   So we can talk about how things in Syria that President Obama did,  things in Libya that President Obama did, things in Yemen that  President Obama did are outside the AUMF that was adopted in 2001 with  regard to Afghanistan, and I think that is a legitimate debate. But  there is no legitimate debate about whether or not the ongoing conflict  in Afghanistan and our involvement with it has been authorized, because  it has been authorized for 16 years.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Congressional Record a letter from 14  conservative and liberal national organizations opposing a defense bill  that busts the budget caps.                                                      July 10, 2017.        Dear Representative McGovern: As organizations representing       Americans across the political spectrum, we are writing to       voice our strong opposition to attempts by Members of       Congress to increase the Pentagon's fiscal year 2018 budget       above both the budget caps set by the Budget Control Act and       the President's budget request. The Pentagon is currently       funded at a higher level than at almost any time since World       War II, and the budget problems it faces should be solved by       better fiscal management, not by adding more money to an       already bloated and wasteful department.        The challenges facing our military are partially the result       of years of failing to make the necessary, tough choices our       nation's security requires. Rather than prioritizing basic       needs of the warfighter, lawmakers have pursued huge,       expensive weapons systems that fail to meet technical       specifications and may never be ready for combat. Waste and       unnecessary overhead abound, with a Defense Business Board       study showing that the Department of Defense could save up to       $125 billion over five years just by eliminating excess       bureaucracy and inefficiencies.        Claims of a so-called ``readiness crisis'' are exaggerated.       As former DoD Comptroller Robert Hale said in February, these       claims are just the services ``putting their worst foot       forward'' in the hopes of securing funding increases. General       David Petraeus has also said that this idea of a readiness       crisis is a myth. By opposing important cost-saving measures       like base realignment and closure which could save several       billion dollars a year just by closing excess infrastructure,       Congress is demonstrating that it is not prioritizing fiscal       responsibility or making the choices that will actually keep       us safe. Moreover, the Pentagon cannot be sure what it is       spending as it is the only federal agency that has never       passed an audit.        Budgets necessitate tradeoffs. Pentagon spending increases       shortchange other important priorities, from domestic needs       including education, health and nutrition and affordable       housing, to paying down the national debt. Further increasing       the Pentagon's budget by tens of billions of dollars without       a clear strategy will do little to solve national security       challenges. Rather, it will simply guarantee further wasteful       spending at the Pentagon. We hope that you will oppose any       attempts to increase the Pentagon's budget for fiscal year       2018.            Sincerely,        American Friends Service Committee; Center for       International Policy; Coalition on Human Needs; Council for a       Livable World; Freedom Works; Friends Committee on National       Legislation; Iraq Veterans Against the War.

Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I also include in the Record a letter to  all Representatives from the American Civil Liberties Union in  opposition to the Hartzler amendment, which it deems as discriminatory  and unconstitutional.                                 American Civil Liberties Union,                                      Washington, DC, July 13, 2017.      Vote NO on Hartzler Amendment No. 315 to the NDAA--          Discriminatory and Unconstitutional.         Dear Representative: The American Civil Liberties Union       (ACLU) is strongly opposed to Hartzler Amendment No. 315 to       the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018       (NDAA), H.R. 2810. This amendment would bar transgender       members of the Armed Forces and military families from       receiving appropriate and medically necessary health care.       This is a discriminatory, unconstitutional attack on       transgender service members and their families, plain and       simple. It should be overwhelmingly rejected by members of       the House of Representatives.        Barring access to appropriate and medically necessary       health care, including transition-related care, for       transgender service members and their families is not only       discriminatory, but runs counter to scientific evidence and       contemporary medical standards of care. It also puts the       health of certain service members at needless risk and       undermines the ability of military medical professionals to       provide necessary care for their patients.        There is a clear and overwhelming consensus among the       leading medical organizations--including the American Medical       Association, the American Psychiatric Association, and the       American Psychological Association--that transition-related       care is safe, effective, non-experimental, and medically       necessary. If a military doctor determines that transition-      related care (e.g. hormone therapy) is medically necessary       for a transgender service member, then that treatment should       be provided just as it would be for any other medical       condition for any other service member.        Members of the House of Representatives should       overwhelmingly reject this discriminatory attempt to deny       necessary health care to certain service members and their       families. All of the members of our Armed Forces willingly       put their lives on the line in defense of our nation. The       least that Congress can do is ensure that the health care       needs of our service members and their families are being       met.        Accordingly, the ACLU is strongly opposed to Hartzler       Amendment No. 315 to the NDAA and urges all members to vote       NO on it.        Please contact Ian Thompson, legislative representative.            Sincerely,      Faiz Shakir,        National Political Director.      Ian Thompson,        Legislative Representative.    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, it is ironic to me that we have time to  debate a bill that discriminates against transgender members of the  Armed Forces and military families, but we can't find the time to  debate war. It really is sad. It is a sad commentary on the way the  Rules Committee conducted itself last night.   Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman believes that what we are doing in  Afghanistan is consistent with what was envisioned 16 years ago, he can  go on thinking that, but it isn't. And if he thinks it is okay that  that authorization is used to justify every military involvement we  have all around the world, he can go ahead and think that way. I think  he is very much mistaken.   Mr. Speaker, Congress has to stop kicking the can down the road. It  is unconscionable that the Republican leadership continues to prevent  meaningful debate on these wars. But let me say one thing about why our  House colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, keep bringing these  issues up, despite the opposition from the Republican leadership. And  that is because it is our job.   The American people sent us to Washington to debate the uncomfortable  issues and to take difficult votes. Now, there were some in Congress-- maybe my friend is included in that--who think that it is acceptable to  give this administration a blank check to continue these endless wars.  Why anybody--no matter who is President, but especially with this  President--would feel comfortable giving him a blank check is beyond my  comprehension.   There are others who would like to end them and bring our servicemen  and -women home. And then there are others who look for a different  policy somewhere between these two positions. This is why we need to  debate these wars. This is why we need to bring updated AUMFs to the  floor for a vote.   If that is a debate that you would rather not have, if that is a vote  that you would rather not take, then Mr. Speaker, let me suggest that  you should look for a new job. You should go into a different vocation.   I am sure that I speak for all of my colleagues when I say that  protecting the lives and well-being of our uniform men and women is one  of the highest priorities, if not the highest priorities, of this  Congress. But they deserve more than a ``thank you'' on Veterans Day.   We do not respect their service and sacrifice and that of their  families when we refuse to debate and take any responsibility for  sending them year after year into war. They deserve a thoughtful,  reasoned, and engaged debate. They deserve a debate. They deserve a  little attention in this Chamber, not excuses and not more reports and  not more, ``We will get to it in the future.''   And that is why, along with many of my Republican and Democratic  colleagues, we will continue to demand that the Republican leadership  of this House allow a debate and a vote on the future of these wars.   I just want to say, finally, Mr. Speaker, I have been raising this  issue not just when Republicans have been President, but when Democrats  have been President. I really believe that Congress has forfeited its  constitutional responsibilities. We have abrogated our constitutional  responsibilities. We have acquiesced time and time again to Democratic  and Republican administrations when it comes to war.   We can't allow that to happen. That is not responsible governing. We  have an obligation to make sure that whatever we are doing with regard  to our military, that it is the right thing to do.   The idea that we once again come to the floor with the National  Defense Authorization bill and we are told we cannot debate any of  these things, we can't vote on any of these things, I mean, give me a  break. What are you thinking? Why is this such a big, difficult thing  to overcome with the leadership?   Again, if my friends don't want to take uncomfortable votes, then do  something else. Don't vote. But it is not the right thing to do. We  should be ashamed of this process. There is no justifying shutting out  debate on war.   Mr. Speaker, I again urge my colleagues to defeat the previous  question and vote ``no'' on the underlying bill, and vote ``no'' on the  rule, too.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The gentleman said we can't debate anything. The rule we passed  yesterday makes in order 210 different amendments to be debated on top  of the general debate of the bill itself. And that is on top of 275  amendments in the committee of jurisdiction, the Armed Services  Committee.   This is the most debated piece of legislation we have every year, and  it should be for the very reasons the gentleman from Massachusetts  itemized, because what we are doing here is of profound importance.   Now, I know that there are other issues that people try to stick into  this bill every year that, frankly, distract us from the underlying  importance of the bill; and that is, we are trying to do everything we  possibly can to protect the American people. The threats the American  people face today are more diverse, more profound than we have seen  since the end of World War II.   So, yes, this bill authorizes a lot of very important and expensive  things. I acknowledge they are expensive. But it is even more expensive  if we don't do them, or don't do them right, and we leave the American  people exposed.   Just take into account one of our threats, Kim Jong-un in North  Korea. That missile test he did recently was an ICBM, an  intercontinental ballistic missile. He does not need such a missile to  hit South Korea or Japan. He needs that missile to hit us, to hit  Alaska, to hit the West Coast of the United States, and ultimately to  hit the entirety of the United States.  [[Page H5782]]    It is a direct threat to the safety of the people of the United  States. This bill authorizes an increase in missile defense, just one  of the things that it does.   So I hope that all of us will take the many things that we are going  to debate here over the next several days very seriously and that we  will come to the bipartisan conclusion, as we did in the committee,  that when you take the totality of this bill together after you have  gone through all of these amendments, it does the most important thing  we are here to do, which is to defend the American people.                                time  1400    Mr. Speaker, I again urge my colleagues to support House Resolution  440 and the underlying bill.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 440 Offered by Mr. McGovern         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec 5. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       2933) to promote effective registered apprenticeships, for       skills, credentials, and employment, and for other purposes.       The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All       points of order against consideration of the bill are waived.       General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not       exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair       and ranking minority member of the Committee on Education and       the Workforce. After general debate the bill shall be       considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At       the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the       Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with       such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and       amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit with or without       instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports       that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the       next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the       third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV,       resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 6. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 2933.                                   ____           The Vote On The Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous  question.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair  will reduce to 5 minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote on  the question of adoption of the resolution.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 234,  nays 187, not voting 12, as follows:                               [Roll No. 354]                                 YEAS--234       Abraham      Aderholt      Allen      Amash      Amodei      Arrington      Babin      Bacon      Banks (IN)      Barletta      Barr      Barton      Bergman      Biggs      Bilirakis      Bishop (MI)      Bishop (UT)      Black      Blackburn      Blum      Bost      Brady (TX)      Brat      Bridenstine      Brooks (AL)      Brooks (IN)      Buchanan      Buck      Bucshon      Budd      Burgess      Byrne      Calvert      Carter (GA)      Carter (TX)      Chabot      Cheney      Coffman      Cole      Collins (GA)      Collins (NY)      Comer      Comstock      Conaway      Cook      Costello (PA)      Cramer      Crawford      Culberson      Curbelo (FL)      Davidson      Denham      Dent      DeSantis      DesJarlais      Diaz-Balart      Donovan      Duffy      Duncan (SC)      Duncan (TN)      Dunn      Emmer      Estes (KS)      Farenthold      Faso      Ferguson      Fitzpatrick      Fleischmann      Flores      Fortenberry      Foxx      Franks (AZ)      Frelinghuysen      Gaetz      Gallagher      Garrett      Gianforte      Gibbs      Gohmert      Goodlatte      Gosar      Gowdy      Granger      Graves (GA)      Graves (LA)      Graves (MO)      Griffith      Grothman      Guthrie      Handel      Harper      Harris      Hartzler      Hensarling      Herrera Beutler      Hice, Jody B.
