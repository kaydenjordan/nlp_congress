 Madam Speaker, today is a great day. It is  the birthday of the United States Air Force and for those of us who  serve. I rise today to recognize not only that birthday of the Air  Force but to have the great and distinct honor of having Chief of  Chaplains Steve Schaick, as we have just heard, to be here. I have the  privilege of also calling him my boss because I am in the Air Force as  well. He is a chaplain, and he is the top of my chain. He is there for  a reason. He exemplifies what a chaplain means and how they serve in  our Air Force.   Throughout our country's history, men and women have awaited and  answered the call of duty, accomplishing each mission with valor.  Today, we acknowledge the men and women who have taken to the skies to  defend our country as members of the United States Air Force.   As a chaplain in that United States Air Force Reserves, I have had  the privilege to minister and work with airmen since 2002. Their  courage and integrity both at home and abroad are unmatched, and  Chaplain Steven Schaick is a testament to that courage and integrity.    Chaplain Schaick is a native of Oshkosh, Wisconsin. He enlisted in  the United States Air Force in 1976, serving for 4 years as an F-15  integrated avionics component specialist. He is endorsed by the  Presbyterian Church, U.S.A., and was commissioned in the Air Force  Reserves as a chaplain candidate in 1985 and into the Active Duty  chaplaincy in 1988.   Chaplain Schaick has served three different major commands as a staff  [[Page H7760]]  chaplain, followed by a special duty assignment to Arlington National  Cemetery. He now serves as the Chief of Chaplains of the United States  Air Force.   It is my honor to sponsor him to be the guest chaplain of the United  States House of Representatives on this, the Air Force's birthday,  September 18, 2019. Again, it is my pleasure to have Chaplain Schaick  with us today.                            ____________________
