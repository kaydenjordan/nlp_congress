 Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my friends from New  Jersey and Michigan for their help on this important bill.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin with a startling statistic. Every  9 minutes, someone in the United States attempts suicide or is  successful, and for every suicide-related death, there are 25 attempts.  These are truly heartbreaking statistics. Sadly, they hit close to home  in Utah, which ranks fifth for the highest suicide deaths in the U.S.   One example is Madison Radtke, a charitable and loving young lady who  unexpectedly took her own life. I have gotten to know Madison's family,  and it has been an honor to do so. Madison is remembered for her  kindness to others and for her ability to see the good in each person.   Here is something that is startling and should be terrifying to those  of us who are parents: Madison didn't show any sign of suicidal  thoughts. To others around her, she seemed to be making the most of the  prime of her life.   This is a sad reminder that suicide can strike anywhere. These are  our neighbors, our coworkers, our friends, our family members. I  believe that we have the power and we have the responsibility to reach  out and to help them. Yes, there are many tools available for people  who are struggling with mental illness or thoughts of suicide, but,  tragically, some of these resources are simply too difficult to find in  a time of urgent need.                                time  1415    The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline dialing number is cumbersome  and is very hard to remember, and most people have never even heard of  it. Additionally, in Utah and many other States, there are various  other entities that provide service, but there is not one consolidated  number for people to call.   After the recent passing, as has been mentioned, of Kate Spade and  Anthony Bourdain, calls to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline  jumped 25 percent. While the hotline number has increased access, I  know we can do better, and that is the purpose of this bill. This is  where Congress can help.   I introduced the National Suicide Hotline Improvement Act to  streamline and to provide easy access to potentially lifesaving  resources by designating a new and very simple national  [[Page H6594]]  three-digit dialing number, very similar to 911, for national suicide  prevention and mental health crisis.   The study will also examine the overall effectiveness of the current  National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and Veterans Crisis Line for  individuals both here and abroad and their access to that. Ultimately,  the report will recommend ways to improve the existing system.   I recognize this legislation alone is not a panacea. It is not going  to solve every problem. There is much more that we can do and we must  do, and some of the solutions will require a multifaceted approach; but  it is an important step and one that has the potential to avert  tragedy, such as the loss of Madison, and to save many lives.   For those of us who have seen firsthand and been impacted by the  tragedy of suicide or attempted suicide, it is simply time for us to  act.
