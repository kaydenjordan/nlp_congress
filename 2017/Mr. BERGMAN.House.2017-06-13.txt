 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 1094, the  Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower  Protection Act.   Anyone who has been responsible for the success of a business or  organization knows that the most important part of the equation is the  people. It is no different with the Department of Veterans Affairs.   Our veterans have given their all, and they deserve our all; but,  unfortunately, vulnerabilities in the VA's administrative processes  have led to incompetence, neglect, and even unchecked illegal activity  on the part of a small number of VA employees.   Unfortunately, lack of oversight and accountability in the hiring and  retention process mean that the VA is still failing our veterans. Even  in the few instances where the VA has tried to discipline employees for  wrongdoing or neglect, it has been foiled by a complex and lengthy  administrative process that rarely yields results.   S. 1094 addresses the VA's administrative shortcomings by providing  the Secretary with the authority to remove, demote, or suspend any  employee for poor performance or misconduct while, at the same time,  enhancing protections for whistleblowers.   As a leader of marines and a Vietnam veteran, I know what our  servicemen and -women across generations and conflicts have sacrificed  for our freedoms and our country. They don't just deserve quality care;  they have earned it.   We made a commitment to defend our veterans just as they have  defended our way of life, and that starts with reforms that restore  efficiency and accountability at Veterans Affairs.   I would like to thank Chairman Roe and the committee for all their  hard work. I strongly urge my colleagues to support.
