 Mr. Chairman, this is a sad day in the history of this  country as Republicans begin the process of destroying health care in  America.   ``Repeal and replace'' is just a slogan. It is not a solution. For  more than 6 years, we have been waiting for a credible Republican  healthcare plan, and none has been forthcoming. All you have is smoke  and mirrors, and the American people are getting ready to get screwed.   Under the so-called Republican plan, seniors will be forced to pay  more for their medicine. Under the so-called Republican plan, children  with preexisting conditions, like pediatric cancer, will be at risk of  being kicked off of their health plans or of being denied health  coverage. Under the so-called Republican plan, young people in America  will no longer be able to stay on their parents' health insurance  through the age of 26. Under the so-called Republican plan, more than a  million people who are receiving drug treatment because of opioid  addiction will be at risk of being denied that lifesaving care.   Under the so-called Republican plan, premiums will go up, co-pays  will go up, deductibles will go up; and the American people will be  screwed. People in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Ohio--screwed.  Seniors in Florida--screwed. People on the west coast and on the east  coast--screwed. People in Appalachia and rural America--screwed.   The only folks who will benefit are the fat cats who are part of the  healthcare cartel. The system, indeed, is rigged, and the American  people should pay attention as to who is jamming them up.
