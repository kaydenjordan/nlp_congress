 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the dire situation  of our interpreters in Afghanistan, where we are over halfway through  our planned withdrawal. Meanwhile, almost 20,000 Afghans who worked  with U.S. forces are anxiously awaiting special immigrant visa  approval, a process that can take years. Making matters worse, our  Kabul Embassy suspended visa operations last week due to a surge in  COVID cases.   Mr. Speaker, President Biden must immediately start preparations to  evacuate those Afghans to Guam to safely await visa approval. My  colleagues and I on the Honoring our Promises Working Group urged the  administration to do so 2 weeks ago, but we have yet to hear back. This  is unacceptable.   President Biden ended the remain in Mexico for economic migrants but  insists on a remain in Afghanistan policy  [[Page H2914]]  for Afghans who risked their lives to help American forces. While they  wait, the Taliban are hunting them down. Dozens have already been  killed while bureaucrats dither.   We cannot abandon our Afghan allies to die. We must get them to Guam.                            ____________________
