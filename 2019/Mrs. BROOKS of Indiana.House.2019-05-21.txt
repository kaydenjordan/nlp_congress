 Madam Speaker, one century ago today, the  United States House of Representatives passed a constitutional  amendment granting women the right to vote. Just 1 year later, the 19th  Amendment was ratified.   Even before women had the right to vote, women from Indiana were on  their feet, rallying their voices to be heard. Hoosier suffragettes  such as Amanda Way, Zerelda Wallace, May Wright Sewall, Helen Gougar,  Dr. Amelia Keller, and Grace Julian Clarke led the push for suffrage in  Indiana and inspired Hoosier women to stand up and speak out about  their rights.   Each of these women and so many more across the country paved the way  so that other women can now vote and hold local, State, and Federal  Government positions.   It is an honor to be one of seven Congresswomen elected thus far to  represent the Hoosier State in our Nation's Capital, but it began with  Representative Virginia Ellis Jenckes, who began her service in 1933;  then Cecil Murray Harden, who began her service in 1949; Katie Hall in  1982; Jill Long Thompson in 1989; Julia Carson in 2003; and my good  friend Jackie Walorski and I in 2013.                                time  1030    Hoosier women have certainly left their marks in America's history  book. But, as I stand here today, I am struck at how much work, yes, we  still have to do.   Exercising our right to vote is the most powerful tool we have to  share our voice. Today, I join many colleagues here in the House  wearing a yellow rose commemorating the suffragettes fight for our  rights to vote. So much has been accomplished by women and for women in  the past 100 years. Today, I want to encourage all Americans to  consider how much farther we can go in the next 100 years.                            ____________________
