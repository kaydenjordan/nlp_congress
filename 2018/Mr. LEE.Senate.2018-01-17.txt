 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.  [[Page S224]]     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to  complete my remarks, notwithstanding the previous order.    Madam President, the Founding Fathers knew and understood  well what it was like to live in a dangerous world. When America was  founded, we were threatened by foreign adversaries. The military might  of the United States was feeble compared to the great powers of that  day. Yet the Founders insisted on a Constitution that would protect the  civil liberties of the American people. They knew it was possible to  defend the homeland and Americans' rights at the same time. It still  is.   The War of Independence was fought in part because King George III  abused general warrants that let his officers snoop through the papers  and property of law-abiding subjects. The abuse of general warrants and  the use of things like writs of assistance prompted the American people  into action, representing that their fundamental liberties were at  stake. That is part of what ushered in the American Revolution.   The Fourth Amendment to the Constitution was put in place  specifically to protect these very kinds of liberties and to protect  the American people against this very type of snooping. The Fourth  Amendment does this by prohibiting unreasonable searches and seizures  of Americans' persons and property. The very wording of the Fourth  Amendment itself recognizes that this is part of what our security  means. It is not just that we are protecting privacy; we are protecting  privacy by protecting our security, to make sure that we are secure in  our persons, our papers, houses, and effects.   The Fourth Amendment also requires search warrants to be limited in  scope and to be based on evidence producing probable cause that a crime  has been committed. Those warrants also have to be particularized so  that they are not open-ended, so that they can't be applied to any and  every circumstance.   Critics of the Fourth Amendment complain about it. They complain  about it from time to time as if it were somehow an annoyance that has  to be dealt with, ultimately circumvented. Some people refer to it even  as something of a security threat in and of itself. This is wrong. Our  Nation's history should itself be enough to convince us that the Fourth  Amendment is no annoyance. It is an essential safeguard of our liberty  in the face of a vast, powerful, and frequently overreaching  government. Just think of how much more powerful the government has  become in the age of supercomputers and the internet. The kinds of  abuses endured by the founding generations will be repeated on an even  greater scale if we are not vigilant in checking the power of  government.   Last night, this body--the U.S. Senate--voted to close debate on a  bill to reauthorize section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence  Surveillance Act. This program may sound dry. It may sound  inconsequential or even uncontroversial to many people's lives. But  supporters and critics who are familiar with it often agree that it is  anything but.   FISA's section 702 authorizes the intelligence community to spy on  suspected foreign terrorists. Not many people are troubled by that  aspiration. The intelligence-gathering that this authorizes is a  valuable task, and it is one that helps protect the homeland from bona  fide threats from outside the United States. However, FISA 702 also  allows the collection of incidental intelligence about American  citizens who communicate with foreign suspects. Once the intelligence  community has collected this incidental information about Americans,  domestic law enforcement can access the information for their own  investigations without first obtaining a search warrant, as  contemplated under our constitutional structure. In other words, FISA  702 opened a backdoor to government spying on American citizens. This  incidental spying is a different matter altogether, and it does  implicate the Fourth Amendment--certainly the spirit of the Fourth  Amendment if not also the letter thereof   It is profoundly worrying that the government maintains vast  collections of information about American citizens, no matter how that  information is collected, incidentally or intentionally. It is likewise  worrying that the government cannot or will not say, specify, list  exactly how many Americans have been subjected to government snooping  under this provision.   Surveillance programs like this one may be implemented with the best  of intentions--and I am willing to assume for purposes of this  discussion that they are with the best of intentions here--but they  themselves provide the raw material that overzealous bureaucrats can  use to snoop on anyone the government doesn't like.   When we speak of the United States, when we speak of our government  agencies, we are not speaking of an omniscient force, something that  can only act for benevolent reasons. Our governments, by necessity, are  run by fallible, mortal individuals. No matter how patriotic might be  the goals underlying this law or the agencies that implement it, at the  end of the day, a human being is in control of each and every action  taken under this law.   So maybe, you might say, the subjects of this type of government  surveillance are in fact overwhelmingly threats to the public. But can  you guarantee that is the case? And if it is the case today, can you  guarantee it will always be the case? Can you be so sure that tomorrow  or the next day or the next year or in a few years from now or decades  from now, that will also be the case? What if the next time, the  subject is a critic of the government, or perhaps the subject is a  petty political enemy of someone charged with implementing this  statute?   History cannot reassure us that this or any other surveillance power  will always be used for good. It is not difficult, for that matter, to  fathom hypothetical scenarios in which this could come about. Imagine,  for example, a political candidate disliked by someone with authority  to do a so-called backdoor search of a section 702 database. Imagine  that someone with that authority dislikes that political candidate and  decides to go looking for dirt on that political candidate, finds dirt  on that political candidate, and then perhaps decides to leak that same  information--unlawfully accessed by this individual acting pursuant to  this program. This might be against all sorts of department protocols.  It might be against the policy of those same agencies charged with  administrating this statute. But the fact that we can't rule it out,  the fact that it is not clear that this couldn't happen, ought to be  concerning to every single one of us.   The only check on this frightening power is the FISA Court, which  rules in near total obscurity about what the government is allowed to  collect. I say the FISA Court is the only check because Congress  certainly isn't acting like a credible check on this authority.   Not long ago, the House handed us a bill that would reauthorize FISA  section 702 for another 6 years, and I am sorry to report that many of  my colleagues in the Senate are forcing this bill through as is, in the  same condition as we received it from the House of Representatives,  without a single change from the bill the House sent us, without any  amendments to protect Americans against warrantless, backdoor searches  by the government about U.S. citizens on U.S. soil.   I believe that Americans' Fourth Amendment rights are worth much more  due diligence than that. Instead of simply rubberstamping FISA 702  through the bill that the House sent us, this body could have  strengthened it by voting against cloture, which would have opened up  the bill for amendments.   To be clear, a vote against cloture would not have been a vote  against FISA section 702. It would not have ended the program or  jeopardized our Nation's ability to spy on suspected foreign  terrorists. In fact, as far as I know, not one of the Members of this  body who voted against cloture would even support such an outcome. Not  one of us, as far as I am aware, would like to see FISA end. What we  would like to see is for amendments to at least be considered, to be  debated, to be discussed by the people's elected representatives in  this body to make sure that we have achieved the proper balance between  the power the government desires and the security and privacy of the  American people. A vote  [[Page S225]]  against cloture would have allowed this body to improve FISA section  702 through a legitimate amendment process--one that we, unfortunately,  are being denied this week.   You see, one of the reasons why it is important, as we consider this,  to allow for amendments is that this law comes up for reauthorization  only so often. I think the American people legitimately would expect  that when it comes up, we would actually have an open, honest debate  and discussion; that we would do more than simply rubberstamp what the  other Chamber has already passed; that we would ask some difficult but  important questions about the rights of the American people relative to  this program.   Had we voted down cloture, had we decided not to vote to end debate,  this would have given us an opportunity to protect Americans' safety  and their constitutional rights, not one or the other. It wouldn't have  put us in this awful Hobson's choice scenario, where you have to choose  to protect one or the other.   What, you might ask, may some of these possible changes to section  702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act have looked like? They  would look a lot like the provisions contained in the proposed USA  Liberty Act, which Senator Leahy and I introduced last year. The USA  Liberty Act would tighten this standard the government must meet in  order to collect and access information on you, pursuant to section  702. This safeguard, and any of the other provisions contained in the  USA Liberty Act, would be worthy additions to FISA 702.   These changes would not restore respect for the Fourth Amendment  overnight. I believe it will take many more battles with the entrenched  interests within government to achieve that, but they would be steps in  the right direction.   If history is our guide, any unlimited, unaccountable power we hand  to the government ultimately will be used against the people. In FISA  section 702, the government has a vast grant of power--a digital-aged  general warrant--to hoard untold terabytes of information about  American citizens.   I hope we can work together in the coming months to improve this  surveillance program and vindicate what the Founders so clearly knew;  that our safety does not have to come at the expense of our rights;  that our security and our privacy are not at odds with one another but  that our privacy and our security are one and the same. Our security is  part of our privacy and vice versa. We can protect both. We can walk  and chew gum at the same time. We can honor the Constitution and  protect the rights of the individual while simultaneously protecting  the security of the greatest civilization the world has ever known. We  can do better, and we must.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
