 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember and  honor the life of Mrs. Cindy Wade Tanner.   From Waycross in Georgia's First Congressional District, she was  loved and cherished by many.   Mrs. Tanner was a gifted teacher and a pillar in her community. She  taught at Bacon County High School and later moved to Ware County High  School.   After teaching high school students, Mrs. Tanner worked at Waycross- Ware Technical School and retired in 2017 as vice president for  institutional advancement. While there, she planned and coordinated the  first community-wide social fundraiser, the Gala.   In 1998, Mrs. Tanner was awarded the Rick Perkins Award of  Excellence, which is to honor technical college instructors who make  significant contributions to technical education through innovation and  leadership in their fields.   She dedicated most of her time to teach and lead others, as she was  also a beloved Sunday school teacher at her church.   Mrs. Tanner's selfless legacy will always be remembered.   Her family and friends will be in my thoughts and prayers during this  most difficult time.                            ____________________
