 DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I move to  suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 7132) to preserve safe access  to communications services for survivors of domestic violence and other  crimes, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7132         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Safe Connections Act of       2022''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.         Except as otherwise provided in this Act, terms used in       this Act that are defined in section 345(a) of the       Communications Act of 1934, as added by section 4 of this       Act, have the meanings given those terms in such section       345(a).       SEC. 3. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, sexual       assault, human trafficking, and related crimes are life-      threatening issues and have lasting and harmful effects on       individuals, families, and entire communities.        (2) Survivors often lack meaningful support and options       when establishing independence from an abuser, including       barriers such as financial insecurity and limited access to       reliable communications tools to maintain essential       connections with family, social safety networks, employers,       and support services.        (3) Perpetrators of violence and abuse described in       paragraph (1) increasingly use technological and       communications tools to exercise control over, monitor, and       abuse their victims.        (4) Communications law can play a public interest role in       the promotion of safety, life, and property with respect to       the types of violence and abuse described in paragraph (1).       For example, independent access to a wireless phone plan can       assist survivors in establishing security and autonomy.        (5) Safeguards within communications services can serve a       role in preventing abuse and narrowing the digital divide       experienced by survivors of abuse.       SEC. 4. PROTECTION OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVORS WITHIN                     COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES.

(D) Compliance.--If the Commission establishes a central       database through the rulemaking under subparagraph (A) and a       covered provider updates its own databases to match the       central database not less frequently than once every 30 days,       no cause of action shall lie or be maintained in any court       against the covered provider or its officers, employees, or       agents for claims deriving from omission from consumer-facing       logs of calls or text messages of any records of calls or       text messages to covered hotlines in the central database.       SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.

The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise  and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 7132.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 7132, the Safe  Connections Act. A cell phone may be one of the most important items a  survivor of domestic violence, human trafficking, or other related  crimes has when living in an abusive relationship. This device will not  only allow a survivor to stay connected to family and friends, but it  also provides them with access to outside help and support networks.   There is no question that a cell phone is an important lifeline for  survivors of these devastating and horrible crimes. However, in some  instances, survivors use a cell phone with a shared mobile service  plan. This can subject these survivors to ongoing digital abuse like  bullying, stalking, or intimidation.   H.R. 7132 addresses these unfortunate circumstances by requiring  mobile service providers to separate the phone line of victims from an  account shared with their abuser within 2 business days without  financial penalties or other potential obstacles.                                time  1545    The legislation also requires mobile service providers to publicly  provide information about the availability of line separation requests  on their websites, in their stores, and in other public-facing consumer  communications.   H.R. 7132 also directs the FCC to establish emergency communications  support for these survivors and to explore how to keep calls and texts  to hotlines for domestic violence, human trafficking, and other related  crimes from appearing on a customer call and text log.   For these reasons, I am pleased that we are bringing this critical  legislation forward on a bipartisan basis. I commend Representatives  Kuster, Eshoo, and Walberg for their work in advancing this legislation  out of the committee.   I know that the Senate passed a companion bill a few months ago, led  by Senator Schatz and Fischer.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this lifesaving  legislation in a bipartisan manner, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, having no  further speakers, I also urge Members on both sides of the aisle to  support H.R. 7132.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I move to  suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 7624) to make available  additional frequencies in the 3.1-3.45 GHz band for non-Federal use,  shared Federal and non-Federal use, or a combination thereof, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7624         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

TITLE VII--DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS       SEC. 701. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 7624.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 7624, the Spectrum  Innovation Act.   Our Nation's airwaves are a critical component in building next- generation wireless networks. These networks can make a meaningful  difference in Americans' lives. They can expand the reach of telehealth  services, extend educational experiences beyond the classroom, and  provide critical communications for public safety activities. But in  order to achieve these important goals, we must continue to expand the  ability of commercial users to access our airwaves, including by using  innovative spectrum management technologies.   H.R. 7624 extends the Federal Communications Commission's auction  authority by 18 months from its expiration date later this fall. This  extension will allow the FCC to hold its planned spectrum auction in  July without disruption, as well as any future actions.   It is essential that we extend this authority. After all, Congress  has never allowed this spectrum authority to lapse.   To maintain our Nation's global leadership in wireless innovation, we  must come together to ensure the smooth management of spectrum, and  that includes the auctions that have for years efficiently made these  airways available.   I am also pleased that this legislation will use auction proceeds in  a budget-neutral manner to fund two significant programs: the FCC's rip  and replace program and the transition to Next Generation 911 networks.  Funding these two longstanding priorities will provide consumers with  access to safe and secure networks that are able to meet the public  safety demands of the 21st century.   The Federal investments in Next Gen 911 will save lives. In an  instant, each of us can text a photo to a family member across the  country or upload a video to social media for all to see. That same  kind of instant communication should be accessible to 911 centers.   Next Generation 911 allows people to call or send text images or  videos to 911 to help first responders and emergency personnel to  better assess the nature of the emergency and reach people in need. It  will help enhance emergency response by shaving precious minutes off  response times and equipping first responders with lifesaving  information before they reach the scene.   In my time on the Energy and Commerce Committee, the Next Generation  911 Act has passed out of the committee and the full House of  Representatives on multiple occasions, both as a standalone bill and as  part of larger infrastructure packages. This bill marks the most  significant progress we have made in this effort thus far, and I remain  committed to working with my colleagues to see that it is signed into  law.   The Energy and Commerce Committee has traditionally worked in a  bipartisan fashion on key telecommunication matters. I commend Chairman  Pallone, Ranking Member McMorris Rodgers, and Communications and  Technology Subcommittee Ranking Member  Bob Latta, my good friend, as  well as Representatives Eshoo, Matsui, Davids, Welch, Hudson, Guthrie,  Joyce, and Johnson for continuing in this tradition on this  legislation.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this important  legislation in a bipartisan manner, and I hope the Senate will soon  follow suit.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I reserve the  balance of my time.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the  balance of my time.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the  balance of my time to close.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, but I would just like to  reiterate how important H.R. 7624 is to future technologies and to  NextGen 911. This is, as was said, a bill that passed out of our  committee unanimously, 52-0.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  give it their support when it comes up for a vote, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
