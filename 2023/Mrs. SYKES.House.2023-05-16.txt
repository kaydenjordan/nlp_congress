 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Ohio's 13th  District champions of the week: The founding mothers of the Canton  Domestic Violence Project, Helen Syrios, Nancy Boylan, and the late  Gertrude Kennedy. These three courageous women founded the Domestic  Violence Project in 1978 when domestic violence was often met with  silence, fear, and ignorance, yet they persevered. It was their  pioneering acts of empathy, strength, and resilience that would change  countless lives forever.   After 45 years, the Domestic Violence Project has provided shelter to  thousands of battered women and children in Stark County, becoming one  of the largest shelters in Ohio.  [[Page H2373]]    The Domestic Violence Project provides a lifeline to survivors, a  place where they can feel empowered, find healing, and gain the tools  necessary to break free from the cycle of abuse.   The courageous service of Helen, Nancy, and Gertrude regularly forced  them to risk their own safety to help women of all backgrounds escape  from abusive homes, and their unrelenting dedication deserves  recognition.   The countless lives that have been saved and the increased safety can  be traced back to the selflessness of Nancy, Helen, and Gertrude, who  worked so tirelessly so that no one in Ohio's 13th District felt unsafe  in their own home.   We honor their legacy, and together we will continue to build a  future where everyone feels safe, valued, and empowered.                            ____________________
