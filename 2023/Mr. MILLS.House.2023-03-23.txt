 Mr. Chairman, I rise today to state the obvious: There is  no room for woke ideologies, sexualization of our children, and CRT in  our classrooms.   The legislation before us makes a few things clear, but the main  point is this: Parents' rights matter. American citizens rose up and  demanded a seat at the table when it comes to their child's education  and curriculum, and they did that by electing a GOP majority in the  House.   I thank our leadership for bringing this legislation to the floor,  and as a father, I want to make it a priority that we state that  parents can and should protect their children. This bill ensures  parents have a voice. It is time to show the American people we stand  with parents, not educational bureaucrats who want to restrict our  understanding and visibility of the issues.   These parents are not to be labeled as domestic terrorists. They are  proud parents who want their children to succeed and not to be  indoctrinated.   Mr. Chair, I stand in great support of H.R. 5.
