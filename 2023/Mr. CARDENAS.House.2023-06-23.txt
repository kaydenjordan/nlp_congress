 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate LGBTQ Pride  Month and stand with all members of the LGBTQ community.   June celebrates the LGBTQ community and the Pride movement's  progress. It also reminds us of our history.   We have made progress in our efforts to further the LGBTQ movement  and  [[Page H3115]]  promote nationwide allyship, yet anti-trans legislation continues to be  presented in legislative bodies across the country, and hate crimes  targeting LGBTQ communities continue to rise.   The LGBTQ community and its allies will not be silenced.   The cities of Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., both hosted their  annual Pride parades on June 11 and 9, with thousands participating in  both. It is a beautiful sight to see such strong, growing support in  our hometown of Los Angeles and right here in our Nation's Capital.   Let's recommit to defending the rights and privileges of all LGBTQ  people as they face a hate-filled wave of anti-equality legislation  across our country.   For all this and more, I stand and celebrate LGBTQ Pride Month this  June.                            ____________________
