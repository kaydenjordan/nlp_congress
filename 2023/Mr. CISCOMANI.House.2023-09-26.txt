 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an incredible  constituent of mine, 9-year-old Carter Crawley.   Not only are Carter and his family constituents of mine, but I am  also lucky to have coached Carter on my flag football team.   Carter has been through some battles leading our team as quarterback,  but earlier this year he encountered the biggest battle of his life and  was diagnosed with synovial sarcoma, a cancer that affects the tissue  around your joints.   Well, I am excited to announce that just 3 weeks ago, following  months of radiation and treatment, Carter received clean scans.   I have had the privilege of being Carter's football coach for several  seasons now, and it has been a high privilege of my life to watch him  develop both as a player and as a leader.   When it came time to tackle cancer, Carter kept a good sense of humor  and bravery, and his team and I look forward to having him back on the  field leading our team once again later this year.    I also recognize his parents, Melissa and Kevin, and his 11-year-old  sister, Emerson, for their strength and fortitude during this time.   Additionally, I highlight Dr. De La Maza and her fellow doctors,  nurses, and staff at Banner UMC, where Carter was treated.   I am thrilled to share this incredible news on the House floor and  can't wait to see Carter back on that field soon.                 Tucson Boulevard Diversion Structure Project     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Tucson  Boulevard Diversion Structure project, which was named one of our  Nation's top public works projects by the American Public Works  Association.   Pima County initiated this project to address the area's persistent  sewer problem, which has plagued the community with sulfuric acid odor  and a number of other issues. The outdated sewer was replaced with a  new composite structure and a safe odor-free and corrosion-resistant  system.   The crews on this project worked 6 to 7 days a week and up to 16  hours a day, which allowed the project to be completed on time. This  achievement would not have been possible without the organizations and  companies who partnered together, including Pima County, Hunter  Contracting, Dibble, and the APWA Arizona chapter.   This project reflects the incredible impact strong partnerships have  on the community. Congratulations to these awardees and all the well- deserved recognition on a job well done.                            ____________________
