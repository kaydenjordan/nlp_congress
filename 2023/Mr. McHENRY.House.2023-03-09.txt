 Madam Speaker, I rise in recognition of the 100th  birthday of one of North Carolina's greatest statesmen, Marshall Rauch.   Growing up in Gaston County, Marshall Rauch was my State senator. He  served 24 years in the State senate, representing Gaston, Cleveland,  Lincoln, and Rutherford Counties, all parts of my congressional  district.   Prior to that, he was on the Gastonia City Council for 14 years. He  was one of the most powerful elected officials in the State, serving as  chair of the North Carolina Senate Finance Committee, and that was  before our Governor had a veto. His service was also groundbreaking.  Senator Rauch was one of the first Jewish elected officials in North  Carolina.   But let's back up to where it all started. Marshall Rauch came south  from his native New York City to play basketball at Duke University in  the 1940s. That was long before anyone had heard of Coach K. In fact,  he played for Coach Eddie Cameron in the first year that Duke Indoor  Stadium was open, long before that legendary venue would be renamed for  Coach Cameron.   Marshall's time at Duke was cut short by World War II, where he  served bravely. However, he will always have Duke to thank for meeting  his wife of 64 years, Jeanne.   After the war, they settled in Jeanne's native Gaston County, where  Marshall started Rauch Industries, thus beginning his prolific business  and political career. Rauch Industries in Gastonia grew into a leading  manufacturer. I knew it well because I mowed the grass around his  facility for a number of years.   Rauch Industries provided jobs to thousands and stood as a pillar of  the civic and charitable community in Gaston County, and we are  grateful for it.   It was not lost on anyone that this business owned by a leading  Jewish citizen was one of the world's leading manufacturers of what,  you may ask? Christmas ornaments.   Senator Rauch was recently quoted as saying: ``In Judaism, there are  eight degrees of charity, and the highest and best charity you can do  is to help someone in a manner that they don't need help anymore.''   Senator, you have done that in many ways for lots of people for a  number of years, and we are all the better for it.                      Remembering Walter Stine Isenhower     Madam Speaker, few people these days associate  politicians with humility, but Catawba County in my district benefited  from the service of one such person for many decades. Walter Stine  Isenhower, known as Mr. Catawba County, passed away in January at the  age of 95, and I rise today to honor his legacy and service to our  area.   Stine was a lifelong Republican who served as chairman of the Catawba  County Board of Commissioners and as a member of the North Carolina  House of Representatives.   His impact is still felt in the community from many issues that he  championed, including support for the local community college and the  county hospital.   Stine was a veteran of the U.S. Army and a volunteer fireman, and he  held various leadership roles with his beloved church, Concordia  Lutheran.   His favorite saying was that a day out of Catawba County is a day  wasted. We thank Stine for devoting his life to making our lives  better.                            ____________________
