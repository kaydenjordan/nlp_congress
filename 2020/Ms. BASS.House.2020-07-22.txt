 Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I rise today to  coanchor the Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour. For the  next 60 minutes, we have a chance to communicate to the American people  our great love for an American hero, Representative John Lewis.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from the great State of  California (Ms. Pelosi), my colleague and the honorable Speaker from  the city of San Francisco.    Mr. Speaker, the Nation lost an icon; the House lost its  most respected Member; and the Congressional Black Caucus lost the most  senior member of our family.   The Congressional Black Caucus is known as the conscience of the  Congress, but John Lewis was known as the conscience of our Congress.  One of the greatest honors of serving in Congress was that I had the  possibility of serving with him.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the State of South  Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), the majority whip.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from the District  of Columbia (Ms. Norton), the state of the District of Columbia.    Mr. Speaker, his legacy to our country is that he devoted  his life to fighting for justice and being a moral compass to our  Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the great State of  Virginia (Mr. Scott).    Mr. Speaker, Congressman John Lewis spent his life fighting  racism and injustice wherever he confronted it, from Boy Scout sit-ins  and other protests in the streets to championing bold, progressive  policies in Congress, including the Voting Rights Act.                                time  1845     Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Danny K. Davis).    Now that he is no longer with us, we have to live up to his  legacy and protect the right to vote for all Americans. As we continue  to face challenges due to the coronavirus and issues of systemic  racism, we must protect our democracy and elections, even in the midst  of adversity.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Meeks).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  David Scott).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Green).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms.  Clarke).    To honor Mr. Lewis, the first thing we need to do is to  pass legislation restoring the Voting Rights Act and get it signed. We  know the credibility of our elections has already shown early signs of  concern during several State primaries and voter suppression cases,  coupled with the fact that people are going to have to vote in  dangerous conditions, cannot be ignored. I know that if Mr. Lewis was  still with us, he would be leading that fight.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
