 Mr. President, the latest inflation numbers came out on  Friday, and it has become par for the course in the Biden economy that  they weren't pretty.   Inflation hit 8.6 percent in May, the worst inflation since December  of 1981. Grocery prices increased nearly 12 percent on average. Eggs  were up 32 percent; chicken was up 17 percent; milk was up 15 percent;  and the list goes on and on.   Gas prices were up 48 percent. Since President Biden took office, the  price of gas has more than doubled. Gas is at $5 a gallon, and the  price of diesel, so essential to our Nation's farmers and ranchers, is  even worse. The problem is, there is no end in sight. JPMorgan  estimates that gas prices could exceed $6 a gallon by August. Other  energy costs have also increased with electricity up 12 percent and  utility gas service up 30 percent.   By one estimate, inflation is costing American households $460 per  month. That is right: $460 per month. It is no surprise that in a  recent poll, 83 percent of respondents--83 percent--describe the state  of the economy as ``poor'' or ``not so good'' or that just 27 percent  said they have a good chance of improving their standard of living.   President Biden likes to talk about creating ``an economy that works  for working families.'' Well, I have news for the President. This  economy is not working for working families. Working families can't  absorb an additional $460 a month. They have to cut back. They have to  put off needed car repairs or eliminate a family vacation or cut down  on milk for their kids. The President said the other day that ``[the  economy] is strong as can be but for inflation, but for gas and food.''   But for gas and food? Well, I have to tell you, gas and food prices  are two pretty essential economic measures for families.   Moms and dads wondering how they can afford to fill up their cars to  get to work or get their kids to baseball practice don't care how good  the President says the economy is when the price of a tank of gas has  more than doubled since the President took office.   I guess we can at least be glad the Democrats and the President have  finally started acknowledging our inflation crisis. For months last  year, as inflation climbed, the administration dismissed those  concerns. Even as it became more and more clear that we had a long-term  problem on our hands, the President and congressional Democrats spent  their time focusing not on solutions to our inflation crisis but on a  massive spending spree almost guaranteed to make our inflation problem  worse.   That is right. Let's remember how we got here. When President Biden  took office, inflation was at 1.4 percent, well within the Fed's target  inflation rate of 2 percent. And it might have stayed there had  Democrats not decided to pass a massive and partisan $1.9 trillion  spending spree under the guise of COVID relief mere weeks after the  Congress had passed a fifth bipartisan COVID bill that met essentially  all current pressing COVID needs.   The Democrats' so-called American Rescue Plan sent a lot of  unnecessary government money into the economy, and the economy  overheated as a result.   And you don't have to take my word for it.   Here is what one Democratic economist who worked in the Obama  administration had to say on the subject:         The $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan passed in the early       days of the Biden administration will go down in history as       an extraordinary policy mistake.    Let me just repeat that.         The $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan passed in the early       days of the Biden administration will go down in history as       an extraordinary policy mistake.    That is a direct quote from a Democratic economist who worked in the  Obama administration.   Democrats were warned that the American Rescue Plan ran the risk of  overstimulating the economy, but they went ahead anyway. What is almost  worse was their subsequent decision to pursue another massive spending  spree, their so-called Build Back Better plan, even after it had become  clear that their first spending spree had helped plunge our economy  into a serious inflationary crisis.   Even now--even now--as Americans deal with the worst inflation in  decades, it is looking like Democrats are trying to revive elements of  their Build Back Better plan and use reconciliation rules to pass yet  another partisan spending spree. It is the triumph  [[Page S2924]]  of Big Government ideology over economic reality. If Democrats succeed  in passing another partisan spending spree using reconciliation rules,  Americans' economic situation is going to get even worse.   Unfortunately, there is no easy solution to the Democrats' largely  self-inflicted inflation crisis, but the first priority is to do no  more harm. That means no more partisan spending sprees like the  Democrats' Build Back Better plan.   Another big priority should be unleashing American energy  production--in particular, the domestic production of oil and gas--to  ease energy prices. High gas and energy prices fuel higher consumer  prices across the board--no question about it. Unleashing American  energy production would not only help reduce the price of gas, but it  could also help rein in prices for other commodities. Unfortunately,  the President has demonstrated a clear hostility to conventional energy  production, which is discouraging investment in American energy and  prolonging the current gas price situation.   Another thing we should be doing to help make life easier for  consumers is trying to ease supply chain woes whether that involves  removing burdensome trucking regulations or passing legislation like my  Ocean Shipping Reform Act.   I am pleased that both Democrats and Republicans have come together  to support my bipartisan bill, which I introduced, along with Senator  Klobuchar, earlier this year. I am particularly grateful to my fellow  South Dakotan, Representative Dusty Johnson, who helped usher this  legislation through the House of Representatives.   The Ocean Shipping Reform Act would help ease supply chain pressures  by addressing unfair ocean carrier practices, speeding up the  resolution of detention and demurrage disputes, and improving the  movement of goods at our Nation's ports. It won't solve our Nation's  inflation crisis, but it should help make life easier for U.S.  exporters, importers, and consumers alike.   I am very pleased that this legislation passed the House of  Representatives yesterday and that it will soon be on its way to the  President's desk, and I hope that we will be able to pursue more  bipartisan propositions to help make life easier for American families.   Democrats' big-spending, Big Government agenda has resulted in a lot  of pain for working families. If President Biden and Democrats really  want to make life better for ordinary Americans, they will decisively  reject any further spending sprees and work with Republicans to do what  we can to alleviate the inflation crisis the Democrats have helped  create.   I yield the floor.
