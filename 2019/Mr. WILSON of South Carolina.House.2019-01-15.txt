 Madam Speaker, America is grateful for  our alliance with Finland, a loyal NATO partner, to promote regional  security.   Finnish Defense Minister Jussi Niinisto wrote an article in Defense  News reviewing our partnership:   ``Today, the Finnish Defence Forces are more capable and more  interoperable than they have ever been. That makes [Finland] effective  in looking after our own security and a solid partner for other EU  member states and NATO countries.   ``During my time as the minister of defense of Finland, we have taken  other steps to strengthen the trans-Atlantic link. A prime example is  our bilateral defense relationship with the  [[Page H555]]  United States. In October 2016, we signed our bilateral statement of  intent on defense cooperation. This was later followed by a trilateral  statement of intent between Finland, Sweden, and the United States in  May 2018.''   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
