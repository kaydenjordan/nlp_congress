 Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that, on  behalf of Delaware's congressional delegation, I wish to honor the  exemplary service of educator and Delaware State Education Association  leader Frederika S. Jenner. She has served Delaware as a teacher and  education advocate since 1972, and during that time, she worked to  effectively improve our education system and shape thousands of young  children's lives. Frederika has now retired after more than four  decades of serving in Delaware's schools and advocating on behalf of  its students and teachers. She is a selfless education advocate and  adviser, as well as a devoted wife and mother. Delaware's education  system and countless Delawareans will benefit from her life's work for  decades to come.   Frederika is a graduate of A.I. DuPont High School in Wilmington, DE.  She earned her bachelor's degree in education from Goucher College in  Baltimore and then returned to Delaware where she taught elementary  school for 39 years. She had such a dedication to education that she  furthered her own while she was teaching and ultimately received her  master's in instruction from the University of Delaware. Although she  started as an English and reading specialist, Frederika took a leap to  become a science teacher along the way, teaching herself and earning  her certification all in the first year in her new position. From then  on, science remained an intense passion of hers, as well as a focus of  much of her work both in and out of the classroom. Throughout her  career, Frederika also encouraged a love of reading among her students  and took great pride in her voluminous classroom library, with over  2,000 books on its shelves.   Throughout her many years in the classroom, Frederika became a  trusted voice among her fellow educators. From day one, she was  involved as a building representative for the Delaware State Education  Association, and her activism grew from there. Later, she would serve  as president of the 1,200-member Red Clay Education Association and  then went on to serve as an executive board member of the Delaware  State Education Association for 3 years. In 2011, Frederika was elected  president of the Delaware State Education Association. In that role,  she emerged as a strong and fair leader, working to shape education  policy decisionmaking. For many years, she served as the bridge between  DSEA members and public officials as the State worked to create and  implement  [[Page S8180]]  new educational standards that we use today and to chart a course to  reach them.   Frederika also took on the task of improving science education in  Delaware. She worked for 5 years as a Coalition science specialist and  helped school districts all over Delaware integrate new State science  standards and innovative teaching practices, including the Smithsonian  Kits Programs. She regularly traveled the State, training teachers and  delivering necessary supplies--everything from magnets and batteries to  live crayfish, all in the interest of ensuring that students receiving  hands-on science training. In 2010, Delaware Governor Jack Markell  recognized her immense capabilities and appointed Frederika to the  State Employee Advisory Committee.   There is a reason why, as Governor of Delaware, I was laser-focused  on education and strengthening families. I believe these are two areas  where we can make a lasting difference in the trajectory of a young  person's life. Frederika shares this belief and dedicated her career to  the young people of Delaware. On behalf of both U.S. Senator Chris  Coons and U.S. Representative Lisa Blunt Rochester, I want to thank  Frederika S. Jenner for her service to the people of Delaware. Her love  of children, along with her leadership and dedication to the notion  that all children can learn, have improved the quality of education for  countless Delawareans who were fortunate enough to be in her classroom  and many who were not. However, all Delawareans have benefitted from  the educational system she has worked so hard to help improve.   We are delighted to offer today our heartfelt congratulations to  Frederika Jenner on a job well done, and we want to convey our thanks  as well to her husband, Charles, and their sons Andrew and Nick for  sharing with the children of Delaware a remarkable woman and  educator.                            ____________________
