 Mr. Speaker, today, I am proud to  recognize my friend, Mr. Bo Biggs of Lumberton, North Carolina, on the  occasion of his ascension to the chairmanship of the Golden LEAF  Foundation, and in doing so, to acknowledge the significance to North  Carolina of the organization he now leads.   Bo is an indefatigable servant of his community and state in  business, professional, and civic leadership. Bo's life of service  includes Antioch Baptist Church of Lumberton, the Lumberton Rotary  Club, of which he is past president, the Lumberton Area Chamber of  Commerce, the North Carolina Association of Certified Public  Accountants, the FreeEnterprise Foundation, the Retail Merchants  Association, and still others.   Time and again, Bo has invested himself in the State of North  Carolina and its citizens, and that is why I am honored to recognize  his new role with an organization that is committed to the same. I have  seen firsthand the impact of Golden LEAF in North Carolina. It promotes  cutting edge agriculture, creates new jobs, and provides scholarships  for future leaders.    The Golden LEAF Foundation has a 20-year history of investing in  Carolinians with over 60,000 jobs created, $624 million in new payroll  stimulated in economically distressed areas.                            ____________________
