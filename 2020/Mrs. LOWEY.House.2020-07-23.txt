 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1060, I call up  the bill (H.R. 7608) making appropriations for the Department of State,  foreign operations, and related programs for the fiscal year ending  September 30, 2021, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   This minibus combines four bills: State and Foreign Operations;  Agriculture, Rural Development, FDA; Interior, Environment; and  Military Construction and Veterans Affairs.   The package is the product of months of thoughtful deliberation and  input from Members on both sides of the aisle. I am proud of the work  we have completed under the incredibly difficult circumstances of the  COVID-19 pandemic.   This appropriations package addresses urgent national priorities. I  would like to highlight a few of our key successes that our cardinals  have secured: strong funding and protections to help put nutritious  food on people's tables during this time of economic crisis and rising  food insecurity; increased investments in broadband to connect more  Americans to work, school, healthcare, and family; robust funding to  protect the environment and build resilience to climate change; and  $12.5 billion in emergency funding to address sharply rising veterans'  healthcare costs.   I am proud that the package also includes strong emergency  appropriations to confront coronavirus and support economic recovery,  with investments in critical infrastructure and coronavirus  preparedness, response, and relief domestically and globally.   Turning to the State and Foreign Operations division, it is  bittersweet to bring my last State and Foreign Operations bill to the  floor before I retire. As subcommittee chairwoman or ranking member for  two of my three decades here, I am honored to have been entrusted with  this responsibility on this bill that has been a key component of  United States foreign policy since World War II.   The work of the subcommittee has been marked historically by  bipartisanship, and I thank former Chair and Ranking Member Hal Rogers  and former Chair and Ranking Member Kay Granger for their partnership  to advance this vital legislation each year.   Pivotal moments, from September 11th to the devastation the  coronavirus pandemic continues to cause, underscore the significant  value of foreign aid. It promotes freedom and democracy and supports  global development and security, all of which increase stability and  mitigate threats to Americans here at home.   Indeed, our own children and grandchildren are more secure as a  result of the United States' foreign assistance that has made the world  better, safer, and healthier for generations, efforts that are  continued in the fiscal year 2021 State and Foreign Operations bill we  consider today.   With a total of $65.87 billion, it rejects the President's go-it- alone approach to foreign policy. The bill includes $47.85 billion in  base funding, $8 billion in Overseas Contingency Operations funds for  base requirements that otherwise would not be funded by the President's  budget request, and $10.018 billion in urgently needed coronavirus  emergency funding to mitigate COVID-19's impact on our health and  economy.   To ensure this pandemic does not derail decades of development gains,  this bill provides $3.8 billion in base funding for development  assistance. This includes $975 million to increase access to basic  education, of which not less than $150 million shall be spent on girls'  education in areas of conflict.   It effectively addresses food insecurity, poor water and sanitation  services, trafficking in persons, and other long-term development  objectives.   The bill's holistic approach to global health seeks to bolster low-  and middle-income countries' management of health threats and  communicable diseases.   It would sustain progress against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria  with $5.93 billion for global HIV/AIDS activities, including $1.56  billion for the Global Fund, for which it clarifies the United States'  commitment to our 33 percent share.   It also reverses the President's global gag rule, stops  counterproductive restrictions on family planning and health funding,  and includes $805.5 million for family planning services, of which  $55.5 million is for the United Nations Population Fund.   The bill provides restoration of funds for the World Health  Organization to ensure American influence in an organization critical  to the development and distribution of vaccines.                                time  1415    To address policies of the administration that harm our neighbors and  drive migration, the bill amends prior-year appropriations acts to  significantly limit the President's ability to redirect assistance  outside of the region.   It also maintains robust funding for counternarcotics and law  enforcement efforts in Colombia, Mexico, Central America, and the  Caribbean; includes $68 million to address international organized  crime; and maintains funding to combat cybercrime.   The bill provides $9 billion for security assistance to key allies  and partners with support for programs in Eastern Europe, Jordan, and  Tunisia. It keeps the commitments of the United States at Camp David to  promote peace in the Middle East by providing $3.3 billion in aid for  Israel's security as well as assistance for Egypt.   It restores humanitarian and development assistance to Palestinians  with resources to organizations working in the West Bank and Gaza, and  it advances a bipartisan priority, with $50 million to fund a new  partnership for peace that would strengthen economic development and  engagement between Palestinians and Israelis. It includes $7.83 billion  in refugee and disaster assistance, including to Latin America, the  Middle East, Asia, and Africa.   Additionally, the bill prioritizes the security of diplomatic and  development staff and facilities with $6.071 billion for embassy  security, which is $692.2 million above the President's request.   To effectively engage allies and reclaim our leadership role, this  bill reaffirms our support for international partners and multilateral  organizations, which extends the impact of our assistance, and  facilitates delivery of urgent aid to mitigate human suffering.   Lastly, to combat the destabilizing and persistent threats posed by  climate change, the bill provides funds in this and prior acts to  support multilateral efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It  also strengthens conservation and environment programs and continues  funding for adaptation and renewable energy programs at prior-year  levels.   This bill reflects our common belief in the absolute necessity of  effective diplomacy, global engagement, and robust development  assistance to protect our own national security even as we address  moral imperatives beyond our own borders.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my subcommittee staff who have worked in  difficult circumstances to prepare the bill, including Majority Clerk  Steve Marchese; staff Craig Higgins, Erin Kolodjeski, Dean Koulouris,  Jason Wheelock, Marin Stein, Jean Kwon, Clelia Alvarado; Minority Clerk  Susan Adams; Jamie McCormick; Austin Gage of Ranking Member Rogers'  congressional staff; and finally, Wendy Coursen, Kelly Healton, Dana  Acton,  [[Page H3791]]  and Elizabeth Stanley in my congressional office.   Mr. Speaker, I express my gratitude to more past staff members and  fellows than we have time to name today who have supported my work on  the subcommittee. They are:   Matthew Traub, Beth Tritter, Howard Wolfson, Clare Coleman, Jean  Doyle, Jenny Luray, Scott Fleming, Mark Isaac, Heather Howard, Jim  Townsend, Chris Bigelow, Lucy Heenan, Ann Vaughn, Talia Dubovi, Liz  Leibowitz, Sonali Korde, Joe Weinstein, Brigid Otieno, Mark Carrato,  Mark Lopes, Barbara Feinstein, Dennis Vega, Cortney Dunn, Megan Oates,  Jennifer Munoz, Karen Larson, Ashley Quarcoo, Ralph Falzone, Mark  Murray, Nisha Biswal, Michele Sumilas, and Michael Marek.   Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, I urge support for the bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Bishop), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Agriculture,  Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies.    I yield the gentleman from Georgia an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the majority leader.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. McCollum), who is the distinguished chair of the  Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5\1/2\ minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), chairwoman of the  Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related  Agencies.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, this package of appropriations bills will  help make our Nations stronger at home and respected again in the  world.   Together, we can bolster food security, combat climate change,  protect our environment, aid the world's most vulnerable people, and  meet our commitments to our veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this important legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I claim time in opposition to the  gentleman's amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, our committee has worked hard on a bipartisan basis to  craft a bill that provides the necessary tools to the Secretary of  State and the USAID administrator to advance United States foreign  policy.   Mr. Speaker, I have long opposed amendments that indiscriminately  apply across-the-board cuts to the carefully considered funding in this  bill, which addressed many of the requests brought to the committee  from both Democrats and Republicans in the House.   Such amendments make no provision for protecting high-priority  programs and activities. For example, this amendment would cut $165  million  [[Page H3799]]  from security assistance for Israel. It would cut $457 million from  global health programs, including $296 million less for HIV/AIDS  activity. This amendment would cut $391 million from lifesaving  humanitarian assistance and $305 million from funds made available to  protect our diplomats and development personnel and the facilities in  which they work and live overseas.   In addition to assistance for our ally Israel, cuts would also impact  funding for other key allies, such as Jordan, Egypt, Ukraine, Colombia,  and countries in Eastern Europe that are battling Russian aggression  and disinformation.   I strongly urge a ``no'' vote on the gentleman's amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Rogers), the distinguished ranking member on the State,  Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, our national security is strongest when development,  diplomacy, and defense are equally prioritized. This amendment  undermines U.S. leadership and diminishes our engagement in the world.   Yes, I do think of my eight grandchildren when I urge my colleagues  to oppose this amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1060, I offer  amendments en bloc.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. Craig).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Dingell), the co-chair of the DPCC.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentlewoman from  Nevada (Ms. Titus).    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 45 seconds to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Ruiz).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentlewoman from  New Jersey (Ms. Sherrill).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Soto).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Panetta).

Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Dingell), the co-chair of the DPCC.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Foster.)  [[Page H3816]]         Mr. Speaker, before I introduce the next speaker, I just  want to say a few words about SESAME, because it is an extraordinary  project, and I thank the gentleman for bringing it to this body's  attention.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.  Cohen).                                time  1600     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Texas.

Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1060, I offer  amendments en bloc.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I claim time in opposition.   There are many things in this en bloc that I oppose, and I could  speak to each issue, but I want to reserve my comments for the attack  on climate change.   Most of us, even my friends across the aisle, agree that climate  change is a real global threat. Our military also believes this.   I cannot emphasize enough that climate change is exacerbating the  root causes of conflict. We will see an increasing demand on our  humanitarian aid and other resources if we do not address it now.   Prohibiting U.S. contributions to the multilaterals that combat  climate change is a shortsighted, harmful policy that does not prepare  our country to face this threat.   We cannot afford to stand idly by while others address climate  change. We already feel its effects. We should not be alienating  multilateral partners. We need to join the fight.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Panetta).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), the chairwoman of the Subcommittee on  Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies.    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Ms. Tlaib). Welcome to her children, too.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
