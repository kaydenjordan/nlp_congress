 Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the 30th  anniversary of the former South African President Nelson Mandela's  release from jail.   Mandela worked tirelessly to abolish apartheid, empower his fellow  citizens, and fight the injustices against the disenfranchised people  of South Africa.   Mandela's efforts led not only to his 27-year imprisonment and  subsequent ascent to the presidency, but it also transformed the  consciousness of a generation and precipitated a more acute  international focus on human rights. I hope we are all informed by his  wise words: ``May your choices reflect your hopes, not your fears.''   Here in this Chamber and around the world we should all feel indebted  to him for his service and commitment to justice.  [[Page H1038]]                                ____________________
