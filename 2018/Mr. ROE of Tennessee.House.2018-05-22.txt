 Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Burgess.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S. 204, the Right to  Try Act.   I am a physician and scientist with almost 40 years of experience in  treating patients, and far too many of them, Mr. Speaker, have been  diagnosed with cancer.   A little over 3 years ago, my beloved wife, Pam Roe, who was a nurse,  died of stage IV colon cancer, 5 weeks to the day after she was  operated on. Pam would have liked the right to try.   Less than 2 months after that, one of the best friends I will ever  have in my life, Phil Street, a Vietnam veteran, Air Force veteran,  died of cancer related to Agent Orange. Phil would have liked to have  had the right to try.   My senior partner in medical practice, a year later, good friend, Dr.  Bill Bone, was diagnosed with brain cancer. Bill died. He would have  liked to have had the right to try.   Shortly after that, Linda Baines, a scrub nurse that I operated with  hundreds of times in my medical practice, was diagnosed with brain  cancer and died shortly after that. Linda would have liked to have had  the right to try.   Currently, I have three friends at this moment who are being treated  with stage IV cancer. If those treatments don't work, they would like  to have the right to try.   Mr. Speaker, my first pediatric rotation in medical school was at St.  Jude Children's Hospital, where, at that time, 80 percent of children  died of their disease. I can still see many of those children's faces  today, and that was almost 50 years ago. Those children, today, have an  80 percent chance of living, but, as was stated, 16,000 parents have to  face that this year.   I have had the misfortune of having to look patients in the eye and  say: Your life is not in my hands anymore;  [[Page H4355]]  it is in God's hands. In that moment, I will tell you this: all that  these patients want and deserve is a right to try.   Please support this legislation.
