 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk on behalf  of myself and Senators Hawley, Ernst, and Braun.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question for counsel for the President from  Senator Lee and other Senators:         Under the standard embraced by the House Managers, would       President Obama have been subject to impeachment charges       based on his handling of the Benghazi attack, the Bergdahl       swap, or DACA? Would President Bush have been subject to       impeachment charges based on his handling of NSA       surveillance, detention of combatants, or use of       waterboarding?    Mr. Counsel HERSCHMANN. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the  Senate. Under the standard, which is no standard that they bring their  impeachment to the Senate, any President would be subject to  impeachment for anything. Presidents would be subject to impeachment  for exercising longstanding constitutional rights, even when the House  chose not to enforce their subpoenas under their vague theory of abuse  of power.   I guess any President--as Professor Dershowitz, he had a long list of  Presidents who might have been subject to impeachment. So I am not  going to go through the particular incidents because I don't want to  besmirch past Presidents.   I don't think the standard that they announced is helpful. I think it  is very dangerous. I mean, you might want to get a lock on that door  because they are going to be back a lot if that is the standard.   The truth of the matter is, you don't have to look at anything. They  are talking about witnesses. You don't have to look at anything, except  the Articles of Impeachment.   I tried to seek areas of agreement. I think we all agree that they  don't allege a crime. That is why they spend all their time saying you  don't need one. I remember one of the clips I showed where someone was  saying, with a lot of passion, they are trying to cross out ``high  crime'' and make it ``any crime.'' Now they are trying to cross out  ``crime,'' any crime. No crime is necessary.   That is not what impeachment is about. This is dangerous. And it is  more dangerous because it is an election year. So, yes, under the  standardless impeachment, any President can be impeached for anything.  And that is wrong. By the way, they should be held to their Articles of  Impeachment. A lot of what they are trying to sell here, their own  House colleagues weren't buying. They didn't make it into the Articles  of Impeachment.   Read the Articles of Impeachment. They don't allege a crime. They  don't allege a violation of law. You don't need anything else, except  their Articles of Impeachment, your Constitution, and your common  sense, and you can end this. Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from Michigan.
