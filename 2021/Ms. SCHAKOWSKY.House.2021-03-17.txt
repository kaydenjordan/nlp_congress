 Madam Speaker, every single constitution in the world  [[Page H1418]]  drafted since 1950 has the equivalent of the equal rights amendment,  except the United States of America.   Though some might say otherwise, it is clear that women need the  equal rights amendment, and we need it now. We need the ERA to  strengthen the movement women have been building to achieve paycheck  fairness and paid family leave, to prevent discrimination against women  who are pregnant in the workplace, and to fight for comprehensive  reproductive health for all women and girls.   Today, I will vote for the equal rights amendment to assure that my  granddaughters, that women and girls throughout the world and  throughout the country, are not only strong, powerful, and resilient,  but also equal here in the United States under the Constitution.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, had I been present, I would have voted  ``yea'' on rollcall No. 88.    Mr. Speaker, I want to begin my remarks about Women's  History Month with a little quiz. Who was the first woman of color to  serve in this body, in the United States House of Representatives?   I think I hear somebody saying maybe it was Shirley Chisolm. Shirley  Chisolm certainly was a groundbreaking leader, but she was not the  first woman of color. It was a woman named Patsy Mink.   Patsy Takemoto Mink was born in the territory of Hawaii in 1927. She  became a lawyer at the University of Chicago. That is my hometown. Not  frequent for women to do that. In fact, she couldn't get a job, so she  set up her own practice.   But she got really interested in politics, and she served in the  territorial House and Senate. And guess what? She was the first woman  ever to be in that body. She was a groundbreaker.   In 1964, 5 years after Hawaii became a State, Patsy ran for the  United States Congress, the first woman of color and the first Asian  American and the first woman to represent Hawaii.   She championed early childhood education, introduced the first  childcare bill in Congress, and she was a groundbreaker by introducing  title IX. This was legislation that itself was groundbreaking. An  amendment to the Higher Education Act, title IX, ensured that women  could not be excluded from participating in school activities or  participating in collegiate athletics. Believe me, this was not an easy  bill to pass.   That same year, she actually did run for President. That was about 2  years before Shirley Chisolm did. A very short race. She was an anti- Vietnam war candidate. Then she dropped out to run for Senate and lost  that race.   But she came back to the United States Congress to serve once again.  I have to tell you that I had the pleasure--when I came here in 1999,  Patsy Mink was here, a fierce and tiny woman whom you could not resist.   I want to say today that we need to lift the name of Patsy Mink  higher. People don't know who she is or who she was or what she  accomplished for women. I am determined that we will do something in  this House of Representatives to acknowledge and honor the great work  of Patsy Mink.
