 Madam Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong opposition  to President Biden's budget proposal for its exclusion of the Hyde  amendment, which for 45 years has protected Americans from forced  financial complicity in abortion and abortion services.   When Congress passed the Hyde amendment in 1976, our country's  lawmakers had the sense and decency to agree that if abortions were  going to take place in this country, then at least dissenting Americans  wouldn't get stuck with the bill. Forcing people to pay for the killing  of babies with their tax dollars is unconscionable. That is why the  Hyde amendment was passed.   Now, the President wants to revoke this protection, as if his $6  trillion budget--which would blatantly require us to raise taxes or  print money unto bankruptcy--wasn't already disastrous enough.   I believe that life begins at conception and that unborn children in  our country have a right to live. Every Member of Congress should, but  one does not need to in order to support the Hyde amendment, which  prohibits the Federal Government from forcing the American public to do  something that we should never ask them to do: pay for abortions.                       Hutchinson Football Championship     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the First District's  Hutchinson Community College football team on their National Junior  College Athletic Association National Championship.   Earlier this month I spoke on this very floor about playing eight-man  football in rural Kansas. I indicated there were clear winners and  losers in the game. On June 5, 2021, the Blue Dragons finished the  regular season as clear winners, undefeated, and ranked number one. On  top of that, first year Head Coach Drew Dallas went on to be named the  2020 through 2021 NJCAA Football Coach of the Year.   This is the program's first national championship and third  undefeated season. The talent, time, and effort that these student  athletes put into playing football while obtaining a college education  is remarkable.   Congratulations again to the Hutchinson Community College football  team and to Coach Dallas.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to address the troubling impact  that inflation is having on the American people.   Raising a family during good economic times is hard enough, but times  of high inflation make it even more difficult. With prices rising at  paces not seen since 1991, families are being forced to make tough  decisions and stretch their paychecks even further.   During his Presidential campaign, Joe Biden promised not to raise  taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 per year. However, his  spending habit is fueling inflation, which is a tax on every American.  In fact, it is worse than an ordinary tax because it is regressive,  hitting the working class the hardest.   President Biden and Democrats would have the American people believe  that debt doesn't matter, and that the government can spend an endless  amount of money on whatever they like. However, that could not be  further from the truth.   To stop the cost of things from accelerating even higher, we must end  our spending addiction and get the national debt under control.
