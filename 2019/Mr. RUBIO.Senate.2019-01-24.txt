 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I wanted to take a moment to address the  recent events in the nation of Venezuela, but before I do, I want to  take the opportunity to congratulate the Presiding Officer, my  colleague from the great State of Florida, who a few moments ago I  believe gave his speech on the floor of the Senate--and gave part of it  in Spanish, and did it very well--and spoke about the important issue  of Puerto Rico. His leadership here on that is going to be critical. It  is an issue I know he knows very well from his time as Governor of our  State.   I know this is another cause he cares about. He took leadership on it  as the Governor of the State of Florida. As recently as 2 nights ago,  he was with me and some others, and together we met with the President  of the United States to talk about what is happening in Venezuela.   The most important answer we have to have for the American people is,  Why should it matter to us? Why should America even be involved in  this, beyond expressing an opinion or sending a letter or even a vote  on an international organism? Why should America lead, and why should  America be so intricately involved in something going on in another  country?   That is always a valid question. It is the most important question we  have to consistently answer and not take for granted. I think we don't  do that enough anymore in American foreign policy. It has allowed some  to argue that perhaps the United States gets too engaged around the  world.   We are a nation that should always stand for our principles, and we  should defend them and stand with those around the world who share the  principles of human liberty and dignity and freedom and respect for  human rights. When the United States gets deeply involved in something  in another country, it must also be in our national interests.   The only reason why being involved in the issues that are going on in  Venezuela can be justified to the men and women of this Nation, for  whom we work, is to prove to them and argue to them and convince them  that what is happening there is not just about Venezuela, but it is in  the national interests of the United States.   Before I can do that, I have to lay out the history of what brings us  to  [[Page S577]]  this point. I will not go into great detail because the time does not  permit it. Venezuela has a Constitution. In fact, it has a Constitution  that was put in place during the rule of Hugo Chavez--someone whom I  was certainly not a fan of and who was not a fan of the United States.   Under that Constitution, there was a parliamentary body of the  National Assembly, and there was a Presidency and a supreme court. What  happened a few years ago is that when Chavez died and Nicolas Maduro-- the current dictator of the country--took over, he had to stand for  election. Before he stood for election, there was an election to the  National Assembly. The party that was Hugo Chavez's party and now  Maduro's party was trounced. They lost badly. They didn't just lose the  National Assembly. They lost Governors' seats across the country.   Maduro realized that his party, and he himself, could not survive in  a truly democratic system. What he did is he canceled the National  Assembly. First, he started ignoring them. He stopped following their  orders. They would pass a bill, and he wouldn't implement it. He would  completely ignore it, as if they didn't exist.   Then, he replaced a supreme court with handpicked people who would do  what he wanted to do. The equivalent would be if the President of the  United States decided that no matter what law we passed, even if we  overrode a veto, he just wouldn't implement it and would refuse to do  it.   Then, at some point, he actually tried to create an alternative to  the National Assembly. He created, out of thin air, this thing called  the Constituent Assembly, which is an idea he got from the Cubans and  from Communist countries, and gave them extraordinary powers to do all  sorts of things.   One of the things that Constituent Assembly did is they created an  election late last spring. People would say Maduro stood for election,  and he won--theoretically. At least that is their argument. You can  have an election and it not be a real election.   For example, every one of the media outlets in the country is  controlled by the government. All of them have to run, by law--they are  mandated to provide what they call network coverage across the board  any time he speaks to the nation.   The opposition party doesn't have that same opportunity. He  manipulated vote tallies. They were able to go in and make sure votes  were counted in a certain way. They control votes through the food  program. Forty-two percent of the people in Venezuela depend on a food  program run by the government. To have that food program, you have to  have an identification card. When you go vote, that same identification  card doesn't just register whether you voted or not, they know whom you  voted for. They know whom you voted for.   If you didn't show up to vote and you didn't vote for whom they  wanted you to vote, meaning Maduro, you got cut off from your food  program. If you had to choose between voting for someone you didn't  like or not feeding your family, you were going to vote for someone you  did not like.   Despite all that, the turnouts were abysmally low. The images that  came out--there were two people in line, in some cases. Sometimes they  caught the same five people making the line over and over again. It  wasn't a real election.   By the way, he legally disqualified every credible opponent he could  have possibly had. Because it was a fake election, the opposition  boycotted it. So he didn't even have real opposition.   He won this fake election. Then came January, and he tried to be  sworn in. He was, through a ceremony, but it was not legitimate. It  would be the same as if the President of the United States announced  that he was calling new elections, not in 2020; we are going to have  them in April of this year. If he wins, he will get to serve 6 years  instead of 4.   Everybody here would say that is not the Constitution. It is not a  constitutional election. That is what they did. It is not a reelection.  Under the Constitution of Venezuela, because that was not legitimate,  you have a vacancy in the Office of the Presidency.   Under the Constitution of Venezuela, similar to ours, when there is a  vacancy in the Presidency--and by virtue of that the Vice Presidency  because he was elected alongside--the President of the country becomes  the equivalent of our Speaker of the House, the same line of succession  we have here. He becomes the President of the National Assembly.   The President of the National Assembly assumes that charge as interim  President and within 45 days has to call valid constitutional  elections. That is what happened yesterday. The valid President of the  National Assembly called, assumed the responsibility of interim  President, and now within the next 45 days he will have to schedule and  call for elections.   The United States responded to that by stating the obvious. This is  not constitutional. It is not legitimate. We don't recognize this fake  President. We recognize your Constitution and the President whom the  Constitution says is in place, this interim President.   This is not a guy who is trying to be President himself for 6 years.  This is not a fight between two political parties, not some civil war  like we see in other parts of the world between two competing bands.  This is basically the person who has been elected, the President of the  National Assembly assuming an interim position who is now a caretaker  to guide the country back toward a constitutional democracy. The United  States recognizes it.   It is stunning to see some of the reporting on this here and around  the world; that he basically proclaimed himself the President. No, he  just assumed his constitutional responsibility. The United States did  something unusual in recognizing him. No. 1, it is not unusual. It is  the Constitution of Venezuela; and No. 2, it was not just the United  States.   We were immediately joined by 11 countries in the region. That number  is now up to 16 in the Western Hemisphere--Colombia, Chili, Peru,  Brazil, Argentina, Honduras, Guatemala--all of them, lined up, and  more, and reflected the same position the United States has taken on  this issue. So did France. Apparently, so did the United Kingdom today  and Albania and Kosovo and a growing number of countries. Even the  European Union says Maduro is illegitimate. They have not gone as far  as to recognize the interim President as the interim President, but  they have said he is illegitimate, and at the National Assembly he is  legitimate.   It is not unusual. It happens to be the global norm. Who disagrees  with us other than Maduro? Cuba, Turkey, Russia, Iran, Egypt,  apparently. What do they have in common? Think about it. These are not  democracies. They have their own interests here at heart.   Some might ask: How does this guy hold on to power if he is so  terrible? No. 1, he controls access to food. I can tell you, if you  control access to food and medicine and you threaten people with  hunger, you will have a lot of control. The other thing he has done is,  he uses migration as a relief valve. It is a very Cuban regime-type  tactic.   It is estimated that over 2.3 million people--basically 1 out of 12  Venezuelans--have left the country since 2015. Think about that. One- twelfth of the population has abandoned the country, leaving behind, in  many cases, children on their own, leaving behind catastrophe.    The ability to drive out opponents and people for whom life has  become too miserable is a relief valve. The other is just sheer  oppression. They put people in jail. They kill people. People die in  custody. They shoot them in the streets. That is pretty effective, too,  sometimes.   The second thing that keeps them in power is the assistance of the  Cuban regime. Every time I mention that, people think: You are just  obsessed with Cuba. You are from Miami, Cuban American.   The Cubans, when it comes to intelligence and repression, punch way  above their weight. They are experts at repression. That is what they  basically assist them with.   Do you know the Cubans basically run the security apparatus of  Venezuela? The personal security of Maduro are Cubans, which tells you  a lot about how much trust he has in his countrymen. The Cubans provide  them with basically all of their intelligence collection and the  capacity to collect intelligence. They have trained their National  Guard on crowd control.  [[Page S578]]    By the way, none of this is free. These are not free services. This  is a country that is poor and low on resources. The Cubans are probably  pulling in $1 billion a year for these services they provide.   The other thing people keep mentioning that keeps him in power is the  loyalty of military officers. I know you will see the picture of all  these guys in a country, by the way, where people are starving, and  every single one of these military guys is overweight. Somehow, in a  starving country, these people are gaining weight. They have these  fancy uniforms on.   Let me tell you, these folks are not truly loyal to Maduro. I saw  that picture today. I can tell you for a fact that more than half of  the people in that picture at some point in time have expressed serious  doubts about Maduro. They are really limited to what they can do right  now. Why? First of all, because all of them--every one of them--is  compromised. Their loyalty is not ideological, and it is not personal.  It is bought. It is paid for. Every single one of them has access to  lucrative corruption opportunities. Some of them have been given the  opportunity to raid Venezuela's national oil company. They have made  millions--hundreds of millions of dollars--by running that company into  the ground. Some of them have been given the distribution of consumer  goods--watches and phones and consumer articles. They give them these  things and say: You guys go out and sell them in the black market in  the street and take your cut.   Others have been allowed to skim off that food program I mentioned  that feeds 42 percent of the people. The military officers get first  dibs at some percentage of it, and they get to sell food directly for a  profit. Some are participating in currency manipulation. It sounds a  lot like an organized crime ring, like one of these old-style Mafia  families, where one guy ran the loan-sharking racket and the other guy  had the gambling and the other guy had the prostitution and the other  guy did the bank heists.   That is what this is. These people are loyal because Maduro allows  them corruption opportunities. They are also loyal, by the way, because  the Cubans are spying on them. The Cuban intelligence agencies quickly  pick up on any of these military officers who are being disloyal or  expressing doubts, and those guys are arrested.   There has been a massive purge of Venezuelan military officers over  the last 2 years. I am talking about dozens of high-ranking military  officials, either removed from their positions or arrested and are in  jail. It wasn't for corruption, believe me. It was because the Cubans  caught them and reported them and were wrapped up. Everybody else was  watching that and saying: It ain't going to happen to me.   That is not really loyalty. That is fear. You can see it in their  eyes today. By the way, they resent the Cubans, these military  officers. Imagine, for a moment, this is your country, and here comes  the smaller country and their guys run everything and tell you what to  do and spy on you and pit you against each other. They better be  careful about expressing that resentment because the Cubans are  listening, and they will report you.   Despite all of this, all is not good in the Venezuela regime. It has  gotten harder and harder every day. What has happened with the  sanctions that have been imposed on these individuals, they have cut  off their ability to steal money and enjoy corruption, and it has cut  off the ability to enjoy the money they have stolen. They can't travel.  They can't buy certain things. They have to hide their money. Some have  had assets seized here and abroad. That has created resentment, and  that has created anger within the inner circle. All these people in the  inner circle are now upset because they are not making as much money  off corruption as they used to make. They start saying to themselves,  maybe we have to get rid of Maduro and get a new godfather Mafia head  here. Maduro finds out about it, and he eliminates them. So the circle  gets smaller, which actually works to his benefit because with  shrinking resources, the less mouths you have to feed with corruption,  the better.   There is a real good example of it. There is a guy named Diosdado  Cabello, who ostensibly is now the president of this fake constituent  assembly. He happens to be a drug lord deeply involved in  narcotrafficking. I guess that is his part of the corruption deal. That  is his take. That is the business line he has been given. But he wants  to be President. He wants to be President, not Maduro.   This guy Cabello--when Chavez was removed in a coup that lasted just  a couple of days, Cabello was sworn in as President of Venezuela  because there was a vacancy, using the exact same provision of the  Constitution that they now claim is illegitimate. But here is Cabello,  who is a drug dealer, a drug lord, a thug, but he wants to be  President. He will never be elected President of Venezuela in a normal  election, in a legitimate election, so what is his path to being  elected and to becoming President?   First is this constituent assembly he has been put in charge of. This  new thing they created outside the Constitution is so powerful that it  has the power to remove Maduro today. They could remove Maduro. And  this guy hears the whispers. These guys are not blind to what is  happening. They can see that the country is in disarray, the economy is  collapsing, and there isn't enough money for them to steal anymore, and  there are people saying to him: Hey, why don't you move on this guy  because this guy is never going to fix this place.   He is thinking about it, and he has thought about it, but he knows  the only way he will ever be President is if he can preserve the  outlines of this regime and just get rid of the godfather and declare  himself the new godfather, the head of this new criminal syndicate, or  he can wait until 2024 and run a rigged election--again, set up under  the confines of this regime. Even if he doesn't like Maduro, it is to  his benefit that he stay there until he is ready to make his move on  him or until 2024, when he can run under this rigged system.   Another thing that is wrong with Venezuela is they are deeply in  debt. They have serious problems. These are the things we think about.  They owe China about $18 billion, which they don't have the money to  pay. They owe Russia about $3 or $4 billion. Do you know how they are  paying that right now? They are paying it with oil. They are sending  oil to China and to Russia for pennies on the dollar. That is what they  are making because they don't have cash, so they are bartering instead,  paying the debts off in oil.   I know you have seen the public pronouncements. The Chinese just want  to get paid. They are owed $18 billion, and they want to get paid, and  they want to make sure that Maduro or whoever is in power is going to  pay them the $18 billion. But the Russians want to get paid too.  Neither one of them believes Maduro is a great leader or is happy with  him; they just don't know what is going to come after him. They are  afraid that whoever comes after him will state that the debt is not  legitimate because it wasn't approved by the National Assembly. So they  would rather have this guy in place unless it is going to be someone  else just like him. But they are not happy.   The corruption in the national oil company is so horrifying that even  the Chinese and Russians don't like it. That is how bad it is. That has  to be a pretty high standard. Then there is the mismanagement. They  have destroyed this company. Its production has collapsed. It is not  run by oil people; it is run by generals who don't know anything about  the business. They have run it into the ground, and they missed  payments. Remember, they are supposed to be delivering oil for payment.  They have missed deliveries to the Chinese and Russians. They are not  happy about it, but what are they going to do? At least they are  getting paid something.   Russia has another interest, by the way, which leads me now to why we  should care about this.   First and foremost, I can make a very compelling argument, I believe,  that what is happening in Venezuela is a national interest threat to  the United States and even potentially a national security threat.   Let me start with this: Maduro has repeatedly and openly invited the  Russians to establish both a naval and an air base in Venezuela.  Basically he said: Here is the land. We will build it for you. We want  to have your airplanes and naval ships stationed here.  [[Page S579]]    Most of us serving here, with a few exceptions, have never served in  Congress when--and many people around do not remember a time--when a  foreign military, an adversary, was stationed in our own hemisphere,  but that is what Maduro is inviting him to do. Why does Maduro want it?  Because he thinks that acts as insurance against ever having an  invasion or whatever he thinks is going to happen.   Why does Russia want it? They want it because it is leverage against  us. They don't like how close we are to them in Europe with our allies  in NATO, so this gives them an opportunity to have the equivalence of  it in our own hemisphere.   So if you think Putin having his military stationed here is a good  thing, then I suppose what is happening in Venezuela wouldn't bother  you. But the enormous majority of Americans don't want Putin's military  anywhere in our hemisphere, and that is precisely what will happen if  Maduro remains in power. That alone is a national security threat to  the United States.   There is more. In their own national territory, the Maduro regime  hosts a group called the ELN, which is a terrorist narco organization.  In fact, last week the ELN detonated a bomb at the police academy in  Colombia and killed 20 people. Do you know where they are  headquartered? Inside Venezuelan territory, and it is from there that  they plot these attacks.   Do you know what else Venezuela does with the ELN from within  Venezuelan territory? They help them ship cocaine to the United States  of America.   I can state that both of those matters are national security  interests to the United States. The first is that drugs are a threat to  this country, and anyone who is helping a drug trafficking organization  ship it into our country is a threat to us. So if you don't mind or  don't care about cocaine being shipped to the United States in growing  quantities, then I guess Maduro and Venezuela is not something that  will bother you. But if you do not want to see people around who are  helping drug organizations ship cocaine into the United States under  the protection of a government, meaning they are giving them controlled  airspace, and they are protecting the shipments into the United States  and Europe--if that troubles you, then Maduro is a problem.   One of our best partners in fighting drugs in the hemisphere is  Colombia, but right now, Colombia is overwhelmed. They don't have  enough money to dedicate to the anti-drug cause at a time when cocaine  production--the growth of coca and the production of cocaine, I should  say--in Colombia is at historic levels 3 years running. Where is that  cocaine headed? A lot of it is headed to our streets, and that will be  on top of fentanyl, heroin, and all the other problems we have. We are  going to have a cocaine crisis in this country because all that cocaine  is headed here.   Colombia is out there trying to fight against it, but their resources  are being drained because they have at this moment at least 1 million  or 1.2 million Venezuelan migrants who have had to leave Venezuela and  are now in their territory. If the United States suddenly absorbed 1  million migrants over a 12- to 18-month period, we would struggle to  afford what that would entail. Imagine Colombia, whose economy is a  fraction of the size of ours--that means that instead of spending money  to fight drug cartels to prevent them from bringing drugs here, they  have had to dedicate resources to the humanitarian cost of housing over  1 million people, and growing.   It is not just Colombia that is being compromised. Ecuador has about  170,000 Venezuelan migrants. Peru has about 250,000 Venezuelan  migrants. These people are not bad. I am not criticizing the migrants.  But these are not big governments. Some of these governments have  budgets smaller than most of our States have. They cannot afford this,  and it is threatening to collapse their public health system, which  means we may not have a humanitarian catastrophe just in Venezuela; we  may soon have a growing economic catastrophe in Brazil, Peru, Ecuador,  and Colombia--multiple countries in our hemisphere. And geography  matters. It would be a terrible thing if it were happening in Africa or  halfway around the world, but it would directly impact Americans and  our economy and well-being because of how close it is to our country,  in multiple ways.   So if you think that having a humanitarian crisis in multiple  countries in our hemisphere--including countries aligned with us in the  war against drugs--is a problem, then you should care about what is  happening in Venezuela.   What is the road forward now? I hope people have been compelled to at  least understand that this is about more than just caring about  democracy. That is a big part of it. We do care, and we are proud of  it. But it is a lot more than just that. This is in the national  interest of the United States. We should be proud, not just of the  bipartisan support in favor of the interim President and of democracy  in Venezuela, we should be proud of the job the National Security  Council, the White House, and the State Department have done. Unlike 25  or 30 years ago, this wasn't some unilateral American action where we  went in and told everybody what to do; this is international  organizations, like the OAS.   Today, the Secretary of State appeared at the OAS personally to argue  the American case, and he was joined by 15 other countries that voted  on a resolution agreeing with our principles on this and their  principles. The leadership of these countries under the auspices of the  Lima Group has been extraordinary. The United States is an equal  partner to them in this endeavor.   What will probably happen now is that Maduro, instead of being the  one who arrests the interim President, will turn it over to the courts  to let them decide. Well, he controls the courts. They are all his  cronies. They are also corrupt, by the way, sanctioned by the U.S.  Government. He could very well move to try to arrest the interim  President, Juan Guaido, tomorrow or the next day, although the eyes of  the world are upon him, and the consequences for that would be  extraordinary and severe.   They are now saying: Let's have negotiations. This is a tactic they  have used repeatedly, and they use it because they all know we like  negotiations. Everybody--anytime there is an international crisis, why  don't we all just sit down and negotiate our way through this? Ideally,  that would be the outcome. But he doesn't really want negotiations. He  wants a delay tactic. He has done this multiple times. There were  negotiations from the Vatican, and they gave up. Then the former Prime  Minister of Spain was involved in some of these negotiations. Those  were a total catastrophe. He is just doing this to bide time. Now he is  talking about Mexico and Uruguay being the host of the negotiations. I  wouldn't be surprised if he soon says: Let Russia come in and be the  interlocutory. How about that for a national security threat, a  national interest threat--having Vladimir Putin brokering political  agreements in the Western Hemisphere. Putin would love it. He fancies  himself a great global leader. You are going to see him do something  like that, all in an effort to bide time. He has no intention of  negotiating anything.   It bides him time to do what? It bides him time for his fake  constituent assembly to change the Constitution towards one-party rule  or even potentially to call on new flash elections at some point for a  new national assembly under this fraudulent election system he set up.  To many people, he will say: We had an election, and the opposition  lost. But it won't be a real election if the people who could win are  not allowed to run, are not allowed to advertise, have no access to the  media. They control the ballot box, and they extort people with access  to food.   At some point, I wouldn't be surprised to see him declare a state of  emergency, maybe go out there and trigger some fake incident, a false  flag, where agitators go out and commit violence, and he will say: The  protesters are out of control; declare a state of emergency. Why would  he do that? So he can paralyze the streets. No one can be out there  protesting. And if the opposition tries to leave their homes, now they  have a pretext to arrest them.   There is really only one way forward, and that is to do everything we  can to  [[Page S580]]  strengthen the legitimate interim government, and that began today. The  interim President's first request was for humanitarian aid to help  bring food, medicine, and medical supplies to the people inside  Venezuela.   The Secretary of State of the United States immediately announced  that as an initial step, we will provide, immediately, $20 million. I  know they are working on how to deliver that into Venezuela and how  they can position that so the Venezuelan people have access to it. This  is on top of and apart from the aid we are already providing the  migrants in Colombia and other places.   That is a good first step. On day one on the job, the interim  President, Juan Guaido, made a request of the international community,  and America immediately stepped forward. And I believe very shortly, in  a matter of days, there will be significant humanitarian aid--food and  medicine--awaiting the people of Venezuela, either within their own  territory and distributed through the Red Cross or some other  nongovernmental organization or just across the border, where they can  access it.   We have to continue to make clear to the elites in that country that  there is no future for Maduro, that there is no way he can hold on, and  that they need to begin thinking about who their loyalties should be  to--the Constitution they swore an allegiance to, the people they live  among, or some guy whose future is about to come to an end.   I think it is important that the National Guard know that not only  should they not repress the people but that they will be held  accountable if they do. Ultimately, I believe this deeply. I know the  generals and all the guys at the press conference in the fancy uniforms  have sworn allegiance--you know how nervous they were--but I can state  that the rank-and-file fighters did not. Do you know why? Because the  rank-and-file soldier and the midlevel officer in the military don't  have corruption deals; they are going just as hungry as everybody else.  They have massive rates of desertion, people just abandoning posts.   When you saw the images yesterday of the hundreds of thousands of  people in the streets, you know that many of those soldiers have  mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, and loved ones, wives, and  children in that crowd. Do you know who else knows that? The military  brass. I know for a fact that they have significant doubts. In fact,  they probably do not even believe that if they ordered the military to  act against their own people, the military would, because there is no  way these rank-and-file soldiers are going to shoot on their brothers  and sisters and mothers and fathers and other loved ones.   So we need to step forward and continue with the humanitarian aid. We  need to help use the leadership of the United States to put together  reconstruction aid.   We need to help the interim President with whatever he needs to carry  out a legitimate free and fair and internationally supervised election,  which he should call for in the next 45 days.   This is the path forward. It is in our national interest. It is the  right thing to do. It reflects our values, but it also reflects our  interests as a nation. That is why this matters. That is why we should  care. This is not halfway around the world. This is in our own  hemisphere. It is just a few hours' flight away, and it impacts more  than just one country. It impacts an entire hemisphere.   I will close with this. There has been a lot of criticism  historically over the U.S. role in the Western Hemisphere. During the  Cold War, the criticism was that we were supporting rightwing  dictators, fighting off communism, but we were involved in some coups,  and we had a heavy hand and got in and imposed ourselves. Then we went  the total opposite way, and for many years--in fact, up until recently,  no one talked about the Western Hemisphere, and to the extent we did,  it was about migration and drugs. It was almost, frankly, a complete  abandonment of the portfolio.   What you are seeing now is the potential birth of a new Latin  America--a new Western Hemisphere, one in which the United States is an  important partner but not a unilateral actor. When you see 16 countries  in this hemisphere come together in an economic and diplomatic way,  from Peru to Chile, Colombia, Argentina, and Brazil, when you see the  OAS come alive after years of--frankly, when is the last time any of us  here discussed anything of the things happening at the OAS? You start  to see the beginning of not just a way to confront the crisis in  Venezuela but of a hemispheric partnership whose impetus may have been  this crisis but creates a path forward that is in our national  interest. Imagine if, in fact, democracies and free people of this  region came together not just to tackle dictatorships but to tackle  drugs, to tackle the root cause of migration. Imagine a hemispheric 16- , 18-regional-nation response to what is happening in El Salvador and  Honduras and Guatemala to cause these people to undertake this  dangerous journey with their children, in many cases; imagine if it  wasn't just the United States but us working in partnership with all  these other countries to tackle these hemispheric challenges. I will  tell you, that is in our national interest.   Not only is this an opportunity to do the right thing in Venezuela,  it is an opportunity to give a start to a new hemispheric reality, a  new Latin American reality that serves the national interest in this  country and allows us to live in a hemisphere that is free and  prosperous, where people do not have to abandon their homelands, where  people can stay in their countries, if they so choose, and raise their  families and not have to undertake dangerous journeys to other  countries for fear of their lives.   We have to start somewhere. I can think of no better place to start  than on behalf of the people of Venezuela who have suffered terribly  for far too long under a dictatorial, corrupt regime that tortured  their children and murdered their fathers and mothers and denied a  once-prosperous country the future they deserve.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, today is the last day for the Senate pages  who are here with us today. This is a little known fact--I didn't even  realize this until it was presented to me--but the 115th Congress,  which we just concluded, had more session days than any Congress since  1951. That goes to tell you that these pages worked incredibly hard,  and we are grateful. We hope their experience here was rewarding. They  should know that there are several Members here serving on this side  who once sat there.   I shouldn't be here by the time the pages get here, I hope, but we  look forward to their service to our country in the years to come in  whatever they decide to do.   Thank you for all of your work.   We truly appreciate the time they have put in.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that their names be printed in  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Abby Solomon, Eve Downing, Sophia Valcarce, Ellie Ralph,       Luke Baldwin, Benjamin Stimpson, Travis Christoff, Elli       Ament, Shira Hamer, Holden Clark, Hardy Williams, Luke       Schneider, Alex Little, Luke Lilly, Robert Hess, Nicholas       Acevedo Foley, Collin Woldt, Sophia Clinton, Amelia Gorman,       Myra Bajwa, Renee Clark, Allison Leibly, George ``Win''       Courtemanche, Luke Turner, Lucy Besch, Victoria Roberts.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to highlight the hard  work and unique entrepreneurial spirit found in small businesses across  my home State of Florida. Each week I recognize a small business that  exemplifies perseverance and dedication to the local community. Today,  as chairman of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, it  is my distinct pleasure to name Bailey's General Store in Sanibel, FL,  as the Senate Small Business of the Week.   Bailey's General Store has a long history of providing essential  goods to the people of Sanibel Island. Founded in 1899 by Frank P.  Bailey, the Sanibel Packing Company provided groceries and other  general supplies to both locals and visitors before there was a bridge  to the island. Three generations of the Bailey family have continued to  expand the business, one of the oldest in Lee County, while still  honoring their roots. In a nod to its heritage, the original 1926  Model-T that was used as a delivery vehicle in Bailey's early days is  still displayed in the store today.   Today Bailey's General Store has two locations on Sanibel Island and  serves as a one-stop shopping solution, providing their customers with  a plethora of supplies, from groceries and hardware to delivery and  catering services. Bailey's is now owned by Richard and Mary Bailey  Johnson, who continue the high standard of service to which Sanibel  Island residents and visitors have grown accustomed. In addition to the  general store, the Bailey Johnsons' team operates Bailey's Coffee Bar.  Located just inside the entrance to the store, the coffee bar serves as  a gathering place for tourists and locals alike to enjoy all types of  drinks, including their unique ``Bailey's Blend,'' in the store's  historic atmosphere. In September 2018, as part of their annual Best of  the Islands banquet, the Island Reporter and Sanibel-Captiva Islander  recognized Bailey's for the best chocolate shop, coffee bar, grocery  store, general store, and wine selection on Sanibel and Captiva  Islands.   Bailey's General Store is not only a great place for those on Sanibel  Island to shop and relax, it is an integral part of the community. In  addition to his role as owner, Richard also works to make Sanibel  Island a better place for both residents and tourists. He currently  serves as the chair of the capital campaign committee for the  renovation of the Bailey-Matthews National Shall Museum. The museum  held a ground-breaking ceremony arlier this month and is on track to  open to the public in early 2020. The family-owned business is  committed to giving back to their community. Bailey's holds an annual  fundraiser for the local FISH food pantry, supports the local Kiwanis  Club, and sponsors a hole at the annual miniature golf event to raise  money for the Community House on Sanibel. Additionally, Bailey's has  been recognized by the Lee County Economic Development Council for  their contributions to the local economy.   Like many Floridian small businesses, Bailey's General Store is an  outstanding example of resiliency. Bailey's has overcome a number of  disasters outside of their control, from multiple hurricanes to the  recent red tide bloom. Regardless of circumstance, the team at Bailey's  has remained steadfast in times of adversity again and again. Their  contributions to the Sanibel Island Community were especially noble in  the aftermath of Hurricane Irma in 2017. Despite damage to the store,  Bailey's reopened the day after the storm to provide island residents  with much needed food and supplies. The store became a lifeline for  residents and helped to reestablish normalcy in the midst of chaos,  while Bailey's employees worked for 10 days to clear debris. Bailey's  General Store's contributions to their community are an outstanding  example of corporate citizenship, and I commend them for continuing to  rise to the occasion when their community is in need of help.   Bailey's General Store serves as a model for any small business  wishing to provide superior service to their customers, while serving  as a gathering place and pillar of the community. The team at Bailey's  routinely goes above and beyond to ensure their customers' needs are  met, while also trying to improve their beachside community. Again, I  would like to congratulate Richard, Mary, and all of the employees at  Bailey's for being named the Senate Small Business of the Week. I wish  you continued success in your future endeavors.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 28, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to,  the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I understand that there are three bills at  the desk, and I ask for their first reading en bloc.    Mr. President, I now ask for a second reading, and I  object to my own request, all en bloc.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it recess until 12 noon, Friday,  January 25, 2019; and, further, that following the prayer and pledge,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand in recess under the previous  order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:36 p.m., recessed until  Friday, January 25, 2019, at noon.                            ____________________
