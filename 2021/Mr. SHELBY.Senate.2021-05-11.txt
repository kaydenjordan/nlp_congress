 Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to  Robert Campbell, of Mobile, AL, who will soon step down as regional  manager at Lamar Advertising.   Robert Campbell joined Lamar Advertising in 1972 as a posting manager  in Mobile. Robert rose through the ranks of sales manager and general  manager before being appointed regional manager in 1983. Throughout his  tenure, Robert oversaw the integration of numerous meaningful  acquisitions and hired and trained dozens in the company. He has served  on the national legislative committee for the Outdoor Advertising  Association of America, OAAA, for over two decades, and in 2007 he was  inducted into the OAAA Hall of Fame.  [[Page S2446]]    Further, Robert is a longtime supporter of the University of Alabama  and its football program. His enthusiasm for Alabama is unwavering,  even though the corporate headquarters of his company is based in Baton  Rouge.   Robert is an effective legislative advocate, and I appreciate his  hard work throughout the years. It is with great pleasure that I join  his friends, family, and colleagues in recognizing his commitment. I  congratulate him on his retirement, and I wish him all the best as he  transitions into a new chapter of his life.                            ____________________
