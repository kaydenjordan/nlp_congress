 Mr. President, today I wish to again express my  support for the Affordable Care Act, ACA.   We must continue fighting to protect the safeguards that were put in  place by the ACA, which prohibits abusive practices that previously  kept healthcare out of reach for millions of Americans, like denying  coverage to people with preexisting conditions. About half of all  Americans have preexisting conditions and could be forced to pay  significantly higher premiums or lose access to coverage altogether if  the ACA is overturned. At least 21 million people could lose their  health insurance if the ACA is struck down. In my State, Minnesotans  would see a loss of $364 million in premium tax credits, and roughly  272,000 people would lose their coverage.   Earlier this year, I came to the Senate floor to read 100 letters  from people in my State and across the country who explained what the  ACA has meant to them. These stories are just a small window into the  positive impact of the ACA and how so many people would suffer if its  protections were eliminated.   Instead of striking down this landmark legislation, we should build  on its strengths, defend the critical consumer protections that it  provides for so many, and make it stronger. We cannot go back to a time  when people who are sick can be denied health insurance coverage. This  is not the time to look back and try to tear things down; we should  look ahead and work to strengthen our healthcare system moving forward.  It is for this reason that we must and will continue to fight against  efforts to take away healthcare protections from millions of Americans.                            ____________________
