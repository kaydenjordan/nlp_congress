 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the underlying rule  and the HEROES Act to provide stimulus checks to all taxpayers.   In April, I introduced H.R. 6438, the Leave No Taxpayer Behind Act,  so that hardworking, taxpaying immigrants, immigrants who work in our  fields to feed us on an everyday basis, also receive stimulus checks.   Thank you for including this measure in the HEROES Act, and I urge  passage of the HEROES Act.
