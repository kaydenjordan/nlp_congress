 Mr. President, this week, as I stated yesterday, the  Senate will focus on personnel business.   Six well-qualified nominees are currently before the Senate. They are  awaiting the full consideration they clearly deserve. Their nominations  have been vetted. Their expertise is well known. Their positions sit  empty, waiting to be filled. The American people are waiting for their  President to have his full team and for their Federal Government to be  appropriately staffed.   If last evening's vote to advance Claria Horn Boom's district court  nomination were any indication, we would be in for a productive week.  Ninety-six of our colleagues voted in support--96. With such broad  bipartisan support, you might think that filing cloture should not have  been necessary in the first place.   With nominees as uncontroversial as these, you might think the Senate  would roll quickly through them and move on to other business, but  unfortunately, for more than a year now, our Democratic friends have  used the partisan playbook to delay and obstruct even the least  controversial nominees. So unless we can reach the kind of bipartisan  agreement that was once the norm around here and process  noncontroversial nominees more promptly, we are left with no choice but  to proceed the hard way, and that is just what we have done.   Facing historic obstruction, Republicans have confirmed ambitious  reformists to crucial posts where fresh ideas were long overdue, and we  have confirmed top-notch legal minds to the Federal bench, including a  record number of circuit court judges for a President's first year and  the generational choice of Justice Neil Gorsuch, who was confirmed to  the Supreme Court 1 year ago today.   I have already stated that the Senate will remain in session as long  as it takes to clear this slate of nominees. Following the confirmation  of Ms. Boom, we will move to consideration of John Ring to serve on the  National Labor Relations Board. After Mr. Ring comes nominees to the  Department of Labor, the EPA, and two more nominees to fill district  court vacancies--all vetted, all qualified, all sitting right here in  the Senate. In at least one case, several of my Democratic friends have  already proactively announced support for the nominee. So let's get  back on track together. Let's consider and confirm these nominees  without delay.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, notwithstanding rule XXII, I ask  unanimous consent that at 12:20 p.m. on Wednesday, April 11, the Senate  vote on confirmation of the Ring nomination and that if confirmed, the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  resume legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 454, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 455, submitted  earlier today.    I further ask unanimous consent that the resolution be  agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 456, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Judiciary Committee be discharged from  [[Page S2045]]  further consideration of S. Res. 377 and the Senate proceed to its  immediate consideration.    I further ask unanimous consent that the resolution be  agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10:30 a.m.,  Wednesday, April 11; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed. Finally, I ask that  following leader remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session and  resume consideration of the Ring nomination under the previous order.    If there is no further business to come before the  Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned under the  provisions of S. Res. 454 and S. Res. 455 as a further mark of respect  to the late Senators Zell Miller of Georgia and Daniel Akaka of Hawaii.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:25 p.m., adjourned until  Wednesday, April 11, 2018, at 10:30 a.m.                            ____________________
