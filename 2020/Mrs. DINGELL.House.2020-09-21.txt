Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 4866.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I want to thank Chairman Pallone and  Ranking Member Walden for their bipartisan leadership on all of the  legislation before us today. During this unprecedented public health  crisis, and in spite of significant logistical challenges, the Energy  and Commerce Committee has come together on a bipartisan basis on  legislation to meaningfully address many public health issues we  continue to face.   I would also like to commend many of my fellow committee members for  their advocacy and efforts on the legislation before us today.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise in support of H.R. 4866, the National  Centers of Excellence in Continuous Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Act.                                time  1745    COVID-19 has made clear that the United States is overly reliant on  foreign manufacturers for critical products like personal protective  equipment and pharmaceuticals. For far too long, we have relied on  China and India to provide our necessary medicines and the ingredients  needed to make them. In times of crisis like COVID-19, access to  critical medicines is even more critical.   While there are many things we must do to encourage drug  manufacturing to come back to the United States, investing and  supporting the use of efficient, innovative technologies like  continuous manufacturing hold promise.   Continuous manufacturing allows manufacturers to make drugs more  efficiently, thereby improving the quality of drugs while also reducing  waste and the footprint needs that traditional drug manufacturing  requires.   FDA has been working to support increased utilization of this  technology because, as we have heard from the head of FDA's drug  center, Dr. Janet Woodcock, continuous manufacturing can help  ``increase the resilience of our domestic manufacturing base and reduce  quality issues that trigger drug shortages or recalls.''   H.R. 4866 will help support this work by investing in centers of  excellence at universities that can help us to further improve this  technology, transfer it to drug manufacturers, and increase its use and  capability in the United States. These centers of excellence would also  be charged with helping to develop a domestic workforce that would be  able to help manufacturers with the adoption of continuous  manufacturing.   For States like mine, Michigan, centers of excellence supported by  H.R. 4866 could help to leverage our manufacturing expertise to support  the growth of a new generation of drug manufacturers in our own  backyard.   Now more than ever, we must work to bring drug manufacturing home to  ensure that our critical medicines are available without interruption  in public health emergencies or crises.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, it is time for the United States to focus  on bringing the production back home. I urge my colleagues to support  this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7574) to amend the Public Health Service Act with respect to  the Strategic National Stockpile, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7574         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.         Section 319F-2(f)(1) of the Public Health Service Act (42       U.S.C. 247d-6b(f)(1)) is amended by striking ``$610,000,000       for each of fiscal years 2019 through 2023'' and inserting       ``$705,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2021 through 2023''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 7574.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Strengthening America's  Strategic National Stockpile Act of 2020.   This legislation incorporates a number of provisions to modernize the  Strategic National Stockpile and to ensure that we are adequately  prepared for future public health emergencies.   The current COVID-19 pandemic has shown the importance of ensuring  that the United States has adequate manufacturing capacity and  stockpiles of PPE and other medical equipment so that America's first  responders and healthcare workers are prepared for public health  emergencies.   In the early days of the pandemic, our frontline healthcare workers  were forced to rely on deficient equipment from overseas manufacturers  or expired equipment in the existing Strategic National Stockpile.   Even today, after months of efforts at the Federal, State, and local  levels, we continue to face concerning deficiencies in PPE and other  lifesaving medical equipment.   We must make robust long-term investments in our Nation's Strategic  National Stockpile and manufacturing capability to better respond to  future public health emergencies.   The Strengthening America's Strategic National Stockpile Act meets  this need by increasing the annual authorization of the SNS to $705  million. This will allow the Federal Government to direct appropriate  resources toward future emergencies.   The legislation will also allow the SNS to refresh and replenish  stocks of critical manufacturing supplies before they are expired.   It also includes a provision my colleague Congresswoman Jackie  Walorski and I authored to create incentives to geographically  diversify production of medical supplies and allow the SNS the  flexibility to enter into leasing or joint ventures with manufacturers  to quickly scale up production if needed.   The Strengthening America's Strategic National Stockpile Act is the  culmination of months of bipartisan work, and I thank Congresswoman  Slotkin, my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee, as well as  both Democrat and Republican committee staff for their efforts.   Mr. Speaker, the Strengthening America's Strategic National Stockpile  Act is vital to both our public health and national security. I urge my  colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my  time.                                          House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                 Washington, DC, September 21, 2020.      Hon. Carolyn B. Maloney,      Chairwoman, Committee on Oversight and Reform, Washington,           DC.        Dear Chairwoman Maloney: I am writing concerning H.R. 7574,       the ``Strengthening America's Strategic National Stockpile       Act of 2020,'' which was referred to the Committee on Energy       and Commerce on July 13, 2020.        I appreciate you not seeking a sequential referral of H.R.       7574 so that the bill may be considered expeditiously. I       acknowledge that forgoing your referral claim does not waive,       reduce, or otherwise affect the jurisdiction of the Committee       on Oversight and Reform over this legislation, or any       appropriate legislation. I will appropriately consult and       involve the Committee on Oversight and Reform as this bill       progresses. I would support your effort to seek appointment       of an appropriate number of conferees from your committee to       any House-Senate conference on this legislation.        I will ensure our letters on H.R. 7574 are entered into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.       I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and       look forward to continuing to work together as this measure       moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                Frank Pallone, Jr.,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                               Committee on Oversight and Reform,                                 Washington, DC, September 21, 2020.      Hon. Frank Pallone,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Pallone: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       7574, the Strengthening America's Strategic National       Stockpile Act of 2020. There are certain provisions in the       legislation which fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the       Committee on Oversight and Reform.        In the interest of permitting your Committee to proceed       expeditiously on this bill, I am willing to waive this       Committee's right to sequential referral. I do so with the       understanding that by waiving consideration of the bill, the       Committee on Oversight and Reform does not waive any future       jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in       the bill which fall within its Rule X jurisdiction. I request       that you urge the Speaker to name Members of this Committee       to any conference committee which is named to consider such       provisions.        Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked       regarding this matter and others between our respective       Committees.            Sincerely,                                                Carolyn B. Maloney,                                                        Chairwoman.     Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill  [[Page H4621]]  (H.R. 2271) to amend the Public Health Service Act to improve the  health of children and help better understand and enhance awareness  about unexpected sudden death in early life, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2271, the Scarlett's  Sunshine on Sudden Unexpected Death Act.   This bipartisan legislation would address the longstanding tragedies  of sudden unexpected infant deaths and sudden unexplained death in  childhood, which collectively cost thousands of lives each year and  result in heartbreak that no parent should ever have to experience.   Every year, about 3,500 babies die suddenly and unexpectedly in the  United States before reaching their first birthday, a category of  deaths known as sudden unexpected infant deaths.                                time  1800    Additionally, approximately 400 children between the ages of 1 and 18  also die unexpectedly from sudden unexplained death in childhood.   More research into the causes of SUDC and SUID is needed, and this  legislation will redouble our efforts to better understand these  tragedies and prevent future deaths.   Scarlett's Sunshine on Unexpected Death Act will establish grants to  national and State organizations, as well as nonprofits, to improve  data collection related to these deaths.   The legislation will also provide additional resources to increase  education about safe sleep practices for children and infants, as well  as authorizing funding to ensure death reviews are completed for all  infant and child deaths.   It will provide support services for grieving families who are  impacted by these tragedies.   Mr. Speaker, improving data collection and analysis of SUDC and SUID  is a critical step in helping us understand and prevent these tragedies  and ensure that no parent has to live with the pain that comes with  losing a child.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representatives Moore, Cole, and Herrera Beutler  for leading this legislation and their years of advocacy and efforts on  this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I also acknowledge Stephanie Zarecky. This legislation  is named after her daughter, Scarlett, who tragically passed as a  result of SUDC, and we wouldn't be here today without her leadership  and pushing for action.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, if we can in any way prevent parents from  going through this horrific experience, we have an obligation to do so.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4995) to amend the Public Health Service Act to improve  obstetric care and maternal health outcomes, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4995         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Every 12 hours, an American woman dies of a pregnancy-related  complication. This is a public health crisis, and the Maternal Health  Quality Improvement Act creates robust new programs to meet this need.  This includes improving rural maternal healthcare through the creation  of rural obstetric network grants, as well as expanding the use of  telehealth.   The legislation also promotes innovation in maternal healthcare by  creating a new grant program to develop and disseminate best practices  to improve health quality and outcomes and help eliminate maternal  mortality.   Additionally, the Maternal Health Quality Improvement Act includes  provisions to address racial disparities in maternal health outcomes by  funding training programs for healthcare professionals, as well as  allowing HHS to disseminate best practices to reduce and prevent  discrimination.   Finally, the legislation authorizes funding for perinatal quality  collaboratives, multi-State networks to improve health outcomes for  pregnant and postpartum women and their infants, as well as creating a  grant program to integrate services and reduce adverse maternal health  outcomes.   Madam Speaker, these robust provisions represent a strong step toward  addressing the ongoing health crisis facing America's pregnant and  postpartum women.   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues, Representatives Engel, Bucshon,  Torres Small, Latta, Adams, and Stivers, for their tireless work on  this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I agree with my colleagues passionately  in the need to take care of our mothers when they are pregnant, the  newborns, and then their postpartum health. This bill is an important  first step, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3935) to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to  provide for the continuing requirement of Medicaid coverage of  nonemergency transportation to medically necessary services, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 3935.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3935, Protecting Patients  Transportation to Care Act. This legislation will add nonemergency  medical transportation services for individuals without other means of  transportation to the list of benefits required by law under Medicaid.   NEMT, N-E-M-T, benefits have been a mandatory Medicaid benefit by  regulation since the program's beginning in 1966, and the benefits are  clear. Transportation is one of the most common barriers to care for  low-income patients, and reliable transportation to and from medical  appointments is a cornerstone of healthcare access.   NEMT provides over 100 million rides to Medicaid beneficiaries each  year, and this lifeline is critical to patients with chronic conditions  like kidney disease or diabetes.   Additionally, it allows seniors and Americans to remain in their  homes and continue to live independently.   The NEMT benefit is especially critical to beneficiaries seeking care  during this current public health crisis, which has placed additional  burdens and barriers to care.   The Protecting Patients Transportation to Care Act will codify this  benefit and maintain robust program integrity protections.   In addition to safeguarding the lifesaving NEMT benefit, the  legislation is scored as having no cost by the Congressional Budget  Office.   I would like to thank Representatives Carter, Cardenas, Graves and  Bishop of Georgia for leading this bipartisan effort and urge my  colleagues to support its passage.   I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1815     Madam Speaker, I, too, urge adoption of this important  piece of legislation to remove barriers so people are able to go to the  doctor, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1646) to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services  to improve the detection, prevention, and treatment of mental health  issues among public safety officers, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1646         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 1646.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1646, the Helping Emergency  Responders Overcome, or HERO Act of 2019.   We have seen the extraordinary actions of America's first responders  in recent months in helping to keep our Nation safe. From the courage  and the bravery of firefighters in Western States as they confront an  unprecedented fire season, to public safety and paramedics responding  to hurricanes on the Gulf Coast, to the frontline health workers  fighting COVID-19, we all owe them a tremendous debt of gratitude.   This includes supporting the mental health needs of these  individuals. Exposure to stressful, life-threatening situations, and  traumatic events can impact one's mental health.   Unfortunately, we see this impact every day with first responders  facing higher rates of suicide and other mental health issues. However,  we still lack data on the full scope of the problem, as well as  treatment strategies to address the unique stresses that our Nation's  first responders face.   The HERO Act would create a National Public Safety Officer Suicide  Reporting System to help us better understand the prevalence of these  tragedies within the public safety officer community regardless of  their employer.   It would also establish a grant program for peer support, behavioral  health, and wellness programs within fire departments and EMS agencies.   The legislation also will develop and disseminate resources to  educate health professionals about the unique mental health challenges  facing our Nation's first responders and evidence-based therapies to  address these issues.   I would like to thank Ami Bera for his leadership and thoughtful  advocacy on the HERO Act and urge my colleagues to support its passage.   I reserve the balance of my time.          House of Representatives, Committee on Science, Space,             and Technology,                                Washington, DC, September 15, 2020.      Hon. Frank Pallone, Jr.,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Pallone: I am writing you concerning H.R.       1646, the ``Helping Emergency Responders Overcome Act of       2019,'' which was referred to the Committee on Energy and       Commerce and then to the Committee on Science, Space, and       Technology (``Science Committee'') on March 8, 2019.        As a result of our consultation, I agree to work       cooperatively on H.R. 1646 and in order to expedite       consideration of the bill the Science Committee will waive       formal consideration of this legislation. However, this is       not a waiver of any future jurisdictional claims by the       Science Committee over the subject matter contained in H.R.       1646 or similar legislation. I also request that you support       my request to name members of the Science Committee to any       conference committee to consider this legislation.        Additionally, thank you for your assurances to include a       copy of our exchange of letters on this matter in the       committee report for H.R. 1646 and in the Congressional       Record during floor consideration thereof.            Sincerely,                                          Eddie Bernice Johnson,                                   Chairwoman, Committee on Science,      Space, and Technology.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                 Washington, DC, September 15, 2020.      Hon. Eddie Bernice Johnson,      Chairwoman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Johnson: Thank you for consulting with the       Committee on Energy and Commerce and agreeing to discharge       H.R. 1646, the Helping Emergency Responders Overcome Act of       2019, from further consideration, so that the bill may       proceed expeditiously to the House floor.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this measure or similar legislation in the future. I would       support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees from your committee to any House-Senate       conference on this legislation.        I will ensure our letters on H.R. 1646 are entered into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.       I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and       look forward to continuing to work together as this measure       moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                Frank Pallone, Jr.,                                                          Chairman.     Madam Speaker, once more we thank our Nation's first  responders for all they are doing for us, and I urge my colleagues to  support them by supporting this legislation.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4564) to amend the Public Health Service Act to ensure the  provision of high-quality service through the Suicide Prevention  Lifeline, and for other purposes, as amended.

(c) Recommendations.--The report required by subsection (a)       shall include recommendations for improving the Suicide       Prevention Lifeline, including recommendations for       legislative and administrative actions.       SEC. 6. DEFINITION.         In this Act, the term ``Suicide Prevention Lifeline'' means       the suicide prevention hotline maintained pursuant to section       520E-3 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 290bb-      36c).     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 4564.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4564, the Suicide Prevention  Lifeline Improvement Act of 2020. This legislation will provide  additional resources and authority for the National Suicide Prevention  Lifeline, ensuring that it will have the infrastructure necessary to  meet both current needs and the increased volume of outreach expected  when the 988 number is formally adopted.   The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline currently expects 12 million  calls over the next 4 years, equivalent to the total number of calls  from 2005 to 2017.   Given this increased demand, the current authorization level of  approximately $7.2 million per year is insufficient to meet expected  need for the lifeline's critical services for those in crisis.   This legislation increases the authorization for the lifeline to $50  million each year through fiscal year 2022, allowing it to effectively  manage the increased call volume while reducing wait times.   Additionally, the Suicide Prevention Lifeline Improvement Act will  create a new pilot program to deploy innovative technologies through  social media, texting, and other platforms, connecting Americans where  they are to the lifeline.   It will also establish a plan for maintaining the lifeline program  and provide additional study and recommendations from HHS on ways to  further strengthen access to this program.   I thank and appreciate Representatives Katko, Beyer, and Napolitano  for their leadership in offering this legislation, and continuing to  push for reforms to strengthen the National Suicide Prevention  Lifeline.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan effort  to strengthen access to this critical resource for Americans in crisis.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the distinguished gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer), who has helped  champion this bill.    Madam Speaker, during these unprecedented times, we  need to ensure that we are putting the resources into those that need  them.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4585) to require the Director of the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention to conduct a national suicide prevention media  campaign, and for other purposes, as amended.  [[Page H4632]]    The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4585         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(b) Target Audiences.--        (1) Tailoring advertisements and other communications.--In       conducting the national media campaign under subsection       (a)(1), the Secretary may tailor culturally competent       advertisements and other communications of the campaign       across all available media for a target audience (such as a       particular geographic location or demographic) across the       lifespan.        (2) Targeting certain local areas.--The Secretary shall, to       the maximum extent practicable, use amounts made available       under subsection (f) for media that targets individuals in       local areas with higher suicide rates.

(f) Authorization of Appropriations.--For purposes of       carrying out this section, there is authorized to be       appropriated $10,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2021       through 2025.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 4585.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4585, the Campaign to  Prevent Suicide Act. This legislation will further facilitate access to  existing Federal resources on suicide prevention by creating a national  suicide prevention media campaign to help raise awareness of the  lifeline as well as advertise the new 988 number when it becomes  available.   Additionally, the Campaign to Prevent Suicide Act will also provide  guidance to TV and social media companies on how effectively to  communicate about suicide prevention through the creation of a media  and best practices tool kit.   Given the significant mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic,  ensuring that Americans have access to the support they need during  these trying times is more important than ever. With multiple studies  pointing to the pandemic's significant impact on mental health,  including a fourfold increase in depression reported by the  [[Page H4633]]  CDC this summer, we cannot lose sight of this longstanding public  health issue.   I appreciate Representatives Beyer's and Gianforte's work on this  legislation, which will provide resources for outreach on suicide  prevention during a time when it is needed more than ever. We need to  lift the stigma from people talking about this. It happens in every  family and in every place.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support passage of this bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer).    Madam Speaker, I want to thank both of my colleagues  for their leadership on this issue and for the willingness to talk  about it publicly because we do need for people to acknowledge that it  is a normal feeling, and it is okay. I have seen it in my own family  and wish that we had been willing to talk about it before it had been  too late.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5619) to authorize a pilot program to expand and intensify  surveillance of self-harm in partnership with State and local public  health departments, to establish a grant program to provide self-harm  and suicide prevention services in hospital emergency departments, and  for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5619         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

SEC. 3. GRANTS TO PROVIDE SELF-HARM AND SUICIDE PREVENTION                     SERVICES.         Part B of title V of the Public Health Service Act (42       U.S.C. 290aa et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the       following:       ``SEC. 520N.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on H.R. 5619.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5615, the Suicide Prevention  Act.   Currently, there is no complete data about suicide attempts or other  instances of self-harm in the United States. This fragmented and  incomplete reporting hinders our ability to track trends and target  suicide prevention resources where they might be the most effective in  preventing these tragedies from occurring.                                time  1845    The Suicide Prevention Act will help strengthen data and reporting on  suicide by authorizing funding for the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention to collaborate with State and local health departments to  improve the tracking of these incidents. This enhanced data collection  will allow for earlier intervention and better understanding of suicide  trends, helping to better identify and treat at-risk individuals.  [[Page H4635]]    The legislation also creates a SAMHSA grant program to fund self-harm  and suicide prevention services in hospital emergency departments. This  includes screening at-risk patients, providing services as needed, and  referring patients for follow-up care for long-term self-harm and  suicide prevention.   Hospital emergency departments are on the front lines of providing  critical behavior health services, and these resources will help  identify and treat individuals at the highest risk for suicide and  self-harm.   Madam Speaker, I appreciate my colleagues, Congressman Stewart and  Congresswoman Matsui, for leading this important legislation, and I  urge my colleagues to support its passage.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, the gentleman is absolutely correct at  how important a piece of legislation this is. I urge my colleagues to  support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5663) to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to  give authority to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting  through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, to destroy counterfeit  devices, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5663         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.          This Act may be cited as the ``Safeguarding Therapeutics       Act''.       SEC. 2. AUTHORITY TO DESTROY COUNTERFEIT DEVICES.         (a) In General.--Section 801(a) of the Federal Food, Drug,       and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 381(a)) is amended--        (1) in the fourth sentence, by inserting ``or counterfeit       device'' after ``counterfeit drug''; and        (2) by striking ``The Secretary of the Treasury shall cause       the destruction of'' and all that follows through ``liable       for costs pursuant to subsection (c).'' and inserting the       following: ``The Secretary of the Treasury shall cause the       destruction of any such article refused admission unless such       article is exported, under regulations prescribed by the       Secretary of the Treasury, within 90 days of the date of       notice of such refusal or within such additional time as may       be permitted pursuant to such regulations, except that the       Secretary of Health and Human Services may destroy, without       the opportunity for export, any drug or device refused       admission under this section, if such drug or device is       valued at an amount that is $2,500 or less (or such higher       amount as the Secretary of the Treasury may set by regulation       pursuant to section 498(a)(1) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19       U.S.C. 1498(a)(1))) and was not brought into compliance as       described under subsection (b). The Secretary of Health and       Human Services shall issue regulations providing for notice       and an opportunity to appear before the Secretary of Health       and Human Services and introduce testimony, as described in       the first sentence of this subsection, on destruction of a       drug or device under the seventh sentence of this subsection.       The regulations shall provide that prior to destruction,       appropriate due process is available to the owner or       consignee seeking to challenge the decision to destroy the       drug or device. Where the Secretary of Health and Human       Services provides notice and an opportunity to appear and       introduce testimony on the destruction of a drug or device,       the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall store and,       as applicable, dispose of the drug or device after the       issuance of the notice, except that the owner and consignee       shall remain liable for costs pursuant to subsection (c).''.        (b) Definition.--Section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug,       and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321(h)) is amended--        (1) by redesignating subparagraphs (1), (2), and (3) as       clauses (A), (B), and (C), respectively; and        (2) after making such redesignations--        (A) by striking ``(h) The term'' and inserting ``(h)(1) The       term''; and        (B) by adding at the end the following:        ``(2) The term `counterfeit device' means a device which,       or the container, packaging, or labeling of which, without       authorization, bears a trademark, trade name, or other       identifying mark, imprint, or symbol, or any likeness       thereof, or is manufactured using a design, of a device       manufacturer, packer, or distributor other than the person or       persons who in fact manufactured, packed, or distributed such       device and which thereby falsely purports or is represented       to be the product of, or to have been packed or distributed       by, such other device manufacturer, packer, or distributor.        ``(3) For purposes of subparagraph (2)--        ``(A) the term `manufactured' refers to any of the       following activities: manufacture, preparation, propagation,       compounding, assembly, or processing; and        ``(B) the term `manufacturer' means a person who is engaged       in any of the activities listed in clause (A).''.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 5663.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5663, the  Safeguarding Therapeutics Act.   Madam Speaker, this legislation provides FDA additional authority to  take action to protect public health and safety by extending the  agency's administrative destruction authority for counterfeit medical  devices, including diagnostic tests and surgical masks, as well as  combination products, like vaccines, that may pose a threat to public  health.   Given the global marketplace and extended supply chains for complex  medical products, counterfeit medical devices are becoming increasingly  common, both in the United States and abroad. These counterfeit  products pose a significant risk to patient health and safety, and  ensuring that FDA has the appropriate authority to take action by  seizing and destroying counterfeit medical devices will help safeguard  America's health.   Under current law, counterfeit medical devices and combination  products are typically shipped back to the sender because of the  limitations in FDA's existing authority. This allows dangerous  counterfeit devices to remain in the supply chain, continuing to  represent a significant risk to consumers. The Safeguarding  Therapeutics Act is a straightforward, commonsense approach to this  issue with bipartisan support that will provide FDA with authority it  already possesses with respect to counterfeit drugs.   Given the deficiencies highlighted with certain aspects of the  healthcare supply chain throughout the current pandemic, taking action  to further  [[Page H4636]]  safeguard the supply chain from potentially dangerous products is more  important than ever.   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues on the Committee on Energy and  Commerce, Representatives Guthrie and Engel, for their work on this  legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support its passage.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I also thank Mr. Guthrie and Mr. Engel  for their leadership.   I think the American people understand this issue more now than ever,  unfortunately. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
