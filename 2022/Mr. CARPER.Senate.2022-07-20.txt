 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, today I have the honor to rise in support  of Greg Williams to serve as a judge on the U.S. District Court for the  District of Delaware, one of the busiest and, we believe, most  important district courts in our Nation.   Before delving into what makes Delaware's district court such an  essential part of the American economy and what makes Greg Williams an  exceptional nominee to serve, in the words of the American Bar  Association, they deem him ``well qualified'' to be a Federal judge.   I want to share some background and the process that we use in  Delaware for making recommendations to the Federal bench to the  President.   A few years ago my friend--and I call him my wingman--Senator Chris  Coons and I had the opportunity to make recommendations to the White  House for two vacancies on this same court. There was, at the time, a  President of a different party, and the majority here was on the other  side, not on this side at that time.   Our process was simple then and was straightforward and borrowed  heavily from the process that I used while serving as Governor of  Delaware for 8 years. Throughout those 8 years when I was privileged to  serve as Governor, we relied on a judicial nominating commission and  charged them with a simple task. Basically, this was it: find the most  qualified individuals, regardless of political party, make  recommendations to the Governor for appointments to Delaware's many  important State courts, including our State supreme court and the court  of chancery.   We used a similar process for Federal district court vacancies. The  process served Delaware well during those 8 years, and I believe that  the process Senator Coons and I have used now serves our Nation well,  too, regardless of which political party controls the White House or  the Senate. It has yielded yet another extraordinary nominee. That  nominee is Greg Williams, a partner at Fox Rothschild. Former president  of the Delaware State Bar Association and President Biden's nominee to  serve as the next judge on the U.S. District Court for Delaware.   But Greg is more than a lawyer, much more. He is a father, a husband,  a son, and a brother. In fact, he is the youngest brother in his family  of five, with four older sisters, and I know they help to keep him on  the straight and narrow much like my older sister did with me.   Greg has been married to his high school sweetheart, Terina, for 27  years. Together, they have raised two children in Delaware that any one  of us would be proud to call our own.   A Villanova Law School graduate, Greg has worked at one of top law  firms in the Nation, Fox Rothschild, for the past 28 years.   Through hard work and commitment to excellence, in 2003, Greg became  the first African-American attorney to have been hired as an associate  and then be named as a partner at Fox Rothschild. Greg learned those  values--hard work and commitment to excellence--in part as a member of  the U.S. Army Reserves, where he served from 1986 to 1994--part of  those years when I was his commander in chief as Governor of the State  of Delaware.   After law school, Greg embarked on a successful legal career that has  earned him the respect and admiration of Delaware's highly regarded  legal community.   Greg has particular expertise in intellectual property and business  litigation, which make him particularly well-suited for the Delaware  District Court.   More than his professional qualifications, though, Greg is the  personification of the Golden Rule, which calls on us to treat one  another the way we want to be treated. And, as a result, he is also the  personification of judicial temperament in that courtroom--and any  courtroom, for that matter.   Like Senator Coons and me and many of our colleagues, Greg is a  person of deep faith. He understands personally the words ``Golden  Rule'' and what they mean. And if confirmed, I believe he will use that  rule to guide him on the bench.   Let me close by saying this: We have all probably heard a saying that  is oftentimes used in relationship to an undersized boxer--someone who  punches above their weight.   The Delaware District Court is one of the busiest courts in our  country. It handles an array of cases related to intellectual property  law, patent law, bankruptcy law, and other specialized business cases  that are critical to the functioning of our national economy.   Like our small State, this court punches above its weight, and our  nominee Greg Williams not only has the credentials and the temperament,  but the strong work ethic that are necessary for this court to continue  to function as one of the most important district courts in our land.   I consider it a privilege to give him my strongest possible  endorsement, and I encourage my colleagues to join Senator Coons and me  today in supporting his nomination on the Senate floor.   And with that, I don't see if--I don't know that our colleague--here  comes Senator Coons, here to speak on behalf of this nominee as well.   I will just say this: You know, we have judicial nominees come before  us, not every day but often in this body. In some cases, the folks who  are from the State where that nominee hails, they know them, have at  least a passing knowledge of them, and have maybe met them.   We have known Greg Williams for almost a quarter of a century. He is  not just one of the finest lawyers in our State; he is one of the  finest human beings in our State.   It is an honor for me to join Senator Coons in suggesting his name to  the President of this country. We are grateful the President actually  submitted that name now to the U.S. Senate for our consideration.   And with that, I am going to yield the floor. I see we have Senator  Cassidy here. I don't know if he has the opportunity to--no, he is  going to wait for a while.   I am going to just stop right here. Senator Coons stopped just  briefly. I think he is going to be right back on the floor; and,  hopefully, he will be able to pick up right where I--I will do the  handoff to my colleague from Delaware.    Mr. President, I have had the privilege of serving with  Senator Barrasso. For any number of years, we were the coleads on the  Environment and Public Works Committee. We actually found common ground  on a whole lot of issues and disagreed on a number of them as well. But  on a personal level, we have, I think, a very good friendship and have  had for a number of years good collaboration on Environment and Public  Works.   I disagree with almost everything he said--almost everything he  said--and I am not a disagreeable person, but I always look for common  ground, and I am sorry to say I didn't hear a whole lot from him today  to do that.   The suggestion that somehow we shouldn't be concerned about climate  change, the climate crisis that has visited our planet--a couple of  points I just want to share. This is off the news yesterday, the day  before, Monday, Tuesday of this week.   The United Kingdom broke its record for the highest recorded  temperature multiple times on Monday, reaching 104.4 degrees  Fahrenheit. In Great Britain, for the most part, they don't have air- conditioning. Record temperature--104.4 degrees just on Monday alone.  There are airport runways in Great Britain that are melting--that is  right, melting--because it is so hot.   The railways in the United States are buckling from the heat, with  riders warned to stay home--to stay home.   Over 1,100 people have died in Spain and Portugal just in the last  week from heat-related causes.   Wildfires in France have forced 30,000 people--that is about as many  people as we have in Dover, DE, our State capital--30,000 people to  evacuate. Organizers plan to pour tens of thousands of liters of water  onto the Tour de France route--it is a huge, international bicycle  competition--to prevent the road from melting in the heat.   More than 40 million people in the United States are under extreme  heat warnings across the Great Plains and California. Around 60 million  Americans will likely see temperatures at or above 100 degrees--not  this year, not this month, this week. Nearly 60 percent of California  is dealing with excessive drought, while 20 percent of Texas--it is 5  percent worse than last week--experiences exceptional drought, the most  extreme level on the drought scale. Firefighters this week are  currently battling 89--that is right, 89--large fires in 12 States in  the United States.   That is just off the news pages of 2 days ago.   Amid calls to lower the price of gasoline, I rise to speak on the  news this week regarding climate change.   There is no doubt that we are living in unprecedented times as a  nation and as a planet. After an unprecedented pandemic ground our  global economy to a halt, Americans have been struggling to return to  ``normal.''   As we saw in the news earlier this year, unprecedented supply chain  issues from the pandemic, along with Vladimir Putin's unprovoked  invasion of Ukraine, have caused gas prices to rise until this month-- until this month. We know that this in turn has fueled inflation and  put economic strain on families and small businesses across our  country.   President Biden has responded to this challenge with unprecedented  action, rallying our global partners and releasing record amounts of  oil from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The result has garnered less  attention from the media. Over the past 34 days, gasoline prices have  declined by more than half a dollar per gallon. I will say that again.  Over the past 34 days, gasoline prices have declined by more than 50  cents per gallon--the fastest decline in over a decade. More than  20,000 gas stations across our country are now offering gas for under  $4 per gallon. Leading economists expect this decline in gas prices to  continue, maybe even to accelerate.    In addition, our Nation is on track to surpass our historic,  prepandemic levels of oil production by 2023. I want to say that again.  In addition, our Nation is on track to surpass our historic,  prepandemic levels of oil production by 2023--next year.   Still, these are short-term solutions that leave Americans  susceptible to higher gas prices. Why? It is the global market that  largely determines gasoline prices. That means that as long as our  economy runs mostly on fossil fuels, energy prices will continue to be  volatile to the forces outside our Nation. We cannot drill our way out  of this problem.   In the long run, the best way to ensure that American families have  access to lower prices at the pump is by reducing our dependence on  foreign oil and on fossil fuels. I want to say that again. In the long  run, the best way we can ensure that American families have access to  lower prices at the pump is by reducing our dependence on fossil fuels.  Doing so isn't just critical for protecting Americans from high energy  costs; it is necessary for addressing the existential threat of climate  change.   Make no mistake, the climate crisis is here. It is here. It is in  Europe. It is in Asia. It is in South America. It is in Africa. It is  all over the world.   We see it in the form of unprecedented heat waves currently impacting  millions of people across Europe, as I suggested, and our country too.   We see climate change in the form of unprecedented drought, driving  wildfires across the Western United States that are bigger than my  State. Currently, firefighters are battling, as I said, 89 large fires  in 12 States, and it is only expected to get worse. According to the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration--we call them NOAA--the  decades-long megadrought in the American West is not just persisting,  it is intensifying and expanding east, worsening the threat of  additional wildfires.   We see climate change in the form of rising sea levels that produce  waves able to wipe out weddings in Hawaii just last weekend.   This event is a real-life consequence of what experts have already  told us: Sea levels are rising faster than they have in more than 3,000  years and are expected to rise by an additional foot by 2050.   We know this firsthand in Delaware. Delaware is the first State. The  lowest lying State in America is Delaware. Our State is sinking. The  seas around us are rising.   Down in Louisiana, a big State in another part of the country, they  are experiencing sea level rise as well. In the State of Louisiana, you  know what, every 100 minutes--every 100 minutes--they lose a piece of  land to the sea the size of a football field in Louisiana. I will say  that again. Every 100 minutes in Louisiana, they lose a piece of land  the size of a football field--every 100 minutes.   We see climate change in the form of sea levels rising all up and  down the east coast, down to Florida, gulf coast, east coast, west  coast, everywhere.   The extreme weather is costing us. According to an analysis of data  from NOAA and the global reinsurance company Munich Re, severe weather  caused more than $121 billion--billion with a ``b''--in property damage  in the United States between 2017 and 2021--$121 billion. That is an  average of about $940  [[Page S3513]]  per household and business and didn't take into account the property  losses from the historic wildfires I have just been talking about.   We continue to see the destruction that accompanies climate change  happen on a global scale as well, threatening the critical  infrastructure we rely on for international trade. This week, I  mentioned the recordbreaking temperatures they are seeing in England  and in Europe and in Germany and other places.   Most tragic of all, these climate-induced events are putting people's  lives at risk. Extreme heat is the leading cause of weather-related  deaths in our country. According to NOAA, the 12 most costly extreme  weather events in 2021 alone resulted in the deaths of nearly 700  people.   Addressing this crisis is the challenge of our time. It is directly  tied to the prices we pay at the pump and in nearly every facet of our  lives.   Instead of doubling down on policies that continue to fail American  consumers and the planet, as some of our colleagues have been  advocating for today, we should focus our attention on passing  legislation that accelerates our transition to a clean energy future  and leaves no community behind in the process. It is our ticket to a  brighter future and one without recordbreaking heat waves, high gas  prices, and unprecedented devastation.   Let me close with apologies to Stephen Stills. Stephen Stills is a  great songwriter and singer with Buffalo Springfield, an iconic group.  Long ago, he wrote a song that has these words. We have heard them a  million times. It starts something like this:         There is something happening here, [just] what it is ain't       exactly clear.    Those are his words, the opening line from one of the great songs of  all time.   Well, with apologies to Stephen Stills, there is something happening  here, and it is exactly clear what is causing it. It is a climate  crisis. We have way too much carbon in the air. We are producing more.  That is the bad news.   Here is the good news: We can do something about it. We can do  something about it. Part of it is--I will just close with this--30  percent of our carbon emissions in this Nation come from our cars,  trucks, and vans--30 percent. More and more, we are seeing automakers  build cars, trucks, and vans that run not on gas and diesel but on  electric. We are beginning to install literally thousands of charging  stations all over the country to help provide an opportunity for people  to charge their batteries and also to buy hydrogen, when we switch to  hydrogen, for fuel cell vehicles. Those expansions and those  investments will put literally hundreds of thousands of Americans-- probably more than that--to work across the country, in every corner of  the country, to enable us to reduce carbon emissions from our mobile  fleet.   Instead of just burning coal and to some extent natural gas, we have  the opportunity to create clean energy from advanced nuclear. I am a  Navy guy, 27 years in the Navy all in. We have been doing nuclear  energy in the Navy for 50 years. Do you know how many people have died  in the Navy from exposure to radioactive materials? Zero. Fifty years-- perfect record. We are now in the beginning of a new development and a  new exploration in pursuit of nuclear energy using small modular  nuclear reactors--a lot safer than the ones we have been building for  years.   We are in a position now to have, literally, from Maine all the way  down to Maryland, offshore wind that creates enormous amounts of  carbon-free electricity that we can use to charge our cars, trucks, and  vans and actually put a lot of people to work building those windmills  and doing good things for our planet.   The climate crisis is here. The question is, What do we do about it?  And there is an opportunity to meet it head-on. And it is not like you  got to eat your broccoli. No, no, no. This is something we can do, and  we could actually not just do good things for our planet, help us avert  greater disasters in the days going forward, we could actually create a  lot of economic opportunity, a lot of jobs and we can do that and we  can do both. We need to do that. We need to do that.   I yield the floor to my friend from Texas. I think I will sit here  and hear what he has to say.    I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum  call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time  to be determined by the majority leader following consultation with the  Republican leader, the Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar  No. 399, H.R. 7776; that the Carper-Capito-Cardin-Cramer substitute No.  5140 be considered and agreed to; that there be up to 1 hour of debate,  equally divided in the usual form, that upon the use or yielding back  of time, if a budget point of order is made, the Senate vote on the  motion to waive; and that if the point of order is waived, the bill, as  amended, be considered read a third time and the Senate vote on passage  of the bill with 60 affirmative votes required for passage; and the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Madam President, I might just add: What is all this  about? It is about the Water Resources Development Act. We are trying  to move it along and expedite it. I want to thank everybody. Senator  Capito I notice is on the floor, but Senator Cardin is here and Senator  Cramer as well. Many thanks to all of them and to the leadership on  both sides of the aisle. It is important legislation. We are happy to  get it moving.   I yield the floor.
