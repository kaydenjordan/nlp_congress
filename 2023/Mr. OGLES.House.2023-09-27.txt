 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, the section 1260H list maintained by the  Department of Defense was created by the fiscal year 2021 National  Defense Authorization Act and intended to identify any Chinese military  companies operating directly or indirectly in the United States.   Section 1260H is a part of a largely bipartisan, years-long effort to  name and shame CCP companies operating in our Nation.   While the Biden administration has made important additions to this  list, including military companies such as ChemChina and China State  Construction Engineering, the administration has still fallen short of  a full commitment to countering the malign influences of the CCP.   Earlier this year, we saw Secretaries Yellen, Blinken, and Raimondo  take trips to China as part of a diplomatic overture.   Many of my colleagues would undoubtedly agree that the CCP could care  less about diplomacy and that these trips have very little, if any,  bearing on how China chooses to behave on the international stage.   One could argue that these trips only serve to demonstrate the limits  and the lack of American resolve to confront the PRC's obviously  petulant behavior.   For instance, it is a daily occurrence to see the PRC infringe on  Taiwan's Air Defense Identification Zone. The PRC regularly makes  threats to wage war against Taiwan.   They manipulate international organizations to do their bidding. They  entrap developing countries into contracts that make them de facto  vassal states. They construct dual-use ports across the world, and it  goes on and on and on, Mr. Chairman.   In the face of the CCP's belligerent escalatory actions, the gut  reaction of the American administration ought not to be for the  Secretary of the Treasury to fly to China and consume psychedelic  mushrooms. Yet, that is what we saw from Janet Yellen.   Before Secretary Raimondo's visit to China, the Department of  Commerce, acting through the Bureau of Industry and Security,  unilaterally removed 27 CCP entities from the bureau's so-called  unverified list.   Our Department of Commerce literally chose to make a concession to an  aggressive state in order to get the CCP to meet with our Secretary of  Commerce.   It is clear that this President's judgment cannot be trusted. This  administration's assessment of China has only emboldened our Nation's  foremost enemy. Appeasement has long failed as a strategy, and it  continues to fail today.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of my amendment. I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, it would appear that many in the Democratic  Party have taken it upon themselves to offer their talents and  considerable abilities to help determine which information is reliable  and which isn't. Thanks, but no thanks.   Mr. Chairman, in September 2021, the Department of Defense offered  NewsGuard, a self-proclaimed fact-checker, a $750,000 grant to  effectively censor conservative viewpoints and opinions.   Want proof of NewsGuard's censorship efforts? I am more than happy to  provide undisputed facts.   NewsGuard has given extremely subjective and clearly biased ratings  to several conservative news outlets, including The Federalist, a 12\1/ 2\ percent accuracy and credibility score; Newsmax, 15 percent; The  Epoch Times, a 17\1/2\ percent score; and OAN, 17\1/2\ percent.   I am sure these conservative news outlets have lost out on crucial ad  revenue from these ratings. It is censorship.   It is fundamentally pathetic that this administration thinks they can  sideline conservative viewpoints and demonize conservative platforms  without the American people finding out about this.   All this is happening while Politico, NPR, and The New York Times  have previously received a perfect 100 percent; CBS, 95 percent.   Mr. Chairman, we are supposed to have an open and free press. There  should be no censorship. This is the United States of America. The fact  that we are funding an organization that is censoring viewpoints and  news is untenable.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, it should be noted that Newsmax TV is more  than just online. CBS isn't just online. The New York Times isn't just  online.   These are news outlets with multiple platforms, so it is not about  censoring online. It is about censorship.   The irony here is abundant, especially when considering that these  leftist news outlets parroted the lie promoted by 51 intelligence  officials and our disaster of a Secretary of State that the Hunter  Biden laptop story was a production of Russian disinformation.   Only in America could a guy who helped steal an election and  undermine our democracy be promoted to oversee our Nation's policy on  Ukraine, but that is the story of Antony Blinken in a nutshell.   The Hunter Biden laptop debacle was literally the biggest story of  the 2021 election, and a story, if taken seriously, that might have  resulted in a different outcome.   Instead, our government is subsidizing a self-identified fact-checker  who completely whiffed on the biggest story of a Presidential cycle.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, while I appreciate my colleague's  perspective, it should be noted that when conservative versus other  news sources are compared with similar metrics that the more liberal- leaning news outlets are ranked 27 points higher.   This has a direct impact on revenue streams. To say that they are  somehow unbiased literally defies the facts that I have laid out before  you and that you have conservative news sites on the bottom end of the  spectrum, whereas the more mainstream, liberal-leaning news sites are  at the top.   Mr. Chairman, it should also be noted that NewsGuard is known to be  reliant on and working with the WHO, the World Health Organization,  which is known for disinformation and lying and is unduly influenced by  the CCP.   This is a grant that should not be authorized, it should not be  continued, and they should not be relied upon.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of my amendment to prohibit  taxpayer money from being used on President Biden's nakedly political  executive order allegedly promoting access to voting.   This dangerous executive order instructed a wide range of agencies,  including the Department of Health and Human Services and the Small  Business Administration to engage in voter turnout operations. Think  about that for a moment, the government is engaging in voter turnout.   Worse, it instructs agencies to partner with approved third-party  organizations to assist them in their voter registration and other  election-focused efforts.   Who will approve these organizations? What criteria will be used? The  executive order doesn't say.   Congress has never granted the administration any authority to  approve such groups or specify criteria therein.   This executive order is blatantly illegal.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  0000     Madam Chair, I agree with my colleague that I, too, would  like all to participate in the voting process, all demographics across  all spectrums.   It should also be noted that there are already provisions in the law  to allow for soldiers deployed to vote.   Madam Chair, I urge adoption of my amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise today in support of my amendment to  prohibit funding for the so-called Homeland Intelligence Experts Group.   The conduct of certain members of the intelligence community, who  behaved as political hacks, quite frankly, rather than sources of  unbiased information, has undermined Americans' faith in government.  That concerns me.   Some of these officials peddled obvious falsehoods in an effort to  undermine the American people's confidence in the election of 2016, and  some meddled in the 2020 election, as well.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, at a time when we see dysfunction in  government and, quite frankly, in Congress, it is important that we  restore faith in institutions.   At a time when there are ongoing investigations into, say, the Hunter  Biden laptop, it is important that we let due process work its way and  not interject so-called experts.   With that being said, I encourage, at a time when we desperately need  to restore faith in institutions, let's do that thing. Let's trust the  process as we move forward.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
