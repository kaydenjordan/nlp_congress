 Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor today to  correct the record, really. Some of my colleagues in the Chamber voted  yesterday to begin consideration of this chips package that we have  talked about a lot because they believed it included legislation called  Safeguarding American Innovation Act, or SAIA, the bipartisan, Senate- passed, White-House supported, essential legislation to protect  taxpayer-funded research and intellectual property from being taken,  stolen, by China and other adversaries and then used against us.   It is understandable people thought that because the SAIA research  security provisions were in the broader USICA bill that passed the  Senate last year. In fact, as the coauthors of USICA know, it was the  reason I was one of the then-original Republican cosponsors of USICA  and only because of that. At that time, we needed Republican  cosponsors. And it is understandable because, this week, all Republican  offices were emailed a list of items by the lead Republican on this  bill which included chips-plus legislation, including SAIA.   So Republicans, when they voted yesterday, thought SAIA was part of  it. Even today, Democrats and Republicans alike have come up to me and  said they thought SAIA was in this bill.   By the way, they want it in this bill, but it is not. It was stripped  out of this USICA. I filed an amendment to get it back into this  package because it is so crucial to the goal of the overall effort,  which is, of course, to improve our country's competitiveness,  especially with regard to China. To do that, we must not only invest in  more American research and innovation, which I support, but we have to  protect that taxpayer-funded research and intellectual property from  being stolen by our adversaries and used against us.   Given the current realities, without such protections, I believe this  chips-plus bill, with significantly increased levels of Federal funding  for research, may well become a giveaway to Beijing.   China's made no secret of its goal to supplant the United States as  the global economic leader, and China has been willing to use every  tool at its disposal to be able to do that. As FBI Director Christopher  Wray has warned:         The greatest long-term threat to our nation's information       and intellectual property, and to our economic vitality, is       the counterintelligence and economic espionage threat from       China.   [[Page S3530]]     Director Wray has characterized China as the largest threat to our  ideas, our innovation, and our economic security, noting that the FBI  has opened 2,000 cases focused on China stealing our research, with one  case being opened approximately every 12 hours.   A number of us, in a totally bipartisan process, have been working on  protecting research for the past 4 years. In 2019, an investigative  report of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee  on Homeland Security, which I chaired with Senator Carper as the  ranking member, documented, after a yearlong investigation, how China  uses talent recruitment programs--like the Thousand Talents Plan--to  target the science and technology sectors. Talent recruitment plans  recruit high-quality overseas talent--primarily from the United  States--including academics, scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, even  finance experts. The plans provide monetary benefits and other  incentives to lure experts into providing proprietary information or  research to China. This is in violation of our laws and conflict of  interest rules. China, in turn, exploits American research,  intellectual property, and open collaboration--often U.S. taxpayer- funded--for its own economic and military gain at our expense.   Really, when you think about it, the rise in China's military and  economy over the past couple decades is, in part, being fueled by  American taxpayer-paid research, where they have essentially  leapfrogged us and commercialized it more quickly than us and used it  against us.   In just one of many examples, recently, a researcher in Kansas hid  his full-time employment with a Chinese research university to obtain  Federal grant funding for six different Department of Energy and  National Science Foundation contracts.   Remember, the funding in this bill primarily goes to the National  Science Foundation. In fact, the Department of Health and Human  Services inspector general recently released a report that found that  two-thirds of the NIH grant recipients--another place a lot of research  is done, NIH--failed to meet Federal requirements regarding foreign  financial interests including instances of U.S.-funded researchers  failing to disclose ties with the Chinese Government.   In fact, since our investigation and hearing, there have been at  least 23 different researchers that have been arrested by Federal  authorities for research theft. In testimony before the Permanent  Subcommittee on Investigations, John Brown, then-assistant director of  the FBI's Counterintelligence Division said:         The Communist government of China has proven that it will       use any means necessary to advance its interests at the       expense of others, including the United States, and pursue       its long-term goal of being the world's superpower by 2049. .       . . The Chinese government knows that economic strength and       scientific innovation are the keys to global influence and       military power. So Beijing aims to acquire our . . .       expertise, to erode our competitive advantage and supplant       the United States as a global superpower.    Then-commander, U.S. Cyber Command, General Keith Alexander described  intellectual property theft and cyber espionage in general as ``the  greatest transfer of wealth in history.''   The sentiment was underscored by former national security adviser,  retired LTG H.R. McMaster. When asked about China's growing and  intertwined military and economic threat at a March 2021 Armed Services  Committee hearing, Lieutenant General McMaster stressed the need for  the United States to defend itself saying:         It's gut-wrenching to see how much has been stolen right       from under our noses. And much of that research [is] funded       by Congress. . . . I think the financial dimension of this is       something worth a great deal of scrutiny. We are, in large       measure, underwriting our own demise.    That is why Senator Carper and I introduced the Safeguarding American  Innovation Act and insisted it be included in the Homeland Security and  Governmental Affairs title of USICA. And, again, it was, and it passed.  And it is part of the research funding--additional research funding to  have these protections around it. It would be necessary even if there  was not additional research funding, but now we are spending tens of  billions of dollars of more taxpayer money and not providing this  security.   Based on feedback from the law enforcement and research community,  the legislation goes directly to the root of the problem. It makes it  punishable by law to knowingly fail to disclose foreign funding on  Federal grant applications.   The FBI wants that badly. It requires the executive branch to  streamline and coordinate grant-making between the Federal Agencies so  there is continuity, accountability, and coordination. It allows the  State Department to deny visas to foreign researchers coming to the  United States to exploit the openness of our research enterprise and  requires research institutions and universities to do more, including  telling the State Department whether a foreign researcher will have  access to export-controlled technologies.   The State Department wants this badly. The career people at the State  Department helped us write these provisions. They need this authority.  They don't have it now.   So a vital component of any competitiveness bill must be this  commonsense, noncontroversial, extensively negotiated, bipartisan bill.  It is a matter of our national security. I have described the  extraordinary theft of taxpayer-paid research under current funding  levels. Again, it is unthinkable that we would add tens of billions of  more taxpayer dollars to sensitive research, as we propose, in the  CHIPS-plus package and not protect that research from China and other  adversaries.   I strongly urge my colleagues to support this amendment to ensure  that it is part again--as it has been in the past; we all voted for  it--of the underlying package.   I yield the floor.
