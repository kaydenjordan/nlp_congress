 I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, first of all, I come to the floor to  call for the confirmation of Rajesh Nayak to serve as Assistant  Secretary of Labor for Policy.   Over the past year and a half, our working families across the  country have really struggled through the most unequal economic crisis  in recent history.   COVID put a glaring spotlight on many of the problems workers were  already facing before this pandemic and has worsened longstanding  inequities, making life harder for women, workers of color and workers  with disabilities, and others.   If we are going to build back stronger and fairer from this pandemic,  then our Federal Agencies must be fully staffed with highly qualified  people who will help us tackle the many challenges hurting workers,  retirees, and their families.   Mr. Nayak already has an impressive track record of doing just that.  Mr. Nayak served as a senior adviser to Secretary Walsh at the  Department, and also previously served in the Solicitor's office as  Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy and Deputy Chief of Staff. In  those roles, he has worked on a broad portfolio of issues important to  workers across the country, including workforce development, worker  protection, counter-trafficking, overtime pay, health and safety,  retirement security, and more.   He has also worked twice at the National Employment Law Project,  including most recently as deputy CEO. As an advocate and a  policymaker, he has shown time and again his commitment to empowering  workers, supporting families, and advancing equity. And I have no doubt  that, if confirmed as Assistant Secretary of Labor for Policy, he will  continue working in the best interests of workers and their families,  and I urge all of my colleagues to join me in voting in support of his  nomination.    Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The VICE PRESIDENT. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all  remaining time on the motion to discharge be yielded back.
