 Mr. President, as I said before, we should not be holding  up any of the President's nominees. There is far too much work to be  done, but I think that is especially true for the man whose nomination  is before us today, the next Secretary of Health and Human Services,  Dr. Tom Price, who I am happy to say has my full support.   It is especially important that we confirm Dr. Price because, as we  all know, our health care has undergone some serious turmoil as of  late. This was undoubtedly caused, at least in part, by the rolling  calamity of ObamaCare. You can step back and you survey the wreckage,  and it is sobering to see what that law has left in its wake: double- digit premium hikes, very high deductibles, and millions of canceled  plans.   For all the fanfare over the law's passage, and all the arguments  that followed, it seems we have forgotten the person who matters the  most, the patient. That is what the next HHS Secretary is facing, a  Herculean or perhaps you might say a Humpty-Dumpty-like task of picking  up the pieces and rebuilding our health care system from the ground up.   So as we consider this nomination, I think it is appropriate to ask  ourselves: If we need someone who will focus on the needs of patients,  why not pick a doctor? Dr. Price was an orthopedic surgeon in private  practice for nearly 20 years. He taught and trained young doctors  personally. So when he hears the phrase ``quality, affordable,  personalized care,'' it is not an abstract notion to him. It is not  something he dreamed up in the Halls of Congress because he himself has  provided just that kind of care to real people.   When we repeal and replace ObamaCare, we have to avoid the kind of  thinking that gave rise to it. We need someone with on-the-ground  understanding of what it takes to care for patients, someone who knows  what it is like to stand at a bedside with a patient comforting her in  a confusing and frightful moment.   Dr. Tom Price is that man. Tom Price is also my friend. We served  together in the House of Representatives. He is a good man. That is  why, during his time in public service, he has earned the respect of  his colleagues as he has worked his way up the ranks: chairman of the  Republican study committee, chairman of the House Republican policy  committee, and, most recently, chairman of the House Budget Committee.   He has studied our health care system from top to bottom, and he is  no stranger to the health care battles the last 8 years. You could say  his chief qualification for the job of replacing ObamaCare is he had  the good sense to oppose it in the first place, but Tom Price did not  just vote no.   Contrary to what you have heard from the Democrats, he also offered  his own alternative, the Empowering Patients First Act. You may or may  not like that bill, but I think you have to admire that he was willing  to make a serious proposal. That is the kind of leadership we need at  the Department of Health and Human Services.   I want to express my support for Tom Price's nomination to be the  next Secretary of Health and Human Services. I urge all Senators to  vote for his confirmation.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
