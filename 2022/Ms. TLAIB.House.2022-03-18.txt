 Madam Speaker, we need to protect the American people from  corporate greed and abuse. The FAIR Act is one of those protections.   Corporations use forced arbitration clauses to deny Americans their  right to seek accountability and justice in disputes with private  companies. They literally eliminated any chance a resident may have for  accountability and justice from a dispute, specifically in the place of  employment.   From employee handbooks to bank documents to college admission  paperwork, companies include forced arbitration clauses as the main  form of dispute resolution so that they can rig the rules and appoint  themselves judge and jury in the arbitration process.   Forced arbitration is a private, secretive system without any  enforceable standards or legal protections for our people. There is no  public disclosure of proceedings or any requirements for arbitrators to  follow the law.   Madam Speaker, forced arbitration makes it virtually impossible for  antidiscrimination laws, disability rights laws, and so many other  important laws to be enforced at the Federal level.   To put it simply, this is unjust, and has failed the American public  for far too long.   Earlier this year, President Biden signed a law ending forced  arbitration for cases involving sexual assault or sexual harassment.   So I urge the Senate to pass this legislation and send it to the  President's desk so that we can protect the rights of consumers and  workers from corporations that seek to exploit them.                            ____________________
