 Madam Speaker, 34 days into the Trump shutdown, New  Jersey families are hurting: 5,000 Federal workers have lost their  paycheck; millions more are being harmed by the closure of critical  services.   In my district in Edison, many EPA employees are being prevented from  doing their jobs. These dedicated public servants help clean up  contaminated sites. They keep our drinking water safe. Meanwhile, at  the NOAA lab at Sandy Hook, they are unable to conduct urgent research  on climate change.   One of my EPA workers said: ``Mr. President, please open the  government. Do your job so we can do our job.'' I couldn't agree more.   Members of the Coast Guard at Sandy Hook in my district are going  without pay. These are the men and women who risked their lives to keep  us safe during Superstorm Sandy, and they deserve a paycheck.   An IRS worker from my district said: ``This is the first time in my  life that I have ever had to go to a food bank for food. Not knowing  where food is coming from is scary.'' And she went on to say that she  fears being evicted from her apartment. This is an IRS worker.   Madam Speaker, House Democrats have voted 11 times on bipartisan  legislation. It is time to open the government, Mr. President.                            ____________________
