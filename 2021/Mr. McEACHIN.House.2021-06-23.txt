 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Michael  Paul Williams, a columnist from the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the  primary newspaper of record for the Commonwealth, which is located in  my district.   Mr. Williams was recently awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary.  He is the first Pulitzer Prize recipient at the Times-Dispatch since  1948.   Throughout his nearly 40-year career, he has been a dedicated and  effective journalist who has focused much of his work on issues of race  and racial inequality in Virginia.   The first commentator of color at the Times-Dispatch, he has provided  unique, insightful, and impactful commentary that has sparked public  discourse, helped shape narratives and understandings of race in  Virginia, and challenged readers to consider the inequities that  communities of color face.   It is with great honor that I congratulate Michael Paul Williams for  his award-winning commentary on the issues impacting our communities in  Richmond.                            ____________________
