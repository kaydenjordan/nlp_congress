 Madam Speaker, I stand before you today to honor the  AmeriCorps, to honor AmeriCorps week, and the AmeriCorps members who  have dedicated their lives or part of their lives to serving others.   I have experienced firsthand the unifying power and impact of  national service, during both my own service first in the Air Force and  then later as a chemistry teacher through the AmeriCorps, Teach for  America.   It was life changing, I hope not just for me. I was honored this week  to be able to visit with AmeriCorps senior volunteers who work in our  schools as foster grandparents to see that service is still indeed  alive and thriving in the hearts of so many Americans.   In fact, since 1994, 57,000 residents of the Commonwealth of  Pennsylvania have volunteered over 79 million hours of time. Service is  a critical component in addressing many of the challenges we face as a  Nation today, including how divided we feel from one another.   Please join me in expressing our gratitude to the AmeriCorps members,  both past and present, who commit themselves to serving others.   Let's embrace national service and challenge ourselves and one  another to serve whenever and wherever we are able.                            ____________________
