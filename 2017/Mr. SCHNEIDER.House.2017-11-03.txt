 Madam Speaker, there is no question we need to reform  our outdated, overly complex Tax  [[Page H8480]]  Code. That is something we all agree on. We need to encourage growth  and support our middle class. But the Republican decision to approach  taxes in an exclusively partisan and fiscally irresponsible way is not  the way to go.   I am deeply concerned about the partisan plan rolled out by the  Republican leadership, in no small part because it saddles future  generations with trillions more in debt just to pay for tax cuts for  the most fortunate Americans.   Furthermore, restricting provisions relied upon by countless middle  class families, including the State and local tax--SALT--deductions and  property tax deductions hurts working families. This is particularly  true in States like Illinois, where one in every three filers depends  on the SALT deduction.   In the days ahead, I hope my Republican colleagues will open the tax  reform discussion to bipartisan engagement. I remain ready and willing  to sit down and work across the aisle to achieve responsible tax reform  that will grow our economy, protect our seniors, truly help middle  class families, and secure our future.                            ____________________
