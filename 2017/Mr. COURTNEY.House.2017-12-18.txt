 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I join my colleague from Kansas (Mr. Estes) today and  rise in support of H.R. 3759, the Recognize, Assist, Include, Support,  and Engage Family Caregivers Act. I want to congratulate all the  cosponsors of this bill for their good work in terms of bringing this  forward, and, again, it looks very promising that it will be passed and  signed into law shortly.   Mr. Speaker, the number of Americans over the age of 65 is expected  to reach 70 million by 2030, roughly doubling the number that existed  in 2005. As those Americans age and require assistance with their daily  routines--taking medication, getting dressed, cooking, and attending  medical appointments--family caregivers will step in to make sure that  their loved ones are safe and cared for.   This is difficult work. For an adult child, caring for an aging  parent can quickly become a full-time job. Between juggling  appointments, understanding medications, helping make informed medical  decisions, a caregiver's own priorities can take a backseat. Most  caregivers have jobs of their own, and many care simultaneously for an  aging parent as well as their own children.   But caregivers are not only providing care for older Americans or  even younger Americans with developmental disabilities. They also serve  those who have served our country.   I recently met with a caregiver from my district, Jessica, who cares  for her husband, a veteran who suffered serious traumatic brain injury  during the battle of Fallujah. Her experience managing her husband's  complex medical needs while also raising their children goes to show  that ensuring caregivers are supported is a national priority.   The bill under consideration today would recognize the contribution  that family caregivers make toward the safety and health of older  Americans. It would require the Secretary of Health and Human Services  to develop and maintain a strategy to support family caregivers by  establishing an advisory body to bring together caregivers, older  adults, persons with disabilities, veterans, employers, and State and  local officials. This advisory council would make recommendations for  how to support, assist, and engage family caregivers.   Caregivers are needed to help Americans live independently in their  homes and communities for as long as possible. In my home State of  Connecticut, there are 459,000 family caregivers who provide an  estimated $5.9 billion in unpaid care, annually. Supporting older and  disabled Americans through caregiving and ensuring caregivers are  equipped to take on this important role benefits all Americans.  Evidence has shown that, when caregivers are supported, patients delay  placement in a nursing home, continuing with lower-cost, long-term  support in the home for much longer periods of time.   Caregiving is foundational to our long-term care system in the United  States. This legislation is an important step to ensure this work is  recognized and supported.   Again, as the gentleman pointed out, the Commission on Long-Term  Care, which was actually created by this body in 2012 as part of one of  the budget bills that passed that year, was a group of stakeholders  from all across the country, in various sectors, that came together and  issued a report that, unfortunately, I don't think has gotten the focus  and attention it needs with the demographics that our country is  experiencing right now: the aging of our society.   However, this is one of those recommendations for which signs of  intelligent life appeared in Congress, and we are taking up their call  for passing legislation like the RAISE Act.   So again, I want to congratulate all the sponsors for coming  together, and I am looking forward to sending this bill to the  President for his signature.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Castor), a cosponsor of the bill, a  former member of the Education and the Workforce Committee; and even  though she has migrated to other committees, her heart still is with  the mission of the Education and the Workforce Committee, which is  obviously shown by her cosponsorship of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate the sponsors of  this legislation and also just note that the Elizabeth Dole Foundation  is a strong supporter. This is a group that has been formed to help  wounded warriors in terms of getting the caregiving help that they need  from other family members who are sometimes overlooked in terms of our  country's appreciation for those who wear the uniform of this country.   Mr. Speaker, I call for support for the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in appreciation of the sentiment that is  expressed in the resolution. However, I just feel that the content of  this resolution, if it is examined closely, particularly in  juxtaposition with the Every Student Succeeds Act, which was the K-12  reauthorization signed into law almost exactly 2 years ago on December  10, 2015, a bipartisanship measure--Congressman Kline, who was the  Republican chairman of the House Education Committee, was at the White  House with his counterparts from the Senate at the bill-signing  ceremony--if people go back and read that, they will see that actually  the road map and the pathway to achieve the goal of this resolution was  actually laid out by folks from both sides of the aisle in terms of  boosting authorized funding for K-12, particularly for low-income  students, raising the authorizing for title I schools, which has been  the workhorse of the Federal Government in terms of trying to help  target resources for kids who come from distressed sectors and areas in  terms of urban areas and rural areas, and also had many voluntary  permissive authorizations for STEM.   Now, if anything, this resolution understates the scope of the demand  that is out there for computer science and for STEM skills. There is  not a sector in the American economy, from agriculture, where the  gentleman comes from in Kansas, farmers are out there using STEM skills  every single day in terms of food production. It exists in  manufacturing.    I come from a district that is a shipbuilding district. We are in the  process of boosting submarine production up in Groton, Connecticut. The  metal trades workers are out there using computer  [[Page H10153]]  skills on the shop floors to make sure that that precision  manufacturing happens accurately.   Certainly, financial services up in Hartford, Connecticut, the home  of insurance companies like Travelers and The Hartford, they just  started a couple years ago the Insurance and Finance Academy, which is  a magnet school that brings in Travelers, Smith Barney, and The  Hartford to collaborate with the public school system to make sure that  kids, particularly low-income kids, from Hartford, Connecticut, are  getting the opportunity to learn about things like finance, banking-- giving them those skills--which are intrinsically connected to computer  science.   Mr. Speaker, the fact of the matter is that there is great appetite  in the private sector for public-private partnerships. I would  stipulate to that and again argue that, in fact, the resolution almost  understates what is out there.   What is missing is the public investment, which ESSA authorized,  whether it was title I, whether it is funding to boost teaching skills  in the STEM area. We try to give permissive authority to school  districts to find math teachers, science teachers, computer science  teachers, engineering folks and their curriculum, which every school  district is crying out for. There isn't a Member in this body who isn't  hearing about that back home.   We want to solve that problem. A resolution like this is certainly  not going to get in the way of that, but what we need to do is make  sure we fund the authorizations that, on a bipartisanship basis, we  passed in 2015.   Unfortunately, if you look at the budget that came over from the  White House back in May, the White House proposed a 13.5 percent cut to  the Department of Education, elimination of all Federal funding for K- 12 teacher professional development, and afterschool programs, which I  was up at one of them, the 21st Century Learning After School Program  in Norwich, Connecticut, a distressed municipality. They had kids,  after school, working on their computer skills, their math skills,  their science skills to give them the chance to keep up with their  grade level and to be school ready when they go into high school.                                time  1700    Again, the big one was the cut to title 1, which, as I said, is the  workhorse making sure that low-income kids actually have funding levels  that at least come somewhat close to their counterparts in more wealthy  parts of the country in wealthy school districts. So, again, this  resolution is not certainly going to be a negative, but it certainly  misses the opportunity that we really should be focused on as Members  of Congress for bolstering the public side of the public-private  partnership.   As I said, the private sector is speaking loud and clear that they  are looking for these skills and actually stepping forward like  companies like General Dynamics at the shipyard that I described in  southeastern Connecticut or The Hartford and Travelers up in the  capital city of the State of Connecticut.   What we need to be doing is match them in terms of our commitment to  make sure we are funding magnet school programs, again, title 1  programs, that help the 90 percent of kids who are in public schools so  that we actually are going to achieve the goal which this resolution  sets forward.   So, again, I certainly commend the sentiment of the sponsors of this,  but it leaves out, really, what I think is the real question of the  day, which is whether or not we are going to step up as a nation and  truly fund public-private partnerships to boost computer science  skills.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier, this resolution is a sentiment that  is hard to dispute or argue, but, unfortunately, it is just that, a  resolution that really, beyond sort of expressing a goal, an  aspirational goal, doesn't move the ball forward in terms of actually  implementing what I think this resolution seeks to do, which is to make  sure that school districts--every school district--particularly those  with low-income kids from urban areas and rural parts of the country,  have the resources which the Every Student Succeeds Act signed into law  2 years ago and laid a pathway out for us to achieve, but,  unfortunately, because of the funding levels that have not come close  to the authorized levels, we are falling short.   I couldn't agree more with the speakers, the proponents of this, that  what is at stake here, really, I think, pervades almost every priority  and every sector of our country's economy and our national policy.   In 1958, when the Russians fired Sputnik, then-President Dwight  Eisenhower stepped forward and advocated the National Defense Education  Act because he recognized that, from a national security standpoint,  having a national policy to make sure that there are adequate resources  out there for our Nation was really central to our national defense.  That triggered, again, a revolution in American education, whether at  the higher education level or even at the elementary level; and  following that lead in 1965, we passed the ESEA Act, which funded, for  the first time, title 1 that gave resources to low-income districts.   That commitment has deteriorated. It has deteriorated over the last 6  years with budgets that have underfunded this program. If you really  took title 1 in terms of the full measure of eligibility for low-income  students and school districts, we are funding it at about half of what  the real need is out there for those types of school districts.   So, again, hopefully maybe this resolution will be an awakening for  people in this Chamber, particularly as we are on the verge of taking  up the 2018 budget, that funding education is as important to our  economy and is as important to our national defense, frankly, as any  other part of the Federal budget, because that gives us the tools to  succeed as a nation, not just in 2018, but in many years forward.   So, again, I certainly am friends with some of the sponsors of this  resolution. I salute the sentiment that was offered when this was  introduced just a week or so ago, but, frankly, it falls short of the  true commitment that we need to make as a Congress to fund and give the  resources to make sure that this aspirational goal is achieved.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
