 Mr. Chairman, I rise for the purpose of a scheduling  announcement.   Mr. Chairman, as we continue to track Hurricane Irma, I know many of  our Members in southeastern United States are anxious to get home to  their families and constituents. So, in order to ensure these Members  can get home safely, the last votes for the week will now occur  tomorrow afternoon on the Harvey disaster relief package at  approximately 12:30 p.m.   The House will complete consideration of H.R. 3354 next week.    I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    The quick overview, as you know, we will complete this  appropriations package next week. We have a couple of other items that  we will list for you tomorrow, but we will continue to monitor this  storm.   I know it is going to hit a couple of States, so we will keep you  posted about the schedule for next week as well. As soon as we know, we  will keep you updated.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman, and I yield back the  balance of my time.           Amendment No. 92 Offered by Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia
