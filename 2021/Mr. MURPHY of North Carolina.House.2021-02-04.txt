 Madam Speaker, today I would like to  bring attention to a troubling assessment that was issued by the  National Counterintelligence and Security Center on Monday.   China continues to aggressively seek to acquire Americans' genetic  information. They have targeted American hotels. They have targeted  government agencies, as well as our universities, through hacks and  ill-intentioned partnerships. They recently even tried to buy fertility  clinics in the United States to gather American DNA.   And as was catalogued on ``60 Minutes'' last week, the Chinese are  now targeting family research databases that Americans innocently use  to research their family trees.   Make no mistake, our healthcare information can be and will be used  against us. The Chinese have already demonstrated the lengths to which  they are willing to go to use genetics against their own people as they  experiment on the Uighurs in the Xinjiang province. This threat cannot  be ignored.   China has already received personally identifying information on most  Americans. As citizens, we must take better control of our information,  and Congress must act to keep this problem from getting worse.                            ____________________
