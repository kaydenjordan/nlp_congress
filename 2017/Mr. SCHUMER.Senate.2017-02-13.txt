 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, candidate Trump ran a populist campaign  that promised so much to working America. Many of those themes were  actually echoed in his inaugural address, but ever since President  Trump took the oath of office, he has gone about breaking promise after  promise to the working people of this country.   A predictable pattern is beginning to emerge. This President uses  populist rhetoric to cover up a hard-right agenda. We still hear the  remnants of candidate Trump's populism in his speeches, but his actions  as President don't match up. Just an hour after he had delivered  populist words on the steps of the Capitol in his inaugural address,  the President signed an Executive order--his first, I believe--that  jacked up the price on Americans trying to afford a mortgage.   Ever since, we here in the Senate have been working through the  President's Cabinet, which is filled not with champions of the working  class, not with people who came from the working class but with a slew  of superrich nominees, Washington insiders, and corporate types who  have spent their whole careers sticking it to the working man.   A President's Cabinet provides insight into how they will govern and  what their priorities will be. The President has shown his hand by  selecting the most anti-working class Cabinet we have ever seen.   The slate of nominees we will soon consider, including Steve Mnuchin  for Treasury, Andrew Pudzer for Labor, and Rick Mulvaney for OMB, show  the yawning gap between the President's audacious promises to working  America and the practical reality of his administration, which is  steadily stacking the deck against them.   This evening we will debate the nomination of Steve Mnuchin for  Treasury, a Cabinet post that will have oversight over Wall Street.   Candidate Trump spent the campaign lambasting elites and criticizing  Wall Street. He said:         I'm not going to let Wall Street get away with murder. Wall       Street has caused tremendous problems for us.    Those are his words, but what does President Trump do? With one of  his first Executive orders, he started the process to try to roll back  Wall Street reform, undoing protections we put in place after the  financial crisis to prevent another one from occurring. He wants to  eviscerate the one agency that sticks up for consumers when they are  being ripped off by payday lenders or debt collectors--the CFPB. That  is a broken promise.   Candidate Trump said at his rallies: ``When you cast that ballot,  just picture a Wall Street board room filled with the special interests  . . . and imagine the look on their faces when you tell . . . them:  `You're fired!' ''   But President Trump told Steve Mnuchin, a Wall Street insider with  [[Page S1096]]  decades of experience in that board room he described, ``You're  hired,'' as his Treasury Secretary, no less. That is a broken promise.   A President who is a true champion for working America would never  consider unwinding protections that were designed to make our financial  system more secure and protect hard-working Americans from the risky  practices too often seen on Wall Street.   For the Secretary of Labor, the President picked Andrew Puzder, a man  who once said he prefers robots to human employees because, in his  words, they are always polite, they always upsell, they never take a  vacation, they never show up late, there is never a slip and fall, or  an age, sex, or race discrimination case.   Secretary Nominee Puzder, the guy who is supposed to be protecting  laborers--working people--actually said that.   I want to read it again. It galls me that this man is nominated for  Labor Secretary. Why does he prefer robots to human employees?  Secretary Puzder: They are always polite, they always upsell, they  never take a vacation, they never show up late, there is never a slip  and fall, or an age, sex, or race discrimination case.   This is a man who has such disdain for workers that he said the  minimum wage is a big mistake, and while at CKE Restaurants, his  company, he continually outsourced American jobs.   A President who is a true champion of working America would never  even consider selecting a nominee like Andrew Puzder to run the Labor  Department. It is another broken promise to the working men and women  of America. Amazing.   What President Trump did during the campaign and said during the  campaign and in his inaugural address is almost the exact opposite of  what he is doing now. You could not find a more anti-labor nominee for  Labor Secretary than Mr. Puzder.   Now, what about OMB? The President selected Representative Mike  Mulvaney, whose congressional career is a direct rebuke to key promises  Candidate Trump made to working America. Candidate Trump promised that  he was ``not going to cut Social Security like every other Republican  and I'm not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid.''   That is a quote from Candidate Trump.   But who does he choose for OMB? A pick who has relentlessly argued to  cut both of these programs, including bill after bill that would end  both Medicare and Social Security as we know it.   Our new Health and Human Services Secretary--who, unfortunately,  passed this Chamber because our Republican colleagues are just marching  in lockstep to the President--is in exactly the same vein.   A true champion of senior citizens, of the working man and woman,  wouldn't hire someone like Representative Mulvaney or Representative  Price to take an ax to the programs they have relied on for  generations.   Just 3 weeks in, the administration is stretching the boundaries of  cognitive dissonance. The President still speaks like a populist but  governs like a hard-right conservative. He promises to stick up for  working families, but every decision he has made is rigging the system  further against them.   Every American who works hard for their paycheck, who desperately  deserves fairer overtime pay, who is counting on Social Security and  Medicare to be there when they retire should look at this Cabinet and  be very worried.   I know many working people voted for President Trump in hopes that  they would change the power structure in Washington, as he promised so  many times. His Cabinet is the first way to see if he really meant it.  His Cabinet is the first way to measure: Is President Trump measuring  up in his Presidency to what he promised in his campaign?   It turns out President Trump was using populist rhetoric to cover up  a hard-right agenda, which will be carried out by this bevy of  billionaires and bankers and hard-right idealogues--broken promise  after broken promise.   Candidate Trump said that Washington was a place where ``the hedge  fund managers, the Wall Street investors . . . and the powerful  [protect] the powerful.''   ``But I'm fighting for you,'' he said to working Americans.   If these first 3 weeks are any indication, that is a broken promise.   The nominations of Steve Mnuchin, Representative Mulvaney, and Andrew  Puzder represent broken promise after broken promise after broken  promise. We Democrats, over the next several weeks, will make clear to  the American people, as we continue to debate these nominations, that  what President Trump said on the campaign trail is not what he is doing  as President. He is breaking his promises to the working people of  America.   Many working people who voted for Mr. Trump are depending on him to  do what he said in the campaign. Reading the tea leaves of the first 3  weeks, working Americans are going to be deeply, deeply disappointed  over the course of his Presidency.   Thank you. I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
