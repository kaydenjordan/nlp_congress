 Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.   I am going to continue to propound these unanimous consent requests  in the same form as the chairman of the Committee, but before I do,  just a few brief remarks. I know the hour is late.   First of all, it is wonderful to hear this revisionist history about  the Trump administration's disposition towards Russia. Everybody knows  what was going on. This was an administration that was practically  sycophantish towards the Russian regime, refused over and over again to  stand up in any meaningful way.   That is why the pipeline got so far along. It was the eleventh hour  when the Trump administration, at the very last minute, decided to move  forward on sanctions.   We are not here to paint the merits of the Trump administration's  decisionmaking on Russia policy. But suffice it to say, Russia did very  well expanding its influence around the region during the 4 years that  Donald Trump was in office.   Second, the effects of holding up all of these nominees is to kneecap  American national security. Never, ever before has a President had so  few nominees confirmed to key national security posts than this  President. It has never happened before.   It is true that there is a history in this body of individual  Senators placing a temporary hold on one or maybe two officials  relevant to the policy over which they are having a disagreement with  the administration. Probably many Members of this body have done that.  But at least in the time that I have been here and from what I have  heard, never before has an individual Senator held up this many  nominees for key national security posts over a disagreement on one  specific policy.   And if every single Senator did that--because every Senator here has  a policy disagreement that they believe is significant with the  Secretary of State, with the Secretary of Housing and Urban  Development, with the Secretary of Defense--then the business of  nominations and confirmations would grind to an absolute halt in this  body.   I had deep disagreements with President Trump, but never did I  endeavor to hold up every single nominee to State Department posts,  because I came to the conclusion that that would do much, much more  harm to American national security than whatever concession I might get  from the administration would provide a benefit to American national  security.   So I share this just, really, paralyzing fear that Senator Menendez  expressed, that something awful is going to happen without the kind of  personnel that every President needs on post to do the job. We could  probably get by if this was a hold of one or two or three individuals.  We are talking about dozens of key national security posts that are  left vacant because of the decision of one Senator.                Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar    Mr. President, I will continue to propound these requests. I imagine  the decision will not be different.   I ask that it be in order to make the same request as those Senator  Menendez was making with respect to Executive Calendar No. 327, Anne A.  Witkowsky, to be Assistant Secretary of State for Conflict and  Stabilization Operations.    Because American national security is gravely compromised  by the inability of a President to have his national security team in  place at a time of crisis, I would ask that it be in order to make the  same request with respect to Executive Calendar No. 328, Anne A.  Witkowsky, to be Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization.    Mr. President, because every single day that the  President doesn't have his team in place to protect this Nation, our  Nation is under more serious threat.   I ask that it be in order to make the same request with respect to  Calendar No. 329, Mary Catherine Phee, a career member of the Senior  Foreign Service to be a Member of the Board of Directors of the African  Development Foundation, for a term expiring September 27, 2026.    Mr. President, because China is absolutely celebrating  every single day that our Corps of diplomats is dramatically and  dangerously understaffed because of these holds on the President's  nominees, I ask that it be in order to make the same request with  respect to Executive Calendar No. 330, Mary Catherine Phee, a career  member of the Senior Foreign Service to be a Member of the Board of  Directors to the African Development Foundation, for a term expiring  September 27, 2021.    Mr. President, similarly, because without an ability to  have U.S. diplomats on posts, to have our most important leadership  positions staffed, we make ourselves intentionally, deliberately unable  to be able to manage crises across the world.   I would ask that it be in order to make the same requests with  respect to Executive Calendar No. 331, Mary Catherine Phee, a career  member of the Senior Foreign Service to be Assistant Secretary of State  for African Affairs.    Mr. President, I would ask that it be in order to make  the same request with respect to Executive Calendar No. 332, Lee  Satterfield, to be an Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and  Cultural Affairs.    Mr. President, I would ask that it be in order to make  the same request with respect to Executive Calendar No. 333, Karen  Erika Donfried, to be an Assistant Secretary of State for European  Affairs and Eurasian Affairs.    Mr. President, I ask that it be in order to make the same  request with respect to Executive Calendar No. 334, Jessica Lewis, to  be an Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs.    Mr. President, I ask that it be in order to make the same  request with respect to Executive Calendar No. 335, Donald Lu, a Career  Member of the Senior Foreign Service, to be Assistant Secretary of  State for South Asian Affairs.    Mr. President, I ask that it be in order to make the same  request with respect to Executive Calendar No. 336, Paloma Adams-Allen,  to be a Deputy Administrator of the United States Agency for  International Development.    Mr. President, I ask that it be in order to make the same  request with respect to Executive Calendar No. 337, Isobel Coleman, to  be a Deputy Administrator of the United States Agency for International  Development.    Mr. President, I am at the final unanimous consent  request, and I will make it in a moment.   Just to note, as we are wrapping up here, this has taken a while, and  this list of pending nominees is going to grow. It is going to get  longer and longer. There are going to be more key posts that are going  to go unfilled.   I understand Senator Cruz's desire to use his power to hold these  nominees in order to get a change in policy from this administration. I  doubt that the administration, which has already set a clear direction  and has executed an agreement with the Germans, is going to abide.   My worry, though, is that this won't be the end, that this is not  going to be the last foreign policy decision that the Senator from  Texas or other Republican Senators will disagree with, nor will it  likely be the last decision that any high-profile Cabinet member makes  that finds disagreement from my Republican colleagues.   And so I end where I began, which is to say that Senator Cruz and I  have a difference of opinion with respect to Nord Stream and the  gravity of the moment that we find ourselves in. But this place just  becomes unworkable if every single Senator holds up this many nominees  over one particular policy disagreement.   This tactic will be utilized by Democrats when there is a Republican  in the White House. It might not be me, because I find this  objectionable, but it will be copied, and you will find the same thing  happening to a Republican President and their administration grinding  to a halt in whatever Department finds itself the object of this  tactic.   So I continue to express this deep worry about what it means to not  have individuals in place in Somalia overseeing the Western Hemisphere  and to not have someone overseeing our counternarcotics operations, but  this list will get longer and longer and longer, and the risk to  American security will be greater.   Again, I will just suggest that the harm being done here to U.S.  security is much greater than the benefit that the Senator believes  will be gained through negotiation over these posts with the  administration.   So, at the risk of inspiring another very long speech from the  Senator from Texas, I make those remarks.                Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar    Mr. President, I ask, finally, that it be in order to make the same  request, as I have and Senator Menendez has, with respect to Executive  Calendar No. 150, Brett Holmgren to be an Assistant Secretary of State  for Intelligence and Research.    Mr. President, I understand the Senator believes he has  such a serious objection to administration policy that it merits this  exceptional tactic. I would submit, as I move into closing business,  that it is not the biggest disagreement that a Senator has had with an  administration. It is not the biggest disagreement that a group of  Senators has had with an administration. To believe that would be to  elevate this dispute beyond its merits. That is not to suggest it isn't  significant, but it is not the most significant disagreement that an  individual Senator has ever had with an administration.   What is exceptional is his tactic. Never before has a U.S. Senator  used their power in this way to hold up this many nominees at such a  critical moment. That is what is exceptional. That is what makes this  moment so dangerous. That is why Senator Menendez and I came down to  the floor to try to unlock some of these nominees toward confirmation,  because it is the tactic, not the disagreement, that is the exception.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session to consider the following nominations en  bloc: Calendar Nos. 268, 321, 189, 247, 267, 270, 344, 301, 295, 296,  297, 298, and 299; that the Senate vote on the nominations en bloc  without intervening action or debate; that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate; that any statements related to the nominations be printed in  the Record; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action; and that the Senate resume legislative session.

There being no objection, the Senate, at 5:56 a.m., adjourned until  Friday, August 13, 2021, at 9:30 a.m.                            ____________________
