 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and congratulate my  friend, Humberto Lopez, for receiving the Arizona Lodging & Tourism  Association's Hotelier of the Year Award this past May.   Humberto Lopez rose from humble roots and is the true definition of  the American Dream. He provided for his family as a young boy after his  father passed away, worked diligently in college at the University of  Arizona, and became a CPA.   In 1975, he founded HSL Properties, Inc. and Arizona's tourism  industry owes him its thanks for bringing excellence in hospitality and  service to the outstanding hotels he manages.   More importantly though, Humberto Lopez created the H.S. Lopez Family  Foundation, which works to improve the quality of life for communities  and families across southern Arizona through education, health, and  welfare. Humberto Lopez's work to provide for Arizona and those in need  is a testament to the success of the American Dream and the character  we need in our citizens.                            ____________________
