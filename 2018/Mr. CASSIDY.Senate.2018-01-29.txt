 Madam President, as we vote this evening on the Pain- Capable Child Protection Act, I speak to the bill as a doctor who  practiced in a hospital for the uninsured for decades. I mention  working in a hospital for the uninsured because the uninsured are  vulnerable, but if the uninsured are vulnerable, among those, the  uninsured pregnant woman is particularly vulnerable. If we are to say  she is particularly vulnerable, then we can say her unborn child is  most vulnerable of all. So I speak to these folks with that background.   Our country has struggled to find a balance between those of us who  are pro-life and those who are pro-choice. As a pro-life doctor, I  think the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act strikes a balance.  Again, as a physician, let me say it is an obligation--our society's  obligation--to care for the woman who is pregnant. Again, she is among  the most vulnerable. Her child is the future of our society.   We all agree to this. You can see we agree because our social  programs provide a safety net both for her and her unborn child.  Example: Society pays for well-baby visits through Medicaid or through  special programs for women if they are uninsured. If that child is born  healthy, then he or she is more likely to be a healthy person, to  contribute to society, to have life, liberty, and be able to pursue  happiness.   Those of us who are pro-life and pro-choice can differ when the child  within the womb deserves protection as a distinct human, but society  has agreed at some point that protection is allowed. Again, I am pro- life. I think the protection should be when the child is conceived, but  right now the law is divided.   If a pregnant woman and her child were killed by a reckless driver,  there are two counts of manslaughter filed against that reckless  driver--one way society acknowledges the life within the womb.   On one hand, let's be clear, a woman has the right to terminate that  pregnancy at another point in the pregnancy. On the other hand,  partial-birth abortion says that child's life cannot be terminated when  she is coming through the birth canal. I think the rationale for this  is that as a child comes through the birth canal, we recognize that  child can live independently, if allowed to proceed. If you will, the  criteria is: Does the child have the ability to live independently from  the mother? Again, I think that is the rationale for the partial-birth  abortion ban.   As it turns out, a child who is 5 months old within the womb has the  ability to live independently. Again, I speak as a physician. When you  see a baby in the womb at 5 months, it is incredible.   A friend of mine who works for me--actually, he and his wife are  expecting now, and they are excited. They went and got the ultrasound,  and they saw the child sucking on his thumb or her thumb--they don't  know or they don't want to know. Nonetheless, it is marvelous what they  see inside--the child. You can see him yawning, stretching. At 18  weeks, you can find out if it is a boy or a girl--and, thanks to modern  medicine and the amazing neonatal intensive care doctors and nurses we  have in this country, babies delivered as early as 20 to 22 weeks can  survive and live healthy lives, perhaps one day to become the Presiding  Officer in the Senate of the United States.   In recent years, medical research has shown that unborn children can  feel pain as early as 20 weeks after they are conceived. As a doctor, I  have to look at the scientific evidence we have when it comes to the  beginning of life. At 20 weeks, studies have provided strong evidence  that babies can feel pain despite the fact that the nerve connections  between the different parts of the brain are still developing. That is  why fetal anesthesia is routinely administered when unborn children  require surgery in the womb.   By the way, doctors know this. I just got a letter from the Louisiana  Academy of Family Physicians. One of their folks, Dr. Gravois, called  me last night. Here is a statement from their letter:         Representing more than 1,900 physicians, including active       practicing physicians, residents in training and medical       student members, as well as the patients in Louisiana, the       Louisiana Academy of Family physicians  [[Page S538]]       is the voice of family medicine in Louisiana. As advocates       for our patients, in August of 2015, the LAFP Congress of       Delegates passed the following resolution on Late Term       Abortions:        Resolved, that the LAFP is against performing elective       abortions 20 weeks and after, and further be it Resolved . .       . .    It goes on, but that is the take-home point. Family physicians take  care of both the mother and her child, the totality of it.   By the way, I will say this bill includes explicit--explicit-- exceptions when a mother's life is at risk or in cases of rape and  incest, again, attempting to strike society's balance between those of  us who are pro-life and those who are pro-choice.   Versions of this law have already been passed in 20 States, including  my State of Louisiana, but all babies who feel pain deserve the same  protection. Most Americans agree, even some who believe abortion should  be legal. Polls show that majorities of women, Independents, and  Democrats support this protection. So I hope my colleagues will join in  supporting this commonsense, humane legislation.   It is estimated this bill will protect 12,000 to 18,000 babies per  year. Protecting unborn babies who can feel pain is the right thing to  do. Protecting their right to life is the right thing to do.   I urge my colleagues to vote for this important legislation.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.
