 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor John  Trees.   Mr. Trees lived in Springfield, Illinois, and was the loving husband  to our own district office's Candice Trees. On September 28 of this  year, they would have celebrated 48 years of marriage.   John was a proud veteran of the U.S. Air Force, serving during the  Vietnam war. After his years of service, John went on to become a  skilled laborer and accomplished carpenter.   Once retiring from the Illinois Department of Transportation, John  had more time to do what he loved. Combining his love of food and  serving others, John started his own catering business aptly named Two  Drunks in the Dark Catering.   He truly enjoyed spending time with his wife, three daughters, and  five grandchildren. Going on yearly trips to St. Louis Cardinal games  or attending his grandchildren's sporting events were just a few things  ``Papa John'' loved to do.   John would be the first to lend a hand and always had a welcoming  door at his home. John was always great at providing advice and giving  direction to those who needed him the most.   We honor John today, and I send my deepest condolences to Candice and  the entire Trees family during this very difficult time.                            ____________________
