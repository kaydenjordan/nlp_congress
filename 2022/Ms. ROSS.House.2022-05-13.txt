 Mr. Speaker, this week 51 Senators voted to allow the  Supreme Court to strip women of their fundamental right to abortion  healthcare. If Roe v. Wade is overturned, abortion access will be left  in the hands of State legislatures dead set on turning the clock  backward 50 years.   We have already seen what Republicans are capable of when it comes to  women's personal liberties, and now I fear women in my home State of  North Carolina could face a similar fate. All that stands between us,  and an egregious abortion ban is Governor Roy Cooper and enough of his  allies in the legislature.   Despite this threat, I am still hopeful because I believe that the  women of North Carolina will make their voices heard. We are ready to  fight for our freedom and liberty. Women deserve to have their  decisions protected and respected.                            ____________________
