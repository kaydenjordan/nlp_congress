 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, Mr. DeJoy was before a Senate committee on Friday. He  was asked if he would put back in the sorters that he had removed, and  he said no.   I think that is because he had already done his dirty work. He had  already slowed down the mail by taking the sorting machines out, and  the flat sorters as well, which my postal people tell me is causing  great delays and will cause greater delays.   He had already done it. He refused to put them back in. Why? Because  the job was done, and he didn't want to put those sorters back in to  see that the mail was delivered. He is no Karl Malone. He does not  deliver. He is not the ``Mailman.''   These postal sorters need to be there. 39,000 letters an hour go  through. The flat sorters are necessary for the mail-in ballots. There  is no reason he wouldn't put them back in. It wouldn't save any money.  It costs money to take them out. He didn't save money by taking them  out. He reduced efficiency. He reduced the ability of the Post Office  to deliver ballots to elect a person safely in America. This is a  shame, and it is a crime.    Madam Speaker, I support the bill, and everyone here should.
