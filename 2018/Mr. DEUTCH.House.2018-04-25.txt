 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member and the chairman  for their leadership. I thank Congressman Jeffries and Congressman  Collins for helping to shepherd the bill to this point.   It is a pleasure to vote on these much-needed consensus reforms.  Consensus on copyright has been difficult. It has been difficult to  forge between the various interests represented in the content and the  tech communities but, fortunately, we now have consensus. Much of that  has been borne out of true necessity, the technological demands of  licensing tens of millions of songs and streaming services, and much of  it has been borne out of basic fairness. Recording artists,  songwriters, producers, and engineers deserve to be paid for their  creativity and genius; and digital services deserve more certainty in  their operations. The current system is broken.   As someone who cares deeply about music and the incredible people who  are a part of making it and who understands the importance of the  intersection of technology and creative works that benefit all American  music fans, I really feel privileged to be part of this process of  modernizing our copyright laws. The Music Modernization Act does not  include everything that I have supported to bring fairness and 21st- century sophistication to the copyright laws, but it takes big steps  forward toward those goals.   I am hopeful that, with this bill, it will help to ensure that we all  continue to benefit from the amazing artists of yesterday and today and  the innovative technologies that bring them into our lives.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the Music Modernization  Act.
