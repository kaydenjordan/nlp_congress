 Mr. President, this morning, I released a ``Dear  Colleague,'' alongside Senators Heinrich, Rounds, and Young, announcing  three Senators-only briefings on artificial intelligence taking place  starting in the next few weeks. These bipartisan briefings will  culminate in the first-ever classified all-Senate briefing on AI's  impact on national security. In fact, all three briefings are the first  all-Senators briefings on AI. The briefings will be led by some of the  top minds in AI and will help Senators develop much needed expertise on  defining the technological shift of this century.   I urge all my colleagues to attend these briefings because it won't  be long before we see AI's dramatic changes in the workplace, in the  classroom, in our living rooms, and in virtually every corner of our  lives. It is already starting to happen. We must be ready.   These all-Senate briefings are important because elected  representatives in the 21st century cannot ignore AI any more than we  can ignore national security, job creation, or our civil liberties. AI  will permanently impact all these things and more.   The first briefing in the next few weeks will focus on the state of  artificial intelligence today. The second briefing will focus on where  this technology is headed in the future and how America can stay at the  forefront of innovation. The third, our first-ever classified briefing  on AI, will focus on how our adversaries will use AI against us, while  detailing how defense and intelligence agencies will use this  technology to keep Americans safe.   We will share more details on dates, times, and speakers in the  coming days, and again, I urge every Senator, Democrat and Republican,  to attend all three briefings.   I thank Senators Heinrich, Rounds, and Young for cosponsoring these  briefings with me.   The Senate and all leaders have an obligation to deepen our expertise  in AI because if we do our jobs correctly, we can ensure AI becomes a  remarkable force for human prosperity, while mitigating its very real  potential risks.   I look forward to attending these briefings and again thank Senators  Rounds, Heinrich, and Young for joining me in this important  announcement.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 166.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call  for the cloture motion filed today, June 6, be waived.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate  proceed to the consideration of the following nomination: Calendar No.  165, Craig Anderson for U.S. Marshal for the district of Montana for  the term of 4 years, that the Senate vote on the nomination without  intervening action or debate, the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table, and that the President be immediately  notified of the Senate's action.    I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to  legislative session to be in a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it stand adjourned until 10 a.m.  on Wednesday, June 7; that following the prayer and pledge, the Journal  of proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be deemed expired,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; that following the conclusion of  morning business, the Senate proceed to executive session to resume  consideration of the Crane nomination postcloture; further, that all  time be considered expired at 11:30 a.m. and if any nominations are  confirmed during Wednesday's session, that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table and the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.    If there is no further business to come before the  Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:31 p.m., adjourned until  Wednesday, June 7, 2023, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
