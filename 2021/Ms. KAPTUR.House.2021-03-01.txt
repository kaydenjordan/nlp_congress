 Madam Speaker, I rise to support and ask my colleagues to  support the COVID-19 Hospital Loan Conversion Act, a bipartisan piece  of legislation that I have introduced along with my good friend from  Ohio (Mr. Gibbs).   Madam Speaker, our Nation's hospitals have invested heavily to  prepare for and care for us during the coronavirus pandemic. They  canceled tens of thousands of elective surgeries and nonemergency  patient tests, at the government's request, to help ensure adequate  hospital capacity, preserve gear and equipment, and reduce the risk of  unnecessary patient spread.   Madam Speaker, this major shift has put some of America's hospitals  on the brink of financial disaster. While a provider grant program that  costs $175 billion and is designed to provide support to all providers  is helpful, more support is needed, especially in regions that fall  well below the median household income at the national average.   Madam Speaker, this legislation will convert Medicare accelerated and  advance payment loans to grants to ensure the additional financial  support hospitals and other providers direly need.   Hospitals across my district have shared that in the absence of more  financial support, including this assistance, it is possible they will  be forced to close their significantly scaled back operations.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support the bill, the Gibbs- Kaptur, Kaptur-Gibbs bill, to help these hospitals out.                            ____________________
