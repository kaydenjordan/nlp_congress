 Madam Speaker, I rise today to praise a great man of  faith, Pastor Douglas L. Williams, III.   For the last 11 years he has been the pastor at Zion Hill Baptist  Church in Newark, New Jersey.   In that time, he has done tremendous work to help his community. He  was a strong supporter of vaccinations to protect members and residents  from COVID-19. He worked to provide social services to people who were  suffering due to COVID-19-related job losses and other hardships.   His goal as the pastor of Zion Hill has been to love people and grow  an active community church, and he has done that.   I had the honor of attending his installation 11 years ago along with  my father, the late Congressman   Donald Payne, Jr., as I was a city  councilman at the time. And recently to celebrate the 11 incredible  years he has given as the head of Zion Hill. I can say, he is truly  succeeding in his goal.   So congratulations again to Pastor Douglas L. Williams, III, on 11  exceptional years as the pastor of my neighbors, Mr. and Mrs. Johnson,  from across the street, who for 60 years have gone to that church, and  also for the rest of the congregation at Zion Hill Baptist Church.   He is truly a man of faith who is a blessing to our community.                            ____________________
