 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I learned on Friday that the Department  of Justice has opted not to pursue a civil rights investigation into  government-run nursing homes in several States about their response to  the COVID-19. Earlier this year, I urged the Department to pursue this  investigation, and I, today, call on the Attorney General to reconsider  this decision that I learned about last Friday. I do that in light of  media reports suggesting that the obstruction of justice may have  occurred in at least one of these jurisdictions.   Close to 1 year ago, the Department sought information from four  States. Those four States are New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and  Michigan. The information sought was about the number of COVID-19  infections and deaths in their public nursing homes.   The Department's request for this information came on the heels of  media reports suggesting that State officials in these jurisdictions  had pressured nursing homes to accept patients, regardless of their  COVID-19 status. It was reported that officials in New York also may  have engaged in a coverup by actively concealing from the public the  actual number of COVID-19-related fatalities in that State's nursing  homes.    Serious questions remain to this day about whether the Governors in  New York and these three other jurisdictions helped fuel the COVID-19- related  [[Page S5153]]  death tolls in nursing homes through the issuance of their own  executive orders that went against the advice of geriatricians.   Yet the Department is declining to pursue the matter. And in the case  of New York, this is particularly troubling.   New York's Governor not only reportedly pressured nursing homes in  his State to accept patients during the initial stage of the pandemic,  regardless of their COVID-19 status, but his administration did not  provide an accurate picture of the actual death tolls to the public.  This lack of transparency was done to avoid accountability. So put very  simply, the public deserves better.   According to a report by the New York Post, a top aide to Governor  Cuomo even apologized to a group of Democratic State lawmakers during a  phone call for reportedly withholding data on COVID-19-related nursing  home fatalities during this pandemic.   The Department's Civil Rights Division won't investigate, but at  least the FBI and prosecutors at the U.S. Attorney's Office are looking  into the matter. These Federal prosecutors' review reportedly focuses  on whether Governor Cuomo's administration underreported COVID-19  deaths in the nursing homes in an effort to avoid negative publicity.   At least someone is looking at this. However, I am disappointed that  the Justice Department proper and Attorney General Garland have decided  to pull their punches.   As I stated today in a letter to the Attorney General, it would be a  grave injustice to those who perished in these facilities during the  pandemic to neglect to fully explore such widely reported and troubling  allegations.   And as others, too, have noted, promoting more accountability and  transparency is vital under these circumstances. It would not only help  prevent similar missteps in the future but also maintain public  confidence in the Department, which is waning under the Department's  current leadership.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  attached speech, which I delivered in honor of National Whistleblower  Appreciation Day, be printed in the Congressional Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  National Whistleblower Appreciation Day                                july 29, 2021         Each year on July 30th, we take time to celebrate       whistleblowers and the important role they play in keeping       our government transparent and accountable.        But as you folks know, the task of supporting       whistleblowers doesn't start and stop on July 30th.  [[Page S5173]]         It's a year round job.        And here in the Congress, it's something we've been working       at for decades.        When I first came to Washington in the 1970s, many of the       whistleblower laws we take for granted today didn't exist at       all.        Anybody who dared to blow the whistle back then was about       as welcome as a skunk at a picnic.        Of course the real skunks were usually there among the       crowd trying to build a scare, chase the whistleblower away,       and destroy their reputation.        That's still true today.        But now it's a lot harder for those people to get off the       hook.        That's because whistleblowers today have a lot more       protections than they did years ago, and they have important       advocates in their corner, such as the IG community, who are       there to support them.        And when they don't, I call them out for it.        You may have heard that I recently recommended that       President Biden fire FHFA IG Laura Wertheimer.        Last month, the IG decided to resign effective July 31st.        It's unusual for me to ask the President to fire an IG. In       fact, you may recall that in past years, I've written letters       to Presidents Obama and Trump when they fired IGs without       providing reasons to Congress as required by law.        But this was a clear cut case.        I started investigating IG Wertheimer years ago.        Whistleblowers were the ones who first brought concerns       about the IG to my attention.        They said she was abusing her staff, making fun of them for       things like their weight and medical disabilities.        She was even retaliating against some of the whistleblowers       who spoke to my office.        After I saw just how bad things were, I asked the Inspector       General Community's Integrity Committee to conduct their own       investigation.        They validated many of the whistleblowers' claims and       called for her to be removed.        Earlier this month, there was concern that the IG's Chief       Counsel, who was found to have obstructed the Integrity       Committee's investigation and was recommended for       disciplinary action, could become the new Acting IG.        So I wrote to President Biden, urging him to appoint a       qualified individual for the Acting IG position and swiftly       nominate a permanent replacement who will respect their staff       and protect whistleblowers the way they are supposed to as an       IG, instead of retaliating against them.        My ongoing work to support whistleblowers also involves new       legislation.        One bill that we passed recently involves the Commodity       Futures Trading Commission Whistleblower Program.        Since that program was created, whistleblowers in the       commodities industry have been coming forward in       unprecedented numbers to report fraud and abuse.        We reached a point within the last year where the upcoming       awards were so large, the fund was in danger of not having       enough cash on-hand to pay whistleblower office staff.        My CFTC Fund Management Act, which passed the Congress in       June, now allows the Commission to set aside money in a       separate account to ensure that staff are paid and this       highly successful whistleblower office can remain open.        I also have several other bipartisan whistleblower bills I       intend to pass this congress.        I'm working on legislation that will strengthen incentives       and protections for whistleblowers who report potential money       laundering, as well as whistleblower protections for FBI       employees.        And I have bills to further strengthen the False Claims Act       and Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act.        So, as much as we've accomplished together, there's still       more to be done.        In closing, I want to thank you all for the role you play       in bringing attention to whistleblower issues and advocating       on behalf of whistleblowers.        Your service in support of whistleblower issues is a       service to our country and all the ideals of good government       that I've spent my career working to promote.        So please go forward and continue doing the good work that       you've been doing all along.        Together, let's make sure the whistleblower laws and       protections we have in place next year and the year after are       even stronger than the ones we have in place today.        Thank you.                            ____________________
