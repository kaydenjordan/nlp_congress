 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor my number one caseworker,  Jenny Stansberry, who is retiring after 30 years of service to the  people of east Tennessee. She has been with me since I took office, and  she also worked for Congressmen Duncan Sr. and Jr. prior to me taking  Congress in the Second District.   Jenny and I used to hang out at Brunswick Billiards, and she is a  dear friend as well as the best employee I could ever ask for. When I  was running for office, Mr. Speaker, her mom offered me a Coca-Cola and  she always regretted that she never allowed me to use her bathroom. She  has always been very kind to me. She drove a cool GMC Acadia back in  the day that was quite fetching in the Brunswick Billiards parking lot.   She is best known for her work with veterans and active military  members, but she has helped thousands of east Tennesseans deal with  basically every Federal agency issue you can think of, and she does it  all with a warm smile that lights up the room.  [[Page H1235]]    This picture beside me is her farewell surprise, a poster we made of  her with one of the loves of her life, Magnum P.I. Although she didn't  end up with Tom Selleck--my fraternity brother, he went to U.S.C., of  course, and I went to the University of Tennessee many years later--in  fact, she never met him, her retirement will allow her to spend more  time with the actual love of her life, Tony, and her daughter Anne, who  is just a wonderful, wonderful young lady.   Jenny, thank you so much for everything you have done for me and the  folks of east Tennessee. I always appreciate you. You were always good  to my folks, and you have been my buddy. You will be missed.                            ____________________
