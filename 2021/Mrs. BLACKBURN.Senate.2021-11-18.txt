 Madam President, the Biden administration's  disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan jeopardized our national  security, empowered our enemies, and put thousands of innocent lives in  jeopardy. But as the situation devolved, stories emerged of heroic  efforts to push back the Taliban's advance and save stranded Americans,  allies, and Afghan partners from the clutches of one of the world's  most dangerous terror organizations.   Today, I want to honor a group of unsung heroes who joined this  effort from the home front. Team Blackburn is blessed to include a  dedicated and tenacious group of caseworkers and personal staff who  treat the needs of Tennesseans like those of their own families. During  those chaotic weeks, these people fielded hundreds of panicked calls  for help from and on behalf of Tennesseans who were trapped behind  enemy lines. They used every resource at their disposal, leveraged  every connection they could think of and worked more than a few  miracles to bring those Tennesseans closer to home.   On behalf of the Volunteer State, I thank the following members of my  staff who went above and beyond on behalf of the common cause of  freedom: Elizabeth Kelly, Payton Scott, Kayley Russell, Heather  Hatcher, Josh Knell, Jeri Wheeler, Dana Magneson, Caroline Diaz- Barriga, Kim Cordell, Mac McCullough, Alexander Gonzalez, Grace Burch,  Jay Strobino, John Clement, Edward Pritchard, and Emily Manning.                            ____________________
