 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of  Brandon Caserta from Peoria, Arizona.   Brandon was born on May 25, 1997, and everyone who knew him spoke of  his kindness. Brandon grew up in a family dedicated to serving our  Nation. He followed in the footsteps of his father, Patrick, a retired  United States Navy Senior Chief, by enlisting in the Navy. Brandon  dreamed of one day joining our Nation's elite in the United States Navy  SEALs, and he eventually served as Petty Officer Third Class with the  Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron 28 in Norfolk, Virginia.   Sadly, on June 25, 2018, Brandon tragically took his own life. In  memory of their son, Brandon's parents, Teri and Patrick, began  advocating for change to help prevent suicides among Active-Duty  military and veterans. Their dedication resulted in the inclusion of  H.R. 3942, the Brandon Act, named after Brandon, in the fiscal year  2022 National Defense Authorization Act. This bill allows  servicemembers to quickly seek lifesaving mental health care.   I am grateful for Teri and Patrick's dedication and their tireless  effort to ensure that Brandon's legacy brings about meaningful change  within our military.                            ____________________
