 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 923, I  call up the bill (H.R. 3) to rescind certain budget authority proposed  to be rescinded in special messages transmitted to the Congress by the  President on May 8, 2018, in accordance with title X of the  Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act 1974, and ask for its  immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise today to present H.R. 3, the Spending Cuts to Expired and  Unnecessary Programs Act. This package of rescissions withdraws nearly  $15 billion in funds previously appropriated to various Federal  programs and agencies. These funds are rescinded from programs and  agencies that no longer need or cannot spend the money or from programs  that no longer exist. When such funding goes unused for years, those  funds should be returned to the Federal Treasury, as taxpayers should  expect.   Sweeping up these extra funds will not cause undue harm or hardship  to the essential activities at these Federal agencies. In fact, year  after year, rescissions are included in our regular appropriations  bills, and dozens of such rescissions have previously received  bipartisan support.   The bottom line is that it is not in the interest of the taxpayers to  let outdated, unnecessary dollar balances sit idle, especially when the  Nation is facing such high debt and deficits.   As I have said many times, Congress controls the power of the purse,  and it is up to us to keep our fiscal house in order in order to reduce  wasteful spending, unnecessary spending, whenever possible.  [[Page H4873]]    Such rescissions are not new. Over the past 20 years, there have been  hundreds proposed and approved in both Democratic and Republican  administrations.   I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to  the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), the majority whip.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to  the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Granger), the chairman of the  Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to  the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), the chairman of the Labor,  Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittee  on Appropriations.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to  the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Graves), the chairman of the Financial  Services and General Government Subcommittee on Appropriations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Arkansas (Mr. Womack), who is the chairman of the Budget  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Arkansas  an additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Oregon (Mr. Walden), who is the chairman of the Energy and  Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from California (Mr. McCarthy), the majority leader of the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Alabama (Mr. Aderholt), chairman of the Agriculture, Rural  Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies  Agriculture Subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional  30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Kansas (Mr. Estes).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support H.R. 3, and  I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H4882]]         Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 5895, the first set of the fiscal  year 2019 appropriations bills: Energy and Water, the Legislative  Branch, and the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs.   I am pleased that the House is considering three appropriations bills  this afternoon. These bills provide funding to rebuild our military  infrastructure, support military families, improve nuclear security,  support our Nation's energy and water infrastructure, and assure the  smooth and safe operations of the legislative branch.   To highlight a few of these important investments:   The Energy and Water bill, under Chairman Simpson's direction, funds  our national security and supports the energy and water infrastructure  that keeps our economy moving and America open for business.   In total, his bill provides $44.7 billion in discretionary funding.  To support a strong nuclear national security strategy, particularly at  this time of rapidly shifting global dynamics, his bill provides  targeted increases that will maintain an effective nuclear arsenal,  preserve our Nation's nuclear-powered fleet, and keep nuclear weapons  out of the hands of those who would misuse them.   Beyond these critical responsibilities, the bill also directs $7.28  billion to the Army Corps of Engineers for projects and activities that  will improve America's ports and waterways and promote public health  and safety.   The bill also further supports economic growth by investing in the  Department of Energy's programs to advance the goal of an all-of-the- above solution to energy independence. This includes funding to  continue congressional efforts for the safe, secure storage of nuclear  waste at Yucca Mountain.   Next, the Legislative Branch Appropriations bill under Chairman  Yoder's lead provides $3.8 billion in funding for the operation of  Congress and its support agencies, excluding Senate-only items. It may  be the smallest of the 12 appropriations bills, but it is very  important to the operation of our great democracy.   This total represents a small increase above current enacted levels.  These increases are directed to critical programs that make our Capitol  complex more secure and more efficient. This includes supporting our  wonderful and dedicated Capitol Police force, which keeps the complex  safe for Members and visitors.   Lastly, the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations  bill, led initially by former Chairman Dent and now by Chairman Judge  Carter, provides a total of $96.9 billion in discretionary funding at a  crucial time for our Armed Forces and the VA. This includes $11.3  billion for military construction projects, a 3.8 percent increase  above fiscal year 2018 levels, recognizing the need to rebuild our  military infrastructure. This funding will enable our troops to fight  current and emerging threats around the globe, as well as provide them  with peace of mind and care for their families.    This bill also includes $85.3 billion for the Department of Veterans  Affairs, the largest total amount for the VA in its history. These  additional funds will be directed to critical priorities within the  Veterans Administration: improved access to healthcare; quicker claims  processing; and support for crucial health programs like suicide  prevention, mental health, and opioid abuse prevention. This also  includes $1.2 billion for the new VA Electronic Health Record system to  accelerate the progress on this long-awaited project.   Accompanying these funding increases are strong oversight provisions  that will increase accountability at both the Pentagon and the Veterans  Administration and ensure that precious tax dollars go where they are  most needed.   I want to thank the chairs and ranking members and all the staff who  worked on these bills that all Members should be proud to support.   These bills received bipartisan support in committee because they  focus on universal priorities: national security, care for our veterans  and military families, and essential infrastructure.   I am extremely disappointed to read and hear the minority has  directed its Members to oppose this appropriations package, despite the  fact that all of these bills were constructed as they always have been:  in a bipartisan manner. If there is no minority support for this  package, those Members will be turning their backs on this House's  historic support for our veterans and their families and for  modernizing our military installations around the world, which include  medical facilities, new barracks and mess halls, playgrounds, schools,  and family housing.   I want to thank Chairman Simpson, Chairman Yoder, former Chairman  [[Page H4885]]  Dent and now Chairman Judge Carter for their leadership on these bills;  and also Ranking Member Kaptur, Ms. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and Mr.  Tim Ryan from Ohio for their work on these bills.   I would also like to thank the hardworking staff who helped to bring  the bills to the floor: Jenny Panone and Tim Monahan from the  Legislative Branch Subcommittee; Sue Quantius, Sarah Young, Kiya  Batmanglidj, and Tracey Russell from the Military Construction and  Veterans Affairs Subcommittee; Angie Giancarlo, Loraine Heckenberg,  Perry Yates, and Amy Murphy from the Energy and Water Subcommittee;  along with the front office staff and my personal staff.   I urge my colleagues to support these responsible appropriations  bills and vote ``yes'' on H.R. 5895.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Carter), the new chairman of the Military  Construction, Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies on Appropriations,  and I also thank him for his leadership and work on the Homeland  Security Subcommittee as well.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to  the gentleman from California (Mr. Calvert), the chairman of the  Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, and thank him  for getting through such a successful markup of 5 hours yesterday  afternoon. Actually, I thank all members for their perseverance in that  regard.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Tennessee (Mr. Fleischmann), a valuable member of the Energy and  Water Development and Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Rutherford), a new member of the House Appropriations  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Washington State (Mr. Newhouse).    Mr. Chair, I yield the gentleman an additional 15  seconds.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Alabama (Mr. Aderholt), chairman of the Agriculture, Rural  Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies  Subcommittee on Appropriations.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Valadao), a great member of the Appropriations  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman  from Idaho (Mr. Simpson), chairman of the Energy and Water Development,  and Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to urge Members to vote  for this three-bill package. I know that both Members of the majority  and minority have worked hard on those bills. I think it is important  we deliver this package for the American people.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Chair, I would like to thank the gentleman for  his amendment. We are pleased to accept it. This is a remarkable  program, and we want to honor those who serve and allow them to serve  with us in a further capacity.   I wanted to commend the gentleman. I believe we have about 110  serving in congressional offices, and this will provide additional  opportunities to some remarkable young men and women.   I thank the gentleman for yielding.    Will the gentlewoman yield?    We would be very pleased to accept the  gentlewoman's amendment. We commend the gentlewoman for her effort. We  also commend the effort of those who work in this office dealing with  many, many hundreds of cases. We are pleased to accept the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to  the gentleman's amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment would provide funding  to re-create a government agency, as the gentleman mentioned, which was  defunded in 1995, 23 years ago. Before we re-create an entire  government agency, I believe the most responsible thing to do is to  study the need for such an agency and to identify the best path  forward.   After receiving dozens of requests advocating for the restoration of  this funding, this bill has included, through the work of Chairman  Yoder--and I am briefly taking his place and have the pleasure of  working with Ranking Member Ryan.   We have included in the report accompanying this bill language  directing the Congressional Research Service to engage with the  National Academy of Public Administration or a similar entity to  produce a report detailing, first of all, the current technology  assessment resources available to Members within the Government  Accountability Office, to some extent, which has taken over this  responsibility for the last 23 years; also to assess the potential need  to create a separate entity; and, lastly, are there parts of what are  being suggested here already duplicative within the available resources  and services of the legislative branch?   For this reason, I oppose the amendment and urge the Members to do so  as well.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, the GAO does most of what these  gentlemen are seeking. I think, obviously, they have a certain feeling,  and I respect those feelings. I don't think we need to create an  agency, basically the duties of which have been taken, for the last 23  years, by the Government Accountability Office.   Mr. Chairman, I urge the Members to vote against the amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.                                time  2300     Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Chairman, I would be very pleased to accept  the amendment. I thank the gentleman from Tennessee for his forethought  and concern, which we also share.
