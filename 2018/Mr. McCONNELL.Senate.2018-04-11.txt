 Mr. President, this morning, Speaker Ryan announced to  his colleagues that he will be departing the House at the conclusion of  the 115th Congress.   Two and a half years ago, Paul Ryan was drafted by his colleagues to  lead the House through a new era. Like a true leader, Paul stepped up  to the plate. He answered his colleagues' call with exactly the  earnest, selfless, and focused approach that has defined his entire  career in Congress. The results have been beyond impressive.   Capping off a remarkable 20-year career in Congress, Paul's  speakership has yielded one significant accomplishment after another  for his conference, his constituents in Wisconsin's First Congressional  District, as well as the American people.   True to his career-long reputation as a champion for pro-growth  economics, Paul helped lead the way on last year's once-in-a-generation  rewrite of the Nation's Tax Code. Thanks in large part to his personal  passion and expertise, reform became a reality, and our economy is  charting a new course toward greater prosperity and greater  opportunity.   On its own, this generational accomplishment would secure the  Speaker's legacy as a transformational conservative leader, but, of  course, it is far from the only fruit of his speakership. His  leadership was vital to securing everything from the largest year-on- year increase in defense funding in 15 years to the remaking of the way  we treat and find cures for rare diseases. What is more, Paul has  paired that ambitious agenda with infectious good cheer and an  unflagging commitment to serve all Americans. Amidst all the stresses  and pressures of leadership, Paul's optimism and energy never waned.   It has been a sincere pleasure and a real inspiration to work  alongside this humble servant and happy warrior. I am glad we can count  on his continued leadership through the rest of this year because our  work together is far from finished. I look forward to collaborating  closely these next months to implement more of the inclusive, pro- growth, pro-opportunity agenda the American people are counting on us  to keep advancing.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on another matter, yesterday the  Senate confirmed the first of six nominees slated for consideration  this week, Claria Horn Boom to serve as district judge for the Eastern  and Western Districts of Kentucky. She was confirmed 96 to 1. There was  just one Senator in opposition.   This is the kind of uncontroversial nomination the Senate could  typically dispatch by a voice vote, but not these days. Over and over  again, we have had to file cloture and exhaust floor time on amply  qualified nominees who then soar through their confirmation votes by  lopsided margins.   Since President Trump took office, the Senate has had to hold 82-- 82--cloture votes on judicial and executive nominations. In the first 2  years of President Obama's administration, there were only 12 such  cloture votes--12 for President Obama, 4 for George W. Bush, 8 for  President Clinton, and already, just a few months into President  Trump's second year, there have been 82. The numbers speak for  themselves.   Today we will have the opportunity to confirm yet another qualified  nominee for a critical post. John Ring's nomination to serve on the  National Labor Relations Board is an important next step to continue  cleaning years of regulatory rust off of the American economy. It is a  natural addition to the progress we have made scaling back unhelpful  regulations that make it harder for American businesses to create jobs  and make opportunities for American workers more scarce.   Mr. Ring's confirmation will give the country a fully staffed NLRB  once again and turn the page on the previous administration's efforts  to remake this bipartisan Board into a one-sided political weapon. Even  in a short amount of time last year, we saw just how much good a fully  functioning NLRB can do for American workers when it calls balls and  strikes fairly instead of bending over backward to  [[Page S2048]]  meet Big Labor's every demand. Today we will have the chance to get  things back to normal for the long term.   Mr. Ring has a distinguished record in labor negotiation. I would  urge my colleagues to join me in voting to confirm him today.   After Mr. Ring, the Senate will turn to the nomination of Pat  Pizzella to serve as Deputy Secretary of Labor. The fact that this  Cabinet agency has gone 15 months without its No. 2 official is yet  another testament to the historic obstruction visited on this  administration by Senate Democrats. He has been sitting on the calendar  for 6 months despite his ample qualifications. I would urge all of my  colleagues to vote to finally advance Mr. Pizzella's nomination.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, this week we have  been discussing the stark difference between the Obama administration's  agenda and the policies that President Trump and this Republican  Congress have implemented.   During the Obama years, the overwhelming majority of all the limited  new growth and new jobs went to the biggest and richest urban areas.  Times were good if you happened to live in New York, San Francisco, or  a few other places, but if you were one of the millions of Americans in  our Nation's towns, smaller cities, suburbs, or rural areas, they were  not so good. According to one estimate, between 2010 and 2016, 73  percent of all the employment gains in the country went to metro areas  with more than 1 million residents. Practically everywhere else,  Americans either treaded water or started sinking.   This President and this Republican Congress were sent here to put  this right, and because the American people gave us a chance to do so,  they now have leaders in Washington who focus on cutting taxes instead  of raising them, rolling back overregulation instead of piling on more  suffocating rules, and looking out for the best interests of all  workers and job creators, not just those in our biggest and wealthiest  cities.   The early results from our inclusive opportunity agenda are clear.  After years of stagnation, we are beginning to see signs that rural  America turned a corner in 2017. One analysis found that last year,  rural areas outpaced the rest of the country in job creation, relative  to the share of the economy they started out with. There is still much,  much more to do, but these early promising signs add up to hundreds of  thousands of new jobs. That is a sight for sore eyes in Kentucky, West  Virginia, Montana, Maine, and so many other States.   What about our smaller cities? I recently heard from my friend  Senator Toomey that, because of this historic tax reform we passed last  year, Carpenter Technology in Reading, PA, will invest $100 million in  expanded manufacturing capabilities--$100 million in our economy and  American workers because of tax reform. For this American manufacturer,  founded in 1889, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act means a new hot rolling mill  to produce the special alloys for aerospace and consumer electronics.  They are also investing in 3D printing. This is what happens when  manufacturers have the breathing room to bet on the U.S. economy and on  their American workforce. Breathing room is exactly what our policy is  giving them. Carpenter already employs more than 3,000 Pennsylvanians,  and with this kind of major capital investment, I expect they will be  competing for future generations of skilled workers as well.   Pennsylvania should be proud of Senator Toomey. He is one of the  leaders who have helped lead the charge for tax reform. It is a shame  his colleague, the senior Senator for Pennsylvania, put party politics  ahead of workers and taxpayers and voted to block tax reform right from  the beginning.   Fortunately, my Democratic colleagues failed to block tax reform from  taking place, even though many now want to repeal the law that has led  to new jobs, higher wages, and increased opportunities all across our  country.   Stories like these are just the first fruits of tax reform,  regulatory reform, and all the other ways this Republican Congress is  fighting for every American worker, job creator, and middle-class  family.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII, all postcloture time on  the Pizzella nomination expire at 9:30 a.m. tomorrow and the Senate  vote on confirmation of the Pizzella nomination; further, that if  confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action; finally, that there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided  prior to each vote.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the  distinguished Democratic leader, Mr. Schumer, I send to the desk a  resolution authorizing testimony and representation by the Senate Legal  Counsel, and ask for its immediate consideration.   Mr. President, this resolution concerns a civil case pending in the  Court of Common Pleas for Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, in which  defense contracting logistics firms based in Kuwait have sued  competitor firms for defamation and tortious interference for allegedly  sending false emails to various U.S. government agencies harming the  plaintiff companies. The complaint asserts that in 2011 representatives  of the defendants communicated allegedly harmful allegations to a  number of government agencies and officials, including an employee in  the office of then-Senator Mark Kirk. Senator Kirk forwarded the  information for investigation by the Defense and Treasury Departments.   The plaintiffs issued a subpoena seeking deposition testimony from  the former Senate staffer about his communications with the defendants'  representatives about these allegations. Senator Kirk would like to  cooperate by providing relevant and unprivileged staff testimony about  these communications.   Accordingly, consistent with the rules of the Senate and Senate  practice, this resolution would authorize former Senator Kirk's staffer  to testify at a deposition. The resolution would also authorize the  Senate Legal Counsel to represent Senator Kirk's former employee in  connection with his testimony.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 357, S. Res.  224.    I further ask unanimous consent that the committee- reported amendment to the resolution be agreed to, the resolution, as  amended, be agreed to, the committee-reported amendment to the preamble  be agreed to, the preamble, as amended, be agreed to, the committee- reported amendment to the title be agreed to, and the motions to  consider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening  action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 457, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed,  the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 458, submitted  earlier today.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
