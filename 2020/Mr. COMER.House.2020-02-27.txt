 Mr. Speaker, last week, I had the opportunity to travel to  Kentucky Lake, alongside Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and  other local leaders, to observe progress being made to remove Asian  carp from our west Kentucky waterways. Senator McConnell and I took a  boat out on the water to observe the new Modified Unified Method for  removing this invasive species from our lakes.   Thanks to Federal funding we have secured, efforts are in progress  that will improve the fishing industry and our overall tourist economy  in the First Congressional District of Kentucky. The Federal resources  that have been steered toward this problem are instrumental in fighting  the war on carp.   It has truly been a team approach, with local leaders like Lyon  County Judge-Executive Wade White doing a tremendous job of advocating  for action.   While there is certainly work left to do to eradicate Asian carp, we  are moving in the right direction. I pledge to continue working with  State and local officials and to be an effective Federal partner moving  forward to rid our waters of this harmful species.            Honoring Union County Superintendent Patricia Sheffer     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Union County  Schools Superintendent Patricia Sheffer for winning the F.L. Dupree  Outstanding Superintendent Award. This prestigious honor is awarded  annually by the Kentucky School Boards Association to a leader who has  demonstrated a high level of accomplishment within their school system.   Serving as superintendent comes with a variety of steep challenges  and responsibilities. Based on this award, Patricia has gone above and  beyond to excel in this critically important role.   She has committed her career to working with community leaders to  improve opportunities for the next generation, including placing a  heavy emphasis on improving career and technical education  opportunities.   Mr. Speaker, her impact on Union County and public education cannot  be overstated. I have seen firsthand the great work Ms. Sheffer has  done there in Morganfield, and I join with all of my constituents in  the First Congressional District of Kentucky in congratulating her.               Honoring National Future Farmers of America Week     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of National FFA  Week, an event that always brings back fond memories and is very  special to me. Not only am I a proud farmer and former commissioner of  agriculture, but I was also very active in FFA and had the high honor  of serving as Kentucky FFA president.   FFA had an extraordinary influence on my life, as I know it does for  many young people today. I proudly display my blue and gold jacket here  in my congressional office.   While I will admit to being biased, there is no better way to learn,  grow, and excel than being part of FFA. This quality organization uses  agriculture education to empower students and put them on a lifelong  path to success.   The leadership skills that students gain through FFA are extremely  valuable, and I know that it makes a positive difference in the lives  of young people every day.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent so many high-quality FFA  programs, leaders, and students here in Washington, and FFA will always  hold a special place in my heart.                            ____________________
