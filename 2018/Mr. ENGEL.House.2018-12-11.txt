 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure.   First of all, I want to thank Mr. Chabot for authoring this  resolution. I also want to thank Representative Joe Crowley for his  extraordinary dedication to all the people of Burma, including the  Rohingya people. I thank Chairman Royce for bringing this resolution  forward and for his leadership on this crucial issue throughout the  years.   This resolution calls on the Government of Burma to release Burmese  Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, who have been sentenced to  7 years following their investigation into the attacks on Rohingya  civilians by the Burmese military and security forces. There is  overwhelming evidence that these journalists were entrapped by the  Burmese Government, who targeted them because of their reporting of the  military's horrific crimes.   Their jail sentence is a part of a broader issue. Despite elections  in 2015 that brought a pro-democracy civilian government to power, the  Burmese Government still operates on antiquated laws that lead to  locking up prisoners of conscience, even when their only crimes are  reporting information that is unflattering or inconvenient for the  government or for the military.   This resolution rightly calls on the civilian government in Burma to  repeal the laws that have been used to crack down on civil society and  free expression and to pardon prisoners of conscience who have been  imprisoned under these unjust laws.   We must take a moment and reflect on the context of these arrests.   The journalists were investigating what we now know were the crimes  against humanity and genocide of the Rohingya people. They should not  be sitting in a prison cell. They should be celebrated for faithfully  carrying out their obligation to report the truth.   This resolution does something else that is very important. It states  that, in the opinion of the House, the atrocities inflicted on the  Rohingya people by the Burmese military constitute genocide.   It is important that we call it by name. It is a critical step  towards justice for the victims. So we need to use the word  ``genocide.''    I am glad that this resolution urges the Trump administration to call  this atrocity what it is and pursue accountability for this heinous  violence.   With this resolution, Congress continues to assert our leadership and  show that we stand with the Rohingya people. We will not be silent as  the Burmese Government allows or tacitly encourages attacks on the  press and on civil society. We will call out injustice when we see it.   So I support this measure, and I urge all Members to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Levin), who retires this year and leaves an extraordinary  legacy in this Chamber.   (Mr. LEVIN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Sherman), a senior member of the House Committee on  Foreign Affairs and the ranking member of the Asia and the Pacific  Subcommittee    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, I want to, again, thank my colleagues and Chairman Royce  for their hard work on this measure, as always. This is an important  resolution. It gives a name to the atrocities that occurred in Rakhine  State, calling them genocide, and urges the Trump administration to  take appropriate action to hold the Burmese military accountable for  these crimes.   I agree with what everybody has mentioned. The resolution also calls  for the release of two journalists wrongly imprisoned in Burma; and by  passing this resolution today, we not only speak on behalf of these two  journalists, but call for an open, civil, transparent, and increasingly  democratic society in Burma.   Mr. Speaker, I hope all Members will join me in supporting this  measure, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I rise in support of this measure.   Mr. Speaker, let me once again start by thanking Chairman Royce. He  has been one of Congress' most active leaders, if not the most active  leader, on policy related to the Korean Peninsula. He leaves behind a  great legacy after a distinguished career in this Chamber and a  remarkable record of bipartisanship and leadership on the Foreign  Affairs Committee.   The measure before us today affirms that the United States-Republic  of Korea alliance will continue to defend against outside aggressors,  uphold the peace, and guard the prosperity built by our two nations.   This resolution is before us at a critical time. The American  alliance with South Korea is under intense strain. It is critical that  we coordinate with our partners in Seoul when it comes to North Korea,  but we see the administration and our South Korean partner are not on  the same page when it comes to this important security issue. I am  deeply concerned about the potential consequences of this gap between  our administration and our ally, and many of us in both parties share  the concern.   Now, the question of how we handle American policy toward North Korea  is very important. This resolution rightly lays out that we should  continue to apply economic pressure to the Kim regime, but we need to  remember sanctions are a tool, not a complete strategy. We need to  fully articulate a diplomatic strategy to accompany sanctions and  enable them to work properly.   I also think it is important that our sanctions policy provides  specific humanitarian exemptions. Life-saving humanitarian aid has  never been held hostage to the political whims of the Kim family. We  need to continue that tradition and not allow the impoverished,  mistreated people of North Korea to pay the price for their dictator's  political machinations.   I agree with the chairman that we need to put economic pressure on  the North Korean regime. But Congress should continue to provide space  for diplomacy and humanitarian assistance, as we do now in our current  sanctions policy. The resolution before us today would be a stronger  piece of legislation if it contained mention of this principle.   Although I wish the resolution laid out more explicitly the  importance of a holistic strategy to accompany sanctions, it is a good  measure that I am proud to support.   Our alliance with Korea is of paramount importance to our strategic  and security interests, and I am glad this  [[Page H10067]]  measure reaffirms our strong commitment to that partnership.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting this  resolution, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Sherman), one of our most senior and ranking members on  the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. He is ranking member of the  Asia and the Pacific Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Let me say, Mr. Speaker, I again thank Chairman Royce for his years  of leadership on the Foreign Affairs Committee and his remarkable  legacy on setting the agenda for American policy in the Korean  Peninsula.   The United States-South Korea alliance is essential to our strategic  posture in Asia. Our commitment to the Republic of Korea will persevere  as a critical part of American foreign policy. It should be our utmost  priority to deepen and strengthen our cooperation, and this resolution  continues and aids that strong partnership.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this  resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure.   First of all, I want to acknowledge the gentlewoman from Guam (Ms.  Bordallo), my colleague, for her longstanding advocacy of American  engagement in the Pacific region. I thank her for introducing this  resolution.   This measure supports cooperation with the Pacific Islands in the  areas where we both have critical interests, including support for  regional organizations and promotion of sustainable economic  development.   The resolution rightly focuses on a critical threat facing the  Pacific Islands and the United States, which is climate change.   In September of this year, Pacific Island leaders reaffirmed in a  joint declaration that ``climate change remains the single greatest  threat to the livelihoods, security, and well-being of the peoples of  the Pacific.''   I wish that the President and the administration would act on that  threat, but, instead, the United States refuses to acknowledge climate  change at recent international conferences. The refusal to acknowledge  established scientific fact is really wrong and dangerous.   Our country has a critical role to play in the effort to address  climate change, and when we abdicate that responsibility, we endanger  future generations and the regions most at risk, like the Pacific  Islands.   So this is a good resolution, affirming America's commitment to  advance self-government, economic development, and self-sufficiency for  all the people of this strategically important region.   It is important to note that this resolution expresses our continued  support for our compact agreements with the Freely Associated States.  The Pacific Islands remain a region critical to our interests and the  interests of our partners, including Australia, New Zealand, and Japan.  It makes sense that we would continue to support investments that  enhance our partnership with the Pacific Islands.   I support this measure, and I urge all Members to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Sherman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H10070]]    I want to again thank Congresswoman Bordallo for introducing this  resolution.   American engagement in the Pacific Islands region is critical to our  strategic posture in the Western Pacific. With its passage, we reaffirm  our commitment to the islands. I support this resolution, and I  encourage my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume,  and I rise in support of this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Mast of Florida, who authored this  measure, and I want to, again, extend my thanks to Chairman Royce,  particularly for his very kind and generous words.   We have worked for the last several years, so many years, on the  Foreign Affairs Committee to try to bring peace to Syria. We have been  frustrated in watching the dictator kill hundreds of thousands of his  own people, innocent men, women, and children.   I think one of the most horrific days that I have ever spent in  Washington was when we had Caesar, the photographer who was part of the  regime but defected and escaped with his pictures of genocide and  pictures of unbearable, unthinkable atrocities that kind of scarred my  brain forever, and I know the same goes for the chairman. We will never  forget it. And we will keep trying to fight for the people of Syria and  try to bring the dictator and the people who allow him to do these  horrific things to justice.   It has been very difficult, because the Russians have embraced Assad,  but it is absolutely disgraceful.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Royce for his kind words. He has  said a lot of things about what I did, but it couldn't have possibly  been done without him as the chairman working side by side, the two of  us, pushing these important issues, and Syria has certainly been a  situation that needed our attention.   I just regret that we weren't able to do more to stop the slaughter  in Syria, but I want to thank Chairman Royce, who has just been  fantastic in terms of having a moral compass to say that what is going  on should not stand and calling attention to the atrocities.   So, Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Royce and Mr. Mast.   Mr. Speaker, the crisis in Syria has gone on for far too long, a  civil war that has killed at least half a million people, displaced  more than 11 million Syrians, and stoked instability and extremism well  beyond Syria's borders.   Iran and al-Qaida are on Israel's doorstep; refugees have overwhelmed  Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan; and the human suffering inside Syria is  still unimaginable.   Just 2 weeks ago, an American family learned the tragic news that  their daughter was tortured and killed in Assad's prison. Leila was one  of thousands of cases of enforced disappearance in Syria.   The Assad regime has had plenty of help, as this resolution points  out. The Syrian regime was on the ropes earlier in the conflict when  Iran sent thousands of fighters to defend its ally, Bashar al-Assad.  Iranian-backed Hezbollah has been battle hardened, gaining fighting  experience in Syria, displacing communities wholesale, and remaking  Syrian society in their image.   The Russian Government came in to save the Assad regime when they  again seemed to be losing the war, and the Russians sent fighter jets  to target civilian populations and infrastructure, hospitals,  schools, markets. We have heard from Syrian doctors who were delivering  babies as air strikes threatened them from above, and then when  civilian defense workers, the White Helmets showed up to clear the  rubble, Russian bombs targeted the emergency workers, too. That is just  shameful.    And it is not over. Idlib, a city of 2 million people, many of whom  fled other conflict zones, is now under threat of annihilation. Truth  be told, terrorists have a strong presence there, emboldened by the war  crimes of the Syrian regime and their allies.   As Assad seeks to consolidate power and territory, millions of  innocent people stand in the crosshairs.   There is no military solution to this conflict. Assad may believe  that he can bomb his way out of this, but the regime's presence will  continue to be a magnet for extremists.   Iran's permanent presence in Syria will only lead to further  instability. And let me be very clear: we cannot and should not rely on  Russian assurances to remove Iran from Syria.   You know the old adage, ``Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice,  shame on me.'' The only thing that the Russians can be trusted to do in  Syria is foment further instability on behalf of the regime.   This resolution comes at a critical time. It calls on the  administration to work toward a political solution to this conflict and  it seeks to build American leverage in negotiations by opposing  international reconstruction funds that would support projects in  Assad-controlled territory.   Lastly, I want to thank the many Syrian-American groups, which I have  worked closely with, who have been doing whatever they can possibly do  to stop the carnage and the evilness of the Assad regime. I will be  continuing to work with the Syrian-American groups. Hopefully we can  one day restore freedom and democracy to that beleaguered land.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support this resolution, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Kildee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   In closing, Mr. Speaker, let me say that this resolution reminds us  of the importance of building leverage as we push for an end to the  crisis in Syria. We can and we should do more to increase that  leverage.   Congress, as Chairman Royce mentioned before, could do so today by  passing the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act, my legislation to  pressure the Assad regime to stop the violence, to sit down and  negotiate an end to this conflict.   It really breaks my heart that it is being held in the other body,  and we are hoping, before the end of the year, that we can shake it  loose. It had tremendous support in this Chamber, bipartisan support,  support on both sides  [[Page H10073]]  of the aisle. The House passed it twice; the administration strongly  supports it; and the Syrian people desperately need it. The clock is  running out in the other body, with one single Member opposing it.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the Caesar bill and the  resolution before us today, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Conaway of Texas for authoring this  resolution, and, again, I thank Chairman Royce.   Mr. Speaker, in Europe's far eastern reaches, construction has begun  on a new pipeline to move natural gas, the Nord Stream II. If this  project reaches completion, it will represent much more than a way to  move fuel from point A to point B. It will, in fact, be a new tool for  Russia to interfere in European politics, to pit ally against ally and  neighbor against neighbor, to put down deeper roots in the heart of the  European Union, and to weaken efforts to confront Russia for a range of  aggressive behaviors.   Russia has already shown the way it uses its gas resources as a  weapon, choking off supplies to Ukraine and inflating prices. If the  Nord Stream II  [[Page H10074]]  goes forward, this dangerous practice could increase a hundredfold.   We want to see a Europe that has access to a range of energy sources.  The last thing European countries should do is become more dependent on  Russian gas. There are plenty of other options, whether from the  Caspian basin or from right here in the United States.   This measure calls on European governments to reject this clear  threat to stability and security. It is an appeal to our allies not to  allow Russia another avenue to undermine European unity and involve  itself in European politics.   Mr. Speaker, I am glad to support this measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, Russia is already enough of a problem for our European  friends. Putin's efforts to undermine democracy and stoke instability  are a constant threat to European peace and unity. In 6 months' time,  Russia could have another way to exert even more leverage on Europe,  and that is if its development of the Nord Stream II pipeline goes  forward. Today we are going on record to say that that is a terrible  idea, and we hope our allies and partners in Europe see it the same  way.   So I again thank the authors of this measure, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure.   Let me start by thanking Chairman Royce for bringing this measure  forward. He and I introduced this resolution a few weeks ago after the  latest flare-up of Russian aggression in Ukraine.   I also want to thank the gentlewoman from Florida, who has always,  through the years, time and time again, been standing up with us for  what is right and really showing a great moral compass.   I am glad that, as we wrap up this Congress and as Chairman Royce  wraps up a distinguished career as a Member of the House, we are again  working together, working across the aisle with a bipartisan commitment  to American leadership and American values. That has been the hallmark  of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the 6 years Mr. Royce has been  chairman and I have been ranking member. I am grateful that we are  going out of this Congress on the same, positive, good note.   Mr. Speaker, this measure is another opportunity for the House to go  on record condemning the aggressive and destructive behavior of Russia  under Vladimir Putin. Russia had shredded international norms and laws  with its illegal occupation of Crimea, its violent campaign in eastern  Ukraine, the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight 17, and Russia's  ceaseless shirking of its obligations under the Minsk II peace  agreement, all at a cost of thousands of lives.   Most recently, Russia has blockaded the Kerch Strait and militarized  the Sea of Azov. A few weeks ago, Russian forces fired on Ukrainian  vessels attempting to pass through the strait, ultimately seizing the  vessels and their crews as well.   What is remarkable about this latest action, Mr. Speaker, is just how  brazen it is. Typically, Putin has always made sure that there is some  veil of deniability over his dirty work so that he can say up is down  and cast blame somewhere else.   But this time, Russian forces are operating out in the open. It is  almost as though Putin thinks he can turn the international order on  its head and there won't be any consequences. I cannot imagine where he  got that idea.   My measure that we are now considering says that Russia's latest  aggression cannot stand. It calls upon the  [[Page H10076]]  Kremlin to immediately return the captured vessels and crews and to end  its violation of Ukrainian sovereignty. It reaffirms our support for  Ukrainian independence, democracy, and prosperity, and it calls on the  Trump administration to hold Russia accountable, to make sure there  will be consequences for this sort of behavior.   We hope the administration hears us and acts accordingly, and we hope  the people of Ukraine and the thugs running Russia hear us and know  that Congress won't stay silent in the face of Moscow's outrageous  behavior.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Levin), who has been a Member of this House for many  years and has done wonderful work.   (Mr. LEVIN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)                                time  1600     Mr. Speaker, in closing, I am worried that Vladimir Putin  is becoming emboldened because he has faced no real consequences for  his ongoing violations of international law. I am glad we are  considering this resolution today, saying that he should face  consequences.   I wish we had more time in this Congress to work on legislation that  could make those consequences real. I am committed to staying focused  on this issue when we come back in January.   For now, I am glad we are sending this message, and I am glad to  stand shoulder to shoulder as I have so many times over the past 6  years with my friend, Ed Royce, as we pass this measure.   Mr. Speaker, again, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida, Ileana Ros- Lehtinen. I ask all Members to support this, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
