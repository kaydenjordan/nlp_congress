 Mr. President, I send a question to the desk directed at  both sides.  [[Page S689]]    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas has a question for  both sides.   The clerk will read the question, and the House managers will go  first for 2\1/2\ minutes.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         Out of their 16 hours, the House managers devoted all of 15       minutes to articulating a newly created legal standard for       incitement: 1, was violence foreseeable; 2, did he encourage       violence; 3, did he do so willfully? Is this new standard       derived from the Criminal Code or any Supreme Court case?        While violent riots were raging, Kamala Harris said on       national TV:        They're not gonna let up--and they should not.        And she also raised money to bail out violent rioters.        Using the managers' proposed standard, is there any       coherent way for Donald Trump's words to be incitement and       Kamala Harris' words not to be incitement?    Mr. Manager RASKIN. Thank you, Mr. President and Senators.   I am not familiar with the statement that is being referred to with  respect to the Vice President, but I find it absolutely unimaginable  that Vice President Harris would ever incite violence or encourage or  promote violence. Obviously, it is completely irrelevant to the  proceeding at hand, and I will allow her to defend herself.   The President's lawyers are pointing out that we have never had any  situation like this before in the history of the United States, and it  is true. There has never been a President who has encouraged a violent  insurrection against our own government. So we really have nothing to  compare it to. So what we do in this trial will establish a standard  going forward for all time.   Now, there are two theories that have been put before you, and I  think we have got to get past all of the picayune, little critiques  that have been offered today about this or that. Let's focus on what is  really at stake here.   The President's lawyers say, echoing the President, his conduct was  totally appropriate; in other words, he would do it again. Exactly what  he did is the new standard for what is allowable for him or any other  President who gets into office.   Our point is that his incitement so overwhelmed any possible legal  standard we have that we have got the opportunity now to declare that  Presidential incitement to violent insurrection against the Capitol and  the Congress is completely forbidden to the President of the United  States under the impeachment clauses.   So we set forth for you the elements of encouragement of violence,  and we saw it overwhelmingly. We know that he picked the date of that  rally. In fact, there was another group that was going to have a rally  at another date, and he got it moved to January 1. He synchronized  exactly with the time that we would be in joint session, and as  Representative Cheney said:         He summoned that mob, he assembled that mob, he incited       that mob, he lit the match.    Come on, get real. We know that this is what happened.   The second thing is the foreseeability of it. Was it foreseeable?  Remember Lansing, MI, and everything we showed you. They didn't mention  that, of course. Remember the MAGA 2 march, the MAGA 2 rally. They  didn't mention that. The violence all over the rally, the President  cheering it on, delighting in it, reveling in it, exalting in it.   Come on. How gullible do you think we are? We saw this happen. We  just spent 11 or 12 hours looking at all that.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The managers' time has expired.   Counsel for the former President has 2\1/2\ minutes.   Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. Senator Cruz, I believe the first part of  your question refers to the newly created Raskin doctrine on the First  Amendment, and he just--his answer actually gave you a new one:  appropriateness.   The standard that this body needs to follow for law is Brandenburg v.  Ohio, and the test really--the three-part test really comes out of  Bible Believers v. Wayne County, to be specific. The speech has to be  explicitly or implicitly encouraged, the use of ``violence.'' In other  words, it has to be in the words itself, which is--clearly, it is not  in the words itself. That is step one. They don't get past it.   Two, the speaker intends that his speech will result in use of  violence or lawless action. There is no evidence of that, and it is  ludicrous to believe that that would be true.   Third, the imminent use of violence or lawless action is likely to  result from speech.   Also, they fail on all three points of the law as we know it and  needs to be applied here.   I don't know why he said he never heard Kamala Harris say about the  riots and the people rioting and ruining our businesses and our streets  that they are not going to let up and they should not because we played  it three times today. We gave it to you in audio, I read it to you, and  you got it in video. That is what she said. But it is protected speech.  Her speech is protected also, Senator. That is the point.   You all have protections as elected officials, the highest  protections under the First Amendment, and that First Amendment applies  here in this Chamber to this proceeding. And that is what you need to  keep focused on. You need to keep focused on what is the law and how do  we apply it to this set of facts. It is your duty. You can't get caught  up in all of the rhetoric and the facts that are irrelevant. You need  to keep focused on what is the issue before you decided based on the  law--Brandenburg and Bible Believers--and apply it to the facts, and  that requires you to look at the words, and there were no words of  incitement of any kind.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The counsels' time has expired.   The Senator from Washington.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following  op-ed be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     [From the Fox News, Feb. 9, 2021]   Sen. Ted Cruz: Should the Senate Exercise Impeachment Trial? Why the                               Answer Matters                               (By Ted Cruz)         The constitutional question of whether a former president       can be impeached or tried after he has left office is a close       legal question. On balance, I believe that the better       constitutional argument is that a former president can be       impeached and tried--that is, that the Senate has       jurisdiction to hold a trial.        However, nothing in the text of the Constitution requires       the Senate to choose to exercise jurisdiction. In these       particular circumstances, I believe the Senate should decline       to exercise jurisdiction--and so I voted to dismiss this       impeachment on jurisdictional grounds.        Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution gives the House       ``the sole Power of impeachment,'' and Section 3 gives the       Senate ``the sole Power to try all impeachments.'' At the       time the Constitution was adopted, there was meaningful       debate over whether impeachment encompassed so-called ``late       impeachments.'' i.e. after the person had left office.        The British common law, which informed the understanding of       the Founders, suggests that the better answer is yes.        In the 18th century, there were two English impeachments of       note: Lord Chancellor Macclesfield in 1725 and India's       Governor-General Warren Hastings, which extended from 1787 to       1795. Both were late impeachments (after they had left       office). Shortly after the Founding, a third British       impeachment occurred: Lord Melville in 1806. His impeachment       also occurred after he left office.        The American experience is similar. In 1797, the House       impeached Sen. William Blount, and in 1876 the House       impeached Secretary of War William Belknap. Both had left       office by the time articles of impeachment were delivered to       the Senate.        With Blount, the Senate voted that it lacked jurisdiction       (although principally because he had been a senator and not a       member of the executive), and with Belknap, the Senate voted       that it had jurisdiction but declined to convict.        To be sure, there is textual ambiguity on the question of       whether impeachments of a former president are       constitutional.        One can look to other provisions of the Constitution--such       as article II, Section 4's reference to ``the President''       (not ``a President''), and that same section's language that       says an impeached individual who is convicted ``shall be       removed from office''--and conclude in good faith that late       impeachments are not permissible.        However, given the historical underpinnings and the       Constitution's broad textual commitment (``sole power'') of       the impeachment power to the House and Senate, I believe the       best reading of the Constitution is that the Senate retains       jurisdiction. Imagine, for example, that evidence were       uncovered that a former president had sold nuclear secrets to       the Chinese government. In that instance, where the president       had hypothetically committed both treason and bribery       (explicit grounds for impeachment in the Constitution), there       is little question that both the House and Senate would have       exercise jurisdiction to impeach and try those crimes.        Importantly, there are two types of jurisdiction: mandatory       and discretionary. With mandatory jurisdiction, the tribunal       must hear the case; with discretionary jurisdiction, the       tribunal can decide whether to exercise its legal authority       to hear the case. For example, the vast majority of the       Supreme Court's caseload arises on discretionary       jurisdiction--it has the authority to hear most cases, but it       doesn't have to do so.        And nothing in the Constitution makes the Senate's       impeachment jurisdiction mandatory. ``Sole power'' means       ``sole power''--the Senate can decide whether to hear the       case.        The present impeachment is an exercise of partisan       retribution, not a legitimate exercise of constitutional       authority.        The House impeached President Trump in a mere seven days.       It conducted no hearings. It examined no evidence. It heard       not a single witness.        For four years, congressional Democrats have directed       hatred and contempt at Donald J. Trump, and even greater fury       at the voters who elected him.        On the merits, President Trump's conduct does not come       close to meeting the legal standard for incitement--the only       charge brought against him.        His rhetoric was at times over-heated, and I wish it were       not, but he did not urge anyone to commit acts of violence.       And if generic exhortations to ``fight'' or ``win'' or ``take       back our country'' are now indictable, well, be prepared to       arrest every candidate who's ever run for office or given a       stump speech.        House Democrats argue that these circumstances are       different. The situation was politically charged. The       protesters were angry. And what started as a peaceful protest       on the Ellipse ended up with some of the protestors engaging       in a violent terrorist assault on the Capitol that tragically       took the life of a police officer.        If that's the new standard--and if strong rhetoric       constitutes ``High Crimes and Misdemeanors''--then Congress       better prepare to remove House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-      Calif., Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-      N.Y. and former Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., next.        Repeatedly over the past four years, multiple Democrats       have engaged in incendiary rhetoric and encouraged civil       unrest, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi who expressly compared       law enforcement to Nazis, Rep. Waters, who emphatically       encouraged a campaign of intimidation and harassment of       political opponents, Sen. Schumer, who made threats--by       name--to ``release the whirlwind'' against two sitting       justices of the Supreme Court, and then-Sen. Harris, who       actively campaigned to provide financial support, in the form       of bail, for rioters last summer even after hundreds of law       enforcement officers were injured and many people, including       retired St. Louis police captain David Dorn, were brutally       murdered.        There is no coherent rationale that renders President       Trump's remarks ``incitement,'' and somehow exonerates the       angry rhetoric of countless Democrats. If Trump's speech at       the Ellipse was incitement, so too was Schumer's threat on       the steps of the Supreme Court.        The honest answer is both may have been irresponsible, but       neither meets the legal standard for incitement.        Accordingly, I voted against the Senate taking jurisdiction       in this trial. In different circumstances, the Senate could       choose to exercise its constitutional authority to try a       former office-holder. But here, when the House has impeached       without evidence or Due Process, and when it is petty and       vindictive and it fails to meet the legal standard, then the       Senate should have declined to exercise jurisdiction.        President Trump is no longer in office, and nothing is       served--other than partisan vengeance--by conducting yet       another impeachment trial.                            ____________________
