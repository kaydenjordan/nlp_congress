 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding the  time.   Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to present to the House the fiscal year  2019 Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations  Act.   Before I review the details of the bill, I would like to thank  Chairman Frelinghuysen for his leadership and unwavering commitment to  the appropriations process. Our committee is back on track to bring 12  bills through the committee markup and before the full House for the  second year in a row.   I would also like to thank Ranking Members Lowey and  Kaptur. As  always, their thoughtful approach to the issues have made this a better  bill, even though I was disappointed that the gentlewoman from New  York, who is my friend, said she didn't like the Energy and Water bill  just now.   The Energy and Water bill totals $44.7 billion, which is $1.5 billion  more than last year's level and $8.2 billion above the budget request.   Increases over last year were targeted to those areas where they are  needed most: to provide for our Nation's defense and to support our  Nation's infrastructure.   The bill provides a total of $15.3 billion for the Department of  Energy's nuclear weapons security programs, including Weapons  Activities, Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation, and Naval Reactors, a  $644 million increase above the fiscal year 2018 enacted level and $222  million above the President's budget request   It aligns with the administration's Nuclear Posture Review and calls  for continuing to maintain a strong nuclear deterrent to meet the  challenges of a changing security environment, revitalizing our nuclear  complex, and supporting effective arms control and nonproliferation  efforts.   Additionally, the bill provides for funding increases across the  Department of Energy to defend against cyber attacks and within the  administration's new Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency  Response Office to strengthen energy-sector cybersecurity preparedness,  response, and recovery.   The bill includes strong funding for the Army Corps of Engineers-- $451 million more than last year and $2.5 billion more than the budget  request. This is to address our Nation's critical infrastructure needs.   Harbor maintenance activities are funded at $1.6 billion, which is  $200 million more than the fiscal year 2018 appropriation. The level  exceeds the WRDA annual target by $160 million and represents--and I am  proud of this--95 percent of the estimated revenue.   Basic science research and applied energy research and development  programs at the Department of Energy, including Nuclear Energy, Fossil  Energy, the Office of Science, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy,  and ARPA-E, are strongly supported in this bill. Taken together, these  programs advance the all-of-the-above energy strategy that will support  a strong national economy well into the future.   Finally, the bill sends a clear message that it is time to address  the long-term storage of spent nuclear fuel and finish the Yucca  Mountain license application, with $220 million going to the Department  of Energy and $47.7 million to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. We  simply cannot wait any longer to finish the license application process  and proceed to construction and operation of the permanent repository.   This is a strong bill that incorporates priorities and interests of  all Members of the House. In fact, this bill addresses, in full or in  part, 94 percent of the more than 3,000 separate requests that we  received from Members. I urge my colleagues to support this.   Before I end, I would like to say and emphasize what the chairman  said. These bills would not be possible without the strong work and the  competent  [[Page H4900]]  work of the staff of the Energy and Water Appropriations Committee,  both minority and majority, and also from our personal offices. They do  a great job trying to address the concerns of individual Members and  the requests of individual Members. We wouldn't be able to do this  without the strong work they do, and I thank them for that.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Utah (Mr.  Curtis) for the purpose of a colloquy.    Reclaiming my time, I appreciate my colleague's support  for the cleanup activities of the Department of Energy.   The bill provides $62 million for the cleanup at DOE's nondefense  small sites, $7.1 million above the budget request. Within that,  funding for the Moab uranium mill tailings site is available at $42  million. We would be pleased to work with the gentleman from Utah on  expediting cleanup of the site and appreciate his support for the  underlying legislation.    Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to the amendment,  although I am not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I understand the Great Lakes Coastal  Resiliency Study is of great importance to my colleague from New York  as well as other Members from the Great Lakes region. I would like to  note that the underlying bill includes funding and authority for new  studies, including a multipurpose study like the Great Lakes study.   I also remind my colleagues that the amendment increases the funding  level of an account. It does not direct the funding to any particular  activity. For that reason and because the amendment does not constitute  a major shift in funding between accounts, I would not oppose the  amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), if she  has any comments to make.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I want to assure my colleague that when the  Appropriations Committee develops its bills it takes into consideration  the requests and priorities of Members of the House. Funding levels in  the underlying bill reflect those requests, including those requests  from the gentleman from Louisiana.   Specifically, funding above the budget request for construction of  navigation projects totals $625 million, an increase of $176 million  above fiscal year 2018.   Additional funding for operation and maintenance of inland navigation  projects is at $50 million, an increase of $20 million above last  year's additional funding level.   While we can't specify funding for any particular project, we have  worked hard to ensure significant funding for which projects not in the  budget request can compete.   I would be happy to continue working with my colleague from Louisiana  to ensure significant funding for the critical water resources  infrastructure work of the Corps of Engineers, and I thank him for his  willingness to withdraw the amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I  am not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I can certainly understand my colleague's  interest in this issue, and I agree that there are certain  circumstances where the Corps should consider more than just commercial  tonnage using a waterway when allocating funding. In fact, a report  accompanying the bill directs the Corps to consider several criteria  other than just tonnage.   Since the amendment does not upset the balance of priorities within  the bill nor direct funds to any particular project or activity, I will  not oppose the amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman for yielding.  Yes, it is true that this was written in 1977. The law has stayed the  same since 1977. That doesn't mean that the interpretation of the law  by agencies has been the same since then, and that interpretation has  changed over time.   In recent years, the Corps and the EPA have changed the  implementation of these provisions to significantly reduce the  application of the statutory exemptions. This language in the  underlying bill is intended to get us back to the original intent of  the law. That is all it is meant to do is get back to the original  intent of the law.    If the gentleman is correct and they are interpreting the law the  same as they have for 40 years, then this wouldn't be necessary. But  the fact is that is not the case. They have been changing the way they  implement this law. This is meant to get us back to the original  intent, and, therefore, I must oppose the amendment that would strike  this language.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, although I am not opposed to it.    I understand the gentleman seeks to show support for  additional funding for projects such as the one important to his  district and his constituents.   I would note that the underlying bill includes a total of $379  million above the budget request for various types of projects that may  have public health benefits. Since the amendment before us does not  upset the balance of priorities within the bill nor direct funds to any  particular project or activity, I would not oppose the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition, although I am  not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I understand that the gentlewoman seeks to  show support for additional funding for water research and development  activities that are important to her district and to the country.   I would just like to clarify that the amendment does not direct funds  to any particular activities. For that reason and because it does not  upset the balance within the bill, I will not oppose the amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I  am not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I understand that the gentleman seeks to  show support for additional funding for fish screen projects important  to his district and his constituents. I would simply note that this  account is one where we historically have given the administration,  Republican or Democratic, great flexibility in allocating the funds. If  there is widespread interest, we should take a comprehensive look at  funding levels within the program, not just adjust funding levels in  one activity.   Since the amendment does not direct funds to a specific activity and  because it does not upset the balance of the bill, I will not oppose  the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague's passion for  research and development in the Water Power Technologies Office. He is  a strong advocate in his State for research in this important work.   Although I could not support the original amendment, I would  appreciate it if the gentleman would be willing to withdraw it and  instead work together as we move toward conference to discuss efficient  funding for the Water Power Technologies Office.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, similar to the previous amendment, I  appreciate my colleague's passion for this important research and  development and work done in the Water Power Technologies Office. They  are each strong advocates, and I recognize their leadership in their  States for this important work.   Although I could not support this amendment, I would again make the  offer that, if the gentlewoman is willing to withdraw the amendment, I  would work with her and others to make sure that we have sufficient  funding for the Water Power Technologies Office when we go to  conference.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate my colleague's advocacy for  the Advanced Manufacturing Office within the Energy Efficiency and  Renewable Energy account.   The Advanced Manufacturing Office performs research and development  to improve the productivity and energy efficiency of U.S.  manufacturing. This is important work, and I recognize my colleague's  leadership in highlighting the office.   While I could not support using the Nuclear Waste Disposal account as  an offset for the original amendment, I would appreciate my colleague's  willingness to offer to withdraw this amendment. I look forward to  working with my colleague as we move forward toward conference to  discuss sufficient funding for the Advanced Manufacturing Office.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, this bill includes $84 million for research  and development on wind energy within the EERE account. That is more  than $53 million higher than the budget request--$53 million higher  than the budget request.   Research and development in the wind office was targeted to support  our Nation's wind turbine testing infrastructure and advanced solutions  to wind energy challenges. This is a strategic focus to lay the  foundation for technological innovations that can be picked up by  industry at a later stage.   While I support research and development on wind energy and recognize  my colleague's advocacy for these activities, focusing funds on job  training grants strays too far from the bill's strategic priorities.  Therefore, I must oppose the amendment and urge my colleagues to do the  same.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Keating).    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman and  gentlewoman's passion for this.   I have to oppose the amendment at this time but look forward to  working with the gentlewoman to try to address this issue as we move  forward in the future.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to the amendment,  even though I am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chair, I thank my colleague for his amendment and  for his willingness to withdraw it and for the authorizer's strong  support for this bill.   I recognize the House-passed authorization for the versatile neutron  source is a priority of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee  and also of me.   I appreciate my colleague's highlighting these priorities, and I look  forward to working with him as we move into conference to ensure these  priorities have sufficient funding in the final legislation.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, even though I am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman of the Science Committee  for his amendment and for the authorizers' strong support for this  bill. I recognize the House-passed authorizations for DOE research,  infrastructure construction and facilities upgrades, and the low dose  radiation research are priorities of the Science Committee.   I appreciate the chairman highlighting these priorities and I look  forward to working with him as we move to conference to ensure these  projects receive sufficient funding.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  gentleman's amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.   My colleague's amendment would eliminate the Advanced Research  Project Agency--Energy, otherwise known as ARPA-E.   ARPA-E's mission is to fund projects that are not yet addressed by  the private sector but that can bring transformational shifts in  current energy technologies. From reducing the energy involved in  producing aluminum to creating new battery storage technologies, these  are projects that have impacts in almost every industry.   Since 2009, ARPA-E has provided funding for more than 660 projects.  As of this year, ARPA-E projects have produced 245 patents, formed 71  new companies, and have raised more than $2.9 billion in follow-on  funding from the private sector to bring technologies to market.   These are successes, and successes help ensure our Nation's energy  security and create a manufacturing edge in the energy sector. These  are energy technology goals all Members can support.   I would remind my friend from Arizona, our job is not to be lemmings  for the administration. It is to make our own independent judgment.   While I appreciate and look at the reason that they would like to  eliminate ARPA-E, I disagree with them. So do a majority of the Members  of Congress, as they have demonstrated in the past.   So we must exercise our independent judgment on what is best. While  we respect the administration's position, we just disagree with it.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1830     Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms.  Kaptur).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, although I am not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, since the amendment does not change funding  levels in the bill, I will not oppose the amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment. Assuring funding for the modernization of our nuclear  weapons stockpile is a critical national security priority of this  bill. The bill provides necessary funding to extend the life of our  Nation's nuclear weapons stockpile and to address the continued  deterioration of infrastructure at the NNSA sites.   The amendment targets a new proposal to modify a limited number of  W76 warheads that are currently undergoing refurbishment in order to  provide for a low-level variant of the warhead. They will either be  refurbished with a high-yield warhead or a low-yield warhead.   This modification does not provide the U.S. with any new nuclear  capabilities. The U.S. has the capability and will continue to maintain  that capability to deliver warheads at this yield  [[Page H4942]]  with the Air Force's B61 bomb and the air-launched cruise missile.   These lower level warheads are necessary to provide a credible  deterrent against the use of warheads of similar yields that exist in  large numbers by other nuclear weapons states.   Specifically, possessing a warhead at this yield shows any aggressor  that the U.S. has the capability to provide a proportional response to  the use of a nonstrategic or tactical nuclear weapon against the U.S.  or its allies. That is why the U.S. nuclear strategy under both the  Obama administration and this administration advocated maintaining and  modernizing both the B61 bomb and the nuclear-tipped cruise missile.   Given that the U.S. has possessed this same capability for many  years, I disagree with the idea that this modification will serve to  destabilize relations with other nuclear weapons states. Rather, the  intent of this warhead modification is to improve stability to  demonstrate that the U.S. has the ability to deliver this capability on  platforms that are not vulnerable to air defenses.                                time  1845    It is intended to improve the credibility of our nuclear deterrent  and show that the U.S. has the resolve to respond to nuclear threats.  Credibility is the most basic requirement for nuclear deterrence to  work.   The amendment would also reduce the size of the current W76 stockpile  because the funding supports not only the low-yield modification but  also the refurbishment work that is needed to extend the life of these  warheads.   Mr. Chairman, I support the modification. I urge all Members to vote  ``no'' on this amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Thornberry), who is the chairman of the Armed Services  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, is all the time expired on that side?    Mr. Chairman, is all of the time expired on my side from  the original 5 minutes?    Mr. Chairman, let me just say in this 30 seconds, first  of all, addressing the gentlewoman from Ohio's concern, the  administration waited until the Nuclear Posture Review was done before  they could submit their request for this funding.   The budget request had been being worked on from clear last September  before that, and they came up within days of each other, but the  administration was waiting for the NPR to be finished before they  submitted.   We might not have liked the way that turned out, but that is just the  reality. I don't think it was anybody's intent to try to misguide  Congress or anything like that, while I understand her concern.    Mr. Chairman, as the designee of the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Frelinghuysen), I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chairman, before I yield to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Lamborn), let me say the impression here is that we are  increasing the number of nuclear weapons. We are not. We are doing  refurbishment of the current weapons.   And 50 of them would not be high-level; they would be low-level, low- yield nuclear weapons. It doesn't increase the numbers.   All of this is compliant with all of our nuclear treaties--compliant  with all of our nuclear treaties.   When I first heard about this, I actually had the same concerns I am  hearing from the other side of the aisle: How does this increase our  safety? Doesn't it make it more likely it would be used if it was a  low-yield rather than high-yield?   Then I went to some briefings and talked to some people, people who  wrote the NPR and a few things like that, and what I found out was that  Russia already has hundreds and hundreds--as the chairman of the  committee said, has hundreds and hundreds of low-yield nuclear  warheads.   Why are they doing that? Would why they possibly do that? Because  they think it will give them a strategic advantage in a traditional  war.   If our only response to their use of a low-yield nuclear weapon is  Armageddon, then their bet is that we are not going to go to that  level. For deterrence to work, it has to be credible. They have to  understand that if they even use a low-yield nuclear weapon we will  respond and that we have the capability to do it in proportion without  destroying the world.   But you also have to understand we are not talking about first use by  us. This is meant to decrease the likelihood of a nuclear exchange.                                time  1900    I have come to the conclusion that if we don't do this, we are going  to increase the likelihood of a nuclear exchange. Otherwise, why are  they creating hundreds and hundreds--and China and North Korea are  looking at it also--why are they creating nuclear low-yield weapons?  Why is that in their interest?   Stop and think about it a minute.   Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  gentleman's amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to my friend from  Virginia's amendment. This bill shows strong support for the  nonproliferation programs of the National Nuclear Security  Administration, something that I support.   Funding for Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation is $1.9 billion, it is  $39 million above the budget request. That includes increases above the  request for research and development activities for which we received  Member requests.   I have also supported increases in the past for these activities. The  $2 billion amount that this amendment seeks to achieve is the result of  an increase of $206 million above the fiscal year 2018 request.   The NNSA's nonproliferation account has significant unexpended  balances that are the result of slow progress on international  nonproliferation agreements and the infusion of additional funding  added by Congress in prior years.   It is not enough to just say we support nonproliferation and we  support it by increasing the budget. That is how much we support it. It  has to go towards something. You have to have agreements with  international partners for nonproliferation activities.   In May, the NNSA reported that it had $2.6 billion in available funds  to carry out its nonproliferation mission, of which more than $733  million is left over from prior years. You have $733 million left over  from prior years, and you want to add to that.   Given the increasing amounts of unused balances, it is not clear that  the NNSA will be able to expend additional funding in a timely manner.   Not only would the amendment continue to add to programs beyond which  the agency has said it can accomplish, it would do so at the expense of  funding necessary to sustain our nuclear weapons stockpile, refurbish  aging infrastructure, secure facilities where U.S. nuclear weapons are  stored, and support a science-based stockpile certification strategy  without nuclear testing. That is why I oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, the only thing I would ask the gentlewoman  from Ohio and the gentleman from Virginia is: What are they going to do  with the additional $97 million? What are you going to do with it?   You have got $733 million sitting there right now that they can't  spend. We have to have agreements with foreign countries to do  nonproliferation work. Where are they going to spend it?   I have been complaining--not complaining, but arguing, I guess--with  Members for the last several years that want to put money in to show  their support for nonproliferation: Why don't you just put more money  into it? I ask them: What do you want to do with it? They can't tell  you.   By saying we increase the nonproliferation account, it shows we  support nonproliferation. But you have got to have something you are  going to do with it.    I yield to the gentleman from Virginia.    Reclaiming my time, I guess you have got an agreement  there with Iran to do nonproliferation work?   The reason we have some excess money is because the agreements with  Russia, when things got a little cold between our two countries, some  of those agreements kind of went by the wayside.   I would like to know what the projects are. If there is something  that somebody has come up with, if there are agreements to do those  types of things. You can't say: I want to spend another $97 million on  top of the $733 million.   If that is accurate at $190 million, we've got $733 million to do it  right now. So why throw another $97 million on top of it? It just  doesn't make sense to me.   Mr. Chairman, I urge opposition to the amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.   I recognize my colleague's concerns about certain actions and  practices of the Western Area Power Administration. I applaud his  dedication to improving the functionality of the agency for the benefit  of his constituents. In fact, he has worked with this committee to make  improvements related to appropriations, and I would encourage him to  continue to engage with us on appropriate oversight measures.   This amendment, though, will not improve the effectiveness and  transparency of this agency. Rather, it is simply a punitive one toward  one individual, and I cannot support such an effort. That is why I  opposed the Holman rule that was adopted by the rules package, I  guess--what?--last year or something like that, the year before last.   The problem is you have got an individual here, and there have been  claims about his behavior or his inability to do his job, and we are  going to debate whether he is going to have a salary or not or whether  you are going to essentially fire him, reduce his salary to $1, in a  10-minute debate on the floor.   Is that really fair? Is that right? I don't think you should do that.   If the activities that have been suggested by the gentleman from  Arizona have occurred, why isn't the Government Oversight Committee  looking at this? Why aren't they calling him in, having a hearing on  it? Why isn't the Energy and Commerce Committee doing the same?   That is the appropriate way to do that when you have got someone who  has misbehaved as an Administrator, not to come on the floor with a 10- minute debate, make charges which may or may not be true--I just don't  know--but then ask us to essentially fire somebody. I just don't think  that is right.   For these reasons, I must urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.     Mr. Chair, nobody is defending this individual. What he  has presented is 20 accusations. I think he ought to be able to have  his day in a proper hearing before the proper committee to decide  whether it is the right  [[Page H4947]]  thing to do, not sit here and say, ``I agree with these accusations.''  I don't know if they are true or not. Nobody on this floor knows  whether they are true or not.   Mr. Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).    Mr. Chair, has my time expired?    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Let me first state that Idaho is not next to an ocean, although we do  have the furthest inland port of any State in the country.   The point of this is that you all make great arguments--arguments  that ought to be held and debated in the authorizing committee.   The point is that the ocean policy here was put in effect without  ever going through Congress. It has never been authorized. It is not  that it has been authorized and the expiration dates just expired, like  many programs, far too many programs. This has never been authorized by  Congress.   I might agree with you in the end, but it ought to go through the  proper process instead of just doing an executive order.    Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this would not be an appropriation bill if  we didn't have this amendment before us. Every year, this amendment has  been offered, and the gentlewoman from Tennessee and I have debated  this many times in the past.   While I commend my colleague for her consistent work to protect the  taxpayers' dollars, this is not the approach that I would endorse nor  can I support.   The bill in its current form balances many of the needs. The bill  prioritizes funding for national security and critical infrastructure,  yet the gentlewoman's amendment proposes an across-the-board cut on  every one of these programs, including increases in funding that are  sorely needed to modernize our nuclear weapons stockpile and to protect  our Nation's electrical grid from emerging cyber threats.   Across-the-board cuts make no distinction between where we need to be  spending or investing in our infrastructure, promoting jobs, and  meeting our national security needs and where we need to limit spending  to meet our deficit reduction goals. That is what we actually do when  we write a bill in the Appropriations Committee and have the hearings  and so forth.   The main reason this bill is $1.5 billion above last year and the  reason that the chairman gave this allocation to the Energy and Water  Subcommittee is because there was a need in rebuilding our nuclear  security infrastructure. That is where the majority of that money went.   The next major portion of it went to the Army Corps of Engineers to  build the waterways and infrastructure that need to be replaced. There  is something like a trillion dollars--I know it is not the exact  number, and I don't know if that is the correct number, but it is  pretty close--of backlog, of needs within the Army Corps of Engineers,  with an aging infrastructure: locks and dams, harbors that need to be  maintained for our economy, that need to be dredged. That is where the  majority of that money went. That is why the Appropriations Committee  put the additional $1.5 billion into this.   Yes, reducing the deficit and addressing our debt are critical things  that need to get done, too, but everyone here, including the  gentlewoman from Tennessee, who is my good friend, knows that it is not  the discretionary spending that is driving this debt and deficit each  year; it is the huge increases in mandatory spending. Those are  primarily Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, interest on the  debt. That is what is driving the debt.   If you look back 40 or 50 years ago, out of the entire Federal  budget, 70 percent of it was discretionary spending. That is what we  spend money on that everybody thinks as government when they think of  government. About 30 percent of it was the mandatory programs.   It has reversed. Now a little over 70 percent of the Federal  Government is mandatory. It is on autopilot. Unless we change the law  underneath it and have the courage to do that, it continues to grow.   If you look at our budget today on the discretionary side, we spend  less today than we did in 2010. That is 8 years later. We spend less  today on discretionary spending than we did in 2010. That is the  reality.   So while I appreciate the effort to address the debt and the deficit,  this is not the way to do it. It is not addressing the main problem  that is driving our debt.   Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).     I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, though I  am not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   First, let me assure my colleague that I understand her interest in  addressing flood risks in her district. In fact, the Appropriations  Committee has worked very hard to prioritize these activities,  including significant funding in the supplemental bill earlier this  year, in the fiscal year 2018 appropriations act, and this fiscal year  2019 bill before us today.   Since the amendment does not change funding levels within the bill, I  will not oppose the amendment, and I encourage my colleagues to support  it.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim time in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.  While I agree with my colleague that we need to be finding savings  where possible, this amendment is not the approach that I can support.   The bill in its current form takes a balanced approach to meet a  number of needs, not just wants or wishes or anything else, but actual  needs. The bill prioritizes funding for national security and critical  infrastructure and reduces funding for certain activities that did not  need sustained funding at prior year levels to accomplish their mission  in fiscal year 2019.   These tradeoffs were carefully weighed for their respective impacts,  and the increases proposed are responsible and, in some cases, are  absolutely essential.   Approximately half of the funding in this bill is for national  defense activities. This bill includes $15.3 billion for the Department  of Energy's nuclear weapons security program which provides funding to  maintain our Nation's nuclear weapons stockpile and for the Navy's  nuclear propulsion programs that supports our Navy's fleet of  submarines and aircraft carriers and for nonproliferation activities  that are reducing global nuclear threats.   In February, the administration released a Nuclear Posture Review  that described a sobering view of the current global nuclear threat  situation.   Russia is modernizing its full range of nuclear systems.   China is modernizing and expanding its already considerable nuclear  forces, pursuing entirely new capabilities.   North Korea's nuclear provocations threaten regional and global  peace.   Iran's nuclear ambitions remain an unresolved concern.   Global nuclear terrorism remains a tangible threat. This amendment  would slash funding for the activities in this bill that are an  integral part of the United States' national security strategy to  address these nuclear threats.   For that and many other reasons, I would oppose the gentleman's  amendment and suggest that maybe we ought to look at what is causing  the debt to go up, and that is the mandatory spending and not the  discretionary spending that we have. I would urge my colleagues to vote  against the amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Weber of Texas) having assumed the chair, Ms. Tenney, Acting Chair of  the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported  that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R.  5895) making appropriations for energy and water development and  related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, and for  other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material in the consideration of H.R. 5895, and that I may  include tabular material on the same.    Madam Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Weber of Texas) having assumed the chair, Ms. Tenney, Acting Chair of  the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported  that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R.  5895) making appropriations for energy and water development and  related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, and for  other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The bill provides $92 million for the facilities and infrastructure  program within the EERE account. That level fully funds operation and  maintenance activities at NREL and is the same amount as was  appropriated last year.   In light of EERE being reduced by $243 million compared to last  year's level, I would say that the bill contains very strong support  for NREL's operations and maintenance activities.   This amendment goes too far in increasing an account that already has  strong support.   Additionally, I am concerned that the amendment would have unintended  consequences in taking away strategic funding from the departmental  administration account.   Mr. Chair, for these reasons, I must oppose the amendment and urge my  colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I agree with everything the gentleman just  said, but I disagree with the amendment. Everything he said is  absolutely accurate.   My colleague's amendment would increase funding for the  Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response, or CESER,  account, by using the Fossil Energy account as an offset.   I share my colleague's support for the important work funded by the  CESER account, and the underlying bill reflects that support. In fact,  the CESER account was provided an increase of $50 million over last  year's level. That is a 52 percent increase in this bill. Put another  way, that is the single largest percentage increase in any account in  this bill.   I support the CESER account and efforts to enhance the cybersecurity  and resilience of our electrical grid. That is why the bill provides  the highest level of funding these research and development activities  have ever had.   However, my colleague's amendment would take away funds from other  important research and development activities.   The Fossil Energy account focuses on research and development  activities that ensure the Nation is using its abundant natural  resources as safely, cleanly, and efficiently as possible.  [[Page H4966]]    Targeted increases to the Fossil Energy account support technological  advances in carbon capture, carbon storage, and advanced energy  generation technologies.   Cuts to the Fossil Energy account threaten these innovations.   In light of the robust support for the CESER account in the  underlying bill and the unintended consequences this amendment may have  on the Fossil Energy account, I must oppose the amendment, but I will  tell my colleague that I look forward to working with him to address  this concern that ought to concern all of us.   Cybersecurity is a huge issue, and I think it is going to be one of  the biggest things we face in the coming years.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, even though I am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chair, I want to thank the gentleman for his support  for and active lobbying for the weapons activities that are so vital to  our country. He makes sure that we do our job here.   Mr. Chair, I have no problem with the amendment, and hope it will  pass.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
