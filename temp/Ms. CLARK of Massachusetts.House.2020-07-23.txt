 Madam Speaker, as we all know, sexism  isn't new to Congress, and it is not new to America. It happens in  homes, in schools, and in all places of work.   The behavior, the language, and the assault wielded against my  colleague was disgusting, inappropriate, and endemic of the toxic  masculinity that permeates our culture and our country.   Slurs like the one used by Representative Yoho are meant to degrade,  objectify, and belittle women. It was an attempt to dismiss her, her  role in this body, and her position altogether.   All women have experienced this to some degree, but so often, it is  women of color who are singled out. When we hear comments like this,  men and boys think it is appropriate. Women and girls expect it.   Today, we stand with our colleague. We will not accept this behavior  anymore. We will not be made to feel less than. This is our House, and  we are claiming our space.
