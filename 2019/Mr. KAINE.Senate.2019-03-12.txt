 Mr. President. As career opportunities and the requisite  skills for success adapt to the demands of the 21st century, so too  must the instruction and preparation students receive. Educators are  tasked with designing educational experiences that rise to the rigorous  State academic standards and reflect the needs and interests of our  Nation's diverse student population. We have become accustomed to  welcoming the start of the school year with news headlines describing  overfilled classrooms and districts struggling to fill teacher  vacancies. Though the challenge of teacher and principal shortages is  felt broadly across the country, with a particularly acute impact on  our rural communities, it is an issue we can remedy.   The reauthorization of the Higher Education Act is an opportunity to  strengthen the preparation and leaders and to further support State  efforts to successfully implement the Every Student Succeeds Act. It is  also an opportunity to address the fact that schools in high-need  communities are often staffed by a revolving door of underprepared and  inexperienced teachers who are unable to meet students' needs. This in  part due to State teacher shortages.   This is why I am pleased to introduce today with my colleague Senator  Collins, the Preparing and Retaining Education Professionals Act, or  PREP Act. As schools across our Nation continue to face growing class  sizes, many are struggling with a shortage of qualified teachers. Rural  communities in particular are experiencing a dearth of teachers  equipped to meet their growing needs. The PREP Act aims to create high- quality teacher residency programs to develop a diverse workforce that  is well-prepared to provide the educational opportunities students need  to be successful in the 21st century.   More specifically, this legislation would expand the definition of  ``high need'' districts under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) to  include those experiencing teacher shortages in rural communities and  in areas such as special education, English language, science,  technology, engineering, math, and CTE, to allow for access to  additional support and improvement. It would also encourage school  districts to establish partnerships with local community colleges and  universities to ensure their education programs are developing future  teachers in content areas where there is currently a shortage of  educators. It would increase access to teacher and school leader  residency programs and preparation training while requiring States to  identify areas of teacher or leader shortages by subject across public  schools and use that data to target their efforts. Additionally, the  PREP Act bolsters support for teacher preparation programs at Minority  Serving Institutions (MSIs) or Historically Black Colleges and  Universities (HBCUs) to invest in a diverse and well-prepared educator  workforce.   Improving our Nation's educational system is contingent on our  ability to prepare, support, and retain quality educators. Research  shows that better prepared teachers stay longer in the profession and  are more likely to remain in their roles and positively impact young  people and their communities. As we look to reauthorize the Higher  Education Act, I hope that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle see  the PREP Act as a commonsense opportunity to help ensure that students  in every zip code across the country have the well-prepared teachers  and school leaders they deserve.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN:   S. 763. A bill to establish the Climate Change Advisory Commission to  develop recommendations, frameworks, and guidelines for projects to  respond to the impacts of climate change, to issue Federal obligations,  the proceeds of which shall be used to fund projects that aid in  adaptation to climate change, and for other purposes; to the Committee  on Finance.
