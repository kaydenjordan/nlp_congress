 Madam Chair, I am proud to join my colleagues in  leading this commonsense effort to help our country's veterans access  medical treatment.   Research has shown that medical cannabis can be a safe and effective  treatment in targeted pain management for PTSD which, unfortunately,  impacts many of our veterans. Despite their efficiency, bureaucratic  red tape continues to deny veterans these life-altering treatments. In  States like Ohio and 37 others where it is legal, the Federal  Government should not prevent a VA doctor from recommending medical  cannabis as a viable treatment option if they believe it will help  their patient.   As the son of a WWII veteran who was wounded and left for dead on the  battlefield, I have seen firsthand the many challenges our Nation's  heroes face when they return home. We should all resolve to help expand  access to treatments for the medical challenges, both mental and  physical, our veterans experience.   That is why I ask my colleagues to support this amendment to help  eliminate barriers for alternative treatments and provide our veterans  with the care they need to overcome the wounds of war.
