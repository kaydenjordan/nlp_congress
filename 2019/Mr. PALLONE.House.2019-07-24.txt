SEC. 15. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 3375.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3375, the Stopping  Bad Robocalls Act, it is bipartisan legislation that I introduced with  Ranking Member Walden, Communications and Technology Subcommittee  Chairman Doyle, and Subcommittee Ranking Member Latta. This legislation  advanced out of our Energy and Commerce Committee last week by a  unanimous vote of 48-0.  [[Page H7297]]    The rising tide of unlawful, unwanted robocalls started as a  nuisance, but now threatens the way consumers view and use their  telephones. These calls are undermining our entire phone system, and  that is something we all need to take very, very seriously.   Last year, there were an estimated 47 billion robocalls made to  Americans. It is no wonder that the American people have lost  confidence in answering their phones. The Stopping Bad Robocalls Act  will help restore that confidence, and that is very important, in my  opinion.   Madam Speaker, Americans use their phones at some of the most  important times of their lives. They use their phones to get help from  first responders by calling 911; to hear important medical test results  from their doctor; to connect with or reassure a family member or  friend; to learn that school is closed tomorrow; or just to conduct  daily business.   Illegal, unwanted robocalls threaten the foundational ways that we  communicate with one another and, that, in my opinion is dangerous.   Each time the consumer chooses not to pick up the phone out of fear  that a scam robocall is on the other end of the line, it chips away at  our community and public safety. Too frequently, consumers feel their  best option is to not answer their ringing phone, which may lead them  to miss an important call.   It is truly unfortunate that consumers feel they must take that risk  in order to proactively defend themselves against a scam call. Some  studies estimate that nearly half of all calls this year will be scam  calls; and these calls are not only harmful to the American people, but  they are also harmful to business.   The Chief Information Security Officer of the Moffitt Cancer Center  recently testified before our committee that scammers were calling his  hospital, disguised as Department of Justice officials, demanding to  speak with a physician about his medical license. Robocalls are  dangerous to public health and to people's privacy, using this as an  example.   We have heard similar stories of scammers disguised as the IRS  looking to collect a debt; scammers disguised as local governments or  police departments; and scammers disguised as loved ones in trouble  looking for help. We are even seeing new scams, such as the one-ring- scam, where fraudsters try to trick consumers into calling back  international numbers in the hopes that the consumer will rack up large  charges.   All of these scams are different, and there is no silver bullet to  fix them all. For that reason, this legislation takes the comprehensive  approach to cut off robocalls at many different points.   For example, the bill would implement a nationwide caller  authentication system, free for consumers, so they can again trust that  the number they see on their caller ID is actually the person calling  them.   In that same vein, consumers need more help controlling the calls  they have asked not to receive. Consumers need to be in charge of their  own phone numbers, and scammers or telemarketers must have a consumer's  consent before making calls.   Consumers should be able to block illegal and unwanted calls. But  with blocking, there needs to be transparency and effective redress so  that we ensure the calls people want are actually getting through.   Madam Speaker, we need to ensure that law enforcement and the Federal  Communications Commission have the tools, information, and incentives  to go after robocallers that break the law.   This bill takes all these steps and more. It also includes the text  of many important proposals that would help address the onslaught of  robocalls that consumers face.   And I just want to mention some of the other bills that were  introduced that we have tried to incorporate in this bill. One is the  Ending One-Ring Scams Act; the Tracing Back and Catching Unlawful  Robocallers Act; the Locking Up Robocallers Act, the Spam Calls Task  Force Act; and the Protecting Patients and Doctors from Unlawful  Robocalls Act. I will thank the sponsors of those more specifically  later during this debate.   But ours is a strong and comprehensive bill that puts consumers  first. I want to thank all of my colleagues that have shaped this bill  with me, specifically, Mr. Walden, Mr. Doyle, Mr. Latta, of course. But  I also want to thank all the consumer advocacy organizations and the  carriers that worked hard to reach a consensus piece of legislation  that will take tough and meaningful steps to protect consumers from  these annoying and illegal robocalls.   Madam Speaker, the legislation now has 237 sponsors, and I am hopeful  that it will garner strong bipartisan support today when we vote.   I urge all of my colleagues to put consumers first and join us in  passing the Stopping Bad Robocalls Act.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Eshoo), who chairs our Health Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Michael F. Doyle) who chairs our Communications and  Technology Subcommittee.     Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McNerney).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New York (Ms. Clarke), vice chair of our committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Crist).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Mrs. Murphy).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).    Madam Speaker, can I inquire as to the amount of time on  each side?    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Underwood).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I thank all of the members who were able to work  together to produce this great legislation, and there are a lot.   I thank Mr. McEachin, Mr. Olson, Mr. Kim, Mrs. Brooks, Mr. Brindisi,  and Mr. Kustoff for introducing the Locking Up Robocalls Act, which was  added to this legislation in section 9.   I thank Ms. Clarke, Mr. Bilirakis, Mr. Van Drew, Mr. Rouda, Ms. Foxx,  and Mr. Walberg for introducing the Ending One-Ring Scams Act, which  was added to this legislation in section 10.   I thank Mr. Crist for introducing his Spam Calls Task Force Act,  which was added to this legislation in section 11.   I thank Mr. Butterfield, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Soto, and Mr. Gianforte for  introducing the Tracing Back and Catching Unlawful Robocalls Act, which  was added in section 13.   I thank Mrs. Dingell and Dr. Burgess for introducing their Protecting  Patients and Doctors from Unlawful Robocalls Act, which was added to  the bill in section 14.   And I thank Mr. Flores and Mr. McNerney for offering their amendment  to increase the financial penalties for illegal robocallers.   Mr. Speaker, I also thank my partners--Mr. Walden, Mr. Doyle, and Mr.  Latta--for working with me to introduce the bill, which included at  introduction Mr. Latta's and Mr. Doyle's STOP Robocalls Act in section  8.   I also would like to quickly thank the staff--Alex Hoehn-Saric, AJ  Brown, Jennifer Epperson, Dan Miller, Robin Colwell, Tim Kurth--for all  their hard work, and, in particular, Gerry Leverich, who is here, for  all his time and energy to get this bill to the floor today. I am very  proud for all our members and staff for this important bill.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a few letters and statements for  the Record: a letter from AARP on behalf of its nearly 38 million  members urging a vote in favor of the bill; a letter from more than 80  organizations representing consumers throughout the U.S., including  Consumer Reports and the National Consumer Law Center, among others,  urging strong support by members of the bill; and a list of supportive  statements from carriers and relevant associations, including  USTelecom, The Broadband Association; CTIA, The Wireless Association;  NCTA, The Internet & Television Association; Charter Communications,  and Verizon.                                                            AARP,                                      Washington, DC, July 23, 2019.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Republican Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Leader McCarthy: On behalf of our       nearly 38 million members and all older Americans nationwide,       AARP is writing to urge a vote in favor of H.R. 3375, the       Stopping Bad Robocalls Act, bipartisan legislation that will       help fight back against illegal robocalls.        AARP has a long history of fighting for consumer       protections for older Americans. Unwanted robocalls are a       rich playground for scammers to deceive victims into paying       money under false pretenses. Through our nationwide Fraud       Watch Network initiative, we work to empower consumers to       spot and avoid scams, and we provide support and guidance to       victims and their families when fraud happens.        AARP is pleased that H.R. 3375 appropriately emphasizes       consumer consent regarding the receipt of automatically       dialed calls and expands the enforcement provisions of the       Communications Act by extending the statute of limitations.       The bill specifies that consumers should not face additional       charges for having robocalls blocked through authentication       technology and sets reasonable deadlines for the Federal       Communications Commission (FCC) to prescribe regulations in       the ongoing WC Docket No. 17-97.        AARP also supports the provisions of the bill that require       the FCC to report on the implementation of the reassigned       number database, which will reduce the incidence of repeated       calls to innocent customers based  [[Page H7302]]       on the telephone number's previous owner. Likewise, we       support the requirement of an annual report to Congress on       the FCC's enforcement actions.        All Americans will benefit from the provisions of H.R. 3375       that promote an accurate call authentication framework and       prevent consumers from being charged for blocking technology.       We again urge you to enact H.R. 3375, and we look forward to       working with you on a bipartisan basis to combat unwanted and       abusive robocalls against older Americans. If you have any       questions, please feel free to contact me, or have your staff       contact our Government Affairs staff.            Sincerely,                                               Nancy A. LeaMond,                                        Executive Vice President and      Chief Advocacy & Engagement Officer.                                   ____             Support Strong Legislation to Stop Abusive Robocalls                              (July 23, 2019)         Dear Representative: The undersigned organizations       representing consumers throughout the United States strongly       urge your support for H.R. 3375, the Stopping Bad Robocalls       Act. This bipartisan legislation, which the Committee on       Energy and Commerce approved by a unanimous vote of 48-0,       will help secure important protections against abusive       robocalling.        Robocalls are an ever-increasing plague. Last year,       Americans received an estimated 47.8 billion robocalls. They       harass us, disrupt our peace of mind, interrupt important       time with family, and interfere with important       communications. Many of these annoying automated calls are to       sell products or to collect debts. They also enable scams to       enter our homes. Truecaller found that consumers had lost an       estimated $10.5 billion to phone scams in a single 12-month       period. And spoofing, in which a caller sends a false number       in the caller ID, compounds the problem, impeding call-      blocking services and tricking consumers into picking up the       phone.        A Consumer Reports national survey released earlier this       year found that 70 percent of consumers don't even answer the       phone anymore if they don't recognize the number, because       their phones are so overrun with unwanted robocalls.        H.R. 3375 would strengthen our laws to curb this abusive       robocalling.        It would direct the FCC to issue clear regulations to       better ensure that automated calls and texts cannot be made       without the consumer's prior consent, by requiring that the       technologies that enable unwanted calls are properly defined       and consumers can stop unwanted calls by withdrawing consent,       and closing off avenues for callers to seek loopholes.        It would direct the FCC to require phone companies to       provide effective call authentication capability, at no       charge to consumers, to better identify and stop robocalling       and texting that uses deceptively ``spoofed'' phone numbers.        It would strengthen FCC powers to impose forfeiture       penalties for intentional violations.        It would direct the FCC to oversee creation of a database       that callers can check in order to avoid making robocalls and       texts to a telephone number that has been reassigned to a       different consumer who has not given consent, and would       clarify that the caller must have consent from the person       actually being called.        Consumers are calling on Congress to enact these reforms       now.        We strongly urge your support for H.R. 3375.

Statements of support         Maureen Mahoney, policy analyst for Consumer Reports:       ``Robocalls are a pervasive, persistent problem, and       consumers are desperate for relief from these unsolicited       messages. These calls don't just irritate consumers--they       interfere with the phone service for which we pay dearly, and       they subject people to scams. By one estimate, consumers lost       $10.5 billion to phone scams in one single year. We commend       Chairman Pallone and Ranking Member Walden for introducing       the Stopping Bad Robocalls Act, which will help ensure that       all consumers have effective protections from deceptively       spoofed calls, including calls from scammers. The bill will       also help get rid of loopholes in order to stop robocallers       from skirting the law. We look forward to working with       legislators to ensure that consumers get the protections they       deserve.''        Margot Saunders, Senior Counsel for National Consumer Law       Center: ``This bipartisan bill is an important step forward       in the fight to stop unwanted and illegal robocalls. There's       still more to be done and there is a lot of responsibility       placed on the FCC to protect consumers. Robocalls plague       voters of all political stripes so we are especially pleased       to see a bipartisan effort on this bill. We hope this is the       first of several positive steps that Congress will take.''        AARP: ``AARP commends Chairman Pallone, Ranking Member       Walden, Chairman Doyle, and Ranking Member Latta for their       bipartisan commitment to address the serious problem of       illegal and unwanted robocalls. AARP shares your belief that       illegal robocalls continue to place all Americans at risk of       scams and fraud. New AARP Fraud Watch Network research shows       that consumers are more likely to answer a call if it is       coming from a familiar area code or telephone exchange, which       is precisely what scammers are exploiting. Older Americans       are particularly vulnerable to phone scam victimization,       which can wipe out their life savings. AARP looks forward to       working with you and Congress on a bipartisan basis to combat       unwanted and abusive robocalls.''        Jonathan Spalter, President and CEO of USTelecom:       ``Chairman Pallone, Ranking Member Walden and the bipartisan       members of the House Energy & Commerce Committee delivered a       loud and clear message to illegal robocallers today:       `enough.' These legislative proposals add to the growing       momentum and broad partnership among lawmakers, regulators,       industry and innovators of all stripes who are closely       collaborating to end the illegal robocall plague scamming and       spoofing consumers.''        Kelly Cole, Senior Vice President of Government Affairs for       CTIA: ``We commend Chairman Pallone, Ranking Member Walden,       Chairman Doyle and Ranking Member Latta for their Stopping       Bad Robocalls Act. The wireless industry is committed to       combating illegal robocalls and protecting consumers, and we       thank Committee Leadership for tackling this important issue.       We look forward to working on getting robocall legislation       enacted.''        Robert Fisher, Senior Vice President of Federal Legislative       Affairs for Verizon: ``We applaud Chairman Pallone, Ranking       Member Walden, and the rest of the House Energy and Commerce       committee co-sponsors of this bill for their continued       efforts to protect consumers from disruptive and harassing       robocalls. Enough is enough--it's time for Americans to hang       up on abusive robocallers once and for all. Verizon has       already begun  [[Page H7303]]       deploying the STIR-SHAKEN call authentication protocol for IP       Voice services, and we welcome the continued momentum toward       a bipartisan, comprehensive solution that empowers service       providers, law enforcement, and most of all consumers. We       commend this legislation and look forward to working with       Congress to make abusive robocalls history.''        Charter Communications: ``Charter wants to see an end to       robocalls and we commend Chairman Pallone and Ranking Member       Walden for introducing legislation that will help do just       that. This bipartisan bill is an important step in curbing       unwanted and illegal calls. As we work to implement the call       authentication protocol SHAKEN/STIR by the end of the year in       addition to our currently offered call blocking, screening,       and identification features like the Nomorobo app, we will       continue to work with Congress to hopefully stop these       disruptive calls once and for all.''        NCTA--The Internet & Television Association: ``Robocalls       have become a scourge on our daily lives causing many       Americans to simply stop answering their phones. This is why       we welcome the bipartisan leadership of Chairman Pallone and       Ranking Member Walden to introduce the Stopping Bad Robocalls       Act. This legislation along with efforts by the FCC to combat       robocalls are critical to protecting consumers from this       nuisance.''     Mr. Speaker, again, this is a bipartisan effort and a  bicameral effort. We are not doing messaging here, Mr. Speaker. This is  a bill that will become law, and the President will sign it once we get  it passed in the Senate and we have a final bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1058) to reauthorize certain provisions of the Public Health  Service Act relating to autism, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1058         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 1058.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise in support of H.R. 1058, the Autism  CARES Act, which will continue critical research, surveillance,  education, early detection, and intervention programs for people living  with autism spectrum disorder, also known as ASD, and their families.   The number of children diagnosed with ASD has risen dramatically over  recent years. While 1 in every 150 children was diagnosed with ASD in  1992, that number grew to 1 in every 59 children born in 2006.   While some of this increase may be attributed to an overall higher  number of people with ASD, a significant portion is likely due to  increased efforts to diagnose people to get them the treatment they  need. As efforts to identify individuals with autism have improved, so  has the ability to intervene and treat them. Early intervention for  children with ASD is associated with a positive outcome on  developmental concerns.   It is important that we continue to improve outcomes for children and  all individuals with ASD, and that is what we are doing with this  reauthorization of the Autism CARES program today. This bill would  reauthorize funding for programs at the National Institutes of Health,  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Health Resources and  Services Administration through 2024. The bill also expands efforts to  conduct  [[Page H7305]]  research and intervene with better treatment options for all  individuals with ASD across their lifespan, regardless of age.  Additionally, the bill aims to reduce disparities among individuals  from diverse racial, ethnic, geographic, or linguistic backgrounds, and  directs additional care to rural and underserved areas.   Mr. Speaker, I am confident that this legislation will improve health  outcomes and quality of life for millions of Americans living with ASD,  as well as their families. For that reason, I urge all of my colleagues  to join me in supporting the bill today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Michael F. Doyle), the Democratic sponsor of the  bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Eshoo), chairwoman of our Health Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I don't think I can stress enough how important this  legislation is. I do want to thank my colleague from New Jersey, the  chief sponsor, and also our Democratic sponsor, Mr. Doyle, for pushing  very hard to make sure that this bill went through regular order in a  timely fashion. I agree with Dr. Burgess that, hopefully, this is  something the Senate will take up and will get to the President  quickly.   Mr. Speaker, I ask support by all of our colleagues for the bill, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2035) to amend title XXIX of the Public Health Service Act  to reauthorize the program under such title relating to lifespan  respite care, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2035         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Lifespan Respite Care       Reauthorization Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. REAUTHORIZATION OF LIFESPAN RESPITE CARE PROGRAM.         (a) Data Collection and Reporting.--Section 2904 of the       Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 290ii-3) is amended to       read as follows:       ``SEC. 2904. DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING.         ``Each eligible State agency awarded a grant or cooperative       agreement under section 2902 shall collect, maintain, and       report such data and records at such times, in such form, and       in such manner as the Secretary may require to enable the       Secretary--        ``(1) to monitor State administration of programs and       activities funded pursuant to such grant or cooperative       agreement; and        ``(2) to evaluate, and to compare effectiveness on a State-      by-State basis, of programs and activities funded pursuant to       section 2902.''.        (b) Funding.--Section 2905 of the Public Health Service Act       (42 U.S.C. 300ii-4) is amended by striking paragraphs (1)       through (5) and inserting the following:        ``(1) $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2020;        ``(2) $30,000,000 for fiscal year 2021;        ``(3) $40,000,000 for fiscal year 2022;        ``(4) $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2023; and        ``(5) $60,000,000 for fiscal year 2024.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 2035.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2035, the Lifespan Respite  Care Reauthorization Act of 2019 sponsored by my colleague from Rhode  Island, Congressman Langevin. I am proud to support this program  because it provides much-needed respite services and educational  resources to family caregivers of children and adults of all ages with  special needs.  [[Page H7309]]    Caring for a loved one can be incredibly rewarding but also demanding  work. Surveys have shown respite is among the most frequently requested  services by family caregivers. However, only a small percentage of  caregivers can afford respite care. By reauthorizing and growing this  program, we can expand access to these services across the country.   States who receive grants under the Lifespan Respite Care program  have the flexibility to support family caregivers in a variety of ways.  For example, some States use funds for consumer-directed vouchers or  for the training of volunteer and paid respite providers.   My home State of New Jersey received a grant in 2011 and today still  offers robust scheduled and emergency respite services to family  caregivers. Without this program many families cannot afford these  services.   In addition to helping relieve the emotional and financial stresses  associated with caregiving, respite care can also save families and the  healthcare system money. Research has shown that supporting caregivers  with respite services reduces the odds of hospitalization and nursing  home entry.   We know that more than 43 million adults are family caregivers of an  adult or child with a disability or chronic condition, and the  estimated economic value of family caregiving is approximately $470  billion annually. As our population ages, the need for long-term  services and supports delivered in the home will continue to increase  and, as a result, so will the burden on family caregivers.   The Lifespan Respite Care program is the only Federal program that  supports respite services for all ages and conditions, so I am glad  that we are renewing our commitment to the program today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the passage of H.R. 2035, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin), who is the sponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Rhode Island an  additional 1 minute.  [[Page H7310]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time and  just urge support for this legislation. Again, this is bipartisan, and  I thank everyone who worked on it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, might I inquire as to how much time is  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 776) to amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize  the Emergency Medical Services for Children program.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 776         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Emergency Medical Services       for Children Program Reauthorization Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. REAUTHORIZATION OF THE EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES FOR                     CHILDREN PROGRAM.         Section 1910(d) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C.       300w-9(d)) is amended--        (1) by striking ``2014, and'' and inserting ``2014,''; and        (2) by inserting before the period the following: ``, and       $22,334,000 for each of fiscal years 2020 through 2024''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 776.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, for 35 years, the Emergency Medical Services for  Children, or EMSC, program has been the only Federal grant program  specifically focused on addressing the needs of children in emergency  medical systems.   If ever a parent or caregiver is required to call 911 to get  emergency care for a child, they should know that the child will  receive the medical care that they need.   The EMSC program helps provide this peace of mind by enhancing care  for all children, no matter where they live, travel, or go to school.   The EMSC program invests in research, care delivery enhancements,  data monitoring, innovation in both prehospital EMS settings as well as  hospital emergency departments.   The program has led to real results and better care for children. For  example, research funded by EMSC has led to a new pediatric head injury  algorithm, which has led to a reduction in unnecessary radiation  exposure from CT scans in children who have suffered head injuries.   Mental health and substance abuse screenings have been created to  better assess children in emergency situations, and a full 50 percent  of hospitals have adopted new guidelines to assist them in transferring  children to appropriate facilities when specialized care is needed.   Any doctor, nurse, or EMS provider will tell you that we can't simply  treat children as small adults. They need specialized treatment and  protocols to ensure that the care they receive is appropriate and  available to them when and where they need it. Passing this 5-year  reauthorization of the EMSC program will continue to provide innovative  and appropriate care to children.   Mr. Speaker, I hope all of my colleagues will join me in supporting  this bill today, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would urge support for this bipartisan  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2507) to amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize  certain programs under part A of title XI of such Act relating to  genetic diseases, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows                                 H.R. 2507         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

SEC. 9. NAM REPORT ON THE MODERNIZATION OF NEWBORN SCREENING.         (a) Study.--Not later than 60 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human       Services shall seek to enter into an agreement with the       National Academy of Medicine (in this section referred to as       ``NAM'') (or if NAM declines to enter into such an agreement,       another appropriate entity) under which NAM, or such other       appropriate entity, agrees to conduct a study on the       following:        (1) The uniform screening panel review and recommendation       processes to identify factors that impact decisions to add       new conditions to the uniform screening panel, to describe       challenges posed by newly nominated conditions, including       low-incidence diseases, late onset variants, and new       treatments without long-term efficacy data.        (2) The barriers that preclude States from adding new       uniform screening panel conditions to their State screening       panels with recommendations on resources needed to help       States implement uniform screening panel recommendations.        (3) The current state of federally and privately funded       newborn screening research with recommendations for       optimizing the capacity of this research, including piloting       multiple prospective conditions at once and addressing rare       disease questions.        (4) New and emerging technologies that would permit       screening for new categories of disorders, or would make       current screening more effective, more efficient, or less       expensive.        (5) Technological and other infrastructure needs to improve       timeliness of diagnosis and short- and long-term follow-up       for infants identified through newborn screening and improve       public health surveillance.        (6) Current and future communication and educational needs       for priority stakeholders and the public to promote       understanding and knowledge of a modernized newborn screening       system with an emphasis on evolving communication channels       and messaging.        (7) The extent to which newborn screening yields better       data on the disease prevalence for screened conditions and       improves long-term outcomes for those identified through       newborn screening, including existing systems supporting such       data collection and recommendations for systems that would       allow for improved data collection.        (8) The impact on newborn morbidity and mortality in States       that adopt newborn screening tests included on the uniform       panel.        (b) Public Stakeholder Meeting.--In the course of       completing the study described in subsection (a), NAM or such       other appropriate entity shall hold not less than one public       meeting to obtain stakeholder input on the topics of such       study.        (c) Report.--Not later than 18 months after the effective       date of the agreement under subsection (a), such agreement       shall require NAM, or such other appropriate entity, to       submit to the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the       appropriate committees of jurisdiction of Congress a report       containing--        (1) the results of the study conducted under subsection       (a);        (2) recommendations to modernize the processes described in       subsection (a)(1); and        (3) recommendations for such legislative and administrative       action as NAM, or such other appropriate entity, determines       appropriate.        (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized       to be appropriated  [[Page H7367]]       $2,000,000 for the period of fiscal years 2020 and 2021 to       carry out this section.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 2507.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, every year over 12,000 newborns are born with conditions  that require early detection and treatment. With proper screening,  parents can receive education and children can receive appropriate  follow-up and treatment and, ultimately, better long-term health  outcomes.   Over the years, as more screening tests and treatments have become  available as we have expanded our medical and scientific knowledge, we  have also seen greater potential for improving outcomes for children.   However, prior to Congress passing the first Newborn Screening Saves  Lives Act in 2008, a patchwork of State requirements for screening led  to some newborns screened for many disorders and others for very few.   Since the Newborn Screening law was enacted, we have seen tremendous  progress around the country, with all 50 States screening for at least  29 recommended conditions. But as we develop new screening tests and  treatments for diseases once thought untreatable, we must ensure that  States are able to adopt recommended screening tests more quickly.   The bill we are considering today will do that by reauthorizing the  program for 5 years, with higher authorization levels, improved  processes and pilot testing for new screening tests, and a study  focused on how we can better modernize newborn screening for the  future.   This bipartisan bill will bring us closer to the goal of every child  born in the United States receiving all recommended screening tests and  will improve countless lives of the youngest Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support it and ask all of my colleagues to  join me in passing it today, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Roybal-Allard), the chairwoman of the  Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers. I would ask  my colleagues, on a bipartisan basis, to support this legislation. I  thank the sponsor, the chairwoman, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Oregon,  particularly for saying we are the best committee in the House.   I rise in support of his bill, H.R. 693, the PAST Act.   I want to start by thanking Representatives Schrader and Yoho for  their work over the past several years on this important bill that will  finally put an end to the cruel practice of soring Tennessee Walking  Horses, Spotted Saddle Horses, and Racking Horses.   This incredibly painful practice has been illegal in the United  States for  [[Page H7371]]  nearly 50 years, since Congress passed the Horse Protection Act of  1970. But despite the Federal ban, soring continues to run rampant in  some segments of the walking horse industry.   The bill would amend the Horse Protection Act and finally put an end  to the abhorrent practice for good. The bill bans the use at horse  shows of chains, weighted shoes, and other devices that are commonly  used to sore horses.   It also puts an end to the failed system of industry self-policing by  giving the USDA authority to train and license independent inspectors  at horse shows. The legislation also strengthens penalties on those who  violate the law.   This bill has received endorsements from hundreds of equine and  veterinary organizations, including more than 60 State and national  horse groups, and all 50 State veterinary medical associations.   So, again, I thank Representative Schrader for his continued  leadership. It is time that Congress pass this legislation and put an  end to soring once and for all.
