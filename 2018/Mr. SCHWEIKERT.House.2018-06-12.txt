 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous materials on the topic of this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, this is actually one of those sort of  joyful moments that we finally get a chance to come up here, and we  don't very often get to do that.   We are going to have a discussion of what is happening in our  economy, in our society for both our friends on the left and those of  us on the right, the love of people, and the fact that they have  opportunity.   When you look at the unemployment statistics, when you actually take  a look at how many of our brothers and sisters are moving back into the  workforce, the income, and the closing of income inequality, there are  wonderful things happening out there.   The neat thing tonight, we are going to bring a number of Members  from different parts of the country, particularly in the West, and we  are going to talk about what they are seeing happening in their region.  We are going to talk also about a little bit of the data and a handful  of fairly interesting things that I am actually excited about.   So, first, I yield to the gentleman from Montana (Mr. Gianforte) and  give him an opportunity to talk about what is happening in his State.                                time  2030     Mr. Speaker, as we walk through these, there are fun  little tidbits to understand.   Math is complicated and tax revenues--the fact of the matter is we  are only where we are at in the year, so we are not completely done  with the fiscal year. But we pulled up, a little while ago, the status  from the amount of revenues up until April.   So in the 2017 fiscal year, at that April time, we had taken in $456  billion in revenues. Revenues come from lots of different sources, but  substantially they are from the economic activity in our Nation, the  income tax, corporate tax, payroll taxes, and other things. So it was  456 last year. This year it is $510 billion.   So understand that. It is not a complete fiscal year, but as our  friend from Montana was just saying, there was such hyperbolic language  from some of our friends on the other side that the world was going to  come to an end, the fact of the matter is that revenues are blowing the  doors off from where we thought they would be. This is a wonderful  thing.   To tell one of the other stories, I will invite the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Tipton) to tell us what is happening in Colorado.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Tipton).    Madam Speaker, I have a quick thought experiment for  everyone.   If I had come to you a year ago and said that the United States would  be at 3.8 percent unemployment, you would have laughed at me. If I had  come to you and said that African American unemployment would be the  lowest in  [[Page H5085]]  modern times, Hispanic unemployment would be tied with some of the  lowest numbers in modern times, that you would be seeing data of felons  being recruited out of prison for work because there is such a labor  shortage, and when one of the greatest difficulties we have in our  society right now in the labor force is not enough workers and too many  jobs, why isn't there this sound of joy from every American that this  was the dream so many of us had of where we would be?   So, as we go through our regions, I was going to invite Mr. Curtis of  Utah to come up and tell us what is happening in that beautiful State  because I have actually seen some stories of the Salt Lake area and  other parts of Utah just doing amazingly well right now.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Curtis).    Madam Speaker, there is actually some really fun and  wonderful things we are seeing out there in the data. As we were also  talking about the unemployment numbers, what has also been amazing is,  if you look at home prices, if you actually look at savings rates, and  if you actually look at a lot of the data that we care about as a  society, it is important that we actually embrace and understand we are  in what we would refer to as a Goldilocks economy.                                time  2045    Madam Speaker, if I had come to, like our previous thought experiment  a year ago, and said we would be in this sort of world where the  inflation numbers are within the calculation of the Fed targets, where  we have more jobs than workers, when we are actually seeing incomes  really beginning to rise, when we are actually seeing some first signs  of data saying for the first time in decades that income inequality is  actually shrinking because there are so many more of our brothers and  sisters in the labor force with rising incomes, this would actually be  really exciting.   I will make the challenge to every Member in Congress: How do we not  screw it up? How do we keep that engine going forward?   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko).  She has the district right alongside me and she will basically tell the  story of what she sees happening on the west side of Maricopa County.    Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Lesko. I am so  used to calling her Debbie, having known each other for so long.   What is also amusing here is, the next person I'm going to introduce,  I have actually known most of my life, which is sort of terrifying. The  three of us are from Arizona. I think we actually have a wonderful  story to talk about what is happening in the Southwest, but  particularly our State.   The fact of the matter is, with the tax reform, some of the  regulatory changes, some of the wonderful things in the economy,  Arizona is blessed. Right now, our State is doing very well.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Biggs) to  tell us a bit about what is happening in the Southeast Valley.    Madam Speaker, I will have a little bit of a colloquy  or a little bit of a conversation with the gentleman.   For those of us in Arizona, the gentleman has seen the data that came  out about 2 weeks ago that turns out that Arizona is actually having  what would be the fastest acceleration of income growth in the entire  Nation. Some of that is because we were hit pretty hard in 2008. A lot  of it is because our State legislature, our Governor, have engaged in  very pro-economic expanded qualities.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman to tell everyone what he did  before taking this job.    Madam Speaker, the gentleman was there during some of  the brutal years of the previous decade. The gentleman may remember the  struggles of trying to keep the wheels on of how do you cover  healthcare, education, and so many of the other needs that are in the  State.   Actually, we have a rough situation. We own so little of our land  that I have seen some data where we are the most urbanized State in the  country because we functionally live in two major metroplexes. That is  where most of our population is. And to have a State now, where we are  seeing some revenue forecasts and every month it looks like they are  having to raise that forecast because of the economic vitality in our  State and most of the States around the country.   So I think there is often this misnomer of we talk about Federal tax  reform. And I hold up a chart, it says: Last year at this time, we had  $456 billion in revenue and this year we are at this time $510 billion.  So a substantial increase.   But I think we failed to talk about what is happening in our  community, in our city, our county, and our State revenues, which are  also benefiting from this cascade of economic expansion.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona.    Madam Speaker, we just finished a visit to the  McKesson facility that is on the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian  Community, and they are talking about several hundred additional  positions.   As we sort of talk about this, we actually had a really neat  experience about a month ago. The Arizona correctional system has sort  of a pilot program that has been up and running for about a year.    So picture this. We are in the Ways and Means room, we are holding a  hearing. And sitting on the table before us is the woman who is a  friend of ours who is the Central Arizona Homebuilders representative  and over here is a gentleman with a very large electrical contracting  company. The person sitting in the middle there with tattoos and those  sorts of things is, I think, a three-time convicted felon who actually  now is making $22 an hour and telling the story of how he had a  substance abuse problem and had multiple times fallen back into that  lifestyle. This time, he actually said: I am going to give this a try.   They set up job training in the prison solely funded by the  businesses, because they actually need electricians and carpenters and  other things. They did the job training in the prison with a deal that  if they finish this program, we will guarantee you a job. It doesn't  mean they guarantee they are going to keep you, because you still have  got to show up, you have to demonstrate productivity.   But think about a world where the economy is so vibrant that  businesses are actually going and reaching into our prison communities  and doing job training and actually offering employment.   I guess my heartbreak is I thought there would be this sense of joy  around  [[Page H5087]]  here in Washington that we have actually passed a level that so many  economists just a couple of years ago said we could never reach, this  level of economic vitality, where we are actually seeing felons being  able to be pulled into society's workforce.                                time  2100    We see programs like that in our State that are being creative,  because we need those carpenters; we need those plumbers; we need those  electricians. He started, I guess, at like $13 an hour. Within a year,  he was up to $22, because he was productive, and he showed up to work  on time.   He had one of the greatest quotes of all time. He says: I am working  so many hours, I haven't had a chance to relapse.   It turns out maybe there is something to that saying about idle  hands.    I am one of the people who have to actually admit to  this, that, often, as Republicans, we sound like accountants on  steroids. We are looking at the numbers. We want to do policy by facts  and not feelings, because when you do things by feelings, you end up,  ultimately, hurting people. When you do it by facts, you actually build  something that is sustainable.   This is one of the moments where a lot of the economic theories we  have talked about, if you would lighten and go to a more rational  regulatory model, if you would design a Tax Code that got rid of these  incentives to move your profits overseas and pull your expenses into  the United States and go to a territorial system where you had the  vitality, where capital would flow in, where you actually gave  businesses the incentive to actually buy much more efficient capital  equipment--because the way you pay people more is we have to get more  productive as a society.   Yes, some of the barriers we were worried about were: Will folks get  this tax benefit and spend it all? Now we have seen some data, which is  different than how CBO modeled it. People are paying off debt and other  things, so the capital stock in our country is going up.   There are just really good things. Right now, we have a labor  shortage, and you can see something amazing.   Take a look at things like Social Security Disability. A year ago, it  had only like a year before the trust fund was empty. Now we are seeing  some things that it may be 5, 7, 8 years now, just substantially  because we did change some rules, and we tightened up.   We also have so many more people paying in and working, and many of  our brothers and sisters in the country making a decision saying: ``I  could pursue a disability claim, or I could go into the workforce.''  They are going into the workforce.   So there are all these tells out there right now. The gentleman sees  it in his community. I am blessed to see it in my community.   How do we keep it going? Because, it turns out, the economic vitality  is a powerful thing for families, their ability to save for their  retirement, for their kids' education, for being able to pay off, let's  face it, a certain amount of debt that built up over a pretty rough  decade, particularly being a State like ours with so many people who  are coming to it for opportunity.   As the gentleman talks to small businesses, and I talk to small  businesses and even big businesses, we have this conversation: How do  we keep it going, and how do we keep it going for as long as possible?   Those are the policies we are chasing.    This is one of my favorite stories. About 6 weeks  ago, maybe 2 months ago, I believe it was Starbucks that gave the  bonus, and I am in my favorite Starbucks. As the gentleman knows, I  have a coffee problem and openly admit it. If anyone wants to start a  12-step program, we are holding the meetings at a coffee shop.   I walk in. I am not someone you typically would be jumping up and  down to see, you know, a fairly conservative Republican Congressman.  She looks at me and goes: ``Dude, thank you.''   She had just gotten, I guess, a bonus check from her employer, and  she actually understood what it meant monetarily to her. It was one of  the neatest conversations I had with this young woman as I am ordering  my coffee about how excited she was to have the money and what it meant  to her to pay off some bills and just how things were going.   That is when it starts to click. That is when it is more than just  sitting behind tables with stacks of binders and spreadsheets and  analytical reports and feedback loops of what the tax reform is going  to do and growing the size of the economy, when it gets down to those  individual lives.   Look, I often walk around with this app. It is from the Atlanta  Federal Reserve. Madam Speaker, if I had come to you even months ago  and said: ``The Atlanta Federal Reserve has the calculation for this  quarter, at this moment, at a 4.6 percent GDP growth,'' you would have  worried about my mental health. It turns out, that is actually what the  number is.   The odds are that it doesn't stay there, and it is going to go  through cycles, but that number is stunning. The bias has been,  actually, over 4 in the last handful of data points. I know I am back  to speaking like an accountant on steroids, but the fact of the matter  is that we have some pretty rough things coming toward us as a society.  We are getting older very fast. We have tremendous unfunded liabilities  in Medicare. We have issues on Social Security.    We will find a way to keep our promises to those folks who have paid  into those programs. Turns out, making the math work is a lot easier if  you have a society, an economy, that has actually been able to hold  economic growth rather than one that has been in the troughs as we were  for the previous decade.   How do we sort of tell that story to folks who may be on the left or  those who are just trying to raise their families or those of us who  our constituents are paying attention? This really is that moment where  the rising tide raises boats and opportunity for everyone.    Madam Speaker, I remember when the gentleman first  got here, and we were going over those models. They were like 1.8, 1.9,  and that was our future. Let's face it, we have blown that off the  rails.    In that same vein, it was only a couple of years ago,  actually behind these same mikes, that a discussion was had of the sort  of concept of people being trapped, trapped in their house because they  were underwater, trapped in their job because they didn't have mobility  and options.   For a State like Arizona, the fact of the matter is that your ability  to sell your home and get a job in another State because you are  choosing to move to the Southwest is important to our growth. You could  actually see that in the migration statistics around the country of how  many people, because of the thin employment market, job opportunities,  were underwater in their homes.   As the job opportunities and our real estate values and the stability  of the economy have come back, all of a sudden, you are seeing people  have this thing called choice, options, the ability to move around the  country, pursue their dreams, pursue those careers, change jobs.   I think, actually, that is what the American Dream is supposed to  look like. If you have a dream of living in a certain part of the  country or pursuing a certain career, you get to do it. You get to do  it because the economy is working.   Madam Speaker, as we started to talk early on, if you really do love  and care for people, take a look at what is happening to the income and  employment statistics of so many groups that have been disaffected in  our population for the last decade. They had a really rough decade, and  they are coming back, their opportunity, their ability to save for  their retirement, their future, and their kids.   There should be a sense of joy. There should be, actually, sort of a  uniform discussion between the right and the left of how we keep it  going, because it is not only things I fixate on, of being able to have  revenues or being able to cover our unfunded liabilities and our  entitlements, but also that ability to have a society that is  healthier, that actually the income gaps shrink because there is  mobility and growth.   Populations that so many of the so-called smart people, the  economists, had almost written off as the marginally employable--which  is, if you take a step sideways, it is just really cruel. Those people  are finding a way to come back into the economic part of our society.   I know when the gentleman was in the State legislature, he had worked  on a job training program, and now we are actually seeing some really  interesting data in Arizona where the employers themselves are saying:  We are so desperate for employees, we will do the job training. We will  take someone who is not even from our field, and we will train them.   It turns out that has been incredibly successful, because you are  actually trained not in a job training program over here and then you  get trained again for the actual job you have taken, but now you are  being trained for that rhythm.   I know there has been just tremendous employment growth in the  southeast valley. I think it is a type of high-tech CNC machine shop  that some friends own in the gentleman's district, and they are talking  about even taking in very young people and training them right there on  site.    Madam Speaker, I ask Congressman Biggs: Those of us  who see these numbers, how do we find a way to humanize that  discussion? We want to talk about economic vitality and these things,  but there is almost this cruelty of you are going to remain unemployed,  you are going to remain underemployed, you are going to remain  undercompensated, you are not educated well enough to come into the  mainstream.   We have demonstrated in the last several months that that doesn't  have to be the America we live in, that we are seeing individuals who  were substantially marginalized in our society finding employment and  finding opportunity and finding that economic vitality and growth.                                time  2115    We are looking for a way to humanize the story that, it turns out, a  robust economy actually is really good for families, for individuals,  for your future, for just the individual psyche. And maybe there is an  artist out there of language who can help us find an elegant way to say  this story.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona.    Madam Speaker, it is a powerful story.    Madam Speaker, I think he is his constituent.    Madam Speaker, I know I kept him longer than I  promised to, but I never get the chance to talk.   Madam Speaker, I have appreciated this block of time. I appreciate  your patience with us, particularly talking about Arizona, but it is-- you know, we love our State, and we are very, very proud of how far it  has come. We are proud of the fact that we are leading much of the  Nation in growth--in population growth, economic growth, income  growth--and it is, in many ways, our moral goal around here to keep  this vitality up for every American.   Whether you live in a red State, blue State, whatever you pursue, you  should have the ability and the opportunity to pursue that. We want to  make the powerful argument that where we have gotten this country to  economically right now is pretty darn amazing.   Now, can we do even more? Our goal is we are going to even make it  better.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
