 Mr. President, let me begin by thanking my senior  Senator, Jack Reed, for calling us to the floor to reflect and  memorialize a truly splendid Senator who represented the State of Rhode  Island, our friend and a great Rhode Islander, Claiborne Pell.   I think my senior colleague has done an exemplary job of following in  Senator Pell's footsteps of decency, civility, and quiet determination  in the seat that Senator Pell once held. I cannot claim to hold the  seat the Senator once held, but I can claim to have the desk at which  Senator Pell once sat. If you look here right under where it says  ``Pastore''--a Rhode Island Senator--in carved letters, you see in very  small letters ``P-e-l-l'' and then ``R.I.''--like anybody needed to  know that Claiborne Pell was from Rhode Island.   Claiborne Pell was very important in my political life. He spent  years--in fact, decades--refusing to get involved in primaries. ``It is  up to the party,'' he would say. When I ran for attorney general the  first time I ran for elected office, I was in a three-way primary, and  Claiborne Pell, for the first time in his career, endorsed me in that  primary. He more than endorsed me; we went to a little park near his  house in Newport, and he allowed me to film myself walking with him and  conversing with him for my first commercial. Well, you can imagine, in  a State like Rhode Island, when a legend like Claiborne Pell in the  Democratic Party suddenly appears in your commercial in a primary--let  me just say it was not a good day for my primary opponents. It was  incredibly generous of Claiborne Pell to break a multidecade tradition  on primaries in order to launch my first political effort, and I hope I  have conducted myself since then in such a way that I never gave him or  his family cause to regret it.   As Senator Reed pointed out, one of the significant lessons from  Claiborne Pell's career here in the Senate--and it is one that I think  of all the time--was that he looked beyond the scrum of the moment.  There is always something going on here in the Senate. There is always  some fight or some issue that is on the front page of the Washington  Post and on the news channels. That is always, always, always going on,  and that bright, shiny object very often attracts an enormous amount of  attention in this body. I suspect that Senator Pell paid less attention  to that daily scrum than almost anybody who has served in the Senate.  He had a much more patient soul and steadily and quietly and modestly  worked away at his priorities.   He used to make fun of himself for his interest in ``choo-choos.'' He  would say ``choo-choo.'' Well, we have Amtrak in large part because of  Senator Claiborne Pell's work. The Pell grant is named after him  because of persistent leadership making sure that such a grant existed.  Over years of work, he finally got it done. It was ultimately named for  him, and it remains today an important part of how many young people  here in the United States actually get to college and move toward their  dreams.   He fought for years to create the National Endowment for the Arts and  National Endowment for the Humanities, and those institutions still  exist. They are still doing great work today.   In Rhode Island, we are very proud of Sea Grant. Sea Grant has  programs in all of our coastal States. Sea Grant was the invention of  Claiborne Pell and Dean John Knauss, later dean of the Graduate School  of Oceanography at the University of Rhode Island.   When you look back and think of who the Senators were at the time  that Claiborne Pell served, you can go through all these desk drawers  that I showed you, and there are lots of names of Senators. Many of  them are ones you never heard of. They were certainly important in  their day, but their day is done and their names are no longer  remembered. Senator Pell is remembered. He left lasting legacies like  those, and he did it by quietly and patiently sticking with his  priorities, which he knew were Rhode Island's priorities and America's  priorities. He might not have been on the talk shows as much as other  Senators. He might not have been quoted on the front page of the  Washington Post as much as other Senators. He was not as attentive to  the daily scrum of Washington conflict. But, my goodness, when you look  back at the legacy that he left that still operates today, it is hard  to find somebody of his era whose footprint is larger than that of this  shy, quiet, patient, civil, and persistent man.   I would add to Senator Reed's comments about Claiborne Pell's  philosophy a statement that he made to me that he made quite often. He  said:         One of the things that you must learn in politics, Sheldon,       is how to let the other fellow have it your way. Always let       the other fellow have it your way.    What does it mean to always let the other fellow have it your way?  What I take from that is that it means you have to stand by your  principles. You have to achieve the goals you have set out for yourself  and for your constituents, but on the way to getting there, if you can  give others credit, if you can let other ideas join yours, if you can  let other people have it your way, you are more likely to succeed. To  this day, I still repeat that quote to new hires in my office.   The picture of Claiborne Pell that he signed for me is still right  there on my bookcase, and I see it every time I sit in the chair in my  office. He was a remarkable and special individual. He was not your  standard-issue U.S. Senator. The particular way he chose to go about  his duties has left a larger footprint than most of his colleagues were  able to leave.   I will end with a story about one of my final memories. Senator Pell  was out of the Senate. His illness had caught up with him to the point  where he was barely able to speak any longer. His friend Ted Kennedy,  who sat in this space right here--at a different desk but right here at  this spot on the Senate floor--was sailing through Rhode Island, and he  called up Senator Pell, and he said: I would like to take you out on my  boat. So it was arranged that Senator Pell would go out on his  sailboat. That required getting a wheelchair onto a sailboat, over the  tippy docks that Senator Kennedy's boat pulled up to. Sure enough, we  all grabbed a piece of the wheelchair and hoisted it up and stepped  over into the boat and set his wheelchair down in the cockpit of the  boat. Senator Kennedy started up the motor and drove it off down into  Newport Harbor and then shut off the motor and put up the sails. As the  wind caught the sails, the boat heeled over, and this old  coastguardsman, Claiborne Pell, smiled a smile that I will never forget  as the wind took the boat and we began to move out into Narragansett  Bay.   The only other thing that was really fun about that was, because  Senator Pell could barely speak any longer, he was actually a perfect  fit for Senator Kennedy, who could basically not stop talking. There  was this wonderful conversation with Teddy Kennedy and Claiborne Pell  wherein Teddy Kennedy did all the talking for the both of them, and  they both had a lovely time. They reflected on decades of friendship  and service here. It was a real privilege to have a chance as a very  new Senator to share that moment with those two  [[Page S6949]]  very different but mutually beloved lions of the Senate.   I particularly thank my distinguished senior colleague for organizing  our chance to come here and reflect on our friend Claiborne Pell. I  think nobody better than he carries on the Pell tradition.   I thank Senator Reed.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for  up to 20 minutes as in morning business.    Mr. President, it is hard, particularly for those of  us from coastal States, to overstate the importance of the Earth's  oceans as a storehouse of our food, as a regulator of our climate, as a  highway for our travel and trade, and as a source of wonder, joy, and  recreation. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and  Development, oceans contributed $1.5 trillion to the global economy in  2010. But climate change is putting this all at risk.   I have spoken frequently here on the floor about the threat climate  change poses to our oceans and of the warning signals blaring around  the world. One of the most overlooked of those signals is the enormous  amount of heat accumulating in the oceans.    As CBS News reported last week, ``recent revelations have been  particularly alarming'' and ``deserv[ing] of a big neon sign on  Broadway.'' My humble floor speeches may not be a big neon sign on  Broadway, but I do hope they shine a little light on the plight of our  oceans, which ultimately is our human plight.   We know that more than 90 percent of the excess heat trapped by our  greenhouse gas emissions has been absorbed by the oceans--no dispute,  not even by the Trump administration. The Federal Government's ``2017  Climate Science Special Report,'' a multiagency report by experts from  NOAA, NASA, and the Department of Energy, labeled as ``the United  States' most definitive statement on climate change science'' by the  New York Times, found that the oceans absorbed more than 9 zettajoules  of heat energy per year.   What is a zettajoule? A zettajoule is a billion trillion joules. A  joule is a measure of heat energy, J-O-U-L-E. So 9 zettajoules is 9  billion trillion joules. That is more than 12 times the total energy  that human beings use globally each year, just to put a scale on what 9  billion trillion joules is.   To get another measure of how much energy that is, visualize the  power of a detonated Hiroshima-style atomic bomb. Imagine its classic  mushroom cloud erupting into the sky. Imagine all of that energy from a  Hiroshima-style atomic bomb captured as heat--pure heat.   Now imagine four Hiroshima-sized atomic bombs exploded every second-- every second. That is the equivalent of the excess heat going into our  oceans because of climate change, because of our carbon emissions. More  than four atomic bombs' worth of excess heat energy is being absorbed  by the oceans every second of every day of every year. That is a  massive amount of heat energy, and adding it to the oceans has  consequences.   The most direct consequence of all that energy being pumped into the  seas obviously is increased water temperatures. Global average ocean  surface temperature is up around 0.8 degrees Celsius, or 1.5 degrees  Fahrenheit, since preindustrial times. That is enough to throw off the  delicate balance of ocean conditions that marine creatures rely on to  survive. Within that global ocean warming are extreme ocean temperature  spikes around the world. These marine heat waves in the ocean were  first identified and characterized in 2011. This is a newly described  phenomenon that climate change has brought to our seas.   Although marine heat waves were first identified and characterized in  2011, they have already caused permanent damage in our oceans. The  Great Barrier Reef is the largest coral reef in the world. It stretches  for 1,400 miles off Northeastern Australia, and it is one of the seven  natural wonders of the world. It is made up of corals--corals that can  become heat stressed and evict the tiny algae that support corals and  give corals their bright colors. Without the algae, the corals appear  white, so these events are called coral bleaching.   In the summer of 2016, the Great Barrier Reef was hit by the most  severe marine heat wave on record. It caused the longest and worst mass  coral bleaching event in history. Then another heat wave and bleaching  occurred the next year, in 2017. These unprecedented back-to-back  bleaching events killed half of all corals in the Great Barrier Reef.  If there is a wonder of the world, if there is a majestic feature of  God's creation, it is the Great Barrier Reef, and we are busily  wrecking it in this generation through carbon emissions.   The prognosis for the rest of the world's coral reefs is grim. The  U.N. International Panel on Climate Change released a report last  month, finding that coral reefs will all but disappear from Earth if we  warm by 2 degrees Celsius--which, by the way, is the goal we are trying  to stay under through the Paris accord. Even if we stay under that  goal, corals will suffer immensely. Without any changes to our fossil  fuel consumption, we are on track to blow by 2 degrees and hit 3  degrees Celsius of global warming by 2100, making corals virtually  extinct.   Warming oceans are wreaking havoc on the world's fisheries. Fish feed  the world and power coastal economies. The World Health Organization  says that fish are the main source of protein for around 1 billion  people worldwide. The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization estimates  that 60 million people are employed in fisheries and agriculture.   Across the globe and here at home we are seeing dangerous shifts  affecting the fishing industry. Rhode Island once had a booming lobster  industry. But the lobster population is shifting north as our waters  warm, leaving Rhode Island lobster traps empty. The National Oceanic  and Atmospheric Administration reports, ``The lobster industry in New  York and southern New England has nearly collapsed.'' Maine, as Senator  Angus King has pointed out, is temporarily benefiting from the northern  movement of lobster, but the lobster will keep moving north into Canada  as the oceans continue to warm.    Rhode Islanders and other New England fishermen are also looking  worriedly at declining shellfish populations. Total landings for  eastern oysters, northern quahogs, softshell clams, and northern bay  scallops declined 85 percent between 1980 and 2010. The National  Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration identified warming ocean  temperatures as the key driver for that decline. On the other side of  that decline, of course, are the livelihoods of all the men and women  in that industry.   The accumulating heat energy in our seas is also causing them to  rise. As water warms, it expands. This thermal expansion is responsible  for around one-third of the rise we have measured in sea levels. The  rest comes mostly from melting ice, again, thanks to climate change.  Global sea level has already risen over eight inches on average in the  past 100 years--more in certain locations--and the rate of increase is  accelerating.   Warming and expanding waters eat away at the large ice sheets in the  Antarctic. As the edges melt away, the glaciers behind them melt more  quickly, adding additional water to the ocean. The IPCC warns that as  the world reaches warming levels of 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius--again,  what we are trying to stay at; this is our target. This isn't if it is  worse. At that 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius, ice sheet melt could trigger  multiple meters of sea level rise over time--meters, not inches. We are  already 1 degree Celsius above preindustrial times, so there is not  much room for maneuver between where we are and 1.5 to 2 degrees.   Warmer seas also supercharge storms. Hurricanes gain strength from  heat energy in the oceans below them. Warmer oceans also evaporate more  water to the atmosphere, generating more rainfall. Stronger and wetter  storms then ride ashore on higher sea levels, pushing larger storm  surges ahead of them into our coastal States.   Many of us remember the devastation Superstorm Sandy brought to the  mid-Atlantic and southern New England States in 2012. Here is what Dr.  Michael Mann, professor of atmospheric science and director of the  Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University, said  about that storm:   [[Page S6951]]              Sea level rise adds to the storm surge of every single       storm that makes landfall. In the case of Superstorm Sandy,       in 2012, it added a foot to that 13-foot storm surge. One       foot . . . meant 25 more square miles of coastal flooding. It       meant several billion dollars worth of additional damage.    At one point during this year's hurricane season, our tropics faced  nine active tropical storms. The hallmarks of these warm, ocean-fueled  storms can be seen in powerful hurricanes that hit United States  territories in recent years. Hurricane Harvey hit Houston; Hurricane  Maria hit Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands; Super Typhoon Yutu hit  the Northern Marianas, Hurricane Florence hit in the Carolinas, and  Hurricane Michael hit in Florida.   No one storm can be blamed wholly on climate change, but scientists  are increasingly able to link the increasingly dangerous level of storm  damage to climate change, and we have had an eerie streak of record- setting storms in the past few years. Hurricane Harvey was the single  greatest downpour in U.S. history, according to the U.S. Geological  Survey. It dumped over 50 inches of rain on Houston and over 30  trillion gallons of water over Texas, Louisiana, Tennessee, and  Kentucky. How much is 30 trillion gallons of water? For comparison, the  Chesapeake Bay holds around 18 trillion gallons of water. Basically, it  dumped nearly two Chesapeake Bays onto those States.   Harvey's deluge was fueled by record warm temperatures in the Gulf of  Mexico. Scientists from the University of California, Berkeley, found  that Hurricane Harvey was over three times more likely to have occurred  due to climate change and that its rainfall was increased by around 38  percent due to climate change.   Hurricane Florence intensified over water 1 to 2 degrees Celsius  above average and dumped record rainfall and flooding on the Carolinas  in September. Preliminary analysis suggests that Florence's rainfall  was more than 50 percent higher due to climate change.   When Hurricane Michael hit Florida just last month, it passed over  water 2 to 3 degrees Celsius warmer than average. As it passed over  these waters, Michael's winds increased by 80 miles per hour in just 48  hours, a phenomenon scientists refer to as ``rapid intensification.''  It became the strongest storm ever to make an October landfall in the  United States.   The direct link between sea temperature and hurricane intensification  is well established: Each degree Celsius of ocean warming causes a 7- percent increase in maximum wind speed, and a storm's destructive  potential increases by three times the wind speed increase.   So how does that play through? To quote Professor Mann again:         A 7 percent increase in wind speed is a 21 percent increase       in the destructive potential of the storm. That is with one       degree Celsius ocean warming. With Hurricane Michael, those       temperatures were 2 to 3 degrees Celsius above preindustrial       temperatures. If you do the math, that means it was probably       twice as destructive as it would have been in the absence of       human-caused warming.    The result of the destructive power of Hurricane Michael was the  almost complete demolition of the town of Mexico Beach, FL. Michael hit  with 155 mile per hour winds and a storm surge of around 9 feet,  completely demolishing 70 percent of homes and severely damaging many  more.   The degree of damage and the imposing costs of rebuilding mean that  many Floridians simply will leave, and that is playing out across  coastal properties.   A falloff of coastal property values will spread, many sources  anticipate, as people see more events like the destruction of Mexico  Beach. Insurance companies, banks, and institutional property investors  are already showing signs of anxiety in coastal communities.   Freddie Mac has described the effect of this property value crash on  America's coastal regions as follows. Freddie Mac--the great housing  powerhouse--has said: ``The economic losses and social disruption may  happen gradually, but they are likely to be greater in total than those  experienced in the housing crisis and Great Recession.''   Any of us who lived through the 2008 mortgage meltdown should take  that warning deadly seriously. It is not just Freddie Mac. Moody's now  rates coastal municipalities' bonds for this risk--Moody's, Freddie  Mac, Union of Concerned Scientists, the experience of coastal  communities. It is all piling up, and yet we do nothing. I haven't even  talked about acidification. That is a separate speech--the chemical  changes happening in the ocean, in addition to the physical changes of  warming and rising. Set that aside, but it is just as dangerous.   Despite these warnings just about ocean warming, Republican heads in  Congress and in the White House seem determined to remain buried in the  sand. I don't know how many more storms need to hit us before we are  willing to take meaningful action. Americans who live and work along  our shores--Rhode Islanders and people who live in other coastal  States--are the ones who are suffering the most from all of this, and  they are the ones who will have to explain our delay. Those Americans  are entitled to a voice, not just the lobbyists of the fossil fuel  industry. We must protect our coasts for when the next storms batter  their way ashore.   This is getting worse, not better. We must take responsibility for  the changes we are causing in the world's oceans. We will not be  forgiven for our indolence and disregard just because there is a big  industry behind our indolence and disregard. Our oceans are warning us  loudly, and they are warning us clearly: It is time to wake up.   I yield the floor.
