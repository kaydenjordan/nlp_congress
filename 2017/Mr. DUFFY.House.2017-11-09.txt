 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Emmer, my colleague and friend from the  neighboring State of Minnesota, for offering such a commonsense piece  of legislation.   I frequently hear horror stories of fraud and abuse. All of us stand  against fraud and abuse. I have a news flash for everybody: This law  doesn't change that fraud is illegal. It was illegal before this bill  and it will be illegal after this bill. Fraud is illegal.   All we are doing is saying we are going to keep the promise that all  of us say that we have to small entrepreneurs and startups to make sure  that they get seed capital and make sure they can thrive and grow and  create jobs in our community.   All we are trying to do is give clarity to what constitutes a  nonpublic offering. What is wrong with clarity? What is wrong with  bright lines that they know that they can operate in between without  violating the rule?   This is simple. It is straightforward, it is common sense, and it  supports everything we say we support, which is small businesses, and I  think this is a great piece of legislation.    I would ask all of my colleagues to stand together. Let's  not play partisanship with the smallest businesses in our communities,  the ones that we both agree create jobs. This is a time for unity.  Let's work together, especially when it is common sense.   I love the passion from the ranking member, but on this one, it is  passion without a cause. It makes sense. It gives bright lines.   Let's stand up for small businesses that create jobs in our  community. Mr. Emmer's bill does that. I ask us all to stand up and  support small businesses and this bill.
