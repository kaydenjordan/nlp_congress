 Mr. Speaker, when it comes to immigration  policies, a recent poll shows that the American people are far closer  to President Trump than to the liberal media. The results of a Harvard- Harris poll by Mark Penn, a former Hillary Clinton strategist, came up  with surprising results, considering what we have heard from the media.   When asked, ``Do you think that people who make it across the border  illegally should be allowed to stay in the country or sent home?'' 64  percent said they should be sent home.   When asked, ``Do you think we need stricter or looser enforcement of  our immigration laws?'' 70 percent said stricter; 60 percent support  building a combination of a physical and electronic barrier across the  U.S.-Mexico border.   When asked about sanctuary cities, 84 percent of respondents said  that cities should be required to notify immigration authorities about  taking custody of deportable immigrants, and 69 percent said the  Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency should not be abolished.   The administration's immigration policies do reflect Americans'  views.                            ____________________
