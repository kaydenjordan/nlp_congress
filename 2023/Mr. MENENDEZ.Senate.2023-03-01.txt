On July 26, 2022, Congress was notified by Congressional       certification transmittal number 22-0K of the possible sale,       under Section 36(b)(5)(C) of the Arms Export Control Act, of       one hundred three (103) AN/ALQ-250 Eagle Passive Active       Warning Survivability System (EPAWSS) electronic warfare       suites. The total cost of new MDE articles was $956 million.       This did not increase the total net cost of MDE, which       remained $2.4 billion. The total case value did not increase,       remaining $4.5 billion.        This transmittal notifies the addition of the following MDE       items: up to one (1) Instrumented Test Vehicle; two (2) JASSM       AGM-158 Separation Test Vehicles; two (2) JASSM AGM-158       Jettison Test Vehicles; two (2) ASSM AGM-158 Captive Carry       Flight Test Vehicles; two (2) AGM-158 Inert JASSMs; and one       hundred three (103) Embedded Global Positioning System/      Inertial Navigation System (GPS/INS) (EGI) devices with M-      code technology. The total cost of new MDE articles is $41       million. The total net cost of MDE remains $2.4 billion. The       total net cost of non-MDE remains $2.1 billion.

They system is       highly lethal against tanks and other systems with       conventional and reactive armors. The system possesses a       secondary capability against bunkers.        2. Javelin's key technical feature is the use of fire-and-      forget technology which allows the gunner to fire and       immediately relocate or take cover. Additional special       features are the top attack and/or direct fire modes, an       advanced tandem warhead and imaging infrared seeker, target       lock-on before launch, and soft launch from enclosures or       covered fighting positions. The Javelin missile also has a       minimum smoke motor thus decreasing its detection on the       battlefield.        3. The Javelin Weapon System is comprised of two major       tactical components, which are a reusable Light Weight       Command Launch Unit (LWCLU) and a round contained in a       disposable launch tube assembly. The LWCLU has been       identified as Major Defense Equipment (MDE). The LWCLU       incorporates an integrated day-night sight that provides a       target engagement capability in adverse weather and       countermeasure environments. The LWCLU may also be used in a       stand-alone mode for battlefield surveillance and target       detection. The LWCLU's thermal sight is a 3rd generation       Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) sensor. To facilitate initial       loading and subsequent updating of software, all on-board       missile software is uploaded via the LWCLU after mating and       prior to launch.        4. The missile is autonomously guided to the target using       an imaging infrared seeker and adaptive correlation tracking       algorithms. This allows the gunner to take cover or reload       and engage another target after firing a missile. The missile       has an advanced tandem warhead and can be used in either the       top attack or direct fire modes (for target undercover). An       onboard flight computer guides the missile to the selected       target.        5. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        6. If a technologically advanced adversary obtains       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures or       equivalent systems that might reduce weapon system       effectiveness or be used in the development of a system with       similar or advanced capabilities.        7. A determination has been made that the United Kingdom       can provide substantially the same degree of protection for       the sensitive technology being released as the U.S.       Government. This proposed sale is necessary to further the       U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives outlined       in the Policy Justification.        8. All defense articles and services listed on this       transmittal are authorized for release and export to the       Government of the United Kingdom.                            ____________________
