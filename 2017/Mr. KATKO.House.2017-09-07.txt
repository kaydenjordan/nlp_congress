 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.  [[Page H7148]]    The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 64, line 1, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced       by $250,000,000)''.        Page 67, line 20, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(increased by $250,000,000)''.        Page 67, line 22, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(increased by $250,000,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Katko) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment, which  restores critical water infrastructure funding to the Clean Water State  Revolving Fund.   Across our country, communities are faced with aging water  infrastructure, which poses a growing threat to existing levels of  service, public health, and our environment.   The State Revolving Funds are a proven critical tool for States and  local communities to make high priority water infrastructure  investments that otherwise may not be feasible.   Earlier this year, Onondaga County in my district leveraged over $20  million in funding through the State Revolving Funds to upgrade the  Syracuse-Metro sewage treatment plant to continue to improve the water  quality of Onondaga Lake, which has made a remarkable recovery.   While I commend the Chairman for his work on this legislation, with  the EPA estimating our national 20-year capital improvement need to be  over $650 billion for drinking water and waste infrastructure combined,  now is not the time to roll back this Federal funding.   The $250 million cut to this fund included in the bill would prove  harmful to communities in my district and throughout our entire Nation.   I was heartened to see that the President's statement yesterday  opposed this $250 million cut and reaffirmed the administration's  support of pivotal water infrastructure funding.   This is a bipartisan issue that impacts nearly every congressional  district. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support  this amendment to ensure our communities can continue to invest in  critical water infrastructure projects that support their economies and  a safe and healthy environment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Hultgren). The gentlewoman from Minnesota is  recognized for 5 minutes.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, while there is nothing more I would like to  do, I think any of us would all like to do, than to provide more  resources for the clean water SRF, it can't be done by reducing the  EPA's environmental programs in management.   This administration has clearly shown that they do not regard the  EPA's work as a priority, which means that they have a blatant  disregard for public health and the health of our environment.   The EPM account includes funding for programs like brownfields  enforcement, environmental justice, geographic programs, and lot of  other critical programs, some of which I gave examples of this evening,  which would suffer with a $250 million reduction.   This amendment illustrates, because I agree with the gentleman, I  wish we had more money to put in that account, what happens when we  don't have adequate 302(b) allocations. To overuse a common phrase, we  are robbing Peter to pay Paul, and it is not making us whole. So it is  with great reluctance that I oppose this amendment, but oppose it I  must because the cuts that have already been made this evening to the  brownfields enforcement, the environmental justice programs, and a  myriad of other programs which are critical to the health and well- being of our communities, and they are out there working every day on  it, is something I can just not support.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Calvert).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Calvert).    Mr. Chair, in response to my colleagues from the  Democratic side of the aisle, it is clear, as I stated previously, that  the President has signaled not only that he supports the plussing up of  the money as I propose in this amendment, that he supports plus-ing up  a much larger amount the Clean Water State Revolving Funds as part of  an overall infrastructure plan. To say otherwise is simply untrue. This  President wants everyone in the United States to have clean drinking  water. He supports this program, and for someone to say otherwise, it  is just not true.   She also stated that robbing Peter to pay Paul is something that may  be going on here. We are talking about clean drinking water, $250  million of clean drinking water, that would come out of the general  fund. I would much rather see a little discomfort from bureaucrats in  Washington, D.C., than to see people not have clean drinking water  nationwide.   I want to reiterate the importance of supporting the effective State  Revolving Fund program. It has done a great job nationwide, and we need  in these tough fiscal times to find ways to make these things work.  This is a way to do it. Take away from the general fund, take away from  instances in which bureaucrats may not be able to rent the car of their  choice or have the pencils that they choose or an upgraded computer. I  would much rather have that than to have dirty drinking water for our  constituents nationwide.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, the very employees that the gentleman was  talking about that get in a car, they drive to check out the sewer  waste plants to make sure that they are operating. They are making sure  that the water is clean. They are doing their job.   Tonight we have cut this account already by 16 percent. That means we  are cutting programs. We have cut brownfields enforcement,  environmental justice, geographic programs, programs that support the  very account you and I would like to see more money go into. I just  urge my colleagues not to support this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko).   The amendment was agreed to.                                time  1900         Amendment No. 31 Offered by Mr. Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 31  printed in House Report 115-297.   Mr. BEN RAY LUJAN of New Mexico. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at  the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 67, line 20, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(increased by $6,000,000) (reduced by $6,000,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from New Mexico (Mr. Ben Ray Lujan) and a Member opposed each will  control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Mexico.   Mr. BEN RAY LUJAN of New Mexico. Mr. Chair, a little more than 2  years ago, an Environmental Protection Agency team was investigating a  contamination at the Gold King Mine that caused a spill of 3 million  gallons of wastewater, impacting New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Arizona,  the Southern Ute Reservation, and the Navajo Nation.   I was in Farmington, New Mexico, in the Four Corners area when the  toxic plume turned the Animas River yellow. I met with the community  and heard their concerns about the toll that the spill was taking on  businesses, farmers, families, and individuals. I attended different  community meetings, not only in southern Colorado, but in that  northwestern part of New Mexico.   Despite repeated promises by the EPA that it would fully address this  [[Page H7149]]  environmental disaster, progress has too often been needlessly slow.  For example, in January of this year, the EPA and the Department of  Justice announced a deeply disappointing decision that the EPA was not  liable under the Federal Tort Claims Act for damages caused by the Gold  King Mine spill.   And while I appreciate Administrator Pruitt's recent announcement  that the EPA was reconsidering this misguided position, I believe that  the EPA and the Congress should act to ensure that every impacted  individual and community--especially New Mexicans and the Navajo  Nation--receive the compensation they deserve.   The State of New Mexico and the Navajo Nation should not have to sue  the Federal Government to ensure that the government meets its moral  obligation to the farmers, small business owners, and others injured by  this spill.   This amendment, however, is about the long-term impact the spill will  have on the river and all that that it sustains, from drinking water to  providing water for farming and livestock. Robust long-term water  quality monitoring is essential to ensuring that communities along the  Animas River have the data they need to protect the health of all of  those who rely on this water, and the State of New Mexico has developed  a robust and independent monitoring plan that deserves the EPA's  support.   That is why I am again offering an amendment to provide $6 million to  direct the EPA to work with the affected States and Indian Tribes to  support long-term monitoring programs for water quality on the Animas  and San Juan Rivers in response to the Gold King Mine spill.   The same amendment was accepted by the House last year on a  bipartisan basis. I thank both the chairman and the ranking member for  their work on this issue, and because monitoring now and well into the  future is necessary to protect the health of all those who rely on this  water, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
