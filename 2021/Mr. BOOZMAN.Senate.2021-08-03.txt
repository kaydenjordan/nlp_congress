 Madam President, I rise today to recognize  Garrett Lewis who is saying goodbye as chief meteorologist at KFSM  after a remarkable 20-year career dedicated to keeping Arkansans safe  and providing dependable, reliable, and accurate weather forecasts.   As part of the meteorology team at KFSM, Garrett used his experience  and expertise to provide the people of Arkansas and Oklahoma with  crucial information regarding the weather and dangerous conditions  including tornadoes, flooding, and ice storms. His efforts helped  countless Arkansans and made him a trusted household name.   Garrett was born and raised in Alma, AR, where he developed his  passion and appreciation for the weather. It is no surprise that after  earning his bachelor's degree from Mississippi State University,  Garrett returned to his roots in Arkansas to serve the community. He  quickly rose to success at KFSM. While maintaining a busy schedule, he  also found time to earn a master's degree in applied meteorology.   Garrett's work has been recognized and celebrated by his peers with  both the National Weather Association Seal of Approval and the American  Meteorological Society Seal of Approval. The Arkansas Associated Press  also acknowledged the quality of his work, including with its award for  ``Best Weathercast'' numerous times.   He has a warm heart and deeply cares about the people in western  Arkansas, something he exhibited during each newscast and with viewers  he interacted with every day. That extends beyond his weather role. He  is a strong champion for the welfare of children, having taken a vested  interest in preventing their abuse and supporting efforts to treat  those who experience it through his service on the boards of the Benton  County Children's Advocacy Center and Children's Advocacy Centers of  Arkansas. His efforts have led to positive change and tougher laws to  protect children from predators.   Garrett has dedicated 20 years of his life to serving the people of  Arkansas while being a loving father and devoted husband. I know his  wife Ashley and his children Graham and Ellis are very proud of him and  are looking forward to spending more time together.   I applaud Garrett for his outstanding leadership and accomplished  career which has been marked by service. We will miss watching him on  TV with his sleeves rolled up as dangerous weather approaches, but we  can be confident he will apply the same drive and skill to whatever  endeavors he pursues in the future. I join many Arkansans in  anticipating this chapter in his life and career and wish him all the  best as it begins.                            ____________________
