 Mr. President, today, I wish to recognize and honor the  extraordinary service of retired U.S. Army COL Roger Peterman, a  Greenwood, IN, resident and dedicated veteran and public servant who  served his country with honor.   In 1967, Roger Peterman enlisted in the Army National Guard. He  served in the field artillery in both enlisted and officer positions.  He eventually moved through the ranks and rose to command two artillery  batteries, an artillery battalion, the 38th Division Artillery, and  held numerous staff assignments before retiring in March 2000.   Colonel Peterman's Army service was one of distinction, as evidenced  by his numerous awards and decorations, including the Legion of Merit;  Meritorious Service Medal with two oakleaf clusters; Army Commendation;  Army Achievement Medal; and the Army Reserve Component Achievement  Medal with a silver oakleaf cluster and two bronze oakleaf clusters. In  2012, he was presented the Office of the Secretary of Defense Medal,  and in 2014, the National Guard Association of the United States  awarded him the Distinguished Service Medal. In addition, Colonel  Peterman was recognized with the Ancient Order of Saint Barbara Medal  by the U.S. Field Artillery Association.   Colonel Peterman has distinguished himself beyond his military  service. The transition from the military to civilian life can be a  difficult one for our veterans. We are grateful for Roger's post- military service mission to help veterans and military families through  that transition with his work as a transition assistance adviser with  the Indiana National Guard. Roger is also chairman of the Board for  Operation: Job Ready Veterans, which aims to prepare our veterans for  success in civilian employment; the Indianapolis Veterans Court  Advisory Board; the Indiana National Guard Relief Fund; the American  Legion; and AMVETS. Roger also serves on the board of directors for the  Indiana chapter of the Association of the United States Army and is on  the executive board of Indiana Blue Star. As Roger enters his  ``second'' retirement, we thank him for his dedication and service to  helping Indiana's veterans.   Colonel Peterman's life has set an example not just for his two  children and six grandchildren but for all Hoosiers. His commitment to  defending our country and supporting our veterans is commendable. His  integrity and tireless efforts have helped to make Indiana and this  country a better place to live, work, and raise a family. We thank  Roger's wife Carolyn, children, and grandchildren for sharing him with  our country. We wish Roger well in retirement.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today, I wish to recognize Eden  Elementary School of Greenfield, IN, for being named a 2017 National  Blue Ribbon School by the U.S. Department of Education.   Established in 1982, the National Blue Ribbon Schools Program  recognizes schools that have demonstrated a vision of educational  excellence for all students, regardless of their social or economic  background. Since its inception, this program has allowed schools in  every State to gain recognition for educational accomplishments,  particularly in closing the achievement gaps among students.   Eden Elementary School has continually distinguished itself as a top- performing school in Indiana. For the last 4 years, Eden Elementary has  been named a Four Star School and named an A-rated school by the  Indiana Department of Education for 6 consecutive years.   Eden Elementary attributes much of its success to its effective  implementation of the professional learning community model. Teachers  are encouraged to focus on higher order thinking, integrating  technology, and collaboration with math and reading instructional  coaches. This model also allows teachers to work on targeted areas to  improve an individual student's performance, which is contributing to  the academic success of students. In addition, this interactive model  enables teachers to share resources and ask questions to ensure the  curriculum is being met across grade levels.   Beyond strong academics, Eden Elementary also prides itself on its  character education program. This starts with Eden's Eagle  Expectations--three rules: students should be respectful, responsible,  and ready to learn. The school also promotes healthy habits by  instilling in students the importance of considering the needs of  others, listening first, and working together.   I am proud to recognize previous Eden Elementary School principal  Devon Marine and current principal Melia Hammons, the entire staff, the  student body, and their families. The effort and dedication you put  into the education of these young people have led not only to this  prestigious recognition but will benefit you and the Greenfield  community well into the future.   On behalf of the citizens of Indiana, I congratulate Eden Elementary,  and I wish the students and staff continued success in the future.                            ____________________
