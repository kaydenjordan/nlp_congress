 Madam Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the  tremendous achievement of the Atlanta Braves and wish them good luck in  their first World Series since 1999.   The story of the 2021 Braves is one of resiliency. The team lost two  of their stars--Ronald Acuna, Jr., and Mike Soroka--to injuries early  this season.   Despite these setbacks, the Braves persevered and won the National  League's Eastern Division title for the fourth year in a row.   The Braves have been underdogs in each of their playoff series, but  thanks to big performances by players such as Eddie Rosario, whose 14  hits against the Dodgers tied the record for the most hits in a single  series, tonight, they will take the field to compete in the World  Series.   Many of the players on the Braves' roster honed their skills in  Georgia's Seventh District, playing for the Gwinnett Stripers, the  Braves' Triple-A affiliate in Lawrenceville.   The 2021 Atlanta Braves embody the never-quit spirit of the State of  Georgia, and I wish them good luck as they begin the World Series  tonight.   My family, staff, and people of Seventh District are cheering you on.  Go Braves.                            ____________________
