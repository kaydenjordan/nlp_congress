 Mr. Speaker, today, we write a bold new chapter in our  history by passing the Inflation Reduction Act, which will  substantially lower the cost of living for San Diegans and all  Americans.   We are turning our climate ambition into climate action by  establishing a methane fee to reduce harmful emissions, creating a  clean energy technology bank, and funding wildfire resiliency efforts  and clean energy infrastructure.   Together, these investments will cut our greenhouse gas emissions by  40 percent by 2030 and create 1.5 million good-paying jobs.   This legislation is also the largest downpayment in deficit reduction  since I have served in Congress. Importantly, the drug pricing reform  framework I helped author will help seniors at the drug counter and  protect private-sector innovation, and it has earned enough votes to  pass the Senate.  [[Page H7649]]    The Inflation Reduction Act is a historic measure. After months of  negotiations and hard work, let's finally get this done. Vote ``yes.''
