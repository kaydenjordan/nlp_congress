 HORN of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, this week, we celebrate  one of the most remarkable moments in human history: The launch of the  Apollo 11 lunar mission, and the first steps on the Moon by American  astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. American leadership,  ingenuity, and investment made this moment possible 50 years ago.   As the Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee chairwoman, I am honored to  be joined by my colleagues today to recognize this achievement and talk  about what it means, 50 years later. As we commemorate this historic  accomplishment, it is clear that we stand on the shoulders of space  pioneers, some of whom are still with us today.   Apollo 11 and Armstrong's first steps on the lunar surface were the  culmination of a focused, methodical buildup of the developments,  demonstrations, and operational capabilities needed to achieve the Moon  landing.   The value of the Apollo program is beyond measure. Its mission  inspired and continues to draw countless Americans into science,  technology, engineering and math. This program led to significant  technological advances and products that changed the world as we know  it and benefit our lives today.   Fundamentally, the success of Apollo contributed to our standing in  the world. Apollo taught us the value of taking audacious, and yet  intentional risks.   I would like to focus, as well, for a moment, on the mission that  immediately preceded the Moon landing, Apollo 10. This mission,  launched 2 months before, was launched to test all of the components  and procedures just short of landing. Carrying the lunar module, it  came as close as 50,000 feet from the lunar surface before returning  safely to Earth.   Retired Air Force General Thomas P. Stafford, an Oklahoman, commanded  this essential mission that enabled us to land on the Moon.   General Stafford was born in Weatherford, Oklahoma, and received a  Bachelor of Science degree from the United States Naval Academy in  1952, graduating with honors. Commissioned as a second lieutenant in  the Air Force, he completed advanced interceptor training and served  tours of duty flying F-86Ds. He then graduated from the U.S. Air Force  Test Pilot School as the outstanding graduate.   Throughout his career, Stafford flew more than 100 different types of  aircraft as he pushed the boundaries of achievement in air and space.  Stafford was selected as an astronaut in 1962 and, 3 years later, flew  on Gemini 6 as the first space rendezvous mission, followed by Gemini  9.   Later, General Stafford commanded the first international space  flight mission, Apollo-Soyuz. This peaceful cooperation between two  Cold War rivals was the first step in what has become a sustained  relationship between the U.S., Russia, and our international partners  with the International Space Station.   The last of the Apollo missions, its lasting impacts, reminds us that  even in times of warfare and global distress, that space exploration is  a unifying force of discovery, peace, cooperation, and diplomacy.   Beyond all his accomplishments, General Stafford has also become a  friend and mentor. To General Stafford, and all of those who  contributed to the success of Apollo, you inspired a generation and  showed the world what is possible when our Nation comes together to  focus on an ambitious goal and, in turn, change the world in both  foreseeable and unforeseeable ways.                            ____________________     HORN of Oklahoma:        H.R. 3792.
