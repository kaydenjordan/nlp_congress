 Mr. Speaker, the Second Amendment to the Constitution of  the United States reads: `` . . . the right of the people to keep and  bear arms shall not be infringed.''   That right is a fundamental freedom guaranteed by our Bill of Rights.  That is why I am proud to cosponsor the Concealed Carry Reciprocity  Act, which protects the Second Amendment rights of all Americans.   This legislation says that if you are qualified to carry a gun in  your own State, then you can carry a gun in any State that has a  similar law. This bill will eliminate significant obstacles to the  right to keep and bear arms for millions of Americans in every State.   Hoosiers get it. Law-abiding gun owners have a right to defend  themselves, and that right should not end at the State line. I urge  support for this legislation and I ask my colleagues to join me in  doing more to uphold our Second Amendment rights.                            ____________________
