 Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss the urgency of  reauthorizing the farm bill. This is my 23rd speech about the  importance of this legislation going back a year and a half. American  consumers deserve the strongest possible farm bill as do the American  farmers, ranchers, and producers who face endless hurdles as they work  tirelessly to feed, fuel, and clothe the world.   Mother Nature is a fickle business partner, markets fluctuate, and  overly burdensome Federal regulations only make things more difficult.  We are seeing drought, high interest rates, and high input costs wreak  havoc on the American family farm. And the farm bill is our chance to  protect the future of American food and agriculture.   I said all along that my top priorities for the farm bill in order  are: one to strengthen and maintain crop insurance; two, to promote  trade; and three conduct rigorous oversight of the executive branch.  This farm bill must invest powerfully in research innovation if America  is going to remain the undisputed world leader in food science  technology. Producers are working tirelessly. We need to work just as  hard to pass something as soon as possible to ensure the strongest  safety net possible for farmers, ranchers, and agricultural producers  across Kansas and the country.                            ____________________
