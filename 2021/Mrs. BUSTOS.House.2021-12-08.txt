 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and celebrate the  life of Lieutenant Garrett Ramos of Sterling, Illinois. Thirty-eight- year-old Lieutenant Ramos served the Sterling Fire Department for a  decade before losing his life late last week.   Late Friday night in Rock Falls, Illinois, Lieutenant Ramos responded  to a call for help. As he was bravely fighting a house fire, the floor  collapsed beneath him. But while Lieutenant Ramos' life was cut short,  his memory will live on.   Described as an amazing individual of the highest caliber on and off  duty, Lieutenant Ramos carried on his family's legacy of service when  he became a firefighter, just like his father.   Lieutenant Garrett Ramos was a good man, a good firefighter, a good  friend, and a good Cubs fan. But above all else, he was a son, a  husband, and a father to two little children who will dearly miss him.   He was a true hero to the community he served. The community is asked  to put a red light on their porch in honor of Lieutenant Garrett Ramos.   My deepest condolences to his loved ones. May they be comforted by  his memory.                            ____________________
