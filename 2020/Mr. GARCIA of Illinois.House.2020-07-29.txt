 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Water  Resources Development Act of 2020 and commend the leadership of  Chairman DeFazio and Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment  Chair Napolitano.   I hail from Chicago and the Nation's Gold Coast along Lake Michigan,  and we know how important a healthy Great Lakes system is. Lake  Michigan is not only Chicago's primary drinking water source, it is  part of the largest freshwater source in the world--our beloved Great  Lakes.   Lake Michigan is a tremendous recreational resource and economic  asset, and it needs to be protected. This legislation authorizes  projects important to my constituents.   First, the Brandon Road Lock and Dam project must be completed to  prevent Asian carp, an invasive species, from migrating into Lake  Michigan.   We must also restore Bubbly Creek, a degraded waterway that was  polluted by Chicago's meatpacking industry in the early 1900s and made  famous by Upton Sinclair's ``The Jungle.'' Restoring the waterway will  create a healthy ecosystem and benefit neighborhoods like McKinley  Park, Bridgeport, and Pilsen.   Managing storm water systems can be challenging in Chicago because it  is heavily urbanized. This bill promotes more natural infrastructure  and studies for Chicago area rivers and the Great Lakes river basins to  make sure future projects preserve our drinking water, protect people's  homes and businesses from flooding, and restore our environment so that  all communities benefit from our rivers and Great Lakes.   I am proud of the bipartisan effort developing and passing this  legislation through the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.  [[Page H3956]]    I also want to give a shout-out to my incredible Brookings  Institution fellow, Christine Gallagher, who has done tremendous work  for my office on transportation and water issues. This is her last week  before she returns to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration, and I congratulate her.
