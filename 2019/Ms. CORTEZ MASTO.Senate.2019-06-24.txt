 Mr. President, I come forward today to  recognize the 100th anniversary of one of northern Nevada's most  treasured traditions, the Reno Rodeo. A celebration of Western culture  and daring, the rodeo has grown into a Nevada institution that draws  visitors from across the country. Over the past 100 years, Northern  Nevada has seen a constant state of change and evolution. Yet,  throughout that time, the Reno Rodeo has been a reliable and steady  source of entertainment and community.   In 1919, the Commercial Club of Reno devised the first iteration of  the Reno Rodeo, then the Nevada Round-Up, in order to celebrate the end  of World War I. Cowboys such as Hippy Burmister and Curly Howe won  events in the 1919 rodeo. The most notable winner of the first Reno  Rodeo was Jesse Stahl, one of the first African-American professional  bronc riders. Stahl was known for his ability to ride bucking horses  while sitting backwards and ``winning first but placing third'' due to  the color of his skin. Stahl went on to win four events over the first  3 years of the Reno Rodeo.   Despite only 6 weeks of event planning, the inaugural rodeo was a  wildly popular event, and there was immediate interest in establishing  the rodeo as an annual celebration. Nearly 17,000 people attended the  following year, and the rodeo proved it was not a fleeting success. In  1922, rodeo organizers plotted a publicity strategy around sending  reigning rodeo queen, Mary Harrington, to invite President Warren G.  Harding to the event. President Harding declined the invitation. To  make matters worse, the campaign led to the organization's bankruptcy  and a 10-year hiatus of the rodeo. In 1932, Charles Sadleir, now  frequently referred to as the Father of the Reno Rodeo, led an effort  to revive the event. To stabilize the rodeo's finances, Sadleir  recruited local businesses to help underwrite the events' expenses,  which is still a crucial mechanism today.   Fortunately, Sadleir's revitalization efforts were successful, and  the Reno Rodeo has withstood economic downturns, event growing pains,  and a fire to the venue. Today, the Reno Rodeo is a Professional Rodeo  Cowboys Association-sanctioned competition, billed as the ``Wildest,  Richest Rodeo in the West!'' Each year, the rodeo generates roughly $42  million for the region and draws over 14,000 fans. Through its  charitable foundation, the rodeo has provided hundreds of thousands of  dollars in academic scholarships to Nevada students and grants to non- profit organizations. In 2008, the foundation built a horseback riding  facility for children with special, physical, or mental needs, and  later built an activities center for abused, neglected, and at-risk  children under the care of Washoe County.   One hundred years after the first event, Northern Nevada's support  and appreciation for the Reno Rodeo has never been stronger. Nevadans  are immensely proud of this homegrown tradition and excited to see its  evolution over the next 100 years. Thank you to everyone who has been  involved with the Reno Rodeo and allowed it to thrive today.  [[Page S4454]]                                ____________________
