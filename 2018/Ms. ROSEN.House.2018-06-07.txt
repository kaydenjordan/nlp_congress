 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of our amendment, which  would strike funding for the Yucca Mountain project.   Like the vast majority of Nevadans, I firmly oppose any attempt to  turn my State into the Nation's nuclear waste dump. Dumping nuclear  waste at Yucca Mountain wouldn't only endanger the health and safety of  my constituents, who live just 90 miles away in the Las Vegas Valley,  it would threaten millions of Americans in 44 States.   This ill-conceived plan would mean transporting tens of thousands of  metric tons of radioactive waste across this country. Those shipments  of hazardous material would travel on our highways and railways to  Nevada through over 329 congressional districts on a weekly basis for  more than 50 years.   Finally, reviving Yucca Mountain would jeopardize military testing  and training at our defense facilities.   Our amendment would strike $190 million for the licensing for this  administration's plan to turn Nevada into a dumping ground. That is the  bulk of the funding for this dangerous failure of a project. We  shouldn't waste another dime of taxpayer money on failed efforts to try  to send nuclear waste to Yucca Mountain.   It is time to move on from this reckless and costly project, so I  urge my colleagues to support our amendment to remove this licensing  funding and, instead, work with us on alternative solutions that  repurpose Yucca Mountain into something that can create jobs and keep  our families safe.
