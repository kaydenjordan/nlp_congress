 Mr. Speaker, anti-Semitism has reared its ugly head on our  [[Page H6066]]  very shores. It should be extinguished entirely.   Over the past few weeks, we have seen anti-Semitic demonstrations  take place across the country. Turn on the television, open a  newspaper, or go online and you will find a litany of examples. As  Rabbi Moshe Hauer mentioned in his testimony before the Subcommittee on  Higher Education and Workforce Development recently, the plague of  anti-Semitism has afflicted the United States.   Mr. Speaker, I agree with Rabbi Hauer's assessment, and it is  incumbent upon us all to stand with the Jewish community, push back on  anti-Semitism wherever and whenever it crops up, and rid our country of  this scourge.   Anti-Semitism has no place in any civil society, especially the  United States--not now, not ever. I include in the Record a letter of  November 14, 2023, from Rabbi Moshe Hauer.                                                 Orthodox Union,                                     New York, NY, November 14, 2023      Rabbi Moshe Hauer Testimony--House Education and the Workforce   Committee Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Development           ``Confronting the Scourge of Antisemitism on Campus''         Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, and Members of the       Subcommittee: My name is Rabbi Moshe Hauer. You have heard       and will hear individual stories of what life has been like       for Jewish students on America's university campuses. I would       like to share with you the bigger picture. While I come to       you today as the Executive Vice President of the Union of       Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, also known as the       Orthodox Union, the largest organization serving Orthodox       Jews in the world, in this testimony I hope to represent the       entire Jewish community, every Jew and every Jewish student       on a university campus. Across the entire Jewish communal and       religious spectrum, my colleagues and I work together daily       to address the plague of antisemitism that has struck us all,       a plague that is afflicting our beloved United States and       that is firmly centered in its institutions of higher       learning.        I want to share with this committee three points.        1. The Orthodox Union, along with Hillel, Chabad, and       others, directs significant resources and attention to our       future, to our youth and students. Each of us places full-      time educators on university campuses who seek to provide a       Jewish home for those students on campus, creating a place       where they can come to connect warmly to their faith       community, to celebrate the Sabbath and holidays, to       socialize, study, eat, and pray together with their religious       peers, and to be supported and guided by nurturing mentors.        Today, this entire community is in crisis. Jewish students       on campus no longer need a home; they need a fortress.       Religious educators who have dedicated their lives to       providing students with warmth, nurturing, and a stronger       Jewish identity find themselves thrust into the role of       trauma counselors and security advocates, even as they       experience their own trauma and fear. On too many campuses,       everywhere they go the students and their mentors encounter       protests, chants, and signs that express the goals of       eliminating the world's one Jewish state and killing Jews and       that baselessly accuse Jews of unspeakable crimes. These       messages of hate and intimidation come from students and from       professors, and they are tolerated if not encouraged by many       university administrators.        Decades ago, Jews were not admitted to these universities.       Now they let us in and expose us to hostility and       intimidation. Which situation is better?        Every person in this country should have access to the       resources that the federal government provides. Title VI of       the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination       based on shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics, applies       to all programs and activities supported by federal financial       assistance, including--of course--both public and private       universities. Those universities are tolerating and often       supporting faculty and student groups whose vocal and       virulent antisemitism create discriminatory environments       inhospitable to Jews.        The Jewish experience on campus is a case study in Title VI       non-compliance. This hearing you are holding today gives us       hope that the fundamental right to religious liberty       enshrined in the Bill of Rights will be honored and enforced       on these campuses.        2. This intimidation and hostility are experienced by every       Jewish student, Orthodox, Reform, or unaffiliated, whether       identifiably Jewish or not. The 17,000 non-Orthodox teens       that we serve in American public schools through our Jewish       Student Union clubs experience it as well, as the plague of       brazen and appalling antisemitism has spread from higher       education to public middle and high schools. It is, however,       important to highlight for a moment the specific experience       of Orthodox students on campus.        The Orthodox Jewish students on close to 100 campuses.       Orthodox Jews are usually very visibly Jewish, identifiable       by religious symbols and recognizable modes of dress, and       have not surprisingly been the victims of a significant share       of the antisemitic hate crimes. This makes life very       difficult in the university environment where the term       ``Jew'' is an epithet, where anger and hate are a constant,       and where protection and support from the administration are       absent. Our kids cannot circulate anonymously on campus and       cannot go undercover by tucking the star of David necklace       into the shirt or by removing the kippah. Their strictly       kosher diet and their desire to practice their faith mean       that if they want to eat or pray--which they do daily--thev       need to go to the center for Jewish life on campus. The       Orthodox Jewish student on campus is a walking billboard: it       is me, the Jew, the one you harass, demonize, and intimidate.       I can neither run nor hide.        3. Finally, it is critical that you understand how what is       happening in our universities is being experienced by the       broader Jewish community. The Jewish people are the people of       the book, and that book teaches us both our values and our       story. We know our history, and it goes like this: For more       than three thousand years we have lived in a great many       places, where we thrived and contributed to the host country,       and then we had to leave. Sometimes we were expelled by laws       and sometimes by fear, by the sheer danger of the hate       that grew towards us. That is our story. We always end up       having to leave.        We all believed that the United States was different.        The current tsunami of antisemitism that has surged in the       United States and that is centered in its universities has       shaken us. And now, as of October 7th, I do not know if there       is a Jew that has not said to themselves, ``here we go       again.''        We never imagined it. Five years ago, one year ago, if       someone would tell you or me that we would be sitting in this       room discussing this kind of open, blatant, and vile       antisemitism in the United States of America, we would have       thought they were crazy. America is different. America was       supposed to be different. We were sure that this land of       liberty and civil rights would be the exception to the rule.       Jews would never be chased from here, neither by law nor by       fear. That is what we thought.        We are less convinced of that now. We are shaken, we are       doubting, and we are wondering, ``here we go again.'' We are       worried for the present, for the safety of our kids on       campus. And we are worried for our future in this country       and--quite frankly--for the future of a country whose       institutions of ``higher learning'' appear utterly incapable       of teaching basic values, right from wrong.        You are our elected leaders.        It is in your hands to restore our faith that America will       be the exception to the rule of our history.        It is in your hands to clarify that the true blessing of       free speech does not include speakers who ``direct a threat       to a person or group of persons with the intent of placing       the victim in fear of bodily harm or death.''        It is in your hands to ensure that Title VI is respected       and enforced, as those same hateful words that may be chanted       in our streets may not be part of the government funded       environments of our educational institutions that have       tragically become discriminatory environments inhospitable to       Jews.        It is in your hands to take a step back and to consider the       big and frightening picture of what this country is starting       to look like. For us in the Jewish community, America is       feeling a lot less free and a lot less safe. We need you to       restore our sense of freedom and safety in this blessed land.        Thank you for your attention today and for your actions       tomorrow and in the future.                                                 Rabbi Moshe Hauer,      Executive Vice President, Orthodox Union.                            ____________________
