 Madam Speaker, I support this legislation. I am  concerned, however, that the banks are focused on big small businesses  and have ignored the smaller small businesses seeking $100,000 or less.   I am asking my colleagues to send a clear message to the banks and to  Secretary Mnuchin: We will be watching. We need you to fight for the  little guys.   There are a lot of good things in this bill, including something we  in New York have pushed for: money for hospitals based on the rate of  infection. But we need more.   My three counties are in the top five in the Nation in confirmed  cases. New York has over 30 percent of the cases and 30 percent of the  deaths. Previously, this administration gave New York hospitals less  money than Texas, which has only 3 percent of the cases. How does that  make sense?   Now Senator McConnell is saying let's bankrupt our hardest hit States  and local governments.   Madam Speaker, my State subsidizes Senator McConnell's State and has  for decades. The grim reaper is telling my State and others to drop  dead.   Well, I have a message for you: We are going to fight you. Most  Democrats and Republicans have put aside ideological differences for  the common  [[Page H1932]]  good. We must continue to fight for New York, for my district, and for  the little guy.
