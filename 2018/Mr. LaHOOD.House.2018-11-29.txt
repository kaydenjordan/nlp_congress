 Mr. Speaker, on April 27, 2017, U.S. Army Sergeant Joshua  Rodgers gave the ultimate sacrifice for our country during a raid on an  ISIS headquarters in eastern Afghanistan.   Despite being just 22 years old, Sergeant Rodgers, a member of the  U.S. Army Rangers Special Operations unit, had quickly become a  decorated hero, earning numerous awards and medals, including the  Bronze Star with Valor and Purple Heart.  [[Page H9703]]    Today, the House will consider my legislation renaming a post office  in the name of Sergeant Rodgers. With this legislation, we worked  closely with the U.S. Postal Service; local State Representative Dan  Brady; and Joshua's mother, Vonda Coulter Rodgers. This is a way to pay  tribute to Sergeant Rodgers by renaming the post office in his hometown  of Bloomington-Normal, Illinois.   This legislation has the backing and bipartisan support of the entire  Illinois delegation. We hope that the renaming of this post office will  forever remind the Bloomington-Normal community of their hometown hero  and Joshua's commitment to serving our country.   While we can never fully repay Sergeant Rodgers and his family for  the sacrifices he made, renaming the post office in his honor is a  small way to thank him for his service and dedication to protecting  America, the greatest country in the world.                            ____________________
