 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the esteemed gentleman  from Texas very much.   Mr. Speaker, this break business' backs bill is the latest iteration  of an upside-down--in fact, inverted--economic agenda, ignoring today's  problems and doubling down on what we see are failed policies.    What is in this partisan reconciliation bill says more about  Democrat's Big Government agenda than people's actual needs, and it  will exacerbate challenges currently facing working families and small  businesses. It is an $80,000 tax break for wealthy individuals and $400  billion tax hike on small businesses, with a total of $800 billion in  new taxes. That is a fact.   It subsidizes green energy but it has a new tax on natural gas,  making heating your home more expensive. That is a fact.   It disincentivizes work with new unaccountable entitlements while  business owners are desperate to fill nearly 10 million jobs. It will  increase costs on domestic businesses and manufacturers and make  products overseas more attractive. And it is big spending that everyone  agrees is not paid for; will increase debt to somewhere in the  neighborhood of--I don't know, what is the debt ceiling request going  to be?--$34-, $35-, $36 trillion on something that was said was going  to cost zero? Decrease GDP, reduces wage growth, and drives inflation  higher. We need to make our country better not make government bigger.
