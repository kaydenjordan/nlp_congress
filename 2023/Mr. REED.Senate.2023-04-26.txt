 Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, for the Committee on Armed Services I report  favorably the following nomination lists which were printed in the  RECORDS on the dates indicated, and ask unanimous consent, to save the  expense of reprinting on the Executive Calendar that these nominations  lie at the Secretary's desk for the information of Senators.    Madam President, literacy opens the door for lifelong  opportunity and economic success. But in the aftermath of the COVID-19  pandemic, we have a lot of work to do to help kids catch up. The  National Assessment of Education Progress results show the terrible  toll the pandemic has taken on students' literacy skills. Reading  scores for 9-year-olds dropped by five points, the steepest decline  since 1990. We need urgent action to ensure that all children have the  means and the right to read. That is why I am pleased to join  Congressman Raul Grijalva in introducing the Right to Read Act.   The Right to Read Act will require States and school districts to  have policies protecting the right to read, which includes access to  evidence-based reading instruction, access to effective school  libraries, access to developmentally and linguistically appropriate  materials, reading materials at home, family literacy support, and the  freedom to choose reading materials.   The Right to Read Act will ensure that low-income, minority children,  English learners, and students with disabilities are not  disproportionately enrolled in schools that lack effective school  libraries. This is a matter of equity. Data show that school libraries  make a big difference in giving kids the skills and inspiration to  become proficient and enthusiastic readers. Students who utilize school  libraries have 73 percent higher literacy rates than students who do  not, and the positive impact of effective school libraries is highest  for marginalized groups, including students experiencing poverty,  students of color, and students with disabilities. But not every  student has access to library services. The U.S. Department of  Education reports that 2.5 million students are enrolled in districts  where there are no school libraries. An estimated 1 out of 10 schools  in America does not have a school library, and 30 percent higher of  U.S. public schools do not have full-time librarians. Students  experiencing the highest levels of poverty are 30 percent more likely  to attend a school without a school library.   While school libraries are most effective when they offer resources  that resonate, engage, and empower students and that align with their  First Amendment rights, a recent PEN America report found that 182  school districts across 37 States are facing bans on books that  disproportionately limit access to titles with LGBTQ+ characters and  characters of color. Last month, the American Library Association  reported a record number of attempted book bans in 2022, nearly  doubling the 2021 total.   The Right to Read Act will address the disparities in access to  school library resources. It supports the development of effective  school libraries, including the recruitment, retention, and  professional development of State-certified school librarians. It will  also increase the Federal investment in literacy by reauthorizing  comprehensive literacy State development grants at $500 million and the  Innovative Approaches to Literacy Program at $100 million, targeting  critical literacy resources in high-need communities. Importantly, the  bill protects access to quality reading materials and provides the  resources needed to create a foundation for learning and student  success.   In developing this legislation, Congressman Grijalva and I worked  closely with the library community, including the American Library  Association and the American Association of School Librarians. We are  also pleased to have the support of the American Federation of  Teachers, the National Education Association, the National Council of  Teachers of English, and PEN America. These are the experts in helping  kids become lifelong readers and learners. I appreciate their insight  and assistance on this bill, and I urge my colleagues to join us in  cosponsoring this legislation to ensure that all students have a right  to read.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Ms. Smith, Ms. Duckworth, Mr.          Heinrich, Mr. Murphy, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Blumenthal, Ms. Rosen, Mr.          Lujan, Mr. Casey, Ms. Stabenow, Ms. Baldwin, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr.          Merkley, Mr. Booker, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Sanders,          Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Markey, and Ms. Warren):   S. 1310. A bill to designate as wilderness certain Federal portions  of the red rock canyons of the Colorado Plateau and the Great Basin  Deserts in the State of Utah for the benefit of present and future  generations of people in the United States; to the Committee on Energy  and Natural Resources.    Madam President, I am joined by Senator Van Hollen in  introducing the Consumer Credit Control Act, which gives consumers  greater control over when and how their consumer reports are shared by  consumer reporting agencies.   Our current consumer reporting system is backwards. Consumer  reporting agencies collect massive amounts of personal information on  consumers, often without their knowledge, in order to compile consumer  reports. These reports are then shared with financial institutions and  others, often without consent.   Following Equifax's failure several years ago to secure valuable  personally identifiable information it collected on approximately 147  million Americans, it remains clear that this system needs to change.  Indeed, the National Consumer Law Center's Chi Chi Wu stated in  testimony before the House Financial Services Committee that the  Equifax breach ``means half of the US population and nearly three- quarters of the consumers with active credit reports are now at risk of  identity theft due to one of the worst--if not the worst--breaches of  consumer data in American history. These Americans are at risk of  having false new credit accounts, phony tax returns, and even spurious  medical bills incurred in their good names.'' To make matters worse,  the risks of identity fraud may only increase with time. As Ed  Mierzwinski, U.S. PIRG's Federal Consumer Program Director, explains  ``unlike credit card numbers, your Social Security Number and Date of  Birth don't change and may even grow more valuable over time, like gold  in a bank vault. Much worse, they are the keys to `new account identity  theft.' ''   The Consumer Credit Control Act aims to address these concerns and  fix the current upside down system. Our legislation, at no cost to the  consumer, seeks to give Americans greater control over when and how  their consumer reports are released when applying for new credit, a  loan, or insurance. It also requires consumer reporting agencies to  verify a consumer's identity and secure the consumer's permission  before releasing consumer reports in instances that are particularly  susceptible to identity theft and fraud. Additionally, our legislation  requires every consumer reporting agency to take appropriate steps to  prevent unauthorized access to the consumer reports and personal  information they maintain.   These changes are intended to make it tougher for criminals to open  new fraudulent credit or insurance accounts in other people's names.  They will also dramatically cut down on so-called ``trigger leads,''  where the credit reporting bureaus sell the fact that a consumer is  shopping for a mortgage to other lenders. That causes prospective  homebuyers to get inundated with hundreds of calls offering alternative  mortgages. The credit bureaus say that these ``trigger leads'' help  consumers by making sure they have access to the most attractive  financing, but in reality they are a nuisance and add unnecessary  stress to the already stressful process of buying a home.   I urge our colleagues to cosponsor the Consumer Credit Control Act,  and I thank Senator Van Hollen, the National Consumer Law Center, on  behalf of its low-income clients, U.S. PIRG, the Center for Digital  Democracy, Consumer Action, the Consumer Federation of America,  Consumer Reports, the National Association of Consumer Advocates, and  Public Citizen for their support.                            ____________________     Madam President, literacy opens the door for lifelong  opportunity and economic success.
