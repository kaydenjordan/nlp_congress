 Madam Speaker, I rise to honor a Vietnam veteran and  Clarence, New York, resident, Walter Buechi.   For most of his life, Walt has been dedicated to serving our country  and our community. In 1965, he answered the call to serve our Nation  and spent 18 months as a radio operator in Vietnam. However, his  service didn't stop when he made it back home.   Instead, he joined the Clarence Fire Department, where he continued  to exemplify the qualities that make him a hero in the truest sense. As  a firefighter, Walt put his life on the line once again. He has gone  above and beyond the call to serve, and we owe him a debt of gratitude  that can never fully be repaid.   Walt is facing his next battle as he has been diagnosed with stage IV  cancer. When we support veterans healthcare in this body, he is the  kind of hero that we are helping.   Madam Speaker, I ask our Nation to pray for Walt. We are grateful for  his remarkable contributions to our great Nation, to western New York,  and to the town of Clarence.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my great friend and colleague  from the Rules Committee, the gentlewoman from Indiana, for yielding  the time.   Madam Speaker, since January 2021, the Biden administration has been  laser focused on making the fantasy of the Green New Deal a reality for  Americans.   Earlier this year, the Securities and Exchange Commission proposed  the so-called Climate Disclosure Project, which would require an  entirely new level of burdensome, costly emissions reporting.   Now, who will this rule impact the most? Not big business, as my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle would like people to believe.  Instead, all of these new compliance costs, as with almost every new  rule and regulation imposed by this Biden administration, will be felt  mostly and most painfully by small business owners, farmers, and  independent manufacturers.   Let me be clear: This misguided rule will hurt hardworking Americans  and hinder economic growth at a time where we should be focused on  creating jobs and lowering inflation.   Madam Speaker, the bottom line is this: Main Street can't afford the  Biden economy. The American people can't afford it.   It hasn't stopped this administration from plowing ahead with even  more bans and phaseouts and regulations on everything from internal  combustion engines to gas stoves.   My district sees some of the coldest and harshest winters in the  country in a State that, thanks to Governor Kathy Hochul, is already  one step ahead of the Biden administration in eliminating natural gas  as an affordable and reliable source of clean energy.   We can't afford to allow this administration to take what climate  extremists in States like New York and California are doing and turn it  into a nationwide effort.   At a time when this world is on fire and the rising cost of living is  unsustainable, the last thing President Biden should be worried about  is banning gas stoves, nickel-and-diming small businesses for  emissions, and mobilizing a new IRS and a whole lot more agents to  target hardworking families and small businesses.   I urge my colleagues to pass H.R. 4664 and protect American families,  farmers, and small businesses from this administration's reckless  agenda.
