 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the remarkable  life led by my friend and former pastor, Dr. Wyman Copass.   Wyman passed away on Friday, October 4, having lived an extraordinary  life of 80 years. Wyman will live on in the memories of all who have  had the privilege to know him.   For me, his influence lives on in the memory of his role in my  salvation. As a graduate of Campbellsville University and Luther Rice  Seminary, Dr. Copass oversaw a ministry spanning not only the  Commonwealth of Kentucky, but also the breadth of the Nation.   While he enjoyed golfing, cooking, and gardening, his greatest  passion was his family, whose love and devotion he cherished and  returned in kind. His wife of 62 years, Glenda; his daughter, Susan;  and his son, Chris; as well as his five grandchildren undoubtedly  consider themselves lucky to have had such an emblematic figure in  their lives, just as I do.   Dr. Wyman Copass was a force for good in the First Congressional  District of Kentucky, and his example and vision will be missed.                            ____________________
