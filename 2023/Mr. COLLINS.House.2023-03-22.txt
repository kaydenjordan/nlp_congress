 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to defend our community banks.  For decades, we have had leftwing, out-of-control Federal  administrations that have been hammering on our community banks to put  them out of business. You take Sarbanes-Oxley, Dodd-Frank, or the  Federal agencies who have been regulating and regulating these small  community banks to the point where they either have to sell, close up,  or worst, being taken over.   You see, these community banks, they are the lifeblood of small  businesses, and small businesses, they are the backbone to this  economy.   These community banks, they are a part of our community. They are out  there in your civic and social organizations leading. Their kids go to  school with your kids. They are out there on the ball fields helping  coach. They are even going to church with you on Sunday.   You see, they have a vital interest in seeing the community succeed.  That way they succeed. Yet, now we have this extra-woke, leftwing  administration that has decided to pick winners and losers and take a  different tactic.   The tactic they are taking now is to try to scare the consumer to  where they will take their deposits from the community bank and move it  over to one of the big banks, to where they can achieve that Big  Government, be all, end all for every need and everything you ever  need, and that is not America.   As a matter of fact, Mr. Speaker, I wouldn't be standing here, and I  wouldn't be where I am today, if it weren't for my community bank.   So I have two things, Mr. Speaker: Federal Government get off the  backs of these community banks. Take your leftwing ideology somewhere  else.   To my fellow Americans out there: Continue to support your community  bank out there. Continue to do business with them.                            ____________________
