 Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to John G. Stewart,  who passed away in September at the age of 86 years.   John led an accomplished public service career, Mr. Speaker. It was  highlighted by his work on the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as an aide to  then-Senator Hubert Humphrey. When Humphrey became Vice President in  1965, John joined him in President Lyndon Johnson's administration.   John left Washington for Knoxville in 1980, continuing his career at  the Tennessee Valley Authority as an assistant general manager and vice  president for economic and community development. He retired from TVA  in 1994. John also founded the Georgian Institute of Public  Administration in the Republic of Georgia and served as a consultant on  NASA's Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel.   All who were close to John can attest that he cared about people in  an extraordinary way. For example, after the 2008 Kingston coal ash  spill, John and Nancy raised funds for workers whose health was  severely harmed during the cleanup effort.   John also fought for the people who couldn't fight for themselves and  looked out for the little guy. His generous spirit touched everyone in  his life, and he will be missed by all who knew him. John is survived  by his wife of 64 years, Nancy, and two children, Mike and Cara.   It is not in my notes, but on a personal note, John helped me when I  was in the State senate to abolish Tennessee's sales tax on food. He  will be missed.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Hern for that wonderful  and accurate introduction, and thank him for being my friend.   Madam Speaker, Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, and the far-left Democrats  are playing the American people for fools. They are claiming their  insane multi-trillion dollar agenda will cost nothing. Nothing.   Madam Speaker, our constituents are not stupid. They know nothing  Washington puts out is free, and they know  [[Page H5667]]  that the doggone Democrats want to tax them for this socialist scheme.   Earlier today, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office confirmed  Democrats are lying about the cost of Biden's agenda. The CBO found  that the healthcare provisions alone would increase the Federal deficit  by half a trillion dollars. Let me repeat that: Half a trillion  dollars.    It doesn't matter if the healthcare spending in this bill occurs over  1 year or over 10 years, we never should blow up the deficit like this.   On top of the actual healthcare costs, the CBO also revealed the  healthcare policies would force millions of Americans into one-size- fits-all government healthcare programs. Forget about keeping your  employer-sponsored plan or personalized care. Under progressive care,  as we like to call it in my office, Americans will get to rely on the  slow-moving Federal bureaucracy for meeting their healthcare needs.   Madam Speaker, Democrats have fought amongst each other for months  over this big government boondoggle. The American public now knows what  the Democrat-controlled Congress has been up to while our economy has  tanked. Instead of trying to jam through trillions of dollars on the  backs of American taxpayers, Democrats need to clean up this messy  economy. Crucial shipping ports along our coasts don't have enough  staff to maintain normal operating hours, creating a broken supply  chain.   I saw today where Florida, in fact, is in the market for that  prestigious market.   Some retail shelves have sat empty for weeks. Things have gotten so  bad there that there is talk that some goods will not be available for  the holiday season. Lacking supplies of certain goods have made the  inflation crisis President Biden started even worse.   Skyrocketing prices are a direct result of the blue State stimulus  package Democrats passed back in March, another bill that cost  trillions of dollars. Thanks to that legislation, too many folks are  getting paid more to stay at home instead of going to work, which is  contributing to our current supply chain woes.   Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, and this Democrat-controlled Congress are  guiding our economy straight into the ground. Time and time again,  Congress has proved that throwing money at the country's problems  always makes the situation worse. It already happened once this year.  It is time for Congress to abandon this big government socialism agenda  before it is too late to save our economy.   As I said at the beginning, our constituents are not stupid. They  know they are the ones who always pay, either through inflation or  taxes. Americans will not forget it was Democrats, driven by the far- left political agendas who destroyed this economy.
