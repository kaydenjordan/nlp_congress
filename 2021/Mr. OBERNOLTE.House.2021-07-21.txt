 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor my constituent, Mr.  Mohammad Hossein Mehrmand.   Mr. Mehrmand was a lieutenant general in the Imperial Iranian Air  Force.   Prior to the revolution in 1979, Iran and the United States were  close allies. U.S. fighter jets were based in Iran, and a number of  U.S. military personnel were as well. When the revolution occurred, the  U.S. Embassy recommended that all Americans immediately evacuate. Mr.  Mehrmand was instrumental in negotiating the evacuation of American  citizens from Iran, and ultimately, nearly 5,000 Americans were  successfully evacuated from the country.   Unfortunately, Mr. Mehrmand paid a very high price for that loyalty.  He was accused as a traitor. He lost his property. Ultimately, he was  forced to flee to the United States.   Today, Mr. Mehrmand is 92. He lives in my district in California, and  he is proud to be a United States citizen.   I join my colleagues in thanking Mr. Mehrmand for his service to the  people of the United States and his loyalty to the people with whom he  served.                            ____________________
