 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to celebrate  the 100th anniversary of the founding of the University of California,  Los Angeles.   UCLA's excellence is clear. With 13 Nobel laureates, 13 MacArthur  Fellows, 9 National Medal of Science winners, 3 Pulitzer Prize winners,  a Fields Medal, an A.M. Turing Award, UCLA's academic credentials are  rivaled by few.   And the UCLA Bruins have enjoyed 117 NCAA team championships and 261  Olympic medals over their 100-year history.   Alumni have gone on to make incredible strides in fields like rocket  science, film, and politics. It has been an incredible century for  UCLA.   In honor of UCLA's centennial, I would like to extend my sincerest  congratulations to Chancellor Block, UC President Janet Napolitano, and  UCLA students, faculty, and alumni.   I also want to recognize all the people in UCLA's history that  ensured the university could light the way for the next 100 years to  come. Go Bruins.                            ____________________
