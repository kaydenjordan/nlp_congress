 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize this Friday as the  10th annual National Clinicians HIV/AIDS Testing and Awareness Day.   It is a harsh reality that HIV/AIDS touches every community across  the country. Although we made great progress in treating the disease,  it is imperative to continue striving for prevention, effective  treatments, and a cure.   This is particularly important in my home State of New Jersey. In  2013 alone, over 2,000 adults and adolescents were diagnosed with HIV,  making New Jersey the sixth highest in the country of new diagnoses. In  ages 13 to 24, diagnoses have increased from 10 to 18 percent, and in  the African-American community, rates are above the national average.   We must remain vigilant to combat this epidemic that continues to  plague communities across our Nation, especially in light of the  continued efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and remove  insurance protections for millions. We must be vocal against all  efforts to take away the ability to receive adequate care and do our  part to fight HIV/AIDS. Encourage your loved ones to get tested.                            ____________________
