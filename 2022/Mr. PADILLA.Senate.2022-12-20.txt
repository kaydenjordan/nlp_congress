 Mr. President, I, too, want to thank Senator Feinstein  for her years of effort to get to this point. I am proud to stand today  and now celebrate the passage of H.R. 785, which will provide relief to  the Bueso family.   As you heard, the Buesos came to California 20 years ago from  Guatemala because their daughter Isabel had been diagnosed with a rare,  dangerous genetic disorder that can cause enlarged organs and skeletal  abnormalities.    Let me be clear. She was invited--that is right--invited to the  United States to participate in a clinical trial at that time by  doctors in the San Francisco Bay area to help find a treatment for this  condition. Thanks to her participation in this clinical trial, doctors  eventually identified and created an effective lifesaving treatment for  this disease, not just to help save her life, but others. So, yes, her  participation, the treatment that was developed, will save lives of  Americans.   To this day, Isabel Bueso depends on this drug, which is administered  to her at a hospital in Oakland, CA. But more than that, without this  treatment, which is not even available in Guatemala, doctors have said  that she cannot survive without it. Here at home in America, Isabel is  an inspiration to countless others. As you heard, she graduated summa  cum laude from California State University East Bay, where she didn't  just graduate with these honors, but she helped create a scholarship  for students with disabilities and is now active as an advocate for  immigrants and others with disabilities.   I was proud to cosponsor this bill because there are few options left  for this family to adjust their status. Isabel has renewed her medical- deferred action status every 2 years for the past 20. Her father  obtained H-1B status, but Isabel is now too old to be considered a  dependent who could then adjust to get a green card. That is a story  for another day.   We know the urgency with which we need to modernize our immigration  system, but this is a classic example of folks that are harmed by the  overdue modernization of our immigration system. Isabel and her family  have deserved better than to be stuck in this limbo for so long.   Colleagues, I am grateful for your support for this measure, which  was approved unanimously by the House of Representatives already. As we  are in the holiday season, all I can say is that I am grateful that the  U.S. Senate was able to pass this bill today.   Thank you, Senator Feinstein.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I rise today, alongside my colleague,  the senior Senator from Texas, to speak in support of our bipartisan  effort to continue to give States, local, Tribal, and territorial  governments the support they need as they continue to recover from the  COVID-19 pandemic.   While no corner of the United States was untouched by COVID, we also  know that every town and, frankly, every Tribe, every city, every  State, and every local community was impacted in a different way. As a  result, they have different, specific needs for that recovery.   Over the last 2 years, Congress has provided critical lifelines to  communities across the country that are trying to get through the  pandemic and begin to rebuild, but today, almost 3 years since the  start of the pandemic in the United States, there is still more we can  and should do to help tailor the Federal resources that we have  previously approved to better fit each local community and give them  the tools they need to address their most pressing local needs.    At its core, this bill is about flexibility and empowering local  governments that are closest to the people--flexibility for State and  local governments to use their fiscal recovery dollars as  strategically, as effectively, and as efficiently as possible;  flexibility for the Treasury Department to continue to implement  critical assistance for communities that need it; flexibility for  counties and Tribes that host our Nation's public lands.   As Senator Cornyn mentioned, this bill is the result of a long  bipartisan effort that has involved many of our colleagues on both  sides of the aisle, on both sides of the Capitol.   I particularly want to thank Senator Cornyn and his excellent staff  for their hard work as well. I thank Senator Tester, Senator Murkowski,  and others involved in getting us to this point. I urge my colleagues  to join us in supporting this measure.    Mr. President, I rise to introduce the PEACE Act.   This legislation recognizes the need to reform the standard for use  of force with Federal officers. In order to strengthen our criminal  justice system and reduce the risks posed to both law enforcement  officers and the public, we must reconsider when lethal force is  necessary.   This legislation would end the use of deadly force by Federal law  enforcement unless there are no other reasonable alternatives.   This legislation would also condition certain DOJ funding for States  on whether they enact legislation that establishes the same higher  standard of conduct for local law enforcement. The current  accountability structure for lethal force on the Federal level fails to  accurately ensure accountability when members of the public are killed.   A lack of accountability when members of the public are killed is a  breeding ground for illicit behavior. In recent years, it has been  continuously shown that Black people are more likely to experience  incidents involving excessive force when interacting with police.   Americans deserve better. We deserve a system that will encourage  deescalation tactics and hold bad actors accountable. This is too  urgent a need to go unaddressed.   Public safety is a two-way street. We trust law enforcement to  maintain order. In return, we expect officers to be held to account for  bad behavior. This bill is an important step to reducing unnecessary  losses of life and building trust between the public and law  enforcement.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass the PEACE Act as  quickly as possible.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to introduce the PEACE Act.
