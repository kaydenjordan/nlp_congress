 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I  demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the  ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a  quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Raymond  Lerma, a beloved husband, father, and leader in the community of  Corcoran, California. Ray passed away on January 11.   Among his many honored roles in life, Ray served 25 years as mayor  and councilman in Corcoran, California. He was a pillar of the  community.   Ray was born in El Paso, Texas, and raised in Corcoran in a large and  loving family that proudly farmed the crops of the Central Valley.  Encouraged by his parents to reach for higher education, Mr. Lerma  graduated from UC Berkeley. He was a proud Cal Bear.   After college, Ray returned to the community that raised him to build  his own family with his beloved wife, Lola. He touched countless lives  in his 38 years as an educator at Corcoran High.   After retirement, he kept changing lives, teaching English as a  second language to adult learners. Ray also served as a longtime board  member of the King's Community Action Organization, which helps to  bring resources to the Central Valley.   Ray once said he wanted to be remembered as someone who made a  difference in his community. I stand before you today to say he will  always be remembered for his dedication and contributions to his  community. We will miss his leadership.   Ray leaves behind his wife, Lola; their three children, Eva, Ramon,  and Pablo; as well as his grandchildren.   May he rest in peace.
