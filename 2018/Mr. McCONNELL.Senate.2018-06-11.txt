 Mr. President, later this afternoon, the Senate will  move to begin considering the John S. McCain 2019 National Defense  Authorization Act.   Our colleagues on the Armed Services Committee have spent months  engaged in thorough work and in bipartisan collaboration. Now the whole  Senate will take up their legislation and vote on a plan to deliver on  the most pressing needs of our Armed Forces.   Congress has passed Defense Authorization Acts for 57 consecutive  years--57 consecutive years. In doing so, we have taken steps to  fulfill one of our most fundamental constitutional responsibilities:  authorizing the funds that our men and women in uniform require to keep  us safe.   This year's NDAA arrives as our Nation faces significant challenges-- challenges like an emboldened Iranian regime and its continued support  of destabilizing forces in the Middle East and a new era of great power  competition as Russia and China expand their capabilities.   Building on a time-honored process, this year's Defense authorization  will help our Nation rise to meet these challenges with cutting-edge  tools, top-notch training, and revitalized readiness. It is one of our  most important jobs here in Congress. The 2019 Defense authorization is  the top item on our to-do list, and we will tackle it this week.                                Appropriations    Meanwhile, other important work is underway at the committee level.  Chairman Shelby and our colleagues on the Appropriations Committee are  laying the foundation for a productive summer. Last week, they reported  out appropriations bills to fund the Departments of Transportation,  Housing and Urban Development, and Veterans Affairs, as well as  important military construction projects. This week, they will proceed  to finalize measures for Interior and Environment, Commerce-Justice- Science, and the legislative branch. I look forward to taking up these  appropriations bills right out here on the Senate floor.                          Tax and Regulatory Reform    Now, on another matter, Mr. President, today marks another important  [[Page S3396]]  milestone in our efforts to cut back the forest of redtape the Obama  administration left behind. Effective today, thanks to the leadership  of Chairman Ajit Pai, the FCC has rolled back meddlesome and  unnecessary regulations that Democrats imposed on the internet back in  2015.   Let's put this whole effort into perspective. The Federal Register is  the government's legal newspaper. Among other documents, it prints the  regulations that Federal agencies enforce and the proposed rules on  deck. In 2016, under President Obama, it had to print nearly 39,000  pages of rules--an alltime high--and another 21,000 pages of proposed  rules. That is 39,000 pages of rules and 21,000 pages of proposed rules  in 2016. It is hard to wrap your mind around that--60,000 pages of  rules and proposed rules to pile on American workers and job creators.   We slashed those numbers in 2017. In that first year of our  Republican government, the total number of Federal Register pages  devoted to rules and proposed rules plummeted by more than 50 percent-- 50 percent less in 2017 than in 2016. That is a significant slowdown in  the Federal Government's redtape factory just in our first year. This  is part of what we were elected to do--get Washington, DC's, foot off  the brake and let hard-working Americans and small businesses spend  less and less time and energy hurdling obstacles put up by the Federal  Government.   The regulatory reform comes on top of the historic tax reform  legislation we passed last December. We overhauled our Nation's Tax  Code and rewrote it so that businesses can expand, invest, and create  jobs more easily and middle-class families can keep more of what they  earn. This 180-degree policy turnaround is helping the U.S. economy  rise to its highest heights in recent memory.   Today, thanks in large part to tax reform and regulatory reform, more  small businesses are saying that it is a better time to expand  operations than at any point in the last 44 years--44 years. More  businesses are saying that it is a better time to expand operations  than at any point in the last 44 years. That represents a 25- percentage-point leap in the number of Americans who say now is a good  time to find a quality job. We have 3.8-percent unemployment--the  lowest nationwide level in 18 years.   The real roots of this good news aren't here in Washington. The  Republicans understand that government does not create prosperity, but  public policy plays a big part in determining whether the wind is  blowing in the faces of the job creators or whether it is at their  backs. On that front, the results of this Republican-opportunity agenda  are literally speaking for themselves.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2700 on behalf  of Senator Toomey.    I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the  amendment be dispensed with.
