 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 182, which extends the  authorization of the Cape Cod National Seashore Advisory Commission  until 2028.   The Cape Cod National Seashore was established in 1961. It comprises  more than 40,000 acres on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. The enabling  legislation also provided for an advisory commission comprised of six  Cape Cod communities located within the seashore and the county to  consult with the Secretary of the Interior about the development of the  seashore. This is as it should be.   The Federal Government must be a good neighbor to the communities  that its lands impact, and consulting them as partners is a fundamental  point of this principle.   One of the unique aspects of this advisory commission is that the  Secretary of the Interior cannot issue commercial, industrial, or  recreational permits without the advice of the commission, as long as  action is taken in a timely manner.   In addition, the commission meets regularly with the park  superintendent to discuss specific seashore issues and to advise him  about seashore programs, facilities, and activities, providing valuable  local feedback to the national seashore. This feedback helps to promote  sound park management, improve public access, and it ensures that the  National Park Service is a good neighbor to its surrounding  communities.   This is a model of how the Federal Government's land managers should  be governed. My only regret is that its provisions don't apply to every  community affected by Federal landholdings. I cannot help but note that  the Federal Government owns just 1.2 percent of Massachusetts while  giving great deference to its local communities. Meanwhile, it owns 46  percent of my State of California and often gives local communities  impacted by its lands a dismissive brushoff, which is typical of the  experience of our Western States.   In fact, I take this opportunity to ask my colleagues from  Massachusetts to consider what would happen to their communities if the  Federal Government took over half of the land in their State, removed  it from the tax rolls, severely restricted any productive use of that  land, and then thumbed its nose at the concerns and complaints of local  communities.   Thankfully, this administration has taken a cooperative and  supportive position in recent years and has improved conditions  greatly, but that doesn't guarantee that future administrations won't  revert to the Washington-knows-best approach that has produced no end  of problems for the people of our Western States.   Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I ask for adoption of this measure,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  [[Page H9075]]    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 255, introduced by the gentleman from California  (Mr. Cook), authorizes a locally supported equal value land exchange  between the Forest Service and San Bernardino County. The county has  proposed to convey an inland parcel within the San Bernardino National  Forest to the Forest Service in exchange for land further north to be  conveyed by the county.   The land conveyed by the county will allow needed forest management  infrastructure to be located closer to the forest and promote road  safety by reducing the need to drive forest products down narrow,  winding roads.   H.R. 255 also authorizes cooperation between the county and the  Forest Service to relocate a portion of the Pacific Crest National  Scenic Trail, if needed, and requires that the trail relocation be  completed before the exchange is consummated.   This legislation is the result of a Congressman who has listened to  the voices of his community, an administration sympathetic to the  plight of our forest communities, and community members and their local  representatives putting forward a reasonable and workable plan that is  fair to all parties.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I share my colleague's high words of praise and warmth for our  colleague, Mr. Cook, the author of this measure, and I am also somewhat  annoyed with him for his decision to leave the Congress at the end of  this session for the county board of supervisors.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Cook).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I assure my friend, they are not sarcastic. He will be sorely missed  in this House.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this measure and urge my colleague to  change his mind and come back next session, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, as my friend said, this bill renames the Oyster Bay  National Wildlife Refuge in honor of Congressman Lester Wolff, former  Long Island-North Shore Congressman.   It is certainly appropriate to recognize and honor Congressman  Wolff's distinguished eight-term career representing the people of New  York by adding his name to the wildlife refuge that he fought so hard  to create.   This refuge has become a popular destination for many Americans to  enjoy the wildlife and beauty of our outdoor spaces, and, at 100 years  of age, Congressman Wolff has the distinction of being the oldest  living former Member of Congress.   Mr. Speaker, it is most fitting we honor a man so dedicated and who  has put so much of his life into fighting to protect and conserve this  place and fighting for his constituency. I urge adoption of the  measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask for adoption of the measure, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation is a bumper sticker bill that purports  to save the sharks, but in reality would damage shark fisheries,  destroy American jobs, and increase the threats to endangered species.   Let's first define what we agree on. Killing a shark solely to take  its fins is contemptible. It is immoral. Herman Melville called such  wanton waste blasphemous.   But let us be clear: This practice is already illegal under Federal  law. It has been that way since 1993. American fishermen are not the  villains in this story, they are the heroes who are adhering to  rigorous regulations that require them to account for the full use of  their catches.   So what does this bill do? It does exactly what it purports to abhor.  Proponents rightly denounce taking the fins and then throwing away the  carcass, so they have come up with a bill that would take the carcass  but throw away the fins. This bill makes it illegal to possess or  purchase a shark fin. The fins are 50 percent of the value of the  catch.   If you force shark fishermen to waste literally 50 percent of the  value of their catch, you remove their margin and destroy their  enterprise. And this does little to stop the illegal trade of shark  fins, since almost all of the demand is in east and Southeast Asia, and  that market will simply apply upward pressure on the illegal taking of  shark fins.   The responsible management of our U.S. fisheries and the exemplary  conduct of U.S. fishermen has resulted in a great success story. Since  2000, the domestic shark population has been growing. The index of  shark abundance in 2015 was the highest in its 29-year history.   Now, if you force fishermen to throw away 50 percent of the value of  each shark they catch, one of two things are going to happen. To stay  in business, they will have to take more and more sharks to make up for  their loss, or more likely for American fishermen, they will simply go  out of business.  [[Page H9078]]    If it is the latter, we can expect an out-of-control explosion in  shark populations with devastating consequences for endangered marine  species, like the right whale. And in either case, American fishermen  will suffer to the advantage of the unregulated illegal foreign fishing  fleets.   This is an example of two developments that we have had to watch on  the Natural Resources Committee since the Democrats took control.   The first is their tendency to cater to emotional pressure groups who  have been successful at raising large sums of money by tugging at the  heartstrings of gullible donors, but whose bromides end up doing  enormous harm to the very populations they purport to protect. Indeed,  the Wildlife Conservation Society recently submitted a letter warning  of this signed by 60 of our Nation's leading scientific experts in  shark science and fisheries.   The second is the tendency to blame Americans first for the excesses  and predations of bad foreign actors.    Time and again, American fishermen, American growers, and American  consumers have proven to be the law-abiding, conservation-minded,  responsible practitioners of a sustainable practice. But the Democrats  continue to impose punitive and destructive measures on them to atone  for the irresponsible actions of foreign nations.   Mr. Speaker, I urge rejection of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might  consume.   Mr. Speaker, my friend from California says that, well, California's  ban hasn't resulted in any calamities. What he forgets is that  virtually all shark fisheries in the United States are found in  Florida, Louisiana, and North Carolina. Banning shark finning in  California is like banning buffalo hunting in Rhode Island; there just  isn't any.   My friend from the Marianas tells us that there are 73 million shark  fins in the global market annually. That is a very misleading  statement. It comes from a report published by Shelley Clarke. That  report gives a range of between 26 and 73 million and makes no  differentiation between legally and illegally obtained fins, which,  unfortunately, is a defect in this bill itself.   Mr. Speaker, for a different opinion, however, I yield 2 minutes to  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul).    Mr. Speaker, my friend from Texas compared banning  shark fins to banning ivory. Of course, the difference is that the U.S.  was a major consumer of ivory. It is 1 percent of the entire global  shark fin market.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.  Graves).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, we hear a lot about the letter signed by  150 scientists in support of this bill. We ought to point out that only  10 of those 150 scientists actually are scientists with expertise in  shark fisheries. But every one of the scientists who signed the  Wildlife Conservation Society letter in opposition to this bill is  recognized as an active professional shark researcher and expert in the  field.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Webster).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, let's be very clear: Killing a shark for its fin while  throwing away the rest of the carcass is contemptible; it is immoral;  it is wrong; and it has been illegal and banned in the United States  since 1993. American fishermen don't do this. American fishermen are  the good guys in this story.   This bill does something very different. It requires American  fishermen to throw away the fins when they kill a shark. That is just  as wasteful, just as despicable, and it is not going to stop foreign  bad actors. It will kill American fishing. It will destroy the  livelihoods of Americans who have followed the law and who are  responsibly accounting for their entire catch. It is not going to help  our domestic shark populations. They are doing quite fine.   NOAA currently manages 42 shark species, along with the commercial  and recreational shark fisheries. None of these 42 species in the  Atlantic are listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act. As  I pointed out earlier, the most recent results of the NOAA fisheries'  longest running shark survey show our domestic populations increasing,  with scientists capturing and tagging more than ever before.   It is a shame that we are here to blame American fishermen, who are  following all of the laws and doing everything right.   And remember this: Under H.R. 737, sharks can still be legally caught  in U.S. waters; however, they will be forced to cut off the fins and  throw them into the garbage. Ask yourself: Is this right?   Congress has long supported the full utilization of landed seafood in  order to obtain the maximum economic value of our limited marine  resources, all consistent with the Magnuson-Stevens Act. This  legislation will result in little more than wasted resources.   The administration opposes this legislation. It writes:         We cannot support the Shark Fin Sale Elimination Act       because of the bill's negative impact on U.S. fishermen that       would outweigh its minimal benefit to shark conservation.       This would hurt U.S. fishermen who currently harvest and sell       sharks and shark fins in a sustainable manner under strict       Federal management.    Industry opposes this legislation. They write:         H.R. 737 would effectively put an end to all shark fishing.       The revenue realized from fin sales can comprise up to 50       percent of a large coastal shark's value. Requiring the       discard or destruction of shark fins is also wasteful, both       as a food resource and an economic resource that helps       sustain rural coastal fishing communities here in America. It       has long been the policy of Congress to encourage full       utilization of land and catch in order to obtain the maximum       economic value of our limited marine resources.    And, finally, scientists oppose this legislation. Two of the leading  scientists in the field write:         If the shark fin trade in the United States were completely       eliminated, the direct impact on reducing global shark       mortality would likely be insignificant. The elimination of       United States-supplied fins in world markets would open the       door to increased market share for illegal, unreported, and       unregulated fishing nations not practicing sustainable shark       fishing, including those that have not yet prohibited       finning.    This legislation follows a familiar theme we hear from the other  side: Blame Americans first for the world's problems. This legislation  is the definition of a solution in search of a problem.    I am sorry that some of my Republican colleagues have been convinced  to support this legislation, but I hope that today's debate has shined  a bit of truth on the issue.   Let me just quote from the humane society quickly. Their reasoning  for this legislation is that: ``The United States has a robust market  for shark fins, many of which likely were obtained through finning.''   Let me state again, ``likely were obtained.'' This is the science and  data that we are using to support this legislation, ``likely were  obtained.'' Mind you, we make up less than 1 percent of the global  market.   Shark finning will continue across the rest of the globe, and it will  continue to focus on the market in South and Southeast Asia. We will  have lost our ability to have managed our resources and support our  local fishing industries.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to oppose this misguided and  misconceived legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 925 reauthorizes conservation projects under the  North American Wetlands Conservation Act, NAWCA, through fiscal year  2024.   I readily concede this is a popular program. Even without an  authorization, the appropriators put $42 million into this last year.  The sponsors of the bill, obviously, want more, authorizing $60 million  a year. That is higher than any appropriation to date. I am concerned  that, in a time where we are running record and perilous deficits, we  ought to consider the level which some of these programs should be  funded.   Much of the money under NAWCA is used to obtain conservation  easements and wetlands outright to benefit migratory birds and fish.  According to the Fish and Wildlife Service, the program has benefited  almost 30 million acres of wetland habitat in North America since its  inception 30 years ago. It is a very good thing.   Here is the problem, though: The Federal Government is already  landlord to 640 million acres of the country and is doing a poor job of  maintaining what we already have. For example, the National Park  Service is facing a nearly $12 billion deferred maintenance backlog.  The question I would raise today is whether we really need to authorize  increased funding to buy even more land.                                time  1445    It would be one thing if Congress had taken strong action to address  this backlog by moving H.R. 1225 by Congressman   Rob Bishop, the  former chairman and currently ranking member of the Natural Resources  Committee.   That was a favorably reported bill. It has overwhelming support with  329 bipartisan cosponsors. That bill would take excess funds from new  energy development and target these deteriorating lands so that people  as well as migratory birds and fish can enjoy them.   I recognize that H.R. 925 simply authorizes an existing program, but  it is imperative to take into account the realities that our current  Federal lands are facing. Acquiring more land when we can't take care  of the land we already control is not a wise use of our resources.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wittman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, this is, undoubtedly, a popular program. It does well  serve public recreation and use, the very purpose of our public lands,  and I certainly don't oppose it.   But I do want to close with this warning: We are continuing to  acquire more and more land while we are failing to take care of the  enormous estates that we already hold.   Louie Gohmert, my colleague on the Natural Resources Committee, has  compared our Federal lands policy to the old miser in town whose  mansion is dilapidated, whose yard is overgrown with weeds, and whose  paint is peeling because he spends all of his time and money plotting  how he is going to acquire his neighbor's property.   I would like to hope that the bipartisan support for this bill will  be accompanied soon with bipartisan support for Mr. Bishop's bill, H.R.  1225, which would actually take the resources that we are generating  from the public lands to assure that we are taking proper care of our  public lands.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1088 offered by our colleague from Kansas, Dr.  Roger Marshall, authorizes the Society of the 1st Infantry Division to  modify the First Infantry Division Monument here in Washington, D.C.   This society seeks to honor its members who died during combat in  Operation Desert Storm, Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation New Dawn,  and Operation Enduring Freedom.   The 1st Infantry Division of the United States Army has served our  country faithfully with distinction and honor for well over a century  now. 12,949 heroes of the ``Big Red One'' have fallen in the defense of  our Constitution and the freedoms it guarantees. A grateful Nation  remembers their names by inscribing them on a monument here in our  Nation's Capital.   Every one of them has been faithful to the Division's motto of: ``No  mission too difficult, no sacrifice too great. Duty first.''   It is time to update and add names to the monument to honor these  American heroes and to serve as an inspiration and example to the  generation whose freedom and security they gave their lives to protect.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Marshall), the author of this bill.                                time  1500     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Clay for this legislation and for his being  amenable to changes that make this bill one that every Member can  support.   This legislation raises money through the voluntary purchases of a  special stamp that in turn funds valuable conservation efforts of  iconic global species such as tigers, elephants, rhinos, great apes,  marine turtles, and their habitats.   Anyone who wants to help these efforts can do so by purchasing these  stamps; a small surcharge for which is then deposited in the  Multinational Species Conservation Funds. These funds in turn provide  grants for conservation work around the globe. To date, over $5.7  million have been raised  [[Page H9087]]  by this low-key and entirely voluntary effort.   While the authority to sell these popular stamps has expired, the  stockpile of 49 million stamps still exists. Mr. Clay accepted  amendments to allow the stockpile to be depleted before new stamps are  printed that prevents waste and protects taxpayers.   International conservation of these important species is a shared  goal of both Democrats and Republicans, and this bill is a very good  example of that seemingly rare opportunity for all of us to come  together for the benefit of wildlife, their habitat, and, of course,  the American people who enjoy both for generations to come.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1472, offered by our colleague, Congressman Smith  of Nebraska, would redesignate the Homestead National Monument of  America to simply the Homestead National Historical Park.   Congress authorized this commemoration in 1936 after acquiring the  site of the Daniel Freeman homestead. It was set aside as a lasting  memorial to the settlers who built the American West as a result of the  Homestead Act of 1862 and its successors.   In total, 207 million, or 10 percent, of all land in the United  States was settled under the Homestead Act. The name of the monument  with the redundant qualifier ``of America'' has made it an anomaly  within the National Park system. This bill simply removes that  redundancy and conforms more clearly with the naming customs of the  National Park Service.   Redesignating the unit as a national historical park will further  clarify the unit's characteristics in keeping with the modern  designations that the Park Service maintains.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Nebraska (Mr. Smith), the author of the measure who brings it to the  floor today.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the  other gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Fortenberry).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1487 authorizes a special resource study of  portions of the Los Angeles coastal area in California to evaluate  alternatives for land management, including designating the coastal  area as a unit of the National Park System.   While I do not oppose authorizing a special resource study of this  area, I hope that Congress will exercise caution before adding  significant amounts of coastline to the existing Santa Monica Mountains  National Recreation Area, which is already struggling to manage its  current resources and is increasingly beginning to resemble Lincoln's  story of a farmer who said, ``I ain't greedy for land. I just want what  joins mine.''   In 2018, because of bad land management, the vast majority of this  same area burned in the massive Woolsey fire. More than 21,000 of the  23,595 National Park Service acres, about 88 percent of the land, were  burned. This included most of the Western Town at Paramount Ranch, the  1926 Peter Strauss Ranch home, most of the joint National Park Service/ UCLA La Kretz Research Center, two ranger residences, and an attached  archives building.   Further, the National Park Service is already stretched perilously  thin and facing a nearly $12 billion deferred maintenance backlog that  we discussed in an earlier bill.   Although I recognize that this measure simply authorizes a study and  doesn't transfer any land or jurisdiction, it is imperative that we  take into account the realities that our parks are facing and the  devastating consequences of a land management policy that can only be  described as benign neglect. As we are discovering, the consequences  are anything but benign.   Mr. Speaker, with that caveat, I urge adoption of the measure, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would urge adoption of the measure  with the caveats I have already discussed, and I yield back the balance  of my time.
