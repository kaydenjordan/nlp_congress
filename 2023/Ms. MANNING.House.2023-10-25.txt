 Mr. Speaker, 18 days ago, more than 1,000 Hamas  terrorists invaded our Democratic ally Israel, and in the most  gruesome, savage, and unimaginably barbaric manner attacked 22 Israeli  towns, going house to house slaughtering families, raping  girls, beheading babies, setting fire to homes where children were  hiding in safe rooms, burning them alive, and taking more than 200  people of 40 different nationalities hostage, including taking infants  and the elderly hostage.    They massacred more than 260 young people attending an outdoor peace  concert. They perpetrated the worst attack on the Jewish people since  the Holocaust, slaughtering more than 1,400 people, including 39  Americans.   In committing these horrific crimes against humanity, they have  brought disaster to the very people they govern--the Palestinian  people.   They hide their fighters among civilians. They place rocket launchers  and weapons in schools, in hospitals, in mosques, and in residential  buildings, compounding their acts of evil.   I was so proud that President Biden immediately expressed the full  support of the United States for the State of Israel.   He traveled to Israel in a time of war to embrace the Israeli people,  to show with his presence that the Jewish state has not only a right  but a duty to defend itself against Hamas, a terrorist group that has  in its charter as its foundational purpose to murder Jews and destroy  the State of Israel.   Make no mistake: When they shout, ``from the river to the sea,'' they  are calling for the total destruction of the  [[Page H5056]]  State of Israel and ridding the Middle East of all Jews.   Well, let me say: not on our watch. The United States will stand side  by side with our Democratic ally Israel. I urge my colleagues to join  me in voting in support of this resolution.
