 Mr. President, today I wish to commemorate International  Women's Day, which occurred this past Friday, March 8, 2019. On this  day each year, we recognize and celebrate women's incredible  achievements and double down on our commitment to advance gender  equality and women's empowerment, both at home and abroad.   The theme of International Women's Day this year is ``Think equal,  build smart, innovate for change,'' which highlights the importance of  finding new ways to advance gender equality, especially by utilizing  technology. In January of this year, President Trump signed a bill  Senator Boozman and I sponsored, the Women's Entrepreneurship and  Economic Empowerment Act, WEEE Act, into law. This important,  bipartisan legislation allows women around the world, including those  living in poverty, to access critical tools to start and grow their  businesses. It requires that 50 percent of U.S. Agency for  International Development's micro, small, and medium-sized enterprise  resources are targeted to activities that reach the very poor, as well  as enterprises women own, manage, and control. The WEEE Act empowers  women to invest in themselves, their families, and their communities.   A McKinsey Global Institute report estimates that achieving global  gender parity in economic activity could add as much as $28 trillion to  annual global gross domestic product by 2025. The WEEE Act will help  women overcome the critical barriers they face when seeking economic  opportunity and the legislation will open doors for children, families,  and communities to benefit, too.   This year's theme of ``Think equal, build smart, innovate for  change'' also provides the opportunity to celebrate some of the  incredible and life-changing innovations being launched around the  world. In Cambodia, for example, CARE has developed a gamified mobile  app called ``Chat!'' to provide cost-effective and high-impact  reproductive health education to its young, female population working  in the garment industry. Cambodia has the largest youth and adolescent  population in Southeast Asia; two-thirds of the population are under  the age of 29. Increasing numbers of Cambodians, especially young  women, are migrating to urban areas to support its garment industry.   According to CARE, 85 percent of Cambodia's garment factory workers  are women, who are vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. According to  the United Nations' research on women, one in three women are likely to  face violence in her lifetime. Therefore, applications like Chat! are  critical to reach this population and provide reproductive health  information and services, helping these women make informed and healthy  choices and prevent unplanned pregnancies.   While International Women's Day provides the opportunity to celebrate  such successes, it is also critically important to recognize the work  that lies ahead in the fight for gender equality, and especially the  challenges that female human rights defenders face in this fight. A  recent United Nations report on human rights defenders describes  increased resistance to the work of female human rights defenders at  multiple levels, linked to the rise of populism, fundamentalism, and  violent extremism around the world.   The report highlights the increasing number of countries that are  actively restricting fundamental human rights, including the freedoms  of expression, association, and assembly, and specifically notes the  enforced disappearances of female defenders in Saudi Arabia. Samar  Badawi and Nassima al-Sadah, for example, were arrested last summer for  advocating to lift the ban on female drivers and end the guardianship  system that prevents women from legal and social independence. Amal al- Harbi was also arrested last summer for advocating for the release of  her husband, Fowzan al-Harbi, a human rights defender. These female  human rights defenders remain detained to this day, and several of  these activists are due to appear in Saudi court this week. With no  access to legal representation, I and many of my colleagues fear that  these activists will be charged and tried for crimes they did not  commit, as a result of engaging in peaceful activities to advance human  rights in Saudi Arabia, which are protected under international law.   The reduction in funding for women's rights in recent years is also  an immense challenge to future progress, a challenge exasperated by the  Trump administration's actions, particularly in the realm of women's  health. The Trump administration's reinstatement and expansion of the  Mexico City policy, often referred to as the Global Gag Rule, for  example, has closed the door on some of the most effective, lifesaving  family planning programs by disqualifying international organizations  from receiving U.S. family planning assistance if any non-U.S. funds  are used to provide abortion services or counseling. The implementation  of this expanded policy, as the aforementioned UN report notes, has  ``threatened the integration of health services and created division in  civil society around the world.'' As underscored by the example of  Chat!, we know that family planning tools are critical to providing the  education, information, and services that help prevent unplanned  pregnancies and abortions.   As I have stated in the past, America's global leadership begins with  our progress here in the United States. This also extends into the  realm of gender equality. A critical challenge to progress here at home  is the fact that our own Constitution does not already guarantee women  the same rights and protections as men. The Fourteenth Amendment of the  Constitution guarantees ``equal protection of the laws,'' and the  Supreme Court, so far, has held that most sex or gender classifications  are subject to only ``intermediate scrutiny'' when analyzing laws that  may have a discriminatory impact. Ratification of the Equal Rights  Amendment, ERA, by State legislatures would provide the courts with  clearer guidance in holding gender or sex classifications to the  ``strict scrutiny'' standard. That is why on January 25, 2019, Senator  Murkowski and I introduced a resolution to immediately remove the  ratification deadline and reopen consideration of the ERA for  ratification by the States and finally guarantee full and equal  protections to women in the Constitution.   While we have much to celebrate on this day, I want to take this  opportunity to remind my colleagues in the U.S. Senate that we must  continue to use our leadership positions to shine a spotlight on human  rights violations, wherever they occur, and push for the  [[Page S1840]]  immediate release of human rights defenders around the world,  imprisoned for exercising fundamental human rights. We must also end  the Global Gag Rule once and for all, and we must finally grant women  equality under the law. By doing so, we will truly recommit ourselves  to breaking down the barriers that remain for women's empowerment, so  that we can pave the path towards prosperity for generations to come.                            ____________________
