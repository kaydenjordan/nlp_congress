 Mr. Speaker, according to the U.S. Department of  Agriculture's Economic Research Service, small family farms account for  90 percent of all U.S. farms. These farms are vital to local  communities and economies, and they provide fresh produce for their  local farmers' markets, farm-to-school programs, soup kitchens, and a  host of other local consumer activity. Sales attributed to these  farmers can total up to $12 billion annually.   I was thrilled to see President Biden's administration, through the  Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, recently announce $400  million in funding to support local, regional, and socially  disadvantaged farmers. This is dedicated funding that will go directly  toward local producers and local and regional food systems to help  revitalize the essential farming that makes America proud.   I was also pleased that the administration included Secretary Vilsack  in its new Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force. This will address the  unfair trade practices that have allowed for cheap and unjust  agriculture labor practices to continue at home and abroad.   They have allowed large agriculture companies to thrive and put their  food all over grocers' shelves, while our  [[Page H2874]]  small farmers struggle to put food on their own tables. This decisive  action to increase domestic competitiveness is what our small family  farmers need to regain their footing and make it economically viable to  farm for their communities and our country.   I hope my colleagues will join me in this congratulatory note.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my very able colleague,  Congressman Casten, for the opportunity to join him and Congresswoman  Castor, the leaders of this marvelous committee on climate change. I  thank them very much for leading our country and world in this regard.   My goal as chair of the House Energy and Water Subcommittee is to  help them and help our generation embrace  [[Page H2876]]  a better future for those that will follow. We must sustain life on  Earth. Let us all help our country and world meet the challenges as we  face the dawn of this new climate change era.   The clean energy future of our Nation and our ability to reboot and  reenergize the domestic manufacturing economy depends on climate- related infrastructure programs for inventing that new future.  Addressing climate change will create and even bring back good paying  jobs right here at home. Addressing climate change is our portal to  sustain life on Earth for generations to come.   Headlines coast to coast, as others have referenced, tell part of the  story. Yes, the Earth is warming. The rate of increase for damaging  weather events is unrelenting. Each of us, and each of our districts,  have personally experienced the impacts of this historic change. If we  fail to address the hastening crisis, it is to our collective peril.   As a small first step, I would urge every American who may be  listening to plant trees. Yes, everyone can do something. A first  simple step is to plant a tree to capture the carbon that is already in  the air, and the tree will produce oxygen to help you breathe, and to  help your children breathe and your neighbors. It is amazing what  happens.   Cleveland, Ohio, used to be known as ``forest city.'' We have a big  job to do in replanting many of the trees that have aged-out over the  years, and making Cleveland, and places like it, a much more oxygen- rich community.   Addressing climate change will help human health. As America stands  at a crossroads in this new energy age, we must ensure that  infrastructure includes strategic investments in energy, clean energy,  climate, and water resources innovation.   Technologies and innovation driven by the Department of Energy are  already helping to address climate change. They already have markedly  driven down the cost of wind, solar, energy storage, and efficient  lightbulbs by 60 to 95 percent just since 2008, and we are not done  yet. They have led to widespread deployment and consumer savings.   New innovations will lead to new opportunities. In my own home  region, I was very pleased to be at the birth of a company called First  Solar, now the largest in the Nation, invented locally using cadmium- telluride technology. And now, just recently in the past month, First  Solar has announced the hiring of an additional 500 new employees in  good jobs to match the thousands they already employ, to meet an unmet  market demand.   Reversing the impacts of climate change will create good paying jobs  like these across every State in our country. Already there are more  Americans working in energy efficiency and energy production than as  waiters and waitresses. Think about that. That is in a very short time,  and more jobs to come. We must continue to innovate and lead in these  areas, so our Nation is not left behind. As people in communities  succeed, so will America. As someone said to me, Marcy, what America  makes, makes America. My, gosh, do I agree with that.   The Biden administration has been clear from day one about the need  to urgently address the climate crisis, and I am excited that the  President's American Jobs Plan will create new jobs by reinvesting in  areas and workers too often left behind, and they will help save our  planet and sustain all of us and those who will follow us.   We cannot lose sight of the importance of including climate-related  and job-creating proposals in any infrastructure package. In fact, any  package that aims to build back better must do that. Climate change can  be addressed by every community across our country. Innovation,  intelligence, and environmental patriotism should drive this new  national imperative.   As we watch President Joe Biden in his foreign trip meet the leaders  of democracies across Europe this week, we watch America lead these  democracies of the world in protecting Mother Earth for those who will  follow us.   It really is a daunting time, but it is also an inspiring time. And  any time America has ever set a goal, it has always achieved it.
