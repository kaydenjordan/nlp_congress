 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr.  Lewis for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5444, the Taxpayer First Act.  In particular, I commend Representatives Lewis and Jenkins for their  leadership to prevent private debt collectors from pursuing tax  collections from individuals and families earning under 250 percent of  the Federal poverty level.   I was deeply disturbed by the report of the Taxpayer Advocate which  found that private debt collection enforcement this year targeted SSDI  and SSI recipients, subjected impoverished Social Security recipients  to levies, and put 45 percent of the studied taxpayers into installment  agreements they could not afford.   The private debt collection program appears to have increased the  profits of debt collectors at the expense of the disabled, retirees,  and impoverished--counter to IRS policy and decency. Creating an  independent appeals process, improving the offer in compromise program,  and modernizing the IRS are overdue improvements.   So I thank Ranking Member Lewis and Chairman Jenkins for their  leadership, and I urge all of my colleagues to support this important  legislation.
