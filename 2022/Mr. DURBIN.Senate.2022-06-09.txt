 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, at 11:45  a.m. today, the Senate proceed to executive session and vote on the  confirmation of Executive Calendar No. 856, the nomination of Robert  Steven Huie, as provided under the previous order, and that, following  the vote, the Senate resume legislative session.    Mr. President, this evening, the Select Committee to  investigate the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol will hold its  first public hearing.   For more than 10 months, the January 6 Select Committee has labored  diligently to discover and document the truth about the day we nearly  lost our democracy. This evening, the committee will begin to lay out  publicly, for the first time, the coordinated plan in place to overturn  the results of the 2020 Presidential election and prevent the peaceful  transition of power to a new administration in America. Those are  incredible words that I have just spoken, but they reflect the reality  of January 6, 2021.   Among the witnesses will be Capitol Police Officer Caroline Edwards,  one of the more than 140 Capitol and Metropolitan police officers who  was injured when the mob attacked the Capitol.   To Officer Edwards and all of the police officers who defended  American democracy that day and who continue to protect this Capitol  every day, we owe more than our thanks.   January 6 revealed to the world how fragile democracy can be, even in  America. Keeping our democracy requires vigilance and truth. Often, it  requires sacrifice, and there must be a willingness to accept that  truth. It is regrettable--no, it is shameful--that our Republican  colleagues in the Senate filibustered the creation of an independent,  bipartisan commission to investigate what happened on January 6.   I recall that moment, and I am sure the Presiding Officer does as  well. It was slightly after 2 o'clock, just a few minutes after 2  o'clock. Vice President Pence was presiding over the U.S. Senate as we  went through the orderly, constitutional process of counting the  electoral votes. I looked up from my chair to see the Secret Service  come in and physically remove--quickly remove--the Vice President from  that chair. The events that unfolded in the next few minutes were hard  to imagine could ever occur in the United States of America. We were  told to sit safely in our chairs, in that this was a secure Chamber,  and be prepared for other staffers from around the Capitol to join us.  Not 10 minutes later, a member of the Capitol Police stood before us  and said: As quickly as possible, evacuate this Chamber.    It is hard to imagine this in the United States of America. We have  seen the videos. We know what happened. There is no doubt as to what  happened that day and what an impression it must have left on the rest  of the world. What would we think, at this moment in time, if a mob  with battering rams beat down the doors of Parliament and entered the  House of Commons and the House of Lords? Would we not say on this side  of the ocean, my God, what has happened to the United Kingdom? Can this  government survive? Can that country survive? The same questions were  being asked about America because of that insurrectionist mob on  January 6.   The proposal was made--and it was a legitimate, thoughtful, good- faith proposal--to establish a bipartisan commission to get to the  bottom of it--who was behind it?--and to ask the hard questions. What  role did President Donald Trump play in what unfolded after his rally  on January 6, 2021? Some people don't even want to raise the question,  let alone hear the answer.   History demands the truth, unless we have reached the point that we  saw in the times of the Soviet Union when they refused to print in  their daily newspapers plane crashes. It was bad news, and they didn't  want to peddle any bad news in the official partisan organ, Izvestia.  No. That was the reality of the Soviet Union--deny the truth, rewrite  history. We see the same thing occurring today, but the American people  are going to learn the truth.   All three major broadcast networks and all but one cable news network  will carry this evening's hearing live. What cable news network might  not require the broadcast of this? I am going to guess FOX News, and I  am right. Think about that for a second. Clearly, to FOX News, which  profits off the Big Lie of Donald Trump, it matters more to continue  that relationship than to tell the truth to their viewers.   The members of the Select Committee have undertaken their duty with  uncommon courage, and I want to single out, in particular, Congressman  Adam Kinzinger from the State of Illinois. We are not close friends,  but we have worked on a few things together. I have the highest regard  and admiration for the courage that he has shown throughout this  travail; and the fact that he would volunteer, against the wishes of  the Republican House leadership, to make this committee bipartisan is a  tribute to his citizenship and to his commitment to this Nation.   The same thing, of course, is true for Representative Liz Cheney. She  has a lot at stake. Representative Kinzinger has announced his  retirement. She continues to represent Wyoming, and I hope she will for  many years to come. I may disagree with her on virtually every other  issue, but I have respect for her courage in serving on this bipartisan  committee.                          Federal Bureau of Prisons    Mr. President, on another topic, it is no secret that the Federal  Bureau of Prisons has been plagued by misconduct. One investigation  after another has revealed a culture of abuse, mismanagement,  corruption, torture, and death that reaches all the way to the top.   One of the most troubling investigations was published last week by  National Public Radio and the Marshall Project. The title of the report  reads: ``How the Newest Federal Prison Became One of the Deadliest''-- the facility in question I know well: U.S. Penitentiary Thomson. It is  located in my home State of Illinois. In fact, it is a facility that I  officially and originally encouraged the Federal Government to purchase  in order to reduce overcrowding in high security prisons. The opening  of U.S. Penitentiary Thomson was supposed to improve safety within the  Bureau of Prisons, but the reality, sadly, has been the exact opposite.   According to this report, seven inmates at U.S. Penitentiary Thomson  have died in just 2 years. Five of them were reportedly murdered by  other inmates; two died by suicide. And those deaths are just a  snapshot of the grim reality of this facility--the deadly, grim  reality. The investigation paints a picture of rampant abuse by prison  staff. This alleged abuse includes the excessive use of two kinds of  painful restraints--ambulatory restraints and four-point restraints.  The ``four'' refers to each of a person's limbs, which, under this  technique, are chained to a concrete bed, rendering the individual  immobile.   This is an American penitentiary. The Bureau of Prisons' protocol  says  [[Page S2880]]  that these restraints should be used sparingly and only to  momentarily--momentarily--restrain an inmate who presents an active  danger to himself or others.   According to this report, some guards at U.S. Penitentiary Thomson  have, apparently, made a habit of regularly using these restraints on  inmates--not momentarily but regularly. In some cases, inmates have  reportedly been left chained for hours and days.   A lawyer who has spoken with U.S. Penitentiary Thomson inmates said:         [The inmates] are denied food. They are denied water. Many       of them report being left in their own waste. It's really       akin to a torture chamber.   This is an American prison in my State.   The use of restraints and shackles has become so common, inmates have  coined a term to describe the scars they leave on their arms and legs.  It is known as the ``Thomson tattoo.''   The report also alleges that the staff at U.S. Penitentiary Thomson  have gained a reputation for stoking tensions between cellmates. Make  no mistake, this is a special management unit. These are inmates who  can be very dangerous, and I understand that. I understood it when the  penitentiary was opened.   One example that was highlighted in this report is indicative of the  challenge. It was the murder of Matthew Phillips, a U.S. Penitentiary  Thomson inmate who died in 2020. Mr. Phillips was a Jewish man with a  visible Star of David tattoo. The corrections officers at U.S.  Penitentiary Thomson reportedly locked Mr. Phillips in a recreation  cage with two known White supremacists. These inmates beat Mr. Phillips  until he was unconscious, and he died from his injuries 3 days later.  Both men have since been indicted by the Justice Department on murder  and hate crime charges.   Following the publication of this shocking report, I joined Senator  Duckworth, my colleague from Illinois, and Illinois Congresswoman Cheri  Bustos, sending a letter to the Justice Department's Inspector General  Michael Horowitz. In it, we urged him to launch a full-scale, immediate  investigation into the failures at Thomson prison.   I spoke with General Horowitz yesterday. He confirmed that his office  is investigating the deaths at Thomson, along with many other abuses in  the Bureau of Prisons.   But this report about U.S. Penitentiary Thomson is only the most  recent look into the house of horrors that is the Bureau of Prisons,  the Federal Bureau of Prisons. We already have ample evidence of a  pattern of neglect and abuse that has been embedded in their  bureaucracy.   Consider, for instance, the Bureau's overuse of restricted housing-- the practice of separating inmates from the general prison population,  isolating them alone or with one other person for 24 hours at a time.  The practice can cause severe mental anguish for inmates and can  severely harm the prospects for ever reentering society.   Much like the use of four-point restraints, restricted housing  should, as the Justice Department noted in 2016, ``be used rarely,  applied fairly, and subjected to reasonable constraints.'' That is the  standard, the published standard, of the Bureau of Prisons.   During the Obama administration, I held two hearings, which are still  fresh on my mind they were so gripping, on the issue of solitary  confinement. Following those hearings, the Justice Department took  steps to reduce and reform the Bureau of Prisons' use of restricted  housing. We started to make real progress.   Unfortunately, the progress was erased during the Trump  administration. And since the former President left office, the Biden  Department of Justice has had plenty of time to change course and  leadership. And I have urged them to do so.   A year and a half into this administration, nearly 8 percent of BOP  inmates are still being held in restricted housing. That is the same  level it was under President Trump. That is just plain unacceptable.  The continued overuse of restricted housing and the alleged abuses at  Thomson are among the many instances of misconduct and mismanagement  that have occurred under the failed leadership of Bureau of Prisons'  Director Michael Carvajal.   In light of those earlier reports detailing similar failures, I  called for Mr. Carvajal's resignation last November. So it was welcome  news when, about 6 weeks after I asked for his resignation, he  announced it. Mr. Carvajal said he was going to resign.   But that was January. Now we are in June, and the Justice Department  has shown little progress or urgency in naming Carvajal's replacement.  As a result, he is still running and mismanaging the Bureau of Prisons.   This recent investigation at Thomson makes it clear there are no  excuses for further delay. So today I am calling on President Biden,  Attorney General Garland, and Deputy Attorney General Monaco to do one  of two things; either name a new reform-minded Director to replace  Carvajal immediately or appoint an Acting Director until a permanent  selection is made. This cannot wait. We need to act before another  inmate dies in the custody and care of this Federal Government.   In the coming weeks, the Senate Judiciary Committee, which I chair,  will be holding a hearing on the Bureau of Prisons. We will examine  these allegations of abuse at Thomson and other facilities. We need  answers from the Biden administration on the failure to reduce the use  of restricted housing, and we will discuss what BOP must do to address  the staffing crisis that has contributed to this disastrous situation.   The crisis demands the attention of the highest ranking officials  within the Department of Justice. It has been long overdue. It is time  for us to have competent, principled leadership at the Bureau of  Prisons.   I am not condemning every person who works at that Agency, for sure.  I have met many of them and respect them. But those who are guilty of  this misconduct need to be held accountable, and new leadership is  imperative.   It has been a long time since we have had that kind of competent,  principled leadership. I believe that Attorney General Garland and  Deputy Attorney General Monaco will choose the right leader to clear  out the bureaucratic rot and improve with significant reforms. But we  need to act quickly. Lives are at stake.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) is  necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker)  is necessarily absent.
