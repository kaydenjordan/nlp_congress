 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   I spent the day before Father's Day at the Federal prison in Oregon,  meeting the 123 asylum-seeking immigrant men who are incarcerated in  prison. They were fleeing horrific violence and religious  persecution. They were Christian and Sikh men from India. There was an  LGBTQ man from Honduras and a man from Mexico whose property was burned  because he has been targeted by gangs. We spoke with men who were  separated from their wives and children and who, on Father's Day, had  no idea where they were or how they were.    Criminalizing asylum seekers and separating families is cruel, and it  is appalling.   Now we find out that there are tender-age shelters. Babies don't need  their own jail. They need their own parents. This must stop. The  President and the Department of Justice could stop it right now.   The American Academy of Pediatrics said that separating families in  this way causes irreparable harm. Mistreating children for political  leverage is outside of moral bounds, even for this administration.   As a mother, it breaks my heart. As an American and granddaughter of  immigrants, it makes me furious.   And if the President won't sign something today, which he could,  then, Speaker Ryan, bring us the Keeping Families Together Act, and let  us do something to stop this horrific atrocity that is happening to  children and to people who are coming to this country.                            ____________________
