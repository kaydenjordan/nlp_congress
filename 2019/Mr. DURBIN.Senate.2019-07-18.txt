Mr. President, on August 10, Fulton County Sheriff Deputy  Troy Chisum should be turning 40 years old. He should be spending the  day watching his daughters play softball, or he should be playing  football with his friends and excitedly discussing the upcoming  Minnesota Vikings football season.   But, sadly, he won't be doing these things. Deputy Chisum was killed  in the line of duty on June 25. I want to honor him today.   Deputy Chisum was answering a call about a domestic disturbance in  Avon, IL. He was 4 minutes closer than any other deputy. When he  arrived at the scene, he saw the suspect on the porch. As he moved back  for safety, he was shot in the back and killed. The suspect barricaded  himself in the house for the next 19 hours before the standoff ended.   Deputy Chisum was the fifth law enforcement officer in America in an  8-day period to be shot and killed while on duty. Another police  officer has been shot and killed since then. Their deaths are a  heartbreaking reminder of the dangers officers face every day.   Troy Chisum loved his community. He always answered the call to help.  He worked as a paramedic with the Fulton County EMA and as a  firefighter with Northern Tazewell County. He also was a member of the  West Central Illinois Special Response Team and the Illinois Law  Enforcement Alarm System Weapon of Mass Destruction/Special Response  Team, Region Six. He had formerly worked for Lewistown Police  Department. He was a consummate public servant.   His family was always his No. 1 priority. He loved any activity with  his wife Amanda and his time with his three daughters. He helped  inspire his daughter Kyleigh to pursue a medical career. He made his  girls so proud.   Deputy Chisum's wife Amanda, their three daughters Kyleigh, Abigail,  and Gracie, his father, Phil Chisum, his mother and stepfather, Debra  and Mike Wheeler and too many relatives, colleagues and friends to  name; they were all proud of Troy.   Deputy Chisum was one of the good ones. His colleagues knew him as  the first one in every morning and the last one out every night. His  legacy and sacrifice will be remembered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
