 Madam Speaker, tonight we are going to talk about a  subject that gets too little attention in this Chamber and too little  debate and consideration among lawmakers. Yet the storm clouds are  gathering, and an epic crisis looms large over the future of our great  Nation. Our mountainous and unsustainable national debt is the most  significant, in my opinion, long-term threat to our economic prosperity  as well as our national security. We have sown the wind of fiscal  irresponsibility, and our children will reap the whirlwind of economic  calamity. We will rob generations of Americans of the freedoms and the  opportunities that we have enjoyed and have been so blessed with.   Madam Speaker, we all take an oath, but there is an unwritten  covenant between lawmakers today and our Founding Fathers and our  future generations of Americans, and that unwritten sacred promise that  all American leaders have subscribed to is to leave this Nation better  than we found it.   I believe the question is still hanging out there. The jury is still  out on whether our Nation's leaders today in this generation are  willing to make the sacrifices necessary to take on what I believe is  the greatest challenge of the 21st century, and that is this  unsustainable, unconscionable, and even immoral fiscal path that we are  on. It is a collision course with a disastrous future.   We have to do something. We have all the reforms and policy  solutions. But what we don't have and what I have not seen in now 6  years in this Chamber is the collective political will to do something  about it. It is very simple.   Madam Speaker, I am honored to be joined by fellow lawmakers who I  know share these sentiments. One such man hails from Ohio's Sixth  District. He is a dear friend, he is a patriot, and he is a veteran. He  has served on the Budget Committee. He is the co-chair of the Problem  Solvers Caucus, a task force on addressing our broken budgetary  processes and getting our arms around the debt and reining this in.   Madam Speaker, I am so glad he has joined us tonight. I yield to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Johnson).    Madam Speaker, I thank my dear friend from Ohio and  echo his sentiments. We must get our fiscal house in order.   It is shameful. I would say, a case in point, to the cries from our  citizens, citizens who say that this body and politicians in both  Chambers, in Washington, play by a different set of rules. Do you know  what? They are right. There is no further you have to look than at our  budget and appropriations process.   We haven't had a budget in the last 4 years under the leadership of  our Democrat colleagues, but quite frankly, both parties have been  guilty. I think, over the last 50 years, we have only gone through  regular order and passed a budget in all 12 appropriations and run the  people's House the way our States and local governments and our  families run their fiscal affairs.   They don't get to waive pay-fors. They don't get to borrow infinitum.   This place is so broken, and it is going to catch up to us. You don't  feel the pain until you feel the pain.   When the dominoes fall, you cannot borrow and spend your way out of  that situation and that particular crisis, like we have seen with COVID  and others prior to it.   We have a champion for this issue, fiscal responsibility, restoring  that in our own Conference as well as the broader United States  Congress, a fellow Texan, a man who I am proud to serve with from  Texas' 21st District, and a member of the House Judiciary Committee and  Veterans' Affairs Committee.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Roy).    Madam Speaker, I say a hearty amen to my fellow Texan  who has put his money where his mouth is. Certainly, he has put the  votes of his constituents where his mouth is and has taken a stand.   It is not fun to be voting against things that have these wonderful  titles that are going to do these grandiose things for the country. But  the question is, who is going to pay for it?    I don't even call the $30 trillion of debt ``debt.'' I call it what    Tom McClintock once mentioned in a budget hearing. It is a deferred tax  on our children. It is so easy for us to pass these bills and not  consider the incalculable cumulative cost.   But there will be a payday someday. As James Madison said, ``A public  debt is a public curse.'' We are not blessing our children. We are not  giving them the benefit of the quality of life that we have known as  Americans second to no other nation and society in the world and in the  history of the world. Yet, to do nothing and to keep this runaway  freight train of fiscal irresponsibility running off the cliff is to  curse them. Indeed, it is to curse them, as James Madison said.   Another friend and colleague and a new Member of Congress, but not  new to public service, is Peter Meijer from Michigan's Third District.  He serves on the Committee on Homeland Security and the Committee on  Foreign Affairs. We appreciate his deep concerns and convictions on  this issue facing our country.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Meijer).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Michigan, my  friend, for his comments. I am, again, proud to serve with him, and he  brings such reason and common sense. He is right to say that it is not  a partisan issue and that the debt and those things that have led to  this massive $30 trillion, over 120 percent of the size of our entire  economy, exceeding World War II with our entire debt--and by the way,  in peacetime. He is right.   We have to have an honest conversation with ourselves before we have  an honest conversation with the American people, and both parties have  contributed to this mess. Until we decide to accept that and take  ownership of it, we will never lead us to the path of restoring that  responsibility, that good footing, and the prospects of having saved  this country and our children and grandchildren from the disastrous,  calamitous future if we don't. I appreciate his approach to it.   We are reaching out to our colleagues, our Democrat colleagues, to  fix some of these broken systems, the perverse incentives that let us  get away with this reckless and irresponsible process that we call  budget and appropriations. Nowhere else in the world can you do what we  do.   But the results are indisputable. You get a broken process, a  dysfunctional system like we have, and you are going to get broken  outcomes.   Look no further than the debt clock, and look no further than CBO's  10-year forecast: $16 trillion more over the next 10 years of just the  public debt. It went from almost a trillion in annual deficits leading  up to COVID, and now the average will be $1.6 trillion in annual  deficits over the next 10 years, leading up to 2032, where we will have  $2.3 trillion in annual deficits. The interest we pay on the debt just  to service them, think about this.                                time  2100    We will spend more to service the debt to pay the interest, which you  get nothing for. You get no infrastructure. You don't get a farm bill  with strengthening of the food supply. You don't get a better or bigger  army to put on the field against the threats around the globe.   We will see a tripling of the interest payments that will exceed in  10 years, cumulative, over $8 trillion, but the annual amount will  exceed what we spend on national defense. We get nothing for this  interest. It is the largest growing mandatory spending item in the  budget.   Woe to the country if we don't take a hard look in the mirror and if  we don't decide to muster the political courage to take this on for the  sake of our kids and for the sake of our country.   Now, one of my closest friends in Congress who claims to come from a  State that does more agriculture than the Lone Star State, which  already discredits him from the outset, but I don't want to see the  numbers because I would be afraid if he were right. I would be afraid  to go back to Texas. We are just going to say Texas is bigger in every  way, including ag production.  [[Page H5479]]    He is a Ways and Means Committee member, and this guy, he is  passionate about our debt, our deficits, and getting our fiscal house  in order. He is going to be helping lead the charge in the 118th  Congress when the people, I pray, give our conference, Republicans, a  chance to prove that we are serious on this: Ron Estes from the great  State of Kansas.    Madam Speaker, I couldn't be more proud to serve  alongside of Ron Estes. The people of Kansas are well served, letting  him be their voice in the people's House.   You mentioned the disastrous economic plan and policies of this  administration. It is hard to believe what you didn't mention that this  President and our colleagues on the other side of the aisle somehow  think that the largest tax-and-spend bill is the solution. More  spending. More spending. More flooding the market with Federal moneys.  More expansion of welfare without work.   We all want to take care of those folks who are working hard and  still struggling. But, for example, the refundable tax credit, child  tax credit, where we would be paying thousands of dollars per child,  per person, with no requirement to work, to contribute, to have  ownership in this society, it is reckless.   And, quite frankly, it is heartless because those policies trap  people in poverty. They don't lift them out. They trap them in a life  of dependency on the government.   We want Americans to be the very best that God has created them to be  and have the best quality of life and a chance for a better life for  their families. I thank my friend from Kansas.   I am reminded of some great warnings from our wise Founders. Ben  Franklin said, `` . . . when you run into debt; you give another power  over your liberty.'' We are talking about robbing our children of their  freedom, not just their economic opportunity and future prosperity.   Thomas Jefferson said, ``To preserve our independence, we must not  let our rulers load us with perpetual debt.'' Warning after warning.   One of my favorites, our great father of this country, our first  President, Commander in Chief George Washington, in his farewell  address--think about it, penning a relatively short set of remarks, not  only for those of his time, but for posterity, for future leaders of  the greatest country in the world.                                time  2110    He gave three major warnings. He said: Be careful of foreign  influence, be careful of the factions that will divide you within our  own country, weakening our bonds of unity, as I stand under the ``e  pluribus unum'' motto, out of many one, that unifying spirit that made  this country exceptional.  [[Page H5480]]    But he warned about fiscal irresponsibility, and just to paraphrase,  he said: We must avoid the accumulation of debt, not only by shunning  occasions of expense, but by vigorous exertions in time of peace to  discharge the debts, which unavoidable wars may have occasioned, not  ungenerously throwing upon posterity the burden, which we ourselves  ought to bear.   I mean, we are ungenerously throwing upon posterity a burden of debt  that we are not willing to bear. We are not willing to take the tough  votes and pay for this and reduce our debt and deficit spending and  give the next generation a chance, a fighting chance to have what we  have had in this great country.   I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cloud), another freedom- fighting Texan who serves the coastal communities in the Lone Star  State, Oversight and Reform Committee member and proud Texan, the lone  Texan on the Agriculture Committee. I have tremendous respect for him  and his love for freedom, his love for the Lord, and his love for the  people of this great country, from Texas' 27th District.    Madam Speaker, wow, I have to really hold back here  because I have other colleagues that have important things to say, but  when I listen to my friend   Michael Cloud, I am inspired because he is  a man driven by conviction. I have watched him, and I admire his drive  for truth, his seeking out what is best for the country. That is his  measuring stick.   In an institution full of so much baloney and so many, pardon me,  partisan hacks, it is nice to have somebody that just says, I want to  do right by the Constitution, my constituents, and my kids. And that is  what drives   Michael Cloud. I am proud to serve with Representative  Cloud. I thank him for joining us for this discussion.   We have another Kansan. I think we have had three Texans and two  Kansans, so we are still winning, we are still up one. Tracey Mann is a  new Member of Congress but not new to public service. He has led his  great State as Lieutenant Governor.  [[Page H5481]]    Now, he might boast more wheat and sorghum there in his district, but  he will never be able to produce more cotton than Texas 19. I love that  he is a champion for our producers, our ag producers, and I love that  he is equally concerned about making sure we live within our means, we  rein in our spending, and we reduce our national debt and get back to  the fiscal footing that we all have confidence will be a gift, not a  curse, and that we will, in fact, reverse the curse.   We are going to get a chance in the next term. God willing, I think  the people are going to give us the chance to lead. And lead we must,  which will require courage, and I know you have it.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Mann), from  the First District of Kansas.                                time  2120     Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Mann for  bringing up the stepped-up basis repeal. Republicans didn't get a vote  in this largest tax-and-spending bill that was called Build Back  Better, that some have not so affectionately referred to as build back  broke. Really, it adds, even according to CBO, trillions of dollars in  new debt.   Worst of all, the Democrats negotiated some of these provisions out  before they passed it out of the House. One of them was the repeal of  the stepped-up basis. Then, this President puts it back in the ``Green  Book'' and says to the American farmers and ranchers, who put food on  the table and give us food security, which is national security--we  talk about energy independence; you wait until the pain is felt by the  food shortage, a whole other level of concern when it comes to supply  chain. Less than 1 percent, a fraction of a percent, we spend as a  nation to have ag independence and have a stable ag economy through  farm policies and a farm bill. This stepped-up basis, as I told  Secretary Yellen, would create the largest fire sale of farm assets in  the history of our country.   Farmers are cash poor. If the next generation of farmers inherits a  death tax, after paying taxes out the wazoo on every level--income,  sales, franchise, you name it, they have paid it. It is an unfair, un- American double tax, and they don't have the cash for it. It amounts to  selling off the family farm because the vast majority will be forced to  do that to pay more taxes.     Amen.   Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Mann for his contributions to  this important conversation with the American people.   I am proud to have also met and befriended a gentleman from the great  State of Utah. The first time we met, I talked about this bipartisan  effort to get at the root causes of this broken budget process and  reach across the aisle and simply force us, through the right  incentives, to be responsible stewards, to get budgets out on time with  budget outcomes that would reduce the debt. I remember that  Representative Moore lit up at that dinner meeting and said: Sign me  up.   Ever since then, he has been on a mission. He has worked with his  constituents, put a task force together. He is prepared, as he looks at  joining the Ways and Means Committee, which, by the way, when you look  at 70 percent of our budget on auto-spend--that is, entitlement,  mandatory programs. The vast majority of those, certainly the big  drivers of our debt, are under the auspices and the authority and  jurisdiction of the Ways and Means Committee. I will heartily welcome  him to the team in that regard. I appreciate his passion for this  issue.   Again, we will get an opportunity to serve and lead and govern, and  we are going to need people like him to not only sound the alarm but  assemble the team of people, the coalition of the willing, on both  sides of the aisle, to do the right thing by the American people.  [[Page H5482]]    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Moore), who  represents Utah's First District.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Utah (Mr.  Moore), beating the drum and sounding the alarm is a big part of it. I  think at some point it is hard to calculate and get your mind around  the trillions of dollars that are amassing.   We have added $7 trillion in additional debt since COVID alone. And  what happens, I believe, is when you do that and there is no  consequence, there is no trade-off, we are not hitting them in the  pocketbook saying, we need more of your hard-earned dollars to pay for  this stuff, and we are not cutting the favorite programs of our fellow  Americans, so there is no pain.     Moral hazard. We are sleepwalking off the cliff. The  problem with this crisis is, as I said, when Humpty Dumpty falls and  shatters it is going to be difficult to put him and the exceptional  nature and the superpower leadership of this great country back  together. There is just not a lot of time and heads up and warning  before you go over the precipice.   It is incumbent on us, as young fathers and young family men, to be  able to take this on head-on with the courage that our Founders had who  gave birth to this great country.   Madam Speaker, I hear you rattling the gavel, so God bless America,  and I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
