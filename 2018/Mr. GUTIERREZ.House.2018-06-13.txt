 Mr. Speaker, last week a group of about a dozen of us  wrote a letter to the head of the Department of Homeland Security,  Health and Human Services, and the Attorney General. We demanded that  the Trump administration cease its practice of prosecuting asylum  seekers, to reunite the children they separated from their families,  and to allow Members of Congress to visit the facilities where the  children are being held.   We gave these three Trump administration Cabinet Secretaries a  deadline to get back to us, and so far we have heard nothing, not a  peep. So now we are trying to figure out how to make it clear to the  Trump administration that agencies taking children from the arms of  moms and dads is absolutely 100 percent unacceptable to us and most  Americans.   Let's look at what is going on here. In order to get more of you on  that side of the aisle elected or re-elected, the President and his  henchmen have devised an election-year strategy to be as mean and nasty  as possible to asylum seekers, to immigrants, refugees, and Latinos in  general.   The President, and the Attorney General, and others have said that  this is a national security strategy, and that our national security  depends on taking toddlers, infants, and children, most of whom are  under the age of 12, away from their parents.   Come on, really? How does jailing a scared, frightened, terrorized 8  year old who barely escaped with her life from Central America, make  any of us safer?   Well, it doesn't. The only person who might be safer because an 8- year-old child is in jail is a Member of the House running for re- election on a get-tough-on-immigration platform.   And it isn't like they are taking these children from their parents  and putting them on the other side of the jail or the other side of the  for-profit detention center. No, they are taking the toddler, the  infant, the 8 or 9 year old and taking them to a government facility  somewhere else, maybe in New York, Chicago, Seattle, thousands of miles  away.   And we are hearing the most horrific stories. Parents who have had  their children taken from them have committed suicide.   Imagine how you would feel if you had to walk from El Salvador to  Texas to save the life of your son or daughter, only to wind up in  detention. Now, imagine that a man in a uniform comes up to you and  says, hey, we are going to take your child for a bath. We are going to  take them to see the doctor. And then hours go by and you realize they  are gone, maybe forever. Can you imagine?   Can you sit quietly and do nothing when that is how your tax dollars  are being spent?   We are scarring these children for the rest of their lives. We know  this. Taking children from their families and institutionalizing them  at a young age  [[Page H5099]]  will have consequences for that child, and for this country, and our  taxpayers, for the rest of their lives.   And we don't know for sure because none of the agencies have  responded, but we hear that parents are going to court in mass trials  and having their asylum claims denied--not heard, but denied--and then  the parents are deported.   Does the government then go out and find the child in Chicago or  Detroit, and send them back to their parents? Who knows? But probably  not.   There is a certain devious and genuinely cruel kind of evil in  separating a child from their mother. And they don't expect anyone on  the Republican side of the aisle to say anything, because it is part of  the strategy to help them keep their job.   Well, do you know what? Look, today, I am going to be joining with a  group of hundreds of advocates from a diverse array of organizations,  issues, and areas of this country, and we are going to demand answers.                                time  1015    And it is just not Luis Gutierrez, but my friend and ally, Joe  Crowley. We will be together today at a rally at Freedom Plaza at 1:30  here in Washington, D.C., and Joe and I will have other Members,  including some who signed that letter I talked about and got the ball  rolling.   Because do you know what? We cannot sit back and let our government  systematically ruin the lives of families and scar children for life.  When we said ``never again,'' we meant it. Never again, and that means  right here in the United States of America.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter to the Cabinet  Secretary, signed by 11 Democrats, demanding that answers be placed in  the Record.                                  Congress of the United States,                                       Washington, DC, June 8, 2018.      Hon. Kirstjen M. Nielsen,      Secretary of Homeland Security,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Jeff Sessions,      Attorney General of the United States, U.S. Department of           Justice, Washington, DC.      Hon. Alex M. Azar II,      Secretary, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,           Washington, DC.        Dear Secretary Nielsen, Attorney General Sessions, and       Secretary Azar: We write to express our strong and emphatic       opposition to the recently announced decision to prosecute       migrants and asylum-seekers, which is a reprehensible action       that violates U.S. treaty obligations, due process, and the       law. The consequence of this policy is that children are       routinely taken from their parents, with tragic results.       There are widespread reports of more than 11,000 migrant       children already in custody of the Department of Health and       Human Services (HHS). and hundreds of children--nearly half       younger than 12 years old detained in Border Patrol stations       when the law requires they be transferred within 72 hours to       HHS. Serious and legitimate concerns have been raised about       the deep trauma such separations cause these children, the       questionable conditions in which they are being held and the       absolute absence of a plan to reunite these children with       their parents and families.        Separating families by force and punishing children and       their families who are fleeing for their lives is immoral,       unnecessarily cruel, and violates every science-based child       welfare principle to act in the best interests of the child.       We refuse to stand by while you systematically harm and       traumatize thousands of children. Therefore, we call on the       Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security       to cease and desist with your so-called ``zero-tolerance''       policy and demand that HHS immediately begin reuniting these       separated children with their parents. We also insist that       you share with us the locations where you are holding these       children and allow us and other Members of Congress to visit       these locations and check on the conditions and welfare of       the children.        Given the severity of the situation, an immediate response       is appropriate. We ask that you respond to us with your plan       to meet these requests by 12 noon on Tuesday, June 12th.       Members of Congress stand ready to take action if these       issues are not addressed promptly. Morality and human decency       dictate that you reverse these policies and take immediate       actions to end the harm you are causing to the children you       wrenched from their parents and took into your custody.            Sincerely,          Joseph Crowley, John Lewis, Luis V. Gutierrez, Wm. Lacy             Clay, Pramila Jayapal, Judy Chu, Jan Schakowsky, Raul             M. Grijalva, Adriano Espaillat, Barbara Lee, Al Green,             Members of Congress.                            ____________________
