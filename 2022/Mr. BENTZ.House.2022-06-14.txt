 Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article from  Claremont Review of Books, spring, 2022, titled ``In the Red,'' by  Jeffrey H. Anderson.                                 In the Red                        Our glidepath to insolvency.         When Ross Perot won an impressive 19 percent of the popular       vote as an independent candidate for president in 1992, his       main issue was the national debt. In one of his unusual,       half-hour-long campaign ads, Perot declared, ``Just this       year, we ran up $341 billion in new debt . . . . That's our       legislators and our president trying to buy our vote, this       year, with what used to be our money.''        Three decades later, our national debt--which reached $4       trillion the year that Perot ran--has hit $30 trillion. If       our debt were to keep rising at that rate over the next 60       years, it would increase more than 50-fold and surpass $1.5       quadrillion (a quadrillion, which sounds like a made-up       number, is a thousand trillions).        The portion of the national debt that really matters is the       almost 80 percent that's held by entities--whether foreign or       stateside--other than the federal government. Such ``debt       held by the public,'' which is fueled by deficit spending,       has to be paid back to outside entities, whereas debt not       held by the public merely involves intragovernmental       transfers. Foreign holdings compose about a third of all debt       held by the public. Japan and China hold by far the most       (over $1 trillion each), some of which belongs to private       investors and some to government entities. Put another way,       China--an increasingly hostile world superpower--has more       than $1 trillion of leverage over us.        It's getting worse, fast. Our recent deficit spending has       been truly historic. In 2020, based on official federal       tallies (the basis for all figures in this essay), the       federal government brought in $3.4 trillion in tax revenues       and dished our $6.6 trillion in spending--so, for every $10       that came in, $19 went out. This lavish expenditure smashed       the deficit record like New York's Bob Beamon smashed the       long-jump record in the 1968 Olympics. Beamon soared past the       previous record--27 feet, 4\3/4\ inches--to make an       astounding 29-foot, 2\1/2\-inch jump. In similar fashion,       with the deficit record sitting at $1.4 trillion, the federal       government in 2020 spent a spectacular $3.1 trillion that it       didn't have. In 2020 alone, the government racked up more       deficit spending than it had during the first 36 fiscal years       of the postwar era (1947 through 1982), and that's after       adjusting for inflation.        Even before our blowout spending during COVID, our deficits       had already reached breathtaking levels. In constant 2012       dollars (to adjust for inflation), the average annual deficit       during the four years from 2016 through 2019--a stretch of       relative peace and prosperity--was $700 billion. In       comparison, during the four years from 1942 through 1945--      during which we funded and fought a two-front war against       Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan--the average annual deficit       was $505 billion in constant 2012 dollars. After the war       (using the Office of Management and Budget's composite       deflator), we owed $3 trillion of debt held by the public in       constant 2012 dollars (four times what we owed when the war       began). Subsequent statesmen succeeded in cutting that tally       in half by 1974 (to $1.5 trillion), but it rose back to end-      of-World-War-II levels by 1986 (to $3 trillion), doubled end-      of-World-War-II levels by 2008 ($6 trillion), tripled them by       2010 ($9 trillion), quadrupled them by 2014 ($12 trillion),       quintupled them by 2019 ($15 trillion), and sextupled them by       2020 ($18 trillion).        In other words, we added as much debt held by the public in       2020 alone as we did from the end of World War II to the end       of 2008, and we racked up more debt in the 12 months of 2020       than we did during the four years of the Second World War.       That's after adjusting for inflation.                                 No Big Deal         And yet, incredibly, many politicians and commentators       claim that our staggering indebtedness is nothing much to       worry about. Unwilling to face the challenge of reining in       the budget, we seem to have thrown up our hands in recent       years and chosen to treat our ballooning deficits as funny       money.        Debt apologists like to measure taxes, spending, and debt       in relation to the gross domestic product (GDP), rather than       in relation to inflation or population growth. That way, if       Americans' tax bills double, but the economy doubles in size       over that same span, it can be said that Americans aren't       paying any more in taxes (as a percentage of GDP). The same       thing is true with the debt, which only rises by this measure       if it increases faster than economic output.        This way of talking partially masks the magnitude of our       debt problem by assuming that our government should grow       every bit as fast as our economy. Even so, by the percent-of-      GDP measure, debt held by the public is now at approximately       end-of-World War II levels. But whereas it fell dramatically       after World War II, there is no reason to think it will do so       now. It more than tripled from 2001 (32 percent of GDP) to       2020 (100 percent of GDP), putting us on course to surpass       300 percent of GDP if it grows at the same rate from 2020 to       2039.        For all of the myriad cultural, technological, and moral       problems we face, few things would guarantee the undoing of       the founders' experiment in self-government more surely than       continuing to pile on the burden, to ourselves and our       posterity, of runaway debt. Thomas Jefferson described fiscal       profligacy as a precursor to inevitable misery and suffering,       the first in a stampede of apocalyptic horsemen. ``[T]he fore       horse of this frightful team is public debt,'' he wrote.       ``Taxation follows that, and in its train wretchedness and       oppression.'' This wretchedness will only be more keenly felt       as interest rates rise. Too much debt puts power in the hands       of our enemies and renders the average American poorer every       year.                             Mandatory Bankruptcy         The first step in avoiding a truly calamitous, debt-ridden       future is to understand bow we got ourselves into this       predicament to begin with. It is not national defense or even       the New Deal but rather the Great Society that is bankrupting       us.        A fundamental preliminary question is whether our       government taxes too little or spends too much. The answer is       easy to determine. In 2021, the federal government collected       more than three-and-a-half times as much money, in real       dollars per capita--that is, above and beyond inflation and       population growth--as it did at the start of the postwar       period. But it spent nearly seven times as much. From 1947       (the first postwar fiscal year, as FY 1946 began in July of       1945) through 2021, the population of the United States rose       2.3-fold, while prices rose nearly 13-fold. Combining these       two factors, the federal government could have collected and  [[Page H5513]]       spent 29 times as much in nominal dollars in 2021 as it did       in 1947 without collecting or spending any more in real       (inflation-adjusted) dollars per capita. Instead, the federal       government taxed more than 100 times as much in 2021 as in       1947 and spent almost 200 times as much. By any reasonable       standard, our government isn't afflicted by a shortage of tax       revenues but by an almost endless appetite for spending.        What are we spending all of that money on? Contra the       Left's repeated claims, it isn't defense--and our debt       problem wasn't created by Ronald Reagan. We actually spend       less per capita on defense now, after adjusting for       inflation, than we did during the Kennedy Administration.       Real per-capita defense spending fell from $2,283 in 1962 to       $1,953 in 2020, a drop of 14 percent. Even at the height of       the Reagan defense buildup, we exceeded the 1962 level by       only 2 percent. Meanwhile, real per-capita spending on       everything but defense increased more than eight-fold (from       $1,930 in 1962 to $15,646 in 2020). If overall federal       spending had followed the same trajectory as defense       spending, we would have had a surplus in 2020 of $2.1       trillion instead of a deficit of $3.1 trillion.        The problem isn't defense: it's health care. More       specifically, it was Lyndon Johnson and his (mostly)       Democratic congressional allies who put us on a glidepath       toward insolvency with the passage of their Great Society       programs. The New Deal put strain on the federal budget, to       be sure, but not enough to break it. By 1964, over three       decades after Franklin Roosevelt had taken office, federal       debt held by the public had fallen more than 40 percent from       the end of World War II, in real (inflation-adjusted)       dollars. The real deficit was 1/68th as large as it would be       in 2020. As the first Ford Mustangs rolled off the assembly       line, the country's debt was manageable and dropping, its       deficits were minimal, and seven of the postwar years had       actually produced surpluses. The next year, Johnson signed       legislation creating Medicare and Medicaid.        Broadly speaking, there are two ways to fund federal       programs. Congress either decides how much funding a program       will get (``discretionary'' spending), or just puts a program       on autopilot and finds out later how much it turned out to       cost (``mandatory'' spending). With discretionary spending,       Congress decides each year how much money to appropriate (for       something like national defense), taking into account such       quaint notions as what we need and what we can afford. With       ``mandatory'' spending, Congress creates a program and       pledges to fund it at the same time, even though no one knows       what its price tag will be.        Within ``mandatory'' spending, there are programs that have       a dedicated and generally sufficient revenue stream (such as       Social Security), and there are those that do not have a       dedicated revenue stream that comes anywhere near covering       their costs--such as Medicare and Medicaid (and Obamacare,       part of which expanded Medicaid). Payroll taxes cover only       about a third of Medicare's costs and none of Medicaid's. In       other words, no one who launched these programs had any idea       how to pay for them.        This has had extraordinary consequences. The first year       that Medicare spending visibly hit the books was 1967. From       that point through 2020, Medicare and Medicaid cost a       combined $17.8 trillion, while our combined federal deficits       over that same span were $17.9 trillion. In essence, our       deficit problem is a Medicare and Medicaid problem.                            The Father of Our Debt         By 1975, a decade after they were created, Medicare and       Medicaid were entrenched. From that point through 2019--the       most recent ``normal'' (pre-COVID) spending year--real per-      capita Medicare and Medicaid spending rose nine-fold (more       than triple the rise in Social Security costs over that       period). In 1975, we spent more than five times as much on       defense as on Medicare and Medicaid combined. By 2019, we       spent 56 percent more on Medicare and Medicaid than on       defense.        In 2019, the federal government collected about $10,500 in       revenues per capita and spent about $13,500. Here's how       Americans' contributions to the federal treasury were       allocated. The first $1,000 essentially just went into the       trash--it was used to pay interest on the debt, not to buy       anything. About $2,000 was spent on defense and another       $2,000 on non-defense discretionary spending. Roughly $3,000       was spent on Social Security, $3,000 on Medicare and Medicaid       (with about a 60 percent-40 percent split between them), and       $2,500 on other ``mandatory'' spending, to include much of       Obamacare, unemployment, welfare, etc. So, in all, about       $4,000 (or roughly 30 percent) was discretionary spending,       actually voted upon by Congress, and about $9,500 (roughly 70       percent) was either ``mandatory'' spending or payments on the       national debt.        If we had a Mount Rushmore of deficit spending, then,       Lyndon Johnson would merit George Washington's place of honor       as the father of our debt. Beside him would be the three most       recent presidents. For we have run up more debt under Barack       Obama, Donald Trump, and Joe Biden--even after adjusting       for inflation--than we did under the previous 42       presidents combined. After a brief period of fiscal       responsibility under Bill Clinton, the average annual       deficit soared to $455 billion under George W. Bush ($41       billion more than under his father), $857 billion under       Obama, and $1.462 trillion under Trump (who was averaging       $805 billion even before COVID hit).        Again--amazingly--these figures are adjusted for inflation.       They are based on each president's having been responsible       for the deficit the year after he took office--for example,       Obama, who took office when fiscal year 2009 was already       underway, was responsible for fiscal years 2010 through 2017.       But note the following exceptions: the $179 billion in Obama-      signed ``stimulus'' funds spent in 2009, and the $1.115       trillion in Biden-signed COVID ``stimulus'' funds spent in       2021 are treated as part of Obama's and Biden's deficit       tallies, respectively; and the $147 billion in TARP loans       repaid in 2010 ($110 billion) and 2011 ($37 billion) are       counted as reductions in George W. Bush's deficit tallies, as       they paid back money that was counted as deficit spending       when it was loaned out on Bush's watch.        Clinton is the obvious outlier, having managed an average       annual surplus of $3 billion during his eight years in       office, six of them with a Republican Congress. After Perot       sounded the alarm and Republicans won the House for the first       time in four decades, Speaker Newt Gingrich and his       Republican colleagues--working with Clinton--made good on the       Contract with America's pledge to balance the budget. They       cut defense spending, passed welfare reform, benefitted from       a strong economy that increased revenues, and were able to       lower federal interest payments as the debt fell. Most       surprisingly, however, they managed to cut Medicare spending,       via reforms passed through the Balanced Budget Act of 1997       (BBA). After Medicare's costs had quadrupled from 1982 to       1997, they actually dropped from 1998 to 1999--not just in       comparison to inflation, but in terms of the actual number of       dollars that went out the door.        It was around this time that the ``experts'' decided the       work was done and the free-spending days could return once       again. In 2002, after the George W. Bush tax cues had been       enacted, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected that       the federal government would run a surplus in nine out of the       ten years from 2003 through 2012 and a decade-long surplus of       $2.3 trillion. It turned out that the federal government ran       a deficit in all ten of those years and a decade-long deficit       of $7.l trillion. The CBO also projected that debt held by       the public at the end of 2012 would be $1.3 trillion. It       turned out to be $11.3 trillion, so the CBO was off by $10       trillion and a factor of nearly nine.        Despite this subsequent debt explosion, the Clinton-      Gingrich era was a successful one in terms of fiscal       responsibility. Indeed, over the past 40 years, deficits have       been lowest when a Democrat has been in the White House and       Republicans have controlled both houses of Congress. The       second-best scenario has been a Republican president with       either party controlling both houses of Congress. Next-best       has been a Democratic president paired with a mixed Congress       (with each party controlling one house), followed by a       Republican president paired with a mixed Congress. The worst       scenario has been Democratic control of the whole government.       Over the past four decades, Democratic control (average       deficit of $1.1 trillion in constant 2012 dollars) has been       more than twice as costly as Republican control ($490       billion).        No matter who is in power, however, about 70 percent of our       spending--consuming about 90 percent of our tax revenues--is       on autopilot. To balance the budget by focusing solely on       cutting those portions of the budget that Congress actively       controls through the appropriations process, we would have to       cut discretionary spending--which includes defense--by about       75 percent. Any realistic effort to balance the budget,       therefore, must focus on ``mandatory'' spending.                               Fixing Our Mess         Medicare absolutely must be reformed. Its autopilot has       malfunctioned and is flying not only the plane but also the       country into the ground. We came tantalizingly close to       fixing things back in 1999, when the National Bipartisan       Commission on the Future of Medicare grew out of the BBA and       drafted an appealing blueprint for reform. The Commission,       chaired by Democratic Senator John Breaux and Republican       Congressman Bill Thomas, floated a variety of proposals, most       notably ``premium support,'' which would utilize private       competition to keep public costs down. But events intervened:       Politico healthcare editor Adriel Bettelheim writes that       ``with the Monica Lewinsky scandal festering and the threat .       . . of impeachment growing, [Clinton] took a very public turn       to appease his left flank'' and turned against the commission       just as it was wrapping up its 11 months of work.        Nevertheless, the commission was a serious effort at       exploring promising ideas, many of which Congressman Paul       Ryan picked up during his Obamacare-fighting era. Ryan's       advocacy of premium support did not keep him from being       tapped as Mitt Romney's 2012 running mate, nor did it hurt       the Romney-Ryan ticket (Romney did that all on his own). This       suggests that Medicare reform can be politically viable when       advanced with determination and skill.        Medicaid also cannot go on in its present form. Its funding       system, whereby every $1 of state funding is matched by       between $1 and $9 of federal funding, invites waste and       inefficiency. The more a state spends on Medicaid, the more       federal money it gets. If it manages to reform its Medicaid       program, it gets at most half of the savings--usually far       less. Also, states often hire consultants who concoct       elaborate shell games to exaggerate states' Medicaid funding,       thereby  [[Page H5514]]       bringing in even more federal money, much of which funds non-      Medicaid ventures. If Medicaid were reformed so that each       stare simply received a given amount of federal funding,       independent of the state's level of funding, that would       presumably remove most of these perverse incentives and       reduce Medicaid's costs.        Social Security has always been self-funded, but it too is       projected to dip into the red about a dozen years from now.       It poses nowhere near the threat to our fiscal solvency that       Medicare and Medicaid do, bur its costs have still risen       faster than overall federal spending, and it does need to be       sensibly revised. The percentage of the U.S. population that       is over age 75 is roughly the same as the percentage that was       over age 65 when Social Security was created, yet the       eligibility age for receiving full retirement benefits has       been raised just two years (from 65 to 67) over the past       eight decades. Gradually (but not too gradually) raising that       age to reflect current biological and fiscal realities is an       obvious and necessary fix.        In addition to changing individual programs, there are       measures we can take to promote fiscal responsibility more       generally. Simply demanding a balanced budget, either as a       matter of policy or through a constitutional amendment, will       not do: the state could still spend as much as it accrued,       which might encourage ever-greater levels of taxation to fund       an ever-larger government, as in many European countries.       Instead, we ought to focus on measures that can keep spending       itself low.        For instance, the American citizenry would be more apt to       view the debt as a shared concern if nearly everyone paid at       least some income tax, as Florida Senator Rick Scott has       proposed. At the least, no one's income tax bill should go       negative, as it does when tax credits are made       ``refundable''--available not as a tax cut but as a payment       to those who don't pay income tax. A few years ago, I       released ``The Main Street Tax Plan'' (Hudson Institute,       2016), which the Tax Foundation said would reduce deficits.       It declared, ``Nearly everyone should be paying something in       income tax, however small, and Americans shouldn't regard       April 15 as a payday.''        Some, such as Senator Mitch McConnell, oppose Scott's       proposal because--in McConnell's words--it ``raises taxes''       (for people who don't pay income taxes). Those who share this       concern should consider pairing refund reform with an end to       the Medicare payroll tax. Unlike the Social Security payroll       tax, which is viral and funds Social Security as a (more or       less) pay-in-for-yourself program, the Medicare payroll tax       funds only about a third of Medicare and helps perpetuate the       false notion that Medicare too is mostly pay-in-for-yourself.       Eliminating the Medicare payroll tax would soften the       perception of Medicare as an entitlement, simplify the tax       code, and ease the tax burden of the working poor. Combining       this with Scott's plan would encourage more people to care       about the size and scope of the federal government.        In 2010, back when the Tea Party was ascendant and the       national debt was $13 trillion rather than $30 trillion, I       proposed (in National Affairs) a Limited Government Amendment       to the Constitution. Such an amendment would limit annual       increases in federal spending to inflation plus two       percentage points, except during a formally declared war, or       if two-thirds of Congress and three-quarters of state       legislatures authorized additional spending for other       reasons. An amendment in this spirit could greatly facilitate       fiscal restraint.        It has become fashionable to think of constitutional       amendments as relics from the past. But then, so are fiscal       responsibility and--increasingly--representative government.       The founders made the Constitution amendable for a reason,       and we should take our cues from them. In the late 1990s, we       showed--briefly--that it's possible to take action to reverse       our course and help save our country from the tragic fate       that Jefferson described. But the first step is to recognize       that the $30 trillion elephant in the room isn't going away.       It's just growing bigger.     Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition, sadly, to H.R. 2773.  Although protecting our endangered species is truly a worthy cause, our  country is not fiscally sound, and to commit $1.4 billion a year in  perpetuity is exactly the kind of spending that has landed us in the  mess we are now in.   Let me be clear: we do not have the money. In the 30 years since  1992, the national debt has increased from $4 trillion to $30 trillion.  Mr. Anderson notes in his article that:         At that rate over the next 60 years, our debt would       increase by more than 50-fold to surpass $1.5 quadrillion. In       case one is wondering, a quadrillion is 1,000 trillions.    Mr. Speaker, some might say: Just raise taxes. But, Mr. Speaker, the  author of the article points out that, in fact, the Federal Government  last year taxed over 100 times what it did in the first postwar year  and spent nearly 200 times as much. So taxes are not the problem.  Spending is the problem.   The $1.4 billion per year is perpetual. Now, under anyone's measure,  perpetuity is a long time. Since this money will never be paid back,  some might say like those deep in credit card debt: We will just pay  the interest.   The interest on $1.5 billion for 30 years at current rates of 3.4  percent is $51 million a year. But, Mr. Speaker, we have to look at the  current total interest bill. It is estimated to be almost $400 billion  a year or about 8.7 percent of everything we spend.   Why would we add to this enormous obligation?   There is a quote by Ernest Hemingway: How did you go bankrupt?   The answer is: Gradually, then suddenly.   Mr. Speaker, this is exactly how bankruptcy works. You can keep  spending recklessly and rack up debts for a while--even a long while-- but at some point, it comes to an end abruptly. We have ignored our  Nation's spending problems for far too long. We have been going  bankrupt gradually, and I fear the day will come when we will go  bankrupt immediately.   We must correct this course. For this reason, I cannot support,  sadly, this bill.                                time  1515     Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment No. 8.   This fiscally responsible amendment would establish a 1.85 percent  administrative cap for the Department of the Interior when implementing  title III of this bill.   Title I of the bill, which provides funding to State fish and  wildlife departments for species conservation, includes a 1.85 percent  administrative cap.   Title II of the bill, which covers Tribal Wildlife Conservation and  Restoration, includes a 3 percent administrative cap for the Department  of the Interior.   However, as currently drafted, title III does not have an  administrative cap.   The original intent of this bill was to provide States with funding  to conserve species of greatest conservation need.   Unfortunately, the majority decided to ignore the committee process  by airdropping in title III to give more funding to the U.S. Fish and  Wildlife Service.   Not only did they circumvent process to add the entire title to the  bill, they didn't carry over any of the good government amendments made  in committee.   Under the current text, the State and Tribal portions of the bill  would be subject to strict administrative caps, but the Federal  Government would not be. This is backwards, as the U.S. Fish and  Wildlife Service needs much more oversight since the agency is part of  the reason we find ourselves in the position we are currently in with  respect to the broken Endangered Species Act.   Additionally, the programs funded in title III already receive  existing appropriations, and if the majority would like to increase  them, they should do it through the appropriations process instead of  airdropping in another layer of statute and bureaucracy into the  legislation.   For these reasons, title III should be struck from the bill.  Unfortunately, the majority refused to allow a vote on my colleague  from Utah's amendment that would have done just that.   The very least we can do is at least ensure that title III is subject  to the same administrative requirements as the other titles.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
