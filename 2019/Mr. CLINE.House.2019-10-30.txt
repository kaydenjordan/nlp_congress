 Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Domestic  Violence Awareness Month to acknowledge the strength of survivors and  to call for an end to the abuse experienced by more than 2 million  Americans each year.   Throughout my career, I have fought to end the cycle of domestic  violence.   My contributions in the House of Delegates in Virginia have helped  make the State have some of the toughest criminal penalties for  domestic abusers. During that time, I patroned legislation requiring  domestic abusers to undergo counseling and a court-mandated treatment  program. I also worked across the aisle to make strangulation a felony  in Virginia's criminal code and make sure that abusers charged with  such a crime would have the presumption against bail.   Congress must strive to protect victims and survivors, and I look  forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  pass commonsense reforms that ensure safety and security of those who  suffer abuse.                            ____________________
