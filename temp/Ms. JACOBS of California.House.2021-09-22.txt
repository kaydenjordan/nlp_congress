 Mr. Speaker, I rise to offer amendment No.  41 as the designee of Ms. Lee of California.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this amendment offered by my friend and colleague,  Congresswoman Barbara Lee, restores the NDAA to the original funding  level requested by the White House, the Pentagon, and the chair of the  Armed Services Committee.   Specifically, it would remove the Rogers amendment which would  increase the pending authorization by $23.9 billion. When Mr. Rogers'  amendment was offered during committee markup, I voted against it, and  nothing over the last few weeks has led me to change my mind.   Mr. Speaker, just 3 weeks ago we ended our military operations in  Afghanistan--America's longest war and one that started when I was in  middle school. Yet what some are concluding from that is that what we  need is more war, more weapons, and billions of dollars more than even  what the Pentagon themselves are asking for.   So many of my colleagues who supported Mr. Rogers' amendment note the  emerging threat from China as their reason to support this increase,  even though very little of this increase is even relevant to China and  most national security experts agree that making needed domestic  investments is far more important to our competitiveness with China.  Instead, this inflated budget seeks to sugarcoat that for years we have  been decreasing investments in diplomacy and the support of our  servicemembers in favor of purchasing new, unproven, and un-needed  weapons.   We need to have an honest conversation about the Pentagon budget and  focus on what is achievable, what the real threats are, and what we  actually need for our national security. For the last 20 years, we have  been told that we need more, but I think it is time to recognize that  there are simply not military solutions to every problem.   I thank Congresswoman Lee for offering this amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'', and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Washington (Mr. Smith), who is the esteemed chair of the  Armed Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I  have remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  distinguished gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Ocasio-Cortez).    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, I hear my colleagues on the  other side talk a lot about the needs from Afghanistan. What is  interesting is that in the continuing resolution that this body passed  just yesterday there was additional supplemental funding for  Afghanistan, and yet my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  decided to vote against it.    I also hear them talk about the threats and the briefings that  supposedly we were not in. I sit on both the Foreign Affairs and Armed  Services Committees, I assure you, Mr. Speaker, I have been to every  single one of those classified briefings on the threats. I am very  aware of the threats. But we need to dispel the notion that our ability  to respond to the threats depends solely on the size of our military.   I am honored to represent San Diego, a proud military community. They  don't need a larger budget. They need one that takes their needs into  account, which means better wages and housing free of mold, childcare  and job opportunities for their spouses, and they need a government  that goes through every diplomatic channel before making the decision  to send them to war.   Earlier this month vice chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General  John Hyten asked: Do you think any taxpayer in this country would  believe that for $700 billion a year we can't have a great defense?   Hyten said: We should be able to, and it is crazy that we can't.   He is right. It is crazy, and more of us need to be willing to say  what everyone knows is true: we don't need to spend money even the  Pentagon themselves are not asking for.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1715
