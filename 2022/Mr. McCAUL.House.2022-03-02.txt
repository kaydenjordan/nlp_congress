 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me just thank Chairman Meeks for his leadership.  This is really a historic time, not for only this Nation, but the  world, for Ukraine. It is a time when we come together, not as  Republicans or Democrats, but as Americans in strong support of the  people of Ukraine.   I also want to thank Congresswoman Victoria Spartz, who is from  Ukraine, who knows this story firsthand, and who very passionately has  told her story about what it means, a country that has endured Hitler,  a country that has endured Stalin, and now a country that is enduring  Mr. Putin and Russian aggression.   As we stand here, Ukrainians are fighting for their country and for  their very lives. Vladimir Putin has launched the largest attack in  Europe since World War II.                                time  1430    His war machine has unleashed a brutal barrage of missiles and  rockets on innocent Ukrainian civilians. In fact, there are 40 miles  just north of Kyiv of tanks and military weaponry that is getting ready  to go in and encircle the capital city.   But the people of Ukraine are inspiring the world with their bravery  in the face of this, of Putin's evil and unprovoked attack. Fathers and  mothers, teachers and shop owners, taxi drivers and students are all  taking up arms, making Molotov cocktails, joining Ukrainian soldiers to  defend their country.   They are standing in front of the tanks, standing in front of the  tanks. I have seen a child standing in front of a tank just like  Tiananmen Square and the images coming out that are sent around the  world so we can all witness this, this war against humanity and human  rights, war crimes.   They are risking their lives to fight for freedom, and that is what  this Nation stands for, freedom and democracy.   Despite the terror inflicted upon them by Putin's bombs and rockets,  the Ukrainian people have courageously refused to relent. Vladimir  Putin has underestimated them. He has underestimated their strength and  their bravery. The resiliency of the Ukrainian people has been an  inspiration, really, for the world.   We were told in our briefings, well, this will last 2 or 3 days, but  they have stood up. Putin needs to understand that he has  miscalculated, and this will cost him a very, very high price. He has  underestimated the strength and bravery to his own peril.   So I am pleased that we are able to come together, not as Republicans  or Democrats, as I said, but really, as Americans, as we should, to  express and send a strong message in support of the people of Ukraine  and against this tyrant and this monster who is savagely killing  civilians, as I speak.   We have all seen the images of the women and the children and the  refugees as they leave their fathers and husbands behind who are left  to fight this war.  [[Page H1249]]    This resolution really does one thing: to tell the world in one  united voice that the United States of America stands opposed to  oppression, that we stand with the people of Ukraine, and we stand  against Mr. Putin's aggression. We must ensure that Putin fails, and I  believe long term, he will.   I am hopeful that today's resolution will also lead to additional  constructive bipartisan steps to properly arm the Ukrainians in any way  possible, as they have told us, we don't need your troops, but we need  your weapons to fight against the Russians.   You know, there was a tweet that came out from a dead Russian soldier  who sent a text to his mother, saying, I thought they were going to  welcome us, that we were liberating them. And yet I am seeing  Ukrainians and children being run over by our tanks. And he says to his  mother, this is the worst thing I have ever seen.   He lies. He is deceptive. He lied to his own people that he is  liberating these Ukrainians who are oppressed by the Russians. This is  no liberation. This is not a liberation ceremony.   This is tyranny at its worst, and oppression. We need to continue to  support them as long as even one Ukrainian citizen continues to stand  up to Russia's tyranny.   As in February 1941, facing a devastating bombing campaign by the  Nazis--we can see the parallels here--this is similar to Hitler  invading Poland.   When they talked about the blitz, Winston Churchill made a direct  plea to the United States for assistance, and it is timeless. It  actually resonates today. He said, ``Put your confidence in us. . . .  We shall not fail or falter; we shall not weaken or tire. Neither the  sudden shock of battle, nor the long-drawn trials of vigilance and  exertion will wear us down. Give us the tools, and we will finish the  job.''   Mr. Speaker, this is what the Ukrainian people want. It is what they  are asking for. It is what they need. It is what the United States of  America and our NATO allies will deliver.   Today, facing the onslaught of Putin's missiles and tanks, the  Ukrainian President, Zelensky, a most courageous leader, as we have  seen, who didn't run away from his country like President Ghani. He is  in the bunker right now, knowing that his very life and his survival is  on the line.   He made the same plea to us, and today, we have the opportunity to  tell Ukraine that we have confidence in them by supporting this  measure, that we will give them the tools they need to finish the job.   So let me, once again, thank the chairman. This is when the Foreign  Affairs Committee is at its best, when we come together as Americans.  As Eliot Engel always said, partisanship stops at the water's edge, and  I firmly believe that commitment as well.   I urge my Members to support this. I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. MEEKS: Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), who just recently was walking the streets  of Kyiv, talking to the people, listening to them, and their  determination to preserve their democracy. Mr.   David Cicilline.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Spartz), the lead Republican on this  resolution, who was born and raised in Ukraine. Her grandmother is  still there and has told her the stories of Hitler and Stalin and how  bad this situation is on the ground.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Smith), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee and one  of the longest serving Members of Congress as well.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Chabot), the ranking member on the Subcommittee on Asia, the  Pacific, Central Asia, and Nonproliferation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from the  great State of Texas (Mr. Pfluger), a member of the Foreign Affairs  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the leader for his remarks. I think it is very  important this Chamber passes this resolution unanimously to send one  voice to Putin that the American people stand for the Ukrainian people  and against Mr. Putin.   I think it is no coincidence--to me, it is fitting--that today is  Texas Independence Day. My forefathers fought for freedom and liberty  for the same purpose, from tyranny.   Since 2014, the world has watched the Ukrainian people fight to forge  their own destiny in the face of violent attacks by Russia. They are  facing down  [[Page H1254]]  Putin's missiles and tanks, risking life and limb for their freedom  today.   As President Zelensky warned the Russian troops invading his country  just a few days ago, as he sits in the bunker, putting his life on the  line, he said: ``If they try to take our country, our freedom, our  lives, the lives of our children, we will be defending ourselves. . . .  As you attack, it will be our faces you see, not our backs.''   Today, we have the opportunity to honor his leadership and the  bravery of the Ukrainian people, to send a strong message to these  brave men and women that they are not alone, that the United States  stands with them and will continue to stand with them for as long as it  takes.   Mr. Speaker, again, I urge my colleagues to vote in support, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
