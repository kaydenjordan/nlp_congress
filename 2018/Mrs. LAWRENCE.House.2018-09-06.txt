 Mr. Speaker, I rise to address the extremely serious  and ongoing issue of safe drinking water in our schools.   This week in my hometown of Detroit, the Detroit Public Schools began  the year without safe and clean drinking water. The superintendent  chose to shut the water off to the entire school district after 16 of  the schools tested positive for elevated levels of lead and copper.   What should have been an exciting first day of school was  overshadowed by the fears of lead poisoning and unsanitary learning  conditions.   This, unfortunately, is no surprise. We have seen this happen all  over the country, where schools put bags over their drinking fountains  because they are not safe for the children to consume the water.   This is a consequence of years of neglecting our Nation's  infrastructure. For years, I have spoken out against the severe funding  decrease in our infrastructure and our public schools. For too long we  have kicked the can down the road and ignored this critical issue of  safe drinking water in America.   Deliberately not funding necessary and long overdue upgrades for our  water infrastructure hurts women, children, and especially the poor and  people of color.   We cannot repeat the Flint water crisis, and we must learn from our  mistakes. This situation demands a sense of urgency and should be  handled in a timely manner.   As adults, we are responsible for protecting our children. We are the  ones who must make the right decisions. This is not a partisan issue,  but a public health issue.   The Detroit Public Schools and the Detroit children, every day they  work hard to face the challenges to simply obtain an excellent  education.   We need to address the immediate health concerns. And we need  resources to protect our children from future harm.   Every child must be tested. I appreciate and applaud the  superintendent's positive response to this emergency. I urge the school  district and the city to use whatever resources are immediately  available to test these children for lead poisoning. We need to know  how widespread this situation is. The tests will help us understand how  much damage our children have been exposed to.   Children covered by Medicare are already required to receive blood  lead screening tests. I will work with the city and the State to see  how we can get every child in Detroit tested.   Without adequate resources and access to information, we stand to  fail our children. This is unacceptable.   We also learned from Flint that professionals, not politicians,  should be making health decisions. That is why I introduced H.R. 1909,  the Environmental Health Workforce Act.   Only 28 States require the environmental health workforce to be  credentialed. And unfortunately, Michigan is not one of those States.  This legislation I am proposing will ensure every State has a  credentialed workforce.   We would not go to a doctor who did not have an MD. Why would we let  someone who is making decisions about our water quality and food do it  without proper qualifications.   These emergencies show us that we cannot keep relying on a patchwork  of quick fixes. We don't know how many children are in danger until  every child is tested. We need to truly invest in long-term solutions.  [[Page H7878]]    As I continue monitoring this situation, I will continue pursuing the  issue until we have solutions and funding on a Federal level to protect  our children.   Water is not a luxury, it is a necessity for life. And the least of  ours, our children, should not be put in danger.                            ____________________
