 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  American tradition and heritage, American law enforcement, and the  sovereignty of our Nation.   I stand here in the Chamber of the people's House, a 57-year-old  American man who has never witnessed such division and insanity as I  have observed here in D.C., where right is wrong, where American  traditions are rejected, where Christian principles are ridiculed,  where many of my colleagues across the aisle envision an America with  no sovereign borders, no fossil fuels, and no Second Amendment, a land  where no airplanes fly, where police cannot arrest, and where jails do  not exist.   I remind my colleagues that we are here to serve the best interests  and security of the American people. We were not elected by citizens of  foreign soil, nor should we allow our bicameral, bipartisan Congress to  become infected with anti-American sentiment.                            ____________________
