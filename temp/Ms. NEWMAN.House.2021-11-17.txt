 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the transgender  Americans who must fight every day for their right to live as their  authentic selves.   This Saturday, November 20, marks Transgender Day of Remembrance, a  day to honor the memory of the transgender and nonbinary people whose  lives were lost this year in acts of violence.   Tomorrow, I am proudly joining my colleagues and fellow Transgender  Equality Task Force co-chairs, Representatives Pramila Jayapal and  Jennifer Wexton, to formally introduce a resolution to nationally  commemorate this very somber annual observance.   At least 375 transgender or nonbinary individuals across the globe  have been killed this year--375. In our Nation alone, it breaks my  heart to say that, so far this year, the Human Rights Campaign has  reported at least 46 transgender or gender nonconforming people were  killed by violent means. We say ``at least'' because we believe this  number is actually much higher due to the unfortunate prevalence of  underreporting or misreporting violence against this community.   They were friends, family, loved ones, parents. They were taken far  too soon. We must honor their memory with a commitment to fight anti- trans hate and violence anywhere it exists.   It is with this commitment that I now read the names of each of these  Americans into the Congressional Record. May their memory serve as a  call to action for all of us:   Tyianna Alexander   Samuel Edmund Damian Valentin   Bianca ``Muffin'' Bankz   Dominique Jackson   Fifty Bandz   Alexus Braxton   Chyna Carrillo   Jeffrey ``JJ'' Bright   Jasmine Cannady   Jenna Franks   Diamond Kyree Sanders   Rayanna Pardo   Jaida Peterson   Dominique Lucious   Remy Fennel   Tiara Banks   Natalia Smut   Iris Santos   Tiffany Thomas   Keri Washington   Jahaira DeAlto   Whispering Wind Bear Spirit   Sophie Vasquez   Danika ``Danny'' Henson   Serenity Hollis   Oliver ``Ollie'' Taylor   Thomas Hardin   Poe Black   EJ Boykin   Aidelen Evans   Taya Ashton   Shai Vanderpump   Tierramarie Lewis   Miss CoCo   Pooh Johnson   Disaya Monaee   Briana Hamilton   Kier Lapri Kartier   Mel Groves   Royal Poetical Starz   Zoella ``Zoey'' Rose Martinez   Jo Acker   Jessi Hart   Rikkey Outumuro   Marquiisha Lawrence   Jenny De Leon   Madam Speaker, may we honor their memory today and every day.   Madam Speaker, I yield to my colleague from the great State of Rhode  Island (Mr. Cicilline), the chair of the congressional LGBTQ-Plus  Equality Caucus.    Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Cicilline, who is an  amazing champion for the Equality Act and all things LGBTQI. I couldn't  be more pleased to be his colleague.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Takano),  a co-chair of the Congressional LGBTQ-plus Equality Caucus and the  chairman of the House Veterans Affairs' Committee, where he champions  legislation to serve our LGBTQ-plus veterans.    Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Takano for all his  advocacy and leadership.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from the great Commonwealth  of Massachusetts (Ms. Pressley), who is a champion of LGBTQ-plus rights  and whose intersectional approach is simply inspirational.    Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Pressley for all her  great work.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from the great State of  California (Ms. Jacobs), who is a proud sister to a trans brother and  gender nonconforming sibling.    Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Jacobs for her kind  remarks.   I have one more speaker, Madam Speaker. We have Representative Al  Green, who is an LGBTQ ally.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Green).    Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Green. He is  absolutely right. All is all and love is love.   That concludes our Special Order hour. I want to thank each of my  colleagues this evening for their participation.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
