 Mr. Speaker, I am here to talk for just a moment about law  and order. I am here to talk about how we as a body can prevent more  needless tragedies in our country. I am here to  [[Page H330]]  talk about true justice. Specifically, justice for victims of dangerous  sanctuary city policies.   We have all heard the stories. Kate Steinle brutally murdered in San  Francisco by an illegal immigrant who was repeatedly released.   In Washington State, an illegal named Rosalio Ramos-Romas was  deported four times before authorities arrested him in October of 2017.  Once notified of his arrest, ICE issued a detainer request asking local  authorities to imprison him for an additional 48 hours. But, instead,  local authorities ignored the detainer request and allowed Rosalio back  into the community, where he eventually murdered his cousin and hid the  body in a dumpster.   In my State of North Carolina, the Mecklenburg County Sheriff's  Office refused to notify ICE and comply with lawful detainer requests  when it released dangerous illegal immigrants from the county jail. One  was charged with multiple domestic violence offenses for strangling a  woman and threatening to kill her.    These are not isolated incidents of violence, but, rather, the norm  in sanctuary cities across America. The truth is that sanctuary city  policies are unnecessary and they only threaten the safety of our  families and our neighbors. This lawlessness leads to tragedies that  are simply not acceptable and should not be allowed by our leaders.   That is why I introduced the Justice for Victims of Sanctuary Cities  Act with Senator Thom Tillis. Our bill would allow anyone harmed by an  illegal immigrant in a sanctuary city to sue the sanctuary city or  State for the damages that it caused. It also withholds certain grant  funding from jurisdictions that refuse to comply with Federal law. This  move will put lawless cities on notice and will, hopefully, persuade  them to reverse course, enforce our laws, and keep our streets safe.   At a time when the current administration refuses to crack down on  sanctuary cities, Congress has the responsibility to act. It is long  past time that cities who refuse to enforce our immigration face legal  consequences. This has to stop.                  Uneven Allocation of the COVID-19 Vaccine     Mr. Speaker, last month, over 10,000 patients in and around  my district had their COVID-19 vaccination appointments forcibly  canceled, throwing seniors and frontline workers into uncertainty. This  mistake was the result of an uneven allocation process and bureaucratic  confusion. It is unacceptable and something has to be done.   I sent a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services  demanding immediate answers for my constituents. I understand that an  expedited national vaccine rollout is complex. It is a tough  undertaking. But the faster vaccine doses are allocated to States like  mine in North Carolina, the sooner we will be able to defeat this virus  once and for all.   The people of my community deserve clarity and honesty when it comes  to vaccines from the Federal Government, and I am going to continue to  get answers for them.                          Anniversary of Roe v. Wade     Mr. Speaker, the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade was  decided 48 years ago last month. Since abortion was made legal, more  than 60 million unborn children have had their lives prematurely ended.  This is a matter of conscience for me, and I believe that life begins  at conception.   In recent years, advances in science and medicine have given us an  increasingly vivid picture of what life in the womb is like. A child  has a heartbeat at just 6 weeks. A child feels pain at 20 weeks.   Science makes clear that life exists in the womb and, therefore, an  unborn child is entitled to the most fundamental of human rights, and  that, Mr. Speaker, is the right to live.   This issue transcends what it means to be an American and goes to the  core of what makes us human. I hope that one day soon, the Supreme  Court corrects their constitutional error so that the American people  can reassert their voice in determining the moral question of our time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, today is really about one party single- handedly canceling a Member of the other party because of something  said before that Member was even elected.   This isn't about agreeing or disagreeing with the comments. This is  [[Page H357]]  about Democrats abusing their power and using it to cancel.   This sets a very dangerous precedent. There are Members across the  aisle who have said alarming things recently. They have made anti- Semitic comments repeatedly. They have made anti-American comments  repeatedly. And they have made comments threatening violence  repeatedly.   Cancel culture should not take over our country. Cancel culture  should not take over our tech platforms. And cancel culture certainly  should not take over the House of Representatives.   We need to let the gentlewoman from Georgia serve and to allow her  constituents to judge her performance at the ballot box.
