 Mr. Speaker, later today we will begin voting on the  NDAA, the National Defense Authorization Act, the Pentagon budget.   Moving this legislation forward has almost always been a bipartisan  issue in Congress. It takes on the responsibilities of funding our  military. It protects our national security. It has been a bipartisan  effort for nearly six decades.   But last night, after midnight, Republican leadership decided to  bring to the floor dozens of partisan divisive amendments. If adopted,  these amendments would transform this bill and transform our military.  It is quite literally a wish list of the rightwing extremist colleagues  on the other side of the aisle.   There is an amendment to end all affirmative action in our officer  corps, something even our Supreme Court refused to do just a few weeks  ago. There is an amendment to full stop, end all aid to Ukraine, at the  very moment we are expanding NATO and working on protecting democracy  abroad on behalf of all democracies.   Another one that they passed was a divisive amendment that prevents  female servicemembers in the military from accessing the reproductive  care that they need and they deserve. Plain and simple, last night,  they chose culture war over national security, and they are doing so as  part of a clear effort to prevent every single American woman from  accessing care. It is part and parcel of a larger campaign to impose a  nationwide ban on abortion.   Last night, like I said, in the dead of night, the Freedom Caucus  passed this amendment to stop the military from paying for a bus ticket  or a plane ticket for any woman who needs an abortion, and it is proof  of this bigger plan.   In addition to this amendment that passed last night, we have  amendments in the Appropriations Committee that are the same thing.   We have a single Senator, Senator Tuberville, who is holding and  blocking 250 military promotions right now, the head of the Marine  Corps, the head of the Army, the head of the Navy, because he objects  to the fact that a woman might get a paid bus ticket to get an  abortion.   If blocking these nominations continues, we will have no Chairman of  the Joint Chiefs, no commandant of the Marine Corps for the first time  in 134 years, no Army chief of staff. His colleagues, who claim to care  about national security, are letting him get away with it. Now, they  have used this bipartisan bill in order to make their point.   Forty-six percent of Active Duty servicewomen are stationed in States  that now either ban or very severely restrict abortion. They have no  choice. They are based there. They have signed up to serve their  country. They have been put on a base in Texas or Alabama. That is not  their choice. That is their duty.  [[Page H3486]]    The authors of these amendments are not set on just letting the  reversal of Roe sit and having States make their own decisions. The  authors of these amendments are from Alabama and Texas, which ban  abortion, including in the case of rape or incest.   Why is this important? It is important because we need to hear what  people are telling us. They are telling us that they will not stop with  the reversal of Roe that happened a year ago. They will not stop when  States like Michigan organize to make sure we have protections for  women who want abortions. They want every single American, starting  with our servicemembers, to live under the same rules that they choose  in their States. We need to hear what they are telling us and act  accordingly. They are choosing politics over our women in uniform,  choosing politics in the Senate over our national security.    So, please, I have never in my life, as someone who served in the  CIA, who served in the Pentagon, thought about voting against this  bill. I believe in it. It is about paying our military and getting them  what they need. Please keep your culture war baggage out of national  security.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, I rise today with my colleagues in  opposition to this amendment, and I want to make sure that everyone  understands what this amendment means. This amendment, plus other  amendments that are the exact same in the Appropriations Committee,  plus the same hold that is going on by Senator Tuberville, are putting  culture wars ahead of national security.   We understand that Mr. Jackson, the author of this amendment, is from  Texas and that he supports an outright ban on all abortions, including  for rape and for incest. We understand that he doesn't trust women. He  certainly can't claim to care about recruitment into the military.   What we cannot miss, though, is that this is part and parcel of a  goal from a party that wants a Federal ban on abortion. It wasn't  enough that we overturned Roe in our Supreme Court, and it doesn't  matter if States like Michigan vote on their ballot to preserve Roe.  The majority will not stop until there is a Federal ban where it won't  matter what happens in States.   Madam Chair, I stand in strong opposition to this amendment.
