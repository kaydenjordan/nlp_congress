 Mr. President, today I wish to honor a proud West  Virginian, a dedicated public servant, a beloved wife, mother,  grandmother, and a dear friend to all who had the pleasure of knowing  her. It is a privilege to recognize the life and legacy of Mayor Reba  Joy Honaker for her many years of dedicated service to the city of  Welch and to our home State.   A lifelong resident of McDowell County, growing up on Belcher  Mountain, Mayor Honaker graduated from Welch High School and Concord  College and was also a dedicated member of the Elkhorn Old Regular  Baptist Church. Upon graduating from college, she taught home economics  at Big Creek High School until the birth of her son. Later she began  directing weddings and designing wedding cakes, a skill she taught to  others. She was active with the American Association of University  Women's McDowell Chapter, where she took the lead on the yearly arts  and crafts festival with proceeds benefitting the advancement of women  in higher education. In 1984,  [[Page S4564]]  Mayor Honaker opened Flowers by Reba, a small business she owned and  operated until 2006. Her volunteerism spanned the community, from  helping to start the very successful Coal Camp Creations Company, to  volunteering with the McDowell County Chamber of Commerce at various  festivals and events. Mayor Honaker truly wanted the very best for  McDowell County, helping to recreate events that took place in other  areas of the State. She assumed her role as mayor of Welch in 2011 and  was able to put her vision for the community to even greater use.  Whether working with the Welch Kiwanis Club or the American Legion Post  8 Ladies Auxiliary, she was able to make a tremendous impact on the  lives of countless families in the area. Most recently, we celebrated  the opening of the Jack Caffrey Arts Center, a project near and dear to  Mayor Honaker's heart that serves as a hub for cultural programs in  McDowell County.   Mayor Honaker represented the very best of West Virginia, which is  saying quite a lot. In the Mountain State, if you are hungry, you will  be fed. If you are lost, someone will not only give you directions but  will offer to drive you to your destination. That is just who we are,  and that is who Mayor Honaker was. We have lost a shining star in  McDowell County, but her impact, vision, and her passion for this  special community will last forever. It was an honor to have known her  and to call her a friend.   What is most important is that she lived a full life, surrounded by  dear friends and family. It is my hope that her family and friends are  able to find peace, strength, and support in one another. I extend my  condolences to Charles, her loving husband of 57 years; her children,  Darren and Patty, and Joi and Jeremy; her grandchildren, Christopher,  Erik, Mason, Wyatt, and Paige; and her numerous extended family members  and dear friends with the city of Welch. Again, I extend to you my most  sincere condolences for our loss of this wonderful person. The  unwavering love she had for her family, friends, community, and our  home State will live on forever in the hearts of all who knew  her.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to honor the 75th  anniversary of Harpers Ferry National Historical Park as a part of the  National Park Service.   It is no secret that my home State of West Virginia is one of the  most naturally beautiful States in the Nation. As a native West  Virginian and an outdoor enthusiast, I know just how important our wild  and wonderful outdoor heritage is to our great State. Our sparkling  rivers, sweeping valleys, and majestic mountains make our small State a  true gem and beckon sports and outdoor enthusiasts from all over the  world. It is vital to the Mountain State that the natural beauty of our  home State is protected and that we consistently strive to promote our  endless tourism opportunities.   For more than a century, the National Park Service has played a major  role in this success by engaging communities through recreation,  conservation, and historic preservation programs. To name just one  significant contribution, the National Park Service has been working  with the Fish and Wildlife Service and other experts and volunteers to  help protect peregrine falcons and reintroduce them to the area. The  use of DDT as a pesticide had all but caused the extinction of the  species. Since the ban of DDT in the 1970s, the population of peregrine  falcons have recovered significantly to due extensive conservation  efforts. I am so deeply proud of what our citizens have accomplished  and what they will continue to accomplish to preserve our forests,  rivers, wildlife, and historic sites in the days and years ahead.   Harpers Ferry, itself, has been a location that has greatly  influenced our Nation's history. This community saw the arrival of the  first successful American railroad, was the site of John Brown's raid  on the Harpers Ferry Armory, saw the largest surrender of Federal  troops during the Civil War, and was among the first locations to  support the education of former slaves in one of the earliest  integrated schools in the United States. It was of such significance  that it changed hands seven times during the Civil War.   Visiting this historic community is like stepping into the past.  Whether visiting the park, strolling through the picturesque streets,  visiting museums and battlefields, or hiking the trails, it reflects  the West Virginia heritage and principles you just can't find anywhere  else in the world. All of Harpers Ferry's features collectively make it  one of West Virginia's most treasured destinations. Of course, even  more special than our national historical monuments are the people who  take such pride in maintaining the knowledge of our history and  traditions and preserving the locations and commonsense values we hold  dear.   Harpers Ferry National Historical Park is treasured in the hearts of  all West Virginians as a statewide community and beyond, and it is a  privilege to recognize its 75th year in the National Park  Service.                            ____________________
