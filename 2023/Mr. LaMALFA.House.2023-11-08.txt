 Mr. Speaker, today marks the 5-year anniversary since  the town of Paradise and surrounding areas were tragically burned.  Eighty-six lives were lost in a town that was devastated; 90 percent  gone.   You can see how graphic it is. People trying to escape in their  automobiles on a narrow path up and down, out of the city.   Five years later, we have much to be optimistic about. Indeed, we see  people building. With every reopened business, with every new house  permit, with every community event, the optimism, the resiliency of the  people of Paradise and the surrounding areas after the Camp fire are  indeed an inspiration.   We have much to do to still help them. We have to pass legislation so  they are not taxed for the damages that were caused to them, which I  hope to get to this House floor. We need to help them still with some  infrastructure and getting rid of the dead trees and such that are in  the area. Indeed, they are bouncing back, and we are very proud of  them.    God bless them as they continue to bounce back from that horrible day  5 years ago that will be forever remembered as we remember the loss of  the loved ones and the damage it had.                            ____________________
