 Mr. Speaker, 50 years ago, Syracuse  University made a commitment to high school students to help prepare  them for college. It also made a commitment to educators to help them  continue to grow in their profession, and it made a commitment to the  education community as a whole to continue important research.   The Syracuse University Project Advance is an enhanced concurrent  enrollment project that is serving over 200 other partner schools. It  has helped more than 750 educators become Syracuse University adjuncts.   We celebrate 50 years of the Syracuse University Project Advance  program today. As a supporter of choice in education, I applaud SU for  their continued efforts locally to provide programs that give students  access to the tools necessary for their careers and prepare them for  college.   The Syracuse University Project Advance increases dialogue between a  major local university and our local high schools. It offers innovative  courses, and it allows students the option to stay local and be  prepared for the next chapters in their lives right in their hometowns.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, the redefinition of these  waters of the United States rules is really only about one thing, and  that is Government overreach.   When faced with a crisis, the Government is given a broad mandate and  loves very vague rules.   Just recently, we remember the incredible rules of the COVID crisis  and the extraordinary powers granted to Government to effect this  crisis.   Mr. Speaker, if you remember the definition of essential businesses,  essential personnel, essential services, then you have some idea really  of what the waters of the United States redefinition desired by  activist courts and desired by current administration means.   You can imagine the effect it will have on our lives, Mr. Speaker.   The Clean Water Act was a broad power given in 1974 to clean up  polluted waterways.   Guess what, Mr. Speaker?   It worked. We have clean waters and clean rivers. It has been an  extraordinary success since the high point of pollution in the 1970s.  With a government that is hungry for power, as we learned most recently  in COVID, bureaucrats remembered that vague rules allow for  extraordinary powers. You are not a farmer; you are a polluter. You are  not a homeowner; you are a polluter. You are not a home builder; you  are a polluter. You are guilty until proven innocent.   My colleagues across the aisle say that this provides clarity, and it  does.   But clarity for whom?   This rule provides clarity only to EPA regulators who will have  extraordinary authority. It doesn't provide clarity to homeowners,  farmers, and home builders.
