 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that I be able  to address the Senate as if in morning business.    Mr. President, I wish to speak this afternoon in  recognition of our late President, Ronald Reagan. I want to speak also  about his wife Nancy, and I want to highlight their honest and  passionate work to educate Americans about the real effects of  Alzheimer's.   Last Wednesday, February 6, would have been President Reagan's 108th  birthday, and we paused then to reflect not only on the life and legacy  of President Ronald Reagan, but we also remember the way he carried  himself, the vision he set for our country, and the direction he  steered our Nation.   Years after he left the White House, the President and Nancy Reagan  continued their public service to our Nation with grace and class, and  that was true even as President Reagan was diagnosed with Alzheimer's  disease.   In November of 1994, President Reagan wrote a handwritten letter to  Americans announcing this diagnosis that ultimately took his life.   I read lots of biographies, I read lots of history, and this past  week I finished a book, ``Reagan: An American Journey,'' written by Bob  Spitz. The story of his circumstance with Alzheimer's captured my  attention.   The book quotes President Reagan telling his daughter, Patti: ``I  have this condition . . . I keep forgetting things.''         The doctors finally put a name to it. On November 4, 1994,       a doctor from the Mayo Clinic informed Nancy Reagan that,       having had an adequate chance to observe the president, the       diagnosis was conclusive: he had Alzheimer's.    According to Fred Ryan, a staff member for the President and Mrs.  Reagan, ``She was quite upset, emotional.'' She spoke at length later  that evening: ``So we're going to tell him tomorrow,'' she said, ``and  I'd like you to be there.''         The next morning, a Saturday, they gathered in the library,       a small, comfortable room at the front of the house where the       Reagans typically received guests. The president seemed       puzzled when the doctor and Ryan arrived. ``Honey, come over       here and sit down,'' Nancy said, directing him to a couch       opposite the two men. ``The doctor has something he wants to       talk about.''        The doctor didn't beat around the bush. ``We think you have       Alzheimer's,'' he told Reagan.  [[Page S1318]]         ``Okay,'' he responded faintly. ``What should I expect?''        ``We don't know much about it,'' the doctor admitted.       ``It's a degenerative disorder.'' He ran down a few of the       effects that Alzheimer's patients experienced while Nancy       Reagan struggled to control her emotions. She tried her       utmost to be supportive, but was overcome hearing about the       devastations of the disease. . . . He acknowledged, quite       bluntly, ``There is no cure.''        ``Can I ask a few questions?'' Ryan interjected.        While he and Nancy discussed how to handle the president's       activities--his schedule, office hours, appointments, and       appearances--Reagan wandered over to a small round table in a       corner and sat down, staring hypnotically into the yard.       After a few minutes, he picked up a pen and began to write.       When he finished, he handed two sheets of paper filled with       his cramped handwriting to [his staffer]. ``Why don't we get       this typed up and put it out,'' Reagan suggested.    It was a letter dated that November 5, 1994.         My Fellow Americans--    It began--         I have recently been told that I am one of the millions of       Americans who will be afflicted with Alzheimer's disease. . .       . At the moment I feel just fine. I intend to live the       remainder of the years God gives me on the earth doing things       I have always done. . . . Unfortunately, as Alzheimer's       Disease progresses, the family often bears a heavy burden. I       only wish I could spare Nancy from this painful experience.       When the time comes I am confident that with your help she       will face it with faith and courage.  And with faith and courage, indeed, President and Nancy Reagan faced  the disease together.   Together, they founded the Ronald and Nancy Reagan Research Institute  at the Alzheimer's Association in Chicago, IL, focused on researching,  understanding, and treating Alzheimer's disease.   Over the past several decades, this research institute has awarded  millions of dollars in Alzheimer's research grants and has continued to  see breakthroughs in our understanding of this aggressive and  disastrous disease.   Congress has also rightfully come together in a nonpartisan manner to  fight this disease head-on. For example, last December, just a few  months ago, with legislation that was sponsored by our colleague from  Maine, Senator Susan Collins, Congress passed and the President signed  our BOLD Infrastructure for Alzheimer's Act, which aims to combat  Alzheimer's through a collaborative public health framework. The BOLD  Act will create an Alzheimer's public health infrastructure at the  direction of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which will  establish Alzheimer's centers for excellence across the country, award  funding to public health departments to increase early detection and  diagnosis, and increase data collection, analysis, and reporting  through cooperative agreements with public and nonprofit entities.   I am a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Health and  Human Services, led by my colleague from Missouri, Senator Blunt. I  have advocated and successfully worked with my colleague Senator Blunt  and the members of the committee to provide $2.3 billion for  Alzheimer's disease research in FY 2019, finally reaching the $2  billion funding goal for research laid out by the National Plan to  Address Alzheimer's.   I am the cochair of the Senate NIH Caucus, and I am optimistic that  these funding increases, combined with NIH initiatives to map the human  brain and further develop personalized medicine, will, I hope, lead us  closer to an Alzheimer's treatment and a cure.   Eleven years after President Reagan's death, Nancy Reagan continued  her Alzheimer's advocacy work, helping to dramatically increase the  attention and resources paid to the research of this disease. She  recognized that degenerative diseases like Alzheimer's not only pose a  financial burden to our Nation and health system but, more importantly  and more significantly, these diseases threaten families with  significant financial difficulty and tremendous emotional hardship.   As President Reagan's primary caregiver during his battle with  Alzheimer's, Nancy reminded us of the importance of caretakers and  families and the struggles they themselves go through while watching  loved ones suffer.   As we continue our work to treat, cure, and prevent Alzheimer's and  other degenerative diseases, we will also continue looking for ways to  ease the financial and mental turmoil on caretakers, for they suffer so  much as well.   When President Reagan announced his Alzheimer's disease, he did so  much more than just admitting to having the disease. He fought it, and  he destigmatized it not only for himself but for those who came after  him and for those still to come who may be faced with this same  circumstance.   In the closing letter that President Reagan wrote--and, incidentally,  when he handed it to the staffer and said, ``Type it up and send it  out,'' they read it and said, ``Let's just send it in your handwriting,  Mr. President.'' So that is what happened, and in that closing letter,  President said this:         Let me thank you, the American people, for giving me the       great honor of allowing me to serve as your President. When       the Lord calls me home, whenever that may be, I will leave       with the greatest love for this country of ours and eternal       optimism for its future. I now begin the journey that will       lead me into the sunset of my life. I know that for America       there will always be a bright dawn ahead.    I, too, believe that America's best days are ahead of us, and I  implore Washington to reflect upon President Reagan's enduring  optimism.   Civil in disagreement and often willing to cross party lines to work  toward solutions, I hope we can all remember, like President Reagan, to  focus on the real issues facing our Nation, and I hope that all Members  of the Congress, from all walks of life, will be bold in leveraging  their life experiences to achieve greatness for our Nation, just as  President Reagan and Nancy Reagan did, deepening America's resolve to  fight this terrible disease.   I honor President Reagan and his wife Nancy. I thank them for their  service to our country, and I thank them for their attention to this  disease, Alzheimer's. May we also have the courage and will to continue  the battle to rid our country, its citizens, and the world of this  affliction.   I yield the floor.
