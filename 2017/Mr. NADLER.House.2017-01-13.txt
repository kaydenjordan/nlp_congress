 Mr. Chairman, repeal of the Affordable Care Act will be a  disaster for the American public. It will send America back to the days  when people went bankrupt trying to pay medical bills, and seniors on  Medicare spent $3,000 on prescription drugs alone.   Adding insult to a very serious injury, the bill before us would  defund Planned Parenthood because of debunked accusations. Republicans  are asking us to pass legislation that will punish an invaluable  organization without any evidence of due process because they don't  agree with it. This bill smacks of an unconstitutional bill of  attainder.   If we do pass this bill, we will leave millions of women with no  access to health care. Republicans know that community health centers  and Medicaid networks do not include enough providers, particularly OB/ GYNs, to take on all of Planned Parenthood's patients.                                time  1315    By voting to defund Planned Parenthood today, we will be leaving 2.7  million women and men with no access to reproductive health care.   What a statement for the Republicans to make as their first major  piece of legislation. They are saying to the American people, and to  women in particular: Republicans don't care about your health or about  your families. Republicans just care about politics.   Well, my Democratic colleagues and I care about the health of the  American people, about American jobs and about American women. That is  why we will vote against this absurd budget resolution; that, and the  ACA repeal.   I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill.   Mr. Chair, this budget resolution is primarily a vehicle to repeal  the Affordable Care Act and to defund Planned Parenthood, steps the  Republicans are taking without putting any plans in place to ensure  that millions of men, women, and children will continue to have access  to health care they need. They are proposing to let Americans get sick,  even die, to score cheap political points.   Repeal of the Affordable Care Act will be a disaster for the American  public. In New York State alone, it will result in 2.7 million people  losing health insurance and will create a $3 billion hole in the state  budget. It will also result in the loss of thousands of health care  jobs across the state. Republicans will send America back to the days  when people went bankrupt trying to pay medical bills. It will mean  that people with private insurance--from their employers or the  individual market--will have their insurance cancelled for pre-existing  conditions. It will mean that people once again will be subject to  annual or lifetime limits--in other words, if you get an expensive  illness, a heart attack or cancer, your insurance will run out just  when you need it the most. And people on Medicare will have to pay an  average of $3,000 a year for prescription drugs.   Adding insult to very serious injury, this bill would defund Planned  Parenthood because of debunked accusations. If members have real  evidence that Planned Parenthood broke the law, they should send it to  federal law enforcement agencies. Instead, they are asking us to pass  legislation that will punish an invaluable organization without any  evidence or due process because they don't agree with them. My  colleagues who love to cloak themselves in the Constitution should know  Congress is not the law enforcement body this bill asks us to be--it  smacks of a clearly unconstitutional bill of attainder.   If we do pass this bill, we will leave millions of women with no  access to health care. Republicans may claim that women can go  elsewhere for the services provided by Planned Parenthood--they've even  gone so far as to provide additional funding for Community Health  Centers to fill the gaps they clearly know this bill will leave behind.  But did they check to see if the existing Community Health Centers or  Medicaid networks can fill these gaps? Did they ask HHS to confirm that  Community Health Centers even employ enough OB/GYNs and other  specialists to actually take on the patients currently treated by  Planned Parenthood? Of course not.   Republicans know HHS would never be able to make that determination.  More than half of Planned Parenthood patients rely on Medicaid. Most  states do not have enough Medicaid providers, particularly specialists  like OB/GYNs, to absorb Planned Parenthood's patients. By voting to  defund Planned Parenthood today, you are leaving 2.7 million women,  men, and families with no access to health care.   Republicans are leaving women to suffer with no access to prenatal  care, condemning seniors to undiagnosed cancers, and leaving children  to suffer with asthma and other chronic illnesses all to make a  political statement.   And what a statement for Republicans to make as their first major  piece of legislation. They are saying to the American people, and women  in particular: Republicans don't care about your health. Republicans  don't care about your families. Republicans just care about politics.   Well, my Democratic colleagues and I care about the health of the  American people. We care about American jobs. We care about American  women. That's why we will vote against this absurd budget resolution. I  urge my Republican colleagues to join us.
