 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the service of  a friend and a dedicated public servant, Therese McMillan, who is  retiring as executive director of the San Francisco Bay Area's  Metropolitan Transportation Commission.   Therese began her work with MTC in 1984 and then moved to the Federal  Transit Administration, most notably as the acting administrator from  2014 to 2016. In 2019, Therese returned to the MTC as its new executive  director.   Under her leadership, MTC established an Equity Platform to advance  policies and make investments that will ensure all residents of the San  Francisco Bay Area are considered when discussing the bay area's  transit needs. She also helped to establish minimum housing density  targets near transit stations to foster ridership.   I have had the pleasure of working with Therese over the years. She  has always been smart, kind, and dedicated to doing what is best.  Please join me in congratulating Therese on a magnificent career of  public service and wishing her the best on her retirement and her  nearly three decades of service to our community.                            ____________________
