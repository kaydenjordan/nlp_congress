 Madam Speaker, as we all know, the CDC  finally altered the mask mandates to reflect the science that we have  known for months. People who are vaccinated do not need to wear masks  indoors, outdoors in most settings. Follow the science.   As a physician of 30 years, I believe that people should get  vaccinated, but at the end of the day it is a personal choice and a  decision that should be made between patient and doctor, not person and  Speaker.   At this point practically everyone has had the opportunity to get  vaccinated if they want it. The infinite majority of the at-risk  population in the United States has been vaccinated. I have been  vaccinated for months now, but when I get done with this speech, I have  to put my mask back on despite what the science says because the  Speaker mandates it. That is not the doctor-patient relationship.   Back in North Carolina, my constituents will still be required to  wear a mask in grocery stores because Governor Cooper mandates it.  Again, not the doctor-patient relationship.   So much for following the science.                            ____________________
