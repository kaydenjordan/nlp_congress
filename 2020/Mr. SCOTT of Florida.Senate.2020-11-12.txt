 Madam President, I rise today to support the  confirmation of Aileen Mercedes Cannon to serve as a U.S. District  Court Judge for the Southern District of Florida. Ms. Cannon has a  distinguished record of public service, during which she has  demonstrated a firm commitment to upholding the United States  Constitution and respecting the rule of law. She began her legal career  as a law clerk for Judge Steven Colloton on the Eighth Circuit United  States Court of Appeals and has served with the U.S. Attorney's Office  for the Southern District of Florida since 2013. I am confident that  she will continue to serve the Southern District of Florida well once  she is confirmed to the bench, and I am proud to support her  confirmation today.
