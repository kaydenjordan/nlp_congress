 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins) for  the customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, pathetic, that is the word to describe this process and  this bill. If the American people could sue Congress for malpractice,  my Republican friends would be in deep trouble.   How could you do this? How could you do this to the American people?  How can you do this to the people you represent?   You are taking away essential healthcare protections. You are  allowing insurance companies to discriminate against people with  preexisting conditions. You are supporting a bill that will throw 24  million people off of their health care and cut Medicaid by $880  billion to give a $1 trillion tax break to the wealthiest people in  this country.   What is wrong with you guys?   Today's rule self-executes three of the newest Republican amendments  to the Republican health plan. This means, without any sort of debate  or discussion whatsoever, the Palmer, MacArthur, and Upton amendments  will magically pass the House.   What I find so hard to believe about this latest backroom deal is  that they actually make this bill worse. I didn't think that was  possible, Mr. Speaker.   To shore up support amongst this Chamber's most conservative faction,  Representative MacArthur and others made a deal with President Trump to  gut protections for individuals with preexisting conditions and to  eliminate essential health benefits like maternity care, mental health  treatment, and prescription drug coverage, just to name a few. These  are among the most popular provisions of the Affordable Care Act.   The American people were justifiably outraged, and they showed up by  the thousands to townhalls to express their anger. And there were some  on the Republican side who actually got it. They listened to their  constituents and they had the courage to stand up and say no.   But when Republican leaders came up short in their whip count,  Representative Upton ran to the White House and concocted a deal with  President Trump to try to win back votes. His amendment adds a measly  $8 billion spread out over 5 years in a futile attempt to soften the  devastating effect that this bill will have on millions and millions of  Americans with preexisting conditions.   Now, $8 billion over 5 years sounds like a lot, but when we are  talking about an entire country, it really isn't. Don't take it from  me. Robert Graboyes from the conservative Mercatus Center said:   ``The $8 billion amount is a pittance. Spread over 5 years, it's a  fifth of a pittance.''   This is not a leftwing organization. This is an organization funded  by Koch Industries, the Koch brothers. My friends love the Koch  brothers.   What's more, some analysts have already estimated that an additional  $200 billion will be needed over a decade to adequately fund high-risk  pools. So this amendment is billions upon billions upon billions of  dollars short. And as the Center for American Progress points out, the  Upton amendment ``will have almost no effect.''   Now, my colleagues who have been won over by this should be ashamed  of themselves. We are supposed to fix problems and help people, not  merely settle for political cover that can be used in a press release.  $8 billion to cover a $200 billion shortfall? Back where I come from,  we call that being a cheap date. I guarantee you, your constituents are  going to figure this out, and they will not be happy.   So to so-called moderate Republicans who have contorted themselves  this week to try to find a fix to the damage being done to the people  with preexisting conditions, I have breaking news: I have a magic  bullet fix if Republicans really want to protect people with  preexisting conditions. Are you ready? Brace yourselves. Don't change  the law. Everyone is already protected by the Affordable Care Act,  including people with preexisting conditions and those who struggle to  find affordable care. Let me say to my colleagues that to claim or  imply that this Republican plan covers preexisting conditions is a lie,  plain and simple.    Now, let me say a few words about the process that has been used to  bring this bill to the floor. It has been a disaster from start to  finish, with secret negotiations, backroom deals, and bribes to buy off  factions within the Republican Conference. There have been no hearings  on this bill whatsoever. And the Republican leadership couldn't even  slow down long enough to receive a score from the CBO.   I have one simple question: What is the rush? Wait a week and get a  CBO score. Why is that such a radical idea?   Mr. Speaker, are Republican leaders jamming this bill through to  appease Donald Trump?   Are they concerned that a new CBO score will confirm what we already  know is true, that this bill will be devastating to the people of this  country, force even more people to lose their health care, especially  to older, sick, and low-income Americans.   Or maybe, Mr. Speaker, Republican leaders are worried that their  colleagues will go home over this weeklong break and actually hear from  their constituents who overwhelmingly oppose this effort to repeal the  Affordable Care Act.   Honestly, I don't know how my Republicans friends can defend this  terrible, closed, authoritarian process. It is an absolute disgrace.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill, or, better yet, I  urge my Republicans colleagues to do what they did a couple of weeks  ago and pull this disastrous bill.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Yarmuth), the distinguished ranking member of the  Committee on the Budget.    Mr. Speaker, I am not sure if my colleagues are aware  of this since we are moving so quickly here, but I want to flag for  everyone an important op-ed in The Hill by the executive director of  the Boston Area Rape Crisis Center. She points out that in the latest  version of this legislation, rape can once again be categorized as a  preexisting condition as it often was before the Affordable Care Act.   I include her column, entitled ``Health `reform' will make sexual  assault survivors sick,'' in the Record.          Health `Reform' Will Make Sexual Assault Survivors Sick                            (By Gina Scaramella)         So far, we know that about 24 million Americans stand to       lose their health insurance coverage if the Affordable Care       Act (ACA) is replaced with the American Health Care Act       (AHCA). We know that most of those 24 million people will be       low-income.        We also know that groups of people who experience       significant health care disparities, such as lesbian, gay,       bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people, and Black and Latino       people, will be among those who risk losing the most if the       ACA is repealed. To that list, we must add survivors of       sexual violence.        Before passage of the ACA in 2010, sexual assault survivors       who had sought medical care for their injuries could be       denied health insurance coverage at a later date. The reason?       Health insurers often categorized rape as a pre-existing       health condition.        In one widely reported case, a 45-year-old woman met two       men at a bar in Florida who bought her a drink. Hours later,       she found herself lying by the side of the road with injuries       indicating that she had been raped and that the men had       spiked her drink. Her doctor prescribed a treatment of anti-      viral, post-HIV exposure drugs to protect against HIV       transmission.        When the woman lost her health insurance several months       after the attack, she was unable to obtain new insurance due       to the health care treatment she had received for the       assault. She went without health insurance for three years.        Stories like these prompted the National Women's Law Center       to launch a campaign called ``Being a Woman Is Not a Pre-      Existing Condition.'' It was so popular that then-House       Speaker Nancy Pelosi adopted the phrase in her pro-health       reform talking points with media, and the New York Times ran       an explainer on the ways in which health insurers treated       women as if they were just one giant pre-existing condition.        The AHCA initially retained the ACA's ban on discrimination       against people with pre-existing conditions. But an amendment       to the AHCA bill offered last week by New Jersey Congressman       Tom MacArthur and North Carolina Congressman Mark Meadows       would make it easier for health insurers to deny coverage to       people with pre-existing conditions.        By letting states waive the ACA prohibition on charging       people with pre-existing health conditions higher premiums,       protections for those who've previously been medically       treated for sexual assault would be gutted.        Perhaps more alarming, though, is the MacArthur-Meadows       amendment's provision allowing states to also seek waivers       from the ACA's requirement that essential health benefits be       covered by health insurance plans. Essential health benefits       include preventive health care services that most of us take       for granted. These include tests for blood pressure and       cholesterol, mammograms, and vaccinations. Essential health       benefits also include coverage for mental health care and       substance abuse treatment.        Sexual violence survivors face acute treatment needs in the       aftermath of an assault such as care for gynecological       injuries, other physical trauma, sexually-transmitted       diseases, and pregnancy. But sexual violence takes many       forms: incest: ongoing sexual abuse outside of the family,       sexual assault, sexual harassment or exploitation, and rape.       Each of these types of assault puts the survivor at risk for       various potential negative physical health and mental health       outcomes.        For example, an adult survivor of childhood sexual abuse is       at a higher risk for psychiatric disorders. Women and men who       have survived rape as adults are at higher risk of post-      traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, and substance       abuse--any of which can significantly interfere with daily       living. No one can deny that there is a direct line between       having survived sexual violence, and an increased risk of       physical and mental health problems.        The mental health impacts of sexual violence are deep and       often longstanding. Survivors need long-term access to       nonjudgmental health and mental health services to reduce       their suffering and mitigate as much as possible the stress       that recovery from sexual violence puts on intimate family       relationships, and obligations related to school and work.        It is hard to see any good coming from this latest attempt       to repeal the ACA and all of the care it has brought to       survivors of sexual violence.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. DelBene).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Castro).    Mr. Speaker, wow. I yield myself such time as I may  consume, and to rebut the gentleman from Texas, let me include in the  Record a letter from the American Cancer Society, the American Diabetes  Association, the American Heart Association, the American Lung  Association, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the Juvenile Diabetes  Foundation, the March of Dimes, the National Multiple Sclerosis  Society, the National Organization for Rare Disorders, and the National  Coalition for Women with Heart Disease.   Leading Patient Advocacy Groups Remain Opposed to the American Health                                  Care Act       Eight Organizations Issue Statement Criticizing Upton Agreement         Washington, May 3, 2017.--Earlier today, House Energy and       Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden (R-OR) issued a press       release stating that an amendment proposed by Representative       Fred Upton (R-MI) to the American Health Care Act (AHCA)       provides ``protection and certainty for patients with pre-      existing conditions.'' Eight leading patient groups, listed       below, issued the following statement in response:        Despite the Upton amendment, we remain strongly opposed to       the American Health Care Act and urge Congress to consider       the people at the heart of this decision. The various       patchwork solutions offered by lawmakers would still leave       the millions of patients we represent, who have serious and       chronic health conditions, at risk of not being able to       access life-saving treatments and care.        There is no substitute for fundamental, unequivocal       protections for people with pre-existing conditions.        The AHCA, including the potential amendment, would       undermine vital safeguards against being charged more for       insurance based on health status. Increasing funding for risk       sharing programs and consumer financial assistance does not       address the legitimate challenges built into these proposals.        The other equally important problems with the AHCA remain,       including:        Allowing states to waive the guarantee of essential health       benefits, which would:        Segment the market into plans for sick people and plans for       healthy people, driving up the cost of plans for people with       serious health care needs        Undermine the protection against annual and lifetime       coverage caps, a critical safeguard for patients        Eliminating Medicaid expansion coverage for millions of       Americans and altering the program's financing structure in a       way that jeopardizes coverage of new and innovative       treatments        Increasing out-of-pocket costs for many Americans,       including some of the sickest and elderly among us        Given the numerous shortcomings of the American Health Care       Act in serving the patients we represent, our organizations       have no choice but to oppose this legislation and urge all       Representatives to vote against it, with or without the Upton       and MacArthur amendments.

Mr. Speaker, I also include in the Record a statement  from the American Medical Association in opposition to this bill.            [From the American Medical Association, May 3, 2017]  AMA Warns that Proposed Changes to the American Health Care Act Do Not                         Remedy Bill's Shortcomings     Despite amendments to bill, millions of Americans would still lose                         health insurance coverage         Chicago.--American Medical Association (AMA) President       Andrew W. Gurman, M.D., issued the following statement today       about proposed changes to the American Health Care Act       (AHCA):        ``None of the legislative tweaks under consideration       changes the serious harm to patients and the health care       delivery system if AHCA passes. Proposed changes to the bill       tinker at the edges without remedying the fundamental failing       of the bill--that millions of Americans will lose their       health insurance as a direct result of this proposal.        ``High-risk pools are not a new idea. Prior to the       enactment of the Affordable Care Act, 35 states operated       high-risk pools, and they were not a panacea for Americans       with pre-existing medical conditions. The history of high-      risk pools demonstrates that Americans with pre-existing       conditions will be stuck in second-class health care       coverage--if they are able to obtain coverage at all.        ``Not only would the AHCA eliminate health insurance       coverage for millions of Americans, the legislation would, in       many cases, eliminate the ban against charging those with       underlying medical conditions vastly more for their       coverage.''        ``America should not go backward to the time when our       fellow citizens with pre-existing health conditions faced       high costs for limited coverage, if they were able to obtain       coverage at all. The AMA urges congressional leaders and the       Administration to pursue a bipartisan dialogue on alternative       policies that provide patients with access and coverage to       high quality care and preserve the safety net for vulnerable       populations.''                        Background on high-risk pools         A January report from the American Academy of Actuaries       notes that ``enrollment has generally been low, coverage has       been limited and expensive, they require external funding,       and they have typically operated at a loss . . . Removing       high-risk individuals from the insured risk pools reduces       costs in the private market only temporarily. Over time, even       lower-cost individuals in the individual market can incur       high health care costs, which would put upward pressure on       premiums.''        According to the Kaiser Family Foundation:        State high-risk pools featured premiums above standard non-      group market rates--with most states capping them at 150%-      200% of standard rates. Many also featured high deductibles,       some $5,000 or more.        Despite the fact that many individuals were forced into       high-risk pools because of a pre-existing condition, nearly       all states excluded coverage for these conditions for 6-12       months.        Almost all high-risk pools imposed lifetime limits on       covered services, and some imposed annual limits.        Some states capped or closed enrollment.        Combined net losses for the state high-risk pools totaled       more than $1.2 billion for 2011, or $5,510 per enrollee, on       average.        Furthermore, a 2010 paper by James Capretta and Tom Miller       that appeared in National Affairs estimated that the cost of       adequately funded high risk pools would be $15 billion to $20       billion per year.     Mr. Speaker, I also include in the Record a letter from  the American Academy of Family Physicians in opposition to this bill.                                                 American Academy of                                               Family Physicians,                                                        May 3, 2017.      Jim McGovern,      Representative, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Rep. Jim McGovern: Despite recent activities and       amendments, the American Health Care Act (H.R. 1628) remains       a highly flawed proposal that will destabilize our health       care system, cause significant loss of coverage, and allow       for the discrimination against patients based on their       gender, age, and health status. For these reasons, the       American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) continues to       oppose the AHCA and  [[Page H4120]]       encourages the House of Representatives to reject this failed       policy.        The fact remains that the AHCA will:        Cause more than 24 million people to lose their health care       coverage, including more than 7 million with employer-      sponsored coverage.        Destabilize the individual health insurance market.        Create a race to the bottom by eliminating any standards       with respect to minimum insurance benefits.        Enact draconian cuts in the Medicaid program that will have       an immediate negative impact on low-income individuals,       children, and millions of senior citizens who rely on the       program.        Eliminate community rating and return to medical       underwriting, thus allowing insurers to discriminate against       individuals based on their gender, age, and health status.        Deny individuals protection against annual and lifetime       spending caps, thus threatening the financial stability of       millions of individuals and families in the future.        Over the past few days there has been an effort to advance       policies that seek to protect individuals with pre-existing       conditions from facing discrimination in insurance       underwriting as a result of their health status. Despite a       willingness to spend more money on these proposals, the       current efforts on pre-existing conditions fail to accomplish       their goal. High-risk pools are inherently flawed and       expensive. The proposals under consideration provide       inadequate funding for an inadequate period of time, thus       creating an under-funded and temporary solution for the       millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions. We find       it regrettable that Congress would seek to relegate       individuals with high health care needs to a program that has       a questionable history and would face uncertain financial       stability in the future.        By removing critical consumer protections that collectively       ensure that the millions of individuals with pre-existing       conditions can continue to purchase affordable health care       coverage, the AHCA would result in higher premiums and higher       deductibles for millions. Additionally, the negative impact       of the AHCA is not limited to the individual insurance       market. These policies also may impact the more than 130       million people with employer-sponsored insurance.        Thank you.     Mr. Speaker, I also include in the Record a statement  from the AARP in strong opposition to this bill.                                                           AARP,                                                        May 3, 2017.        Dear Representative: Older Americans care deeply about       access to and affordability of health care. With the addition       of the Upton Amendment, as reported, we once again write to       share our opposition to the American Health Care Act (AHCA)       and urge you to vote NO. Changes under consideration that       would allow states to waive important consumer protections--      allowing insurance companies to once again charge Americans       with pre-existing conditions more because they've had cancer,       diabetes or heart disease--would make a bad bill even worse.       This would be devastating for the 25 million Americans 50-64       who have a deniable pre-existing condition. The Upton       amendment would do little to reduce the massive premium       increases for those with pre-existing conditions.        Throughout consideration of the AHCA, we have been       expressing serious concerns about the impact that this       legislation will have on older Americans. The Congressional       Budget Office (CBO)'s last estimate further demonstrates the       harmful impact of this bill on older Americans and some of       our most vulnerable. Specifically, the American Health Care       Act will weaken the fiscal sustainability of Medicare;       dramatically increase premium and out-of-pocket costs for 50-      64 year olds purchasing coverage on the individual insurance       market; allow insurance companies to once again discriminate       against those with pre-existing conditions; substantially       increase the number of Americans without insurance; and put       at risk millions of children and adults with disabilities and       poor seniors who depend on the Medicaid program to access       long-term services and supports and other benefits.        Our members and others 50 years of age and older care       deeply about health care and want to know where their elected       leaders stand. Recognizing the importance of the upcoming       vote on the American Health Care Act, AARP intends to inform       our members, and others over age 50, how their elected       officials voted. We'll communicate the results of the vote in       our widely-circulated publications, in e-mail alerts, in our       online channels, and through the media. Again, we urge all       Representatives to vote NO on the American Health Care Act in       its current form.                                   Medicare         The American Health Care Act repeals provisions in current       law that have strengthened Medicare's fiscal outlook,       specifically, the repeal of the additional 0.9 percent       payroll tax on higher-income workers. Repealing this       provision would remove billions from the Hospital Insurance       trust fund, hasten the insolvency of Medicare, and diminish       Medicare's ability to pay for services in the future.                     Individual Private Insurance Market         Currently, about 25 million Americans age 50-64 have a pre-      existing condition, about 6.1 million purchase insurance in       the non-group market, and nearly 3.2 million are currently       eligible to receive subsidies for health insurance coverage       through either the federal health benefits exchange or a       state-based exchange (exchange). Since passage of the ACA,       the number of 50-64 year old Americans who are uninsured has       dropped by half. We are deeply concerned that the AHCA would       be a significant step backwards and result in millions of       older Americans who cannot afford their health care,       including many simply losing their health care. Based on CBO       estimates, approximately 14 million Americans will lose       coverage next year, while a total of 24 million Americans       would lose coverage over the next 10 years.        Affordability of both premiums and cost-sharing is critical       to older Americans and their ability to obtain and access       health care. A typical 50-64 year old seeking coverage       through an exchange has a median annual income of under       $25,000 and already pays significant out-of-pocket costs for       health care. We have serious concerns--reinforced by the CBO       estimate--that the bill under consideration will dramatically       increase health care costs for 50-64 year olds who purchase       health care through an exchange due both to the changes in       age rating from 3:1 (already a compromise that requires       uninsured older Americans to pay three times more than       younger individuals) to 5:1 (or more) and reductions in       current tax credits for older Americans. CBO concluded that       the bill will substantially raise premiums for older people       and force many into lower quality plans.        Age rating plus reduced tax credits equal an unaffordable       age tax. Our previous estimates on the age-rating change       showed that premiums for current coverage could increase by       up to $3,200 for a 64 year old. In addition, the bill reduced       the tax credits available for older Americans to help       purchase insurance. We estimate that the bill's changes to       current law's tax credits alone could increase premium costs       by more than $5,800 for a 64-year old earning $15,000.       Overall, both the bill's tax credit changes and 5:1 age       rating would result in skyrocketing cost increases for older       Americans. In their analysis, CBO found that a 64 year old       earning $26,500 a year would see their premiums increase by       $12,900--758 percent--from $1,700 to $14,600 a year.        Current law prohibits insurance companies from       discriminating against individuals due to a pre-existing       condition. The bill would repeal pre-existing condition       protections and would once again allow insurance companies to       charge Americans more--we estimate up to $25,000 more--due to       a pre-existing condition. As a result, the 40 percent of 50-       to 64-year-olds (about 25 million people) who have a deniable       pre-existing condition risk losing access to affordable       coverage. The Upton Amendment, which would add funds to       address the impact of premium increases for those with       pre-existing conditions, would do little to mitigate the       massive premium increase for some of the most vulnerable       Americans. AARP strongly opposes any weakening of the       law's pre-existing condition protections which benefit       millions of Americans.                 Medicaid and Long-Term Services and Supports         AARP opposes the provisions of the American Health Care Act       that create a per capita cap financing structure in the       Medicaid program. We are concerned that these provisions       could endanger the health, safety, and care of millions of       individuals who depend on the essential services provided       through Medicaid. CBO found that the bill would cut Medicaid       funding by $880 billion over 2017-2026, about 25 percent less       than what it projects under current law. Medicaid is a vital       safety net and intergenerational lifeline for millions of       individuals, including over 17.4 million low-income seniors       and children and adults with disabilities who rely on the       program for critical health care and long-term services and       supports (LTSS, i.e., assistance with daily activities such       as eating, bathing, dressing, managing medications, and       transportation). Older adults and people with disabilities       now account for over sixty percent of Medicaid spending, and       cuts of this magnitude will result in loss of benefits and       services for this vulnerable population.        Of these 17.4 million individuals: 6.9 million are ages 65       and older (which equals more than 1 in every 7 elderly       Medicare beneficiaries); 10.5 million are children and adults       living with disabilities; and about 10.8 million are so poor       or have a disability that they qualify for both Medicare and       Medicaid (dual eligibles). Dual eligibles account for almost       33 percent of Medicaid spending. While they comprise a       relatively small percentage of enrollees, they account for a       disproportionate share of total Medicare and Medicaid       spending.        Individuals with disabilities of all ages and older adults       rely on critical Medicaid services, including home and       community-based services (HCBS) for assistance with daily       activities such as eating, bathing, dressing, and home       modifications; nursing home care; and other benefits such as       hearing aids and eyeglasses.        In providing a fixed amount of federal funding per person,       this approach to financing would likely result in       overwhelming cost shifts to states, state taxpayers, and       families unable to shoulder the costs of care without       sufficient federal support. This would result in cuts to       program eligibility, services, or both--ultimately harming       some of our nation's most vulnerable citizens.  [[Page H4121]]         The bill also repeals the six percent enhanced federal       Medicaid match for states that take up the Community First       Choice (CFC) Option. CFC provides states with a financial       incentive to offer HCBS to help older adults and people with       disabilities live in their homes and communities where they       want to be. About 90 percent of older adults want to remain       in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.       HCBS are also cost effective. On average, in Medicaid, the       cost of HCBS per person is one-third the cost of       institutional care. Taking away the enhanced match could       disrupt services for older adults and people with       disabilities in the states that are already providing       services under CFC and would result in a loss of about $12       billion for HCBS over ten years.                              Prescription Drugs         The AHCA would repeal the fee on manufacturers and       importers of branded prescription drugs, which currently is       projected to add $24.8 billion to the Medicare Part B trust       fund between 2017 and 2026. Rather than repeal this fee for       Medicare, AARP believes Congress must do more to reduce the       burden of high prescription drug costs on consumers and       taxpayers, and we urge action on bipartisan solutions.        AARP remains willing to work with you to ensure that we       maintain a strong health care system that ensures robust       insurance market protections, controls costs, improves       quality, and provides affordable coverage to all Americans.       However, the AHCA does not accomplish these goals, and we       continue to urge you to vote NO.            Sincerely,                                                  Nancy A. LeaMond,                                 Executive Vice President and Chief                                   Advocacy and Engagement Officer.     Mr. Speaker, if this bill were so great, these  organizations would be supporting the Republican bill, not opposing it;  and they are strongly opposing it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Doggett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter), the ranking member of the  Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I feel bad for the gentleman because it  appears as if he only has one speaker supporting this rule and the  bill, and nearly our entire caucus wants to speak on this against the  Republican healthcare repeal bill. So I was wondering whether the  gentleman might consider sharing some time with us?    I yield to the gentleman from Georgia.    It looks kind of lonely over there. It speaks volumes  about how much support there is for this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Pascrell).    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  [[Page H4122]]  American College of Physicians in opposition to the bill.                                 American College of Physicians,                                                     April 24, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles Schumer,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan, Minority Leader Pelosi, Majority Leader       McConnell, and Minority Leader Schumer: On behalf of the       American College of Physicians (ACP), I am writing to urge       Congress to move away from the harmful changes to patient       care that would occur if the American Health Care Act (AHCA)       were to become law, and to instead work for bipartisan       solutions to improve the Affordable Care Act (ACA) rather       than repealing and replacing it. We believe that the AHCA,       which would repeal and replace the most important coverage       and consumer protections created by the ACA, is so       fundamentally flawed that it cannot be made acceptable. We       understand that the leadership in the House of       Representatives continues to explore ways to bring a modified       version of the AHCA to a vote, based on a draft amendment       reportedly being developed by Representatives MacArthur and       Meadows, a summary of which was made available to the public       through news organizations. This amendment would make the       harmful AHCA even worse by creating new coverage barriers for       patients with pre-existing conditions and weakening       requirements that insurers cover essential benefits.        The American College of Physicians is the largest medical       specialty organization and the second-largest physician group       in the United States. ACP members include 148,000 internal       medicine physicians (internists), related subspecialists, and       medical students. Internal medicine physicians are       specialists who apply scientific knowledge and clinical       expertise to the diagnosis, treatment, and compassionate care       of adults across the spectrum from health to complex illness.        The draft MacArthur-Meadows amendment would create what is       known as the ``Limited Waiver Option'' that would allow       states to eliminate or severely weaken vital ACA Title I       consumer protections--specifically, community rating and       essential health benefits (EHBs)--returning the country to       the pre-ACA days when persons with pre-existing       ``declinable'' medical conditions in most states were priced       out of the market and the insurance products available in the       individual market did not cover medically necessary services.        Specifically:        The MacArthur-Meadows amendment would create an option for       states to obtain Limited Waivers from certain federal       standards that would gut existing law consumer protections.       Based on a summary of the draft amendment, states could seek       Limited Waivers for:        Essential Health Benefits (EHBs)        Community-rating rules, except for the following       categories, which are not waivable: Gender or Age (except for       reductions of the 5:1 age ratio previously established) or       Health Status (unless the state has established a high-risk       pool or is participating in a federal high-risk pool)        To obtain the waiver, states would only need to ``attest       that the purpose of their requested waiver is to reduce       premium costs, increase the number of persons with healthcare       coverage, or advance another benefit to the public interest       in the state, including the guarantee of coverage for persons       with preexisting medical conditions. The Secretary shall       approve applications within 90 days of determining that an       application is complete.'' [Emphasis added in italics].        In other words, as long as a state attested that there was       a ``benefit to the public,'' insurers would be once again       allowed to charge more to people with pre-existing       conditions, or decline to cover needed benefits like       physician and hospital visits, maternity care and       contraception, mental health and substance use disorder       treatments, preventive services, and prescription drugs.        This would take us back to the days when people had to fill       out intrusive insurance company applications to document       their previous health history, even before being advised what       the premium would be based on their individual health risk.       Unlike community rating, which bases premiums based on the       expected costs associated with all persons in the insurance       pool (adjusted only by age, tobacco use, and family size),       the Limited Waiver would again allow insurers in states that       obtain a waiver to again charge people exorbitant and       unaffordable premiums for their pre-existing conditions.        Before the ACA, insurance plans sold in the individual       insurance market in all but five states typically maintained       lists of so-called ``declinable'' medical conditions       including asthma, diabetes, arthritis, obesity, stroke, or       pregnancy, or having been diagnosed with cancer in the past       10 years. Even if a revised bill would not explicitly repeal       the current law's guaranteed-issue requirement which requires       insurers to offer coverage to persons with pre-existing       conditions like these guaranteed issue without community       rating allows insurers to charge as much as they believe a       patient's treatment will cost. The result would be that many       patients with pre-existing conditions would be offered       coverage that costs them thousands of dollars more for the       care that they need, and in the case of patients with       expensive conditions like cancer, even hundreds of thousands       more.        An amendment to the AHCA reported out of the Rules       Committee on April 6th to establish a ``Federal Invisible       Risk Sharing Program,'' which would create a fund that states       could use to reimburse insurers for some of the costs       associated with insuring sicker patients, would not offset       the harm done to patients with pre-existing conditions by       allowing the Limited Waiver of community rating and essential       benefit protections. The pre-ACA experience with high-risk       pools was that many had long waiting lists, and offered       inadequate coverage with high deductibles and insufficient       benefits. Unless a national high-risk pool is supported with       a massive infusion of funding it will not be sufficient to       cover the millions of people with pre-existing conditions       that would be denied or charged more for coverage under       the AHCA. One paper estimates that a national high-risk       pool would cost $178.1 billion a year, roughly $176.4       billion more than the annual funding provided to the       Invisible Risk Sharing Program. Also, shifting people out       of the existing health insurance marketplace to a high-      risk pool would undermine the assurance that enrollees       could keep their existing coverage.        The Limited Waiver Option will also allow states to seek       waivers from the essential health benefits required of all       plans sold in the individual insurance market, with the       result that millions of patients will be at risk of losing       coverage for essential services like maternity care, cancer       screening tests and treatments, prescription drugs,       preventive services, mental health and substance use disorder       treatments, and even physician visits, prescription drugs and       hospitalizations.        Prior to passage of the ACA, 62% of individual market       enrollees did not have coverage of maternity services, 34 did       not have substance-use disorder-services, 18% did not have       mental-health services and 9% did not have coverage for       prescription drugs. A recent independent analysis found that       the AHCA's repeal of current law required benefits would       result in patients on average paying $1,952 more for cancer       drugs; $1,807 for drugs for heart disease; $1,127 for drugs       to treat lung diseases; $1,607 for drugs to treat mental       illnesses; $4,940 for inpatient admission for mental health;       $4,555 for inpatient admission for substance use treatment;       and $8,501 for maternity care. Such increased costs would       make it practically impossible for many patients to avail       themselves of the care they need. The result will be delays       in getting treatment until their illnesses present at a more       advanced, less treatable, and more expensive stage, or not       keeping up with life-saving medications prescribed by their       physicians.        Allowing states to eliminate the EHB will threaten our       nation's fight against the opioid epidemic. A study concluded       that with repeal of the ACA, ``approximately 1,253,000 people       with serious mental disorders and about 2.8 million Americans       with a substance use disorder, of whom about 222,000 have an       opioid disorder, would lose some or all of their insurance       coverage.'' Finally, allowing states to drop important       benefits like maternity, substance use disorder treatment,       and preventive services will do little to reduce premiums. A       report by Milliman found that the main drivers of premium       costs were ambulatory patient services, hospitalization, and       prescription drugs. These are crucial services that form the       core of any health insurance plan.        To be clear: while some younger and healthier persons might       be offered lower premiums in states that obtained a ``Limited       Waiver'' of community-rating and essential health benefits,       it would be at the expense of making coverage unaffordable       for those who need it most, older and sicker persons, and       result in skimpy ``bare-bones'' insurance for many others       that does not cover the medical care they would need if and       when they get sick.        Finally, even without the Limited Waiver Amendment, ACP       continues to believe that the AHCA has numerous other       provisions and policies that that will do great harm to       patients including:        The phase-out of the higher federal match in states that       have opted to expand Medicaid and the ban on non-expansion       states being able to access the higher federal contribution       if they choose to expand Medicaid;        Converting the shared federal-state financing structure for       Medicaid to one that would cap the federal contribution per       enrollee;        Providing states with a Medicaid block grant financing       option;        Eliminating EHBs for Medicaid expansion enrollees;        Imposing work or job search requirements on certain       Medicaid enrollees;        Regressive age-based tax credits, combined with changes       that will allow insurers to charge older people much higher       premiums than allowed under current law;        Continuous coverage requirements for patients with pre-      existing conditions;        Legislative or regulatory restrictions that would deny or       result in discrimination in the awarding of federal grant       funds and/or Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program       funding to women's health clinics that are qualified under       existing federal law for  [[Page H4123]]       the provision of evidence-based services including, but not       limited to, provision of contraception, preventive health       screenings, sexually transmitted infection testing and       treatment, vaccines, counseling, rehabilitation, and       referrals, and;        Elimination of the Prevention and Public Health Fund, which       provides billions in dollars to the Centers for Disease       Control and Prevention to prevent and control the spread of       infectious diseases.        The College strongly believes in the first, do no harm       principle. Therefore, we continue to urge that Congress move       away from the fundamentally flawed and harmful policies that       would result from the American Health Care Act and from the       changes under consideration--including the proposed ``Limited       Waiver'' amendment--that would make the bill even worse for       patients. We urge Congress to instead start over and seek       agreement on bipartisan ways to improve and build on the ACA.       The College welcomes the opportunity to share our ideas for       bipartisan solutions that would help make health care better,       more accessible, and more affordable for patients rather than       imposing great harm on them as the AHCA would do.            Sincerely,                                               Jack Ende, MD, MACP,                                                         President.     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  Cancer Action Network against this bill.                                              Cancer Action Network,                                         American Cancer Society,                                                        May 3, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi: The American       Cancer Society Cancer Action Network (ACS CAN) is deeply       concerned about the reports of additional amendments to the       American Health Care Act (AHCA), including one that would       allegedly add $8 billion in new spending for state high-risk       pools. This amendment is particularly egregious because it       would further incent states to apply for waivers from       current-law market rules that protect patients with pre-      existing conditions.        Historically, state high-risk pools have fallen short of       providing coverage of prevention, treatment and follow-up       care for cancer patients and survivors. Segmenting people       with cancer and other serious illnesses away from the private       marketplace and into high-risk pools absent an adequate and       permanent source of public funding has never been an adequate       solution.        Between 1976 and 2010, 35 states created high-risk pools to       cover individuals who could not otherwise purchase insurance       in the private market, usually because of a pre-existing       condition. Every one of those risk pools experienced net       operating losses year after year. Furthermore, high-risk       pools did not result in lower premiums. All of them set       premiums above the non-group market average or standard rate       in the state, usually by 150-200 percent. Only a few states       provided additional premium assistance for low-income       individuals, leaving many who could not afford premiums       priced out of the program. Most states also imposed waiting       periods before covering preexisting conditions. An individual       with a prior cancer diagnosis often had to wait 6-12 months       before the high-risk pool would cover the costs associated       with cancer treatment or follow-up survivorship care. Most       states imposed limitations on coverage with either lifetime       or annual limits. And most plans offered deductibles of       $1,000 or higher. Neither AHCA, nor the new amendment would       fully protect patients from any of those conditions.        Cancer patients and survivors need insurance coverage that       is affordable, readily accessible, and protects them from       pre-existing condition exclusions, annual and lifetime caps       on coverage and extraordinary out-of-pocket costs. Past       experience has shown that high-risk pools failed to meet       these basic needs, yet still were a drain on state budgets.        As we have indicated in our earlier letters, there are       reasonable fixes that could be made to the current law. We       stand ready to work with you to develop policies that improve       the law and encourage a robust health insurance market that       provides affordable and comprehensive coverage options.            Sincerely,                                             Christopher W. Hansen,                                                         President.     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  American Society of Clinical Oncology against this bill.                                                 American Society of                                               Clinical Oncology,                                                     April 27, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan, On behalf of the American Society of       Clinical Oncology (ASCO), I write to express our strong       opposition to the American Health Care Act (AHCA), as       currently amended. As the leading professional society       representing more than 42,000 physicians worldwide who care       for people with cancer, ASCO has a unique perspective on the       law's potential impact on cancer patients. Our core mission       is to ensure every patient with cancer has meaningful access       to high quality care. We believe Congress shares this goal       and our comments today are in the spirit of advancing that       common purpose.        In January 2017, as Congress embarked upon the repeal and       replacement of the Affordable Care Act, ASCO shared a set of       guiding principles that support improvements to the current       health care system. We also put forth specific areas where       people with cancer need protections. Our principles rest on       the belief that any health system reform must ensure all       people affected by cancer receive high-quality care. ASCO's       first principle states, ``all Americans should have access to       affordable and sufficient healthcare coverage regardless of       their income or health status. To ensure protected access,       the current ban on preexisting condition limitations,       elimination of annual and lifetime coverage caps, and       maintenance of guaranteed renewability should be preserved.''       We take the position that ``any efforts to reform the       healthcare system at the national, state, or local levels       should ensure that individuals with healthcare insurance can       continue to access affordable insurance without       interruption.'' The amended AHCA violates these principles.        Studies show that when cancer patients do not have adequate       insurance they receive less care, receive it later, and have       worse outcomes than those with better insurance coverage.       Uninsured and under-insured families facing a cancer       diagnosis experience significant stress. They often are       unable to meet out-of-pocket expenses and even forgo cancer       care in order to pay for necessities of daily living. The       AHCA as currently constructed will create or worsen these       barriers to care. It will add costs to the system, decrease       access to appropriate treatment and increase existing       disparities in care.        We are especially concerned with provisions allowing state       waivers that could erode important protections for patients       with cancer, including pre-existing condition safeguards,       coverage of essential services, and access to affordable       health insurance. Removing these protections from current       federal law allows for a weakening of these critical       provisions in some states and establishes a system of       inequitable protections across state lines for cancer       patients. We urge policymakers to ensure that robust       requirements are in place to ensure that all insurance       products cover the full scope of services and therapies that       cancer patients require.        ASCO strongly opposes passage of the AHCA in its current       form. We welcome the opportunity to address these issues--and       to work toward a better proposal--with you and your staff.            Sincerely,      Daniel F. Hayes, MD, FASCO, FACP,        President, American Society of Clinical                                                          Oncology.     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine against this bill.                                                American Congress of                                         Rehabilitation Medicine,                                                        May 2, 2017.      Re Deep Concerns with the American Health Care Act and           Related Amendments.       Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Democratic Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: The American Congress       of Rehabilitation Medicine (ACRM) writes in reference to the       American Health Care Act (AHCA), H.R. 1628, and the MacArthur       Amendment to the bill. ACRM is an organization of       rehabilitation professionals dedicated to serving people with       disabling conditions by supporting research and services that       promote health, independence, productivity, and quality of       life; and meet the needs of rehabilitation clinicians and       individuals with disabilities.        ACRM is seriously concerned that current House proposals       will undercut the federal coverage standard for       rehabilitation and habilitation services and devices       established under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Access to       rehabilitation enables individuals experiencing injuries,       illnesses, and disabilities to maximize their quality of life       by enhancing their health, function, and independence. We       believe that any ACA repeal and replace bill that advances in       the House and Senate must maintain access to rehabilitation       and habilitation services and devices.        In particular, the AHCA (H.R. 1628, as amended) includes a       provision that would allow states to apply for waivers       exempting them from compliance with important patient       protections that are required by the Affordable Care Act       (ACA), including premium rating ratios based on age,       protections for consumers disallowing medical status       underwriting (i.e., community rating), and requirements for       insurers to cover a defined package of essential health       benefits (EHBs), which include rehabilitative and       habilitative services and devices. We are deeply concerned       these EHB changes will curtail access for both children and       adults in Medicaid expansion states, as well as private ACA       health plans. ACRM believes that these provisions will       significantly undermine the health insurance coverage that       patients need.        ACRM urges Congress to work in a bipartisan manner to       improve access to affordable, comprehensive care for all       Americans,  [[Page H4124]]       including those with disabilities and chronic conditions       needing rehabilitation and habilitation services and devices.                                     Douglas Katz, MD, FACRM, FAAN,                                                    ACRM President.     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities in strong opposition to this  bill.                                             Consortium for Citizens                                               With Disabilities,                                                     April 28, 2017.        Dear Member of Congress: The Consortium for Citizens with       Disabilities (CCD) is strongly opposed to the amended       American Health Care Act. The amended American Health Care       Act retains the original bill's proposals to dramatically cut       Medicaid services that are vital to people with disabilities       and seniors through per capita caps, which CCD has opposed.       The new amendments--including permitting states to seek       waivers from the protections for people with pre-existing       conditions and from the requirement to provide essential       health benefits--makes the amended AHCA even more harmful to       people with disabilities. We urge you to oppose this       legislation.        Medicaid provides services and supports that maintain the       health, function, independence, and well-being of 10 million       enrollees living with disabilities. For many people with       disabilities, being able to access timely needed care is a       life or death matter. The American Health Care Act changes       the way that the Federal Government funds Medicaid--rather       than paying states based on the actual costs of healthcare       for people in Medicaid, it sets a cap on the amount of       federal support, a cap that is totally unrelated to the       actual costs of needed care for enrollees. This cap is       designed to cut Medicaid, and the bill uses those cuts to pay       for unrelated tax cuts. Slashing federal support for       Medicaid, which is already a lean program, will force states       to cut services and eligibility that put the health and       wellbeing of people with disabilities at significant risk.        The newest amendments to the American Health Care Act make       the bill even more harmful to people with disabilities. The       new amendments would allow states to easily obtain waivers       that would allow them to charge higher premiums to people       with pre-existing conditions, including people with       disabilities. They also would allow states to seek waivers       from the Affordable Care Act's requirement to provide       essential health benefits, including crucial services for       people with disabilities such as mental health and substance       use disorder services, prescription drugs, rehabilitative and       habilitative services and devices, preventative and wellness       services and chronic disease management, and pediatric       services. These waivers jeopardize the Affordable Care Act's       protections for people with pre-existing conditions,       including people with disabilities, and CCD opposes any roll-      back of those protections.        The ACA helped millions of people with disabilities and       others to gain access to affordable and comprehensive health       insurance. The amended American Health Care Act is       insufficient to help people with disabilities meet their       healthcare needs, and we urge you to oppose the bill should       it come to a vote.            Sincerely,        Health Task Force Co-chairs: Bethany Lilly, Bazelon Center       for Mental Health Law; Dave Machledt, National Health Law       Program; Peter Thomas, Brain Injury Association of America;       and Julie Ward, The Arc of the United States.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Moulton.)    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from  Children's Leadership Council opposed to this bill.                                  Children's Leadership Council,                                                        May 1, 2017.        Dear Representative: The Children's Leadership Council       opposes the American Health Care Act (AHCA) because it would       jeopardize health care for millions of babies, children,       youth and families. We urge you to vote NO on this       legislation.        The Children's Leadership Council (CLC) is a coalition of       organizations dedicated to improving the lives and       opportunities of America's children. Nationwide, CLC members       work to advance the health, education and well-being of       babies, children and youth in order to prepare them for       school, work, and life. The CLC is the only national       children's coalition solely dedicated to supporting       investments in our nation's children and youth; and       collectively, CLC's members have affiliates, partners, and       members in every state in the nation.        The Affordable Care Act and Medicaid play a crucial role in       the lives of children, including those facing the greatest       challenges such as children in poverty; children suffering       abuse and neglect; children in foster care, and children with       disabilities. Medicaid, for example, provides coverage for       approximately 37 million children, including children with       disabilities, children in foster care and children from low-      income families. Children are the largest group of Medicaid       recipients, and nearly 40 percent of all the nation's       children rely on Medicaid and CHIP for their healthcare.       Medicaid provides health care treatment and preventive       services, mental health care, case management and       transportation services to and from medical appointments for       children who are low-income or disabled. The AHCA's changes       to Medicaid would radically restructure a program that has       worked for more than 50 years to support children's health.       The Medicaid cap would shift $839 billion to stages, forcing       them to cut eligibility, benefits, or provider rates that       could have disastrous health consequences.        There is no question that the massive cuts to Medicaid,       increased premiums likely for millions of families, and       eliminating the Essential Health Benefits requirements under       current law will seriously harm children and families.       Maternity benefits would be among the many medical services       no longer guaranteed if this bill were to become law. The       massive Medicaid reductions in substance abuse treatment will       add to the increases nationwide in the need for child welfare       services because of the surge in opioid addiction. Families       caring for children with disabilities will find supports for       care at home jeopardized.        With a record 95% of children with health coverage in our       country, the AHCA would turn back the clock on progress for       children. And recent proposed changes to the bill would       further undermine consumer protections that make health care       out of reach for low-income children and their families--thus       making the already harmful bill worse for children. Polling       conducted by the Children's Leadership Council found 71       percent of parents, including 67 percent of Independent       parents (of children under the age of 18), want increased       investments in programs that help children in the areas of       education, health and nutrition, not less as proposed by the       AHCA.        Congress has a strong history of working on a bipartisan,       bicameral basis on issues, policies and programs important to       children. It is our hope and expectation that members of       Congress continue this history, as Congress works on       improving our nation's healthcare system. This legislation       would be a dangerous step backward. We strongly urge you to       vote NO.            Sincerely,                                                  Randi Schmidt,                                      Executive Director, Children's                                                Leadership Council.     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  Paralyzed Veterans of America against this bill.                                  Paralyzed Veterans of America,                                        Washington, DC, May 3, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: Paralyzed Veterans of       America (PVA) urges  [[Page H4125]]       rejection of the latest version of the American Health Care       Act (AHCA). PVA is the nation's only Congressionally-      chartered veterans' service organization solely dedicated to       representing veterans with spinal cord injury and/or disease.       Consequently, we are very concerned about the conflicting       information circulating about this legislation and the       adverse impact it could have on our members and millions of       other people with disabilities.        As we understand it, the AHCA cuts $880 billion out of the       Medicaid program in order to finance tax cuts that will       explode the deficit and largely assist upper income       individuals, corporations, and providers. The Medicaid       changes are particularly devastating to people with       disabilities. Under the cap and cut proposal, the federal       government would no longer share in the costs of providing       health care services and community services beyond the capped       amount. This would eliminate the enhanced federal match for       the Community First Choice Option under Medicaid that       provides attendant care services in the community. Thanks to       this program, many poor veterans with serious non-service-      connected disabilities have been able to move from nursing       homes into their communities. The AHCA also weakens Medicaid       by ending the Medicaid expansion earlier and offering       Medicaid block grants to states. Data from the Robert Wood       Johnson Foundation shows expansion has helped thousands of       veterans and their caregivers.        For veterans and PVA members in particular, the AHCA       continues several problematic policies of the ACA as well as       troubling new provisions that could affect the ability of       many veterans and their family members to afford health       insurance in the private market. The underlying AHCA bill:        Continues to exclude CHAMPVA beneficiaries--dependents of       the most catastrophically disabled veterans--from the       dependents' coverage policy up to age 26.        Fails to remove the prohibition on enrollment into the VA       health care system for Priority Group 8 veterans, thus       denying these veterans access to the principal health care       system for veterans.        Denies access to tax credits making health insurance       affordable to anyone eligible for a host of other federal       health programs, including those ``eligible'' for coverage       under Title 38 health care programs. This would prevent many       veterans who may be ``eligible for'' but not enrolled in the       VA health care system from accessing these tax credits       intended to help people buy insurance.        Not only do the changes made to the original version of the       AHCA continue its failure to protect veterans and people with       disabilities, they make these circumstances worse. The latest       changes would allow states to seek waivers that would allow       insurers to charge higher premiums to people with pre-      existing conditions, including people with disabilities. The       new amendments also would allow states to seek waivers from       the ACA's requirement that certain essential health benefits       must be provided, including crucial services for people with       disabilities such as prescription drugs, rehabilitative and       habilitative services and devices, preventative and wellness       services and chronic disease management. The combination of       these changes would make it nearly impossible for people with       pre-existing conditions to find affordable plans that cover       basic health care services.        Throughout these past few months, the American people have       been calling for a bipartisan effort to improve the nation's       health care system. Congress should heed these voices, stop       its pursuit of the flawed American Health Care Act and work       together through regular order to strengthen all Americans'       access to affordable, high quality health care.            Sincerely,                                                        Carl Blake,                                      Associate Executive Director.     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  March of Dimes opposed to this bill.                         [From the march of dimes]   Under AHCA, Over 6 Million Women of Childbearing Age Will Lose Health                                  Coverage         Dear Representative: Prior to 2010, low-income adult women       could generally only obtain Medicaid coverage after they were       pregnant. By the time they enrolled in this coverage, many of       the best opportunities for guaranteeing a healthy pregnancy       and healthy baby had already been missed.        Today, states that have expanded Medicaid can extend       Medicaid coverage to low-income women of childbearing age,       giving them the chance to get healthy before they get       pregnant. The March of Dimes estimates that approximately 6.5       million low income women of childbearing age are currently       covered under Medicaid expansion, giving them access to       treatment for tobacco use, obesity, substance abuse, and       other conditions that can have a major impact on future       pregnancies. Between 2012 and 2015, the rate of uninsurance       among women of childbearing age dropped by 40%, with much of       that decline attributable to Medicaid expansion.        The American Health Care Act (AHCA) would do away with       these advances by rolling back Medicaid expansion. Its       fundamental restructuring of the traditional Medicaid program       would also likely lead to significant coverage losses or       restriction of services to beneficiaries, including pregnant       women. These changes do a serious disservice to low-income       women and families by denying them access to the care they       need to lead healthy lives and, ultimately, have healthy       pregnancies and give birth to healthy infants.        The MacArthur amendment and other proposed changes to the       AHCA do not address these issues. Women, infants, families,       and communities will bear the longterm cost if health care       for women of childbearing age and pregnant women is       shortchanged and more babies are born sick as a result. The       March of Dimes urges all Representatives to oppose the       American Health Care Act.            Sincerely,                                                 Stacey D. Stewart,                                                         President.     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from  AFSCME in strong opposition to this bill.                                                         AFSCME,                                                        May 3, 2017.      U.S. House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.6 million working       and retiree members of the American Federation of State,       County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), I am writing to       express our continuing opposition to the American Health Care       Act (AHCA), notwithstanding the addition of the Upton       amendment.        The harm that AHCA will impose on ordinary Americans is       breathtaking in scope. As the Congressional Budget Office has       detailed, 24 million will lose their health care coverage.       The Medicaid program will be cut by $839 billion and       restructured, ending the guarantee that the federal       government will fund a specified share of state Medicaid       costs. The bill makes coverage more expensive, especially for       lower-income families and older workers and it undermines the       financial strength of Medicare. And the MacArthur amendment       makes a very bad bill worse by allowing states to opt out of       Affordable Care Act protections that ensure that people with       pre-existing conditions will be able to obtain comprehensive,       affordable health care. Moreover, the MacArthur amendment       would allow insurance companies to re-impose caps on annual       and lifetime limits, even in employer-sponsored coverage,       putting the health care of those with catastrophic illnesses       or injuries at risk.        Under the Upton amendment, grants to states that could be       used for high-risk pools will be increased by 6% or $8       billion over five years. This is a paltry increase. Even the       conservative Mercatus Center described the increase as a       ``pittance.'' High-risk pools would still be grossly       underfunded, even if states put all of the $138 billion in       grant funding into them. We urge the Congress not to ignore       the previous experience with state high-risk pools. By       segregating those with pre-existing conditions into separate       coverage we know they will face higher premiums, benefit       exclusions, annual and lifetime limits on coverage and       waiting lists.        It is unacceptable that this bill eliminates $500 billion       in taxes on the wealthiest 2%, health insurers,       pharmaceutical manufacturers and medical device makers, while       taking health care away from millions. Moreover, the bill       retains the 40% tax on high cost health plans, which will       undermine employer-sponsored insurance for working families       by hollowing out coverage and increasing out-of-pocket       expenses, although it delays the implementation for six       years.        The bottom line is that this bill would cause millions to       lose their health coverage. Most of those with pre-existing       conditions would return to the days when even inadequate       coverage was unaffordable. The bill would drive up costs for       those who are older and lower-income, shift costs to states,       fail to protect employer-sponsored coverage, weaken public       health and undermine the solvency of the Medicare trust       fund--all the while providing tax cuts for the wealthy and       well-connected.        The priorities demonstrated by this bill are upside down.       We urge you to oppose this bill.            Sincerely,                                                        Scott Frey,                            Director of Federal Government Affairs.     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  National Farmers Union in strong opposition to this bill.                                         National Farmers Union,                                                        May 3, 2017.        Dear Member of Congress: I write on behalf of nearly       200,000 members of the National Farmers Union (NFU) who are       engaged in all forms of farming and ranching. NFU has already       spoken in opposition of the American Health Care Act (AHCA)       because of the estimated 24 million Americans who would lose       coverage as a result. The most recent amendment to the AHCA       only moves further away from NFU's member-driven policy of       affirming ``the right of all Americans to have access to       affordable, quality health care.''        Farming is a dangerous occupation, ranking 6th in       occupational fatality rates. The injury rate for agricultural       workers is also 40% higher than the rate of all workers.       Finally, the average age of farmers in the United States is       over 58 years. U.S. health care policy must take into account       the unique needs of the men and women who provide food and       fiber for our country and much of the world.        Our current health care system is not without its problems,       but progress has been  [[Page H4126]]       made since the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The       current structure of tax credits and premium subsidies help       farmers maintain consistent coverage, especially during       downturns in the farm economy. The expansion of Medicaid has       proven beneficial to rural communities, where the rate of       enrollment is higher than in urban America. The Health       Insurance Marketplace, while certainly in need of stabilizing       measures, makes coverage more accessible for many farm       families.        The correlation between a strong Medicaid program and the       success of rural hospitals has become evident during the       influx of rural hospital closures over the last six years.       Seventy-eight rural hospitals have closed since 2010 with       over 80% of those located in states that opted out of the       Medicaid expansion. With another 673 hospitals at risk of       closure, the AHCA's proposed Medicaid cap could have       devastating consequences for rural communities.        In 2012, 75 percent of farms sold less than $50,000 in       agricultural products and 57% had sales less than $10,000.       Young farm families that don't receive additional income or       health benefits from off-farm jobs would find it extremely       difficult to purchase health insurance. The proposed       legislation would also hurt older farmers. Easing       restrictions on what insurance companies can charge older       customers will leave older farmers facing increased premiums       of thousands of dollars, despite the larger subsidies some       would receive.        The modified AHCA bill also has a significant negative       impact on those with pre-existing conditions. It's estimated       that 40 percent of 50- to 64-year-olds would be denied       coverage in the individual market without the Affordable Care       Act's protections for those with preexisting conditions. The       waiver option would mean that a large number of farmers in       many states would be forced into high-risk pools. This       legislation is woefully short in funding for those high-risk       pools, leaving individuals with preexisting conditions to       contend with increased premiums, higher deductibles and       longer waiting periods for coverage.        Affordable access to quality health coverage is a high       priority for all Americans. As you consider how to best       improve our health care system, we ask that you give serious       consideration to the needs of farmers and ranchers. While       there is certainly room for improvement in current policy,       the American Health Care Act will only hurt family farmers       and rural communities across the country. NFU requests that       you oppose the proposed legislation.        We appreciate your efforts to provide all Americans with       high-quality comprehensive health insurance. Thank you for       your consideration.            Sincerely,                                                     Roger Johnson,                                                         President.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Neal), the distinguished ranking  member of the Committee on Ways and Means.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Crowley), the chairman of the Democratic Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  National Education Association in strong opposition to this bill.                                                        May 3, 2017.      Hon. James P. McGovern,      House of Representatives, House Office Building, Washington,           DC.        Dear Congressman McGovern: On behalf of our three million       members and the 50 million students they serve, we strongly       urge you to oppose H.R. 1628, the American Health Care Act as       amended. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found that by       2026, the original bill would provide $883 billion in tax       cuts while taking health coverage away from 24 million       people, including some of the most vulnerable among us--the       poor, the sick, the elderly, and the children who constitute       more than half the current Medicaid enrollment. Votes on this       issue may be included in NEA's Report Card for the 15th       Congress.        The April 25 amendment made the original bill even worse.       It allows states to jettison existing essential health       benefit requirements, thereby permitting health plans       covering millions of people once again to exclude coverage       for maternity and newborn care, pediatric dental and vision       services, mental health and substance use services, and other       crucial benefits. The May 3 amendment is the equivalent of a       tiny bandage on a gaping wound. The cost of setting up       separate pools or premium assistance programs for people with       pre-existing conditions far exceeds the $8 billion spread       over five years the amendment provides--nationwide, at least       $25 billion per year would be required, according to the       Kaiser Family Foundation.        Both the original and amended American Health Care Act       threaten to return this country to the days when annual and       lifetime dollar-based limits on the use of essential health       benefits shifted tremendous financial and health risks to       working families. Insurance companies could charge people       with pre-existing conditions many times more than they charge       healthy people--just as they did before the Affordable Care       Act. Millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions would       be at risk of losing health coverage or face premiums so high       only the very wealthy could afford them--the same people who       benefit from the massive tax cuts in the original bill.        Specifically, we are concerned that this legislation will:       Lead to drastic cuts in Medicaid benefits and eligible       beneficiaries. The American Health Care Act radically       restructures how Medicaid is funded. Instead of the federal       government paying a percentage of actual Medicaid spending,       each state will get a set amount. States will choose between       a block grant, a lump sum payment, and a ``per capita cap,''       a flat amount for certain Medicaid beneficiaries. Either way,       state budgets will take a big hit: the share of revenue spent       on Medicaid will rise from 24.5 percent in 2017 to 28 percent       by 2025, according to Moody's Investors Service. To       compensate for the loss of federal support, states are likely       to divert money from education to health care as well as       limit the number of Medicaid beneficiaries, the scope of       Medicaid benefits, or both.        Hit the students most in need the hardest. Under the       Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), Medicaid       reimburses schools for mental health care, vision and hearing       screenings, diabetes and asthma management, wheelchairs and       hearing aids, and more. Federal support is substantial--for       example, in 2015 California schools received about $90       million from Medicaid, Florida schools about $63 million, New       York schools about $137 million, Pennsylvania schools about       $131 million, and Texas schools about $250 million (Source:       Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, compilation of 2017 data).       Capping federal support for Medicaid will shift costs to the       states, jeopardizing services essential for students to learn       and thrive, especially those with disabilities.        Increase the cost of health care for those least able to       afford it. The American Health Care Act provides largely age-      based tax credits ranging from $2,000 to $4,000 per year--far       less than today's subsidies. For example, according to Kaiser       Family Foundation calculations, a 60-year-old earning $20,000       a year in Lincoln, Nebraska, now gets $18,470 to help buy       insurance and additional subsidies to help with deductibles       and co-payments. Under the American Health Care Act, she       would get a $4,000 tax credit for the premium and nothing for       other out-of-pocket health  [[Page H4127]]       care costs. By 2026, the average subsidy under the American       Health Care Act would be half the average subsidy under the       Affordable Care Act, according to CBO.        Tax ``high cost'' employer-sponsored health coverage. We       recognize that the American Health Care Act postpones the       effective date of the 40 percent excise tax on such plans       until 2026. But this tax--a back-door pay cut for millions of       working families--needs to be fully repealed.        Enhance tax breaks for the rich. The American Health Care       Act nearly doubles the amount of money that can be socked       away in tax-free health savings accounts--at least $6,550 for       individuals and at least $13,100 for families in 2018. It       also repeals a 3.8 percent investment tax and 0.9 percent       surcharge on wages above $250,000--a savings of about       $195,000 per year for the top 0.1 percent of earners,       according to the independent Tax Policy Center.        Weaken the individual insurance market and employment-based       coverage. The American Health Care Act eliminates penalties       for individuals not buying--and large employers not       providing--health coverage. But premiums go up 30 percent if       coverage lapses for more than 63 days--for example, when       someone loses her job and cannot afford to buy health       insurance until she gets another one. Overall, CBO predicts       substantial increases in out-of-pocket costs for low- and       moderate-income people due to the decline in subsidies and       increase in deductibles and other cost-sharing. Some       employers may gut their health plans or stop offering       coverage altogether, since they will no longer be penalized       for doing so.        The American Health Care Act plays Robin Hood in reverse.       It reneges on the promise to deliver better, cheaper health       coverage for all Americans, giving the richest among us       massive tax cuts while causing the number of people without       insurance to rise from 28 million today to an estimated 52       million in 2026, according to CBO.        We strongly urge you to oppose the amended American Health       Care Act--deeply flawed legislation that is even worse than       the original bill.            Sincerely,                                                      Marc Egan,                                   Director of Government Relations,                                    National Education Association.     Mr. Speaker, I include a letter from the American  Academy of Pediatrics, American College of Nurse-Midwives, American  College of Physicians, American Congress of Obstetricians and  Gynecologists, National Association of Nurse Practitioners in Women's  Health, National Partnership for Women & Families, and Planned  Parenthood Federation of America.                                                       May 1, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: On behalf of       physicians, certified nurse-midwives/certified midwives, and       nurse practitioners who provide care for the women of       America, along with our patient partners, we stand together       for women and families and against House passage of the       MacArthur (R-NJ) Amendment to the American Health Care Act       (AHCA, H.R. 1628). Rather than support recent gains in       women's access to healthcare and coverage, the MacArthur       Amendment and AHCA turn back the clock and reverse hard-won       progress. We stand ready to continue work with Congress to       advance legislation that promotes women's health, healthcare       and coverage.        In our letter of March 22, 2017, we expressed opposition to       the AHCA because it threatened women's access to care       protected by Essential Health Benefits (EHBs) requirements,       eliminated the Medicaid expansion, cut qualified providers at       Planned Parenthood from the Medicaid program, and made severe       reductions to Medicaid and other programs critical to women       and newborns. We said that important health initiatives for       women and newborns should be built upon and improved--not       rolled back.        However, the MacArthur Amendment to AHCA places women's       health and coverage at even greater risk. The MacArthur       Amendment would enable states to waive EHBs including those       for maternity and newborn care, preventive services, and       services for mental health and substance use disorders; to       waive community rating rules; and to shunt patients with       costly healthcare conditions or illnesses into unproven       government high risk pools. Supporters of the bill claim this       bill maintains protections for those with preexisting       conditions, but allowing states to waive coverage of EHB and       charge people more based on their health status renders the       promise of coverage for preexisting conditions to be       meaningless. If all that the Secretary may require of a state       waiver application is an un-validated attestation that the       purpose of their requested waiver is to reduce premium costs,       increase the number of persons with healthcare coverage, or       advance another benefit to the public interest in the state,       including the guarantee of coverage for persons with pre-      existing medical conditions, it is meaningless in protecting       health, quality healthcare and coverage. Women and families       must not be made to suffer, lose access to care and coverage,       and pay higher healthcare costs.        EHB is a critical protection that ensures women have       guaranteed access to a robust set of health care services.       Making certain categories of coverage optional--such as       maternity care--would not substantially lower the premiums       that people pay for health coverage. For example, the       requirement for maternity care as an EHB is not a source of       health cost growth. Rather, by sharing risk across a broad       population of beneficiaries it provides vital protection for       women and families from the risk of tens of thousands of       dollars of out-of-pocket costs associated with normal       physiologic labor and delivery, cesarean section, and birth       complications. In exchange for monthly premium costs of just       $8-14 according to one recent analysis, the maternity care       EHB provides significant security for people wishing to grow       their families in the U.S. Furthermore, since everyone is at       some point a newborn, childbirth affects all of us. Enabling       exclusion of maternity care from health coverage denies       people access to the care that everyone deserves for the best       start in life.        Congress should move to protect and advance health, quality       care and coverage, particularly for women and newborns, and       not to endanger them as the AHCA and the MacArthur Amendment       would do. Americans of both parties agree. A recent Kaiser       Family Foundation poll found ``relatively few Americans want       to see the president and Congress decrease funding for a       variety of different health priorities--including spending       for reproductive health services for lower-income women (21       percent).''        When women have access to quality, evidence-based,       affordable care throughout their lives, they enrich our       workforce, achieve higher levels of education, reach their       goals, and actively contribute to the success of their       families and their communities. We urge the U.S. House in the       strongest possible terms to get it right, not fast. The AHCA       and the MacArthur Amendment turn the clock back on women's       health and should not move forward.        We stand ready to continue assisting Congress in advancing       health policy that supports women's access to high quality       healthcare and coverage, and is effective at controlling and       reducing the costs that people pay for their healthcare.            Sincerely,        American Academy of Pediatrics, American College of Nurse-      Midwives, American College of Physicians, American Congress       of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, National Association of       Nurse Practitioners in Women's Health, National Partnership       for Women & Families, Planned Parenthood Federation of       America.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  National Rural Health Association opposed to this bill.                [From the National Rural Health Association]                  Vote NO to the American Health Care Act         The National Rural Health Association urges a NO vote on       the American Health Care Act (AHCA).        Rural Americans are older, poorer and sicker than other       populations. In fact, a January 2017 CDC report pronounced       that life expectancies for rural Americans have declined and       the top five chronic diseases are worse in rural America. The       AHCA does nothing to improve the health care crisis in rural       America, and will lead to poorer rural health outcomes, more       uninsured and an increase in the rural hospital closure       crisis.        Though some provisions in the modified AHCA bill improve       the base bill, NRHA is concerned that the bill still falls       woefully short in making health care affordable and       accessible to rural Americans. For example, the modified bill       contains a decrease in the Medical Expense Deduction       threshold from 10% to 5.8% in an attempt to assist Americans       between the ages of 50 and 64 who would see their premiums       skyrocket under the current plan. However, this deduction is       not a credit and therefore would be of little use to low       income seniors that are in very low tax brackets or do not       pay income tax at all. Additionally, the new amendments to       freeze Medicaid expansion enrollment as of Jan. 1, 2018, and       reduce the Medicaid per-capita growth rate will       disproportionately harm rural Americans.        The AHCA will hurt vulnerable populations in rural       Americans, leaving millions of the sickest, most underserved       populations in our nation without coverage, and further       escalating the rural hospital closure crisis. According to       the Wall Street Journal, the ``GOP health plan would hit       rural areas hard . . . Poor, older Americans would see the       largest increase in insurance-coverage costs.'' The LA Times       reports ``Americans who swept President Trump to victory--      lower-income, older voters in conservative, rural parts of       the country--stand to lose the most in federal healthcare aid       under a Republican plan to repeal and replace the Affordable       Care Act.'' Let's be clear--many provisions in the ACA failed       rural America. The lack of plan competition in rural markets,       exorbitant premiums, deductibles and co-pays, the co-op       collapses, lack of Medicaid expansion, and devastating       Medicare cuts to rural providers--all collided to create a       health care crisis in rural America. However, it's beyond       frustrating that an opportunity to fix these problems is       squandered, and instead, a greater health care crisis will be       created in rural America.        Congress has long recognized the importance of the rural       health care safety net and has steadfastly worked to protect       it. And now, much of the protections created to maintain       access to care for the 62 million who live in rural America       are in jeopardy. We implore Congress to continue its fight to       protect rural patients' access to care. Three improvements       are critical for rural patients and providers:        1. Medicaid--Though most rural residents are in non-      expansion states, a higher proportion of rural residents are       covered by Medicaid (21% vs. 16%).        Congress and the states have long recognized that rural is       different and thus requires different programs to succeed.       Rural payment programs for hospitals and providers are not       `bonus' payments, but rather alternative, cost-effective and       targeted payment formulas that maintain access to care for       millions of rural patients and financial stability for       thousands of rural providers across the country. Any federal       health care reform must protect a state's ability to protect       its rural safety net providers. The federal government must       not abdicate its moral, legal, and financial responsibilities       to rural, Medicaid eligible populations by ensuring access to       care.        Any federal health care reform proposal must protect access       to care in Rural America, and must provide an option to a       state to receive an enhanced reimbursement included in a       matching rate or a per capita cap, specifically targeted to       create stability among rural providers to maintain access to       care for rural communities. Enhancements must be equivalent       to the cost of providing care for rural safety net providers,       a safeguard that ensures the enhanced reimbursement is       provided to the safety net provider to allow for continued       access to care. Rural safety net providers include, but not       limited to, Critical Access Hospitals, Rural Prospective       Payment Hospitals, Rural Health Clinics, Indian Health.       Service providers, and individual rural providers.        2. Market Reform--Forty-one percent of rural marketplace       enrollees have only a single option of insurer, representing       70 percent of counties that have only one option. This lack       of competition in the marketplace means higher premiums.       Rural residents average per month cost exceeds urban ($569.34       for small town rural vs. $415.85 for metropolitan).        Rural Americans are more likely to have obesity, diabetes,       cancer, and traumatic injury; they are more likely to       participate in high risk health behaviors including smoking,       poor diet, physical inactivity, and substance abuse. Rural       Americans are more likely to be uninsured or underinsured and       less likely to receive employer sponsored health insurance.       Rural communities have fewer health care providers for       insurers to contract with to provide an adequate network to       serve the community.        Any federal health care reform proposal must address the       fact that insurance providers are withdrawing from rural       markets. Despite record profit levels, insurance companies       are permitted to cherry pick profitable markets for       participation and are currently not obliged to provide       service to markets with less advantageous risk pools.       Demographic realities of the rural population make the market       less profitable, and thus less desirable for an insurance       company with no incentive to take on such exposure. In the       same way that financial service institutions are required to       provide services to underserved neighborhoods, profitable       insurance companies should be required to provide services in       underserved communities.        3. Stop Bad Debt Cuts to Rural Hospitals--Rural hospitals       serve more Medicare patients (46% rural vs. 40.9% urban),       thus across-the-board Medicare cuts do not have across the       board impacts. A goal of the ACA was to have hospital bad       debt decrease significantly. However, because of unaffordable       health plans in rural areas, rural patients still cannot       afford health care. Bad debt among rural hospitals has       actually increased 50% since the ACA was passed. According to       MedPAC ``Average Medicare margins are negative, and under       current law they are expected to decline in 2016'' has led to       7% gains in median profit margins for urban providers while       rural providers have experienced a median loss of 6%.        If Congress does not act, all the decades of efforts to       protect rural patients' access to care, could rapidly be       undone. The National Rural Health Association implores       Congress to act now to protect rural health care across the       nation.     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  American Thoracic Society opposed to this bill.                                      American Thoracic Society,                                                     April 27, 2017.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 16,000 members of the       American Thoracic Society (ATS), I want to voice my grave       concerns with the latest legislative proposal developed to       repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA). While CBO       estimates are not yet available for the most recent       legislation proposal being considered in the House, we remain       concerned that the bill, if enacted, will result in a loss of       health insurance for millions of Americans. Should the       proposal come up for a vote in the near future, we urge you       to vote ``NO'' on the American Health Care Act.        The ATS opposes any legislation that does not ensure       affordable health insurance coverage for Americans currently       insured under  [[Page H4131]]       the ACA. We are concerned that allowing states to waive       important insurance reforms in the Affordable Care Act will       lead to reduced coverage for many Americans and significant       price increases for patients with pre-existing conditions.       Further, we are concerned that reliance on ``high risk       pools'' will not adequately meet the health insurance needs       of many Americans with pre-existing conditions. We note that       previous attempts at implementing state-based high risk pools       have been largely unsuccessful. Members of the ATS serve a       large and diverse patient population, including patients with       respiratory diseases, critical illnesses and sleep disorders       such as asthma, COPD, pneumonia, sepsis and obstructive sleep       apnea. Our patients cannot afford to lose affordable health       insurance coverage for any period of time.        The ATS looks forward to working with Congress to improve       our health care system and ensure health insurance coverage       for all Americans. If you have questions or need additional       information, please contact Nuala S. Moore, Associate       Director of Government Relations.

Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics opposed to this bill.                                                Academy of Nutrition                                                   and Dietetics,                                        Washington, DC, May 2, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Democratic Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: Nutrition services       save money, improve chronic disease outcomes and save lives.       For this reason, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, the       nation's largest organization of food and nutrition       professionals, remains opposed to H.R. 1628, the American       Health Care Act (AHCA) as amended by the MacArthur amendment.        The Academy and our 75,000-plus members believe that all       Americans should have both coverage and access to high-      quality health care. The Academy urges Congress to support       measures that include nutrition services and prevention that       reduces the cost of health care and improve patients' lives.        The new proposal set forth in the AHCA not only fails to       improve the health of all Americans, but it will worsen       patient care and public health by removing vital resources       that are currently effective in improving health across the       country.        This legislation continues to eliminate investments in       prevention and public health, reverse advancements made in       disease prevention and chronic care management, and according       to the Congressional Budget Office, would result in the loss       of health care coverage for at least 24 million Americans       Allowing states to waive pre-existing conditions and       essential health benefits will lead to decreased coverage and       utilization of vital nutrition services.        Individuals with chronic disease such as diabetes and       hypertension benefit from medical nutrition therapy and       nutrition services to lower their blood sugar and blood       pressure, while reducing reliance on expensive medications.       The cost of these services is inexpensive and replaces more       costly interventions that are necessary as chronic disease       progresses with many complications.        The Academy holds five key tenets for analyzing any       legislation to reform health care:        1. The health of all Americans should improve as a result       of our health policy choices. Sufficient resources must be       made available to ensure optimal health.        2. Access to quality health care is a right that must be       extended to all Americans.        3. Nutrition services, from pre-conception through end of       life, are an essential component of comprehensive health       care.        4. Stable, sufficient and reliable funding is necessary for       our health care system to provide everyone access to a core       package of benefits.        5. Health care must be patient-centered.        Affordable access to care is an ongoing challenge that any       reform legislation should address. Although this legislation       purports to provide access, it fails to make coverage more       affordable; unaffordable access to coverage is really not       coverage at all. The proposal fails to maintain a core       package of benefits that improve the health of Americans, by       removing a basic floor of services that should be provided       without cost-sharing to the Medicaid population.        Additionally, the new proposal would allow states to opt       out of requiring that health plans cover the Essential Health       Benefits which help reduce longer term health care costs,       allow insurers to charge people higher premiums based on pre-      existing conditions like nutrition related diseases like       diabetes and heart disease and increase out-of-pocket costs       for vulnerable older adults.        By repealing the Prevention and Public Health Fund, the       proposal eliminates the sole federal investment in       prevention, which will harm our state and local communities       that depend on these effective public-private partnerships to       improve the health of their communities.        The AHCA as currently drafted fails to meet the Academy's       five tenets, and therefore we cannot support the passage of       these proposals.        The Academy urges Congress to not hold future votes without       an evaluation of the proposed amendments from the       Congressional Budget Office estimating the budgetary impact       of the amended legislation and the anticipated effect on       coverage for Americans. We look forward to continued       collaboration to improve the health and nutrition for all       Americans.            Sincerely,                                                   Lucille Beseler,                                                         President.     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from The  Jewish Federations of North America opposed to this bill.                                              The Jewish Federations                                                of North America,                                        Washington, DC, May 2, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: The Jewish Federations       of North America (JFNA) remains staunchly opposed to the       American Health Care Act of 2017 (AHCA), even with the       recently released amendment proposed by Representative Tom       MacArthur (R-NJ). We are disappointed that AHCA retains the       devastating cuts to Medicaid included in the earlier version       of the legislation, cuts which are the result of the       legislation's proposal to dramatically restructure Medicaid's       federal financing structure and roll back coverage for 14       million people covered by the state Medicaid expansions. The       amendment does nothing to alleviate these concerns.        JFNA represents 148 Jewish federations and 300 network       communities that together support 15 leading academic medical       centers/health systems, 100 Jewish nursing homes, and 125       Jewish family & children's agencies, providing health care       for more than one million clients, Jewish and non-Jewish       alike. Medicaid is a lifeline for more than 80 million       people, including low-income children, older adults, and       people with disabilities nationwide. Medicaid is a vital       program for Jewish federations throughout the country and       particularly for our communal health and long-term care       partners that care for the most vulnerable in our       communities.        JFNA is deeply troubled by the findings of the       Congressional Budget Office (CBO) that AHCA will cause $839       billion in reductions--about 25 percent--to federal Medicaid       funding and a loss in coverage for more than 14 million       Medicaid beneficiaries. We believe that converting Medicaid       to a block grant or per capita cap will cause irreparable       harm not only to the millions who depend on the program, but       also to our large network of providers who care for them.        AHCA would convert the long-standing and fundamental       federal-state partnership of the Medicaid program to a block       grant or per capita cap system. Under either approach, states       would receive a limited amount of federal money for their       Medicaid programs. As CBO found, even under a per capita cap       system, the federal share is lower than the average annual       increase in Medicaid spending and will not be sufficiently       flexible to address a variety of key factors affecting       Medicaid spending, including major disasters, economic       downturns, unexpected health care cost increases, and       demographic changes, such as the rapidly aging baby boomer       generation. CBO projected that AHCA's $839 billion cut in       federal Medicaid funding will shift substantial costs to       state and local governments, our providers, and our patients,       thus exacerbating the existing strain on the program. We       agree with CBO's conclusion that, due to these reductions in       funding, states will be left with no choice but to reduce       Medicaid enrollment, eligibility for Medicaid benefits, and       payment rates. Many people who now qualify for Medicaid could       end up uninsured or losing access to critical health and       long-term care services.        JFNA is concerned by many of the unintended consequences of       this legislation, such as:        People who desperately need Medicaid and who are currently       eligible will become uninsured;        States will be forced to cut back on crucial Medicaid       services, such as home and community-based services,       effectively forcing people who are capable of living in the       community with proper home and community-based services into       nursing homes;        States will be forced to reduce already low provider       payment rates, thus further decreasing the pool of providers       serving Medicaid beneficiaries and increasing waiting times       for services; and,        Health care providers and entities that care for these       vulnerable populations will suffer additional financial       strain. As a result, these agencies will be forced to lay off       staff or close their doors altogether, resulting in       significant job losses and further hurting state economies.        For these reasons, we must oppose the legislation as       currently written and urge the House of Representatives to       reconsider moving forward with it. We stand ready to work       with you, in tandem with our Jewish communal health and long-      term care providers, to promote more targeted ways to reduce       Medicaid spending and develop a new framework of policies to       improve Medicaid quality, efficiency, and sustainability.            Sincerely,      William C. Daroff,  [[Page H4132]]         Senior Vice President for Public Policy & Director of the       Washington Office.     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article in The  Wall Street Journal today stating: ``. . . employers looking to lower  their costs could impose lifetime limits and eliminate the out-of- pocket cost cap from their plans under the GOP legislation.''                       [From the Wall Street Journal]    Little-Noted Provision of GOP Health Bill Could Alter Employer Plans       Last-minute amendment would allow states to obtain waivers from                  certain Affordable Care Act requirements                 (By Stephanie Armour and Michelle Hackman)         Many people who obtain health insurance through their       employers--about half of the country--could be at risk of       losing protections that limit out-of-pocket costs for       catastrophic illnesses, due to a little-noticed provision of       the House Republican health-care bill to be considered       Thursday, health-policy experts say.        The provision, part of a last-minute amendment, lets states       obtain waivers from certain Affordable Care Act insurance       regulations. Insurers in states that obtain the waivers could       be freed from a regulation mandating that they cover 10       particular types of health services, among them maternity       care, prescription drugs, mental health treatment and       hospitalization.        That could also affect plans offered by large employers,       health analysts said.        The ACA prevents employer plans from putting annual limits       on the amount of care they will cover, and it bars lifetime       limits on the 10 essential benefits. But in 2011, the Obama       administration issued guidance stating that employers aren't       bound by the benefits mandated by their state and can pick       from another state's list of required benefits. That guidance       was mostly meaningless because the ACA established a national       set of essential benefits.        Under the House bill, large employers could choose the       benefit requirements from any state--including those that are       allowed to lower their benchmarks under a waiver, health       analysts said. By choosing a waiver state, employers looking       to lower their costs could impose lifetime limits and       eliminate the out-of-pocket cost cap from their plans under       the GOP legislation.        The measure would give employers added flexibility to take       steps that could lower costs by limiting more-expensive       coverage areas. And it would lessen the federal regulation of       insurers, a goal of GOP lawmakers who believe the ACA is an       example of government overreach.        The impact on employer plans expands the scope of the       health bill to affect, potentially, everyone not insured by       Medicare or small-business plans, since the bill also       includes cuts to Medicaid and changes to the individual       market. Employer health plans are the single largest source       of health insurance in the country, with about 159 million       Americans receiving coverage through their jobs.        ``It's huge,'' said Andy Slavitt, former acting       administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid       Services under President Barack Obama. ``They're creating a       backdoor way to gut employer plans, too.''        But some experts say the impact could be less.        ``The real question is, would employers do this? Many       wouldn't,'' said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the       Kaiser Family Foundation. ``Many employers offer quality       benefits to attract employees. But employers are always       looking for ways to lower costs.''        Fifty-nine percent of employers had a lifetime limit on how       much their insurance plans would cover before the ACA, Mr.       Levitt said.        The potential impact on large-employer plans was picked up       on by health analysts including Matthew Fiedler, a fellow at       the Brookings Institution. It is possible the Trump       administration could minimize the impact by barring employers       from picking plans across state lines, he said, but there is       no sign that that would occur.        ``The core goal of insurance is to ensure that people are       protected if the worst happens, and these protections are       crucial to achieving that goal,'' Mr. Fiedler said.        Potentially, the new provision could play out this way: If       a state did away with a requirement to provide mental health       and substance abuse services, employer plans using that       benchmark could impose lifetime caps on the amount of mental       health coverage they are willing to pay for.        One trade group representing employers said the amendment's       effects on people with employer-sponsored health coverage       would be minimal. Most large employers didn't impose annual       or lifetime limits before the ACA was implemented, according       to James Gelfand, senior vice president of health policy at       the Erisa Industry Committee.        ``Even if self-insured health plans are no longer banned       from imposing annual or lifetime limits, they're unlikely to       attempt to squeeze the toothpaste back into the tube,'' he       said. ``The benefits of reimposing limits are questionable.''     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin).   (Mr. LEVIN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a statement from  the Children's Hospital Association in opposition to this bill.                   [From Children's Hospital Association,                               Apr. 27, 2017]        Children's Hospitals Urge House to Vote Against Amended AHCA                  Lawmakers should know bill is bad for kids         Washington, DC.--On behalf of our nation's children's       hospitals and the patients and families they serve,       Children's Hospital Association (CHA) continues to oppose the       newly modified American Health Care Act (AHCA) and strongly       urges the House of Representatives to reject the bill.       Recently adopted changes only worsen the AHCA by putting       children with preexisting conditions at increased risk of       losing health care coverage and failing to correct the       Medicaid cuts that would impact over 30 million kids.        The legislation the House might consider for a vote as       early as the weekend would impose over $800 billion in cuts       on states by fundamentally changing Medicaid--a program over       40 percent of the children across the country depend on for       their health care coverage and access to medical care. Under  [[Page H4133]]       the bill, Medicaid would no longer be able to flex with the       needs of enrollees, instead becoming a severely restricted       system of per capita caps or block grants.        The block grant option in particular would be devastating       to children as it eliminates Medicaid's EPSDT (Early and       Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment) benefit which       ensures children receive immunizations, mental health       assessments and vision, eye and hearing exams as well as       other medical services they might need. A block grant would       also remove cost-sharing protections for children,       essentially creating new barriers to care for low-income,       working families.        CHA urgently asks members of Congress to vote against the       AHCA. Medicaid must be maintained to ensure children receive       the coverage and medical care that return lifelong benefits       into adulthood. Investing in children's health advances a       better future for our nation.     Mr. Speaker, I include a statement from Families USA in  opposition to this bill.                             [From FAMILIESUSA]    Latest House GOP Proposal--``Upton Amendment''--Still Leaves People                with Pre-Existing Conditions Out in the Cold         Washington, DC.--Republicans in the House today are       discussing a so-called compromise that ostensibly adds $8       billion to their Affordable Care Act (ACA) repeal bill in an       attempt to appease members worried that the bill strips       coverage guarantees for people with pre-existing conditions.       Below is a statement from Families USA Executive Director       Frederick Isasi.        ``Despite today's wheeling and dealing, the GOP repeal bill       still drops the coverage guarantee for people with pre-      existing conditions, strips coverage from millions, and       drives up costs for millions more. A measly $8 billion       handout isn't going to change that. The bill also decimates       Medicaid--more than $800 billion in cuts. That hurts seniors,       people with disabilities, and children like Jimmy Kimmel's       son who he so eloquently spoke of Monday night. Remember,       half of the births in America are reimbursed through       Medicaid.        ``The Upton $8 billion is a non-solution--money thrown at       `high-risk pools' that experts on both sides of the aisle       have warned lead to higher costs, fewer benefits, and waiting       lists rationing care for those with pre-existing conditions.        ``Republicans in the House can do all the backroom vote-      trading they want; their bill will still harm millions and       millions of people in America and breaks President Trump's       promise to cover everybody and protect people with pre-      existing conditions. This isn't what people in America want.       It is time for the GOP to drop this deeply flawed legislation       and move on to efforts that will help, and not hurt,       America's families.''     Mr. Speaker, I include a statement from the Association  of American Medical Colleges in opposition to this bill.                          [From AAMC, May 2, 2017]   AAMC Statement on the MacArthur Amendment to the American Health Care                                    Act         AAMC (Association of American Medical Colleges) President       and CEO Darrell G. Kirch, MD, issued the following statement       regarding the amendment to the American Health Care Act       (AHCA) introduced by Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.):        ``This week, the House could vote on a new version of the       American Health Care Act that includes the MacArthur       amendment. Unfortunately, the amendment does not address the       limitations in the original measure, such as making high-      quality, affordable health insurance available to all, and       maintaining programs to support the health care safety net--      at least at current levels--until other comparable coverage       expansions are available.        The amendment's treatment of essential health benefits and       health status underwriting dilutes protections for many       Americans and would leave individuals with preexisting       conditions facing higher premiums and reduced access to vital       care.        The shortcomings in the underlying bill remain the same.       The original analysis from the Congressional Budget Office       indicated that 14 million Americans would lose their health       insurance coverage as early as next year, and as many as 24       million by 2024. Nothing in the bill has changed that alters       the fact that this legislation would lead to fewer Americans       with quality insurance, less affordable coverage for those       who have it, and the destabilization of the current Medicaid       program.        We continue to urge members of Congress to engage with the       nation's medical schools and teaching hospitals and other       stakeholders to find ways to achieve high quality health care       for all Americans.''     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Sanchez), the vice chair of the Democratic Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Judy Chu of California.)    Mr. Speaker, maybe the gentleman hasn't been listening  to all the organizations and healthcare advocates who have come out  strongly opposed to the Republican bill, that I have read into the  Record, who know a lot more about health care than anybody in this  House, who spend their lives protecting people and protecting people's  healthcare rights. They are all in strong opposition to the Republican  bill because you take away the protections for preexisting conditions,  plain and simple.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  Blumenauer).    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  American Public Health Association in strong opposition to the  Republican bill.                                American Public Health Association,                                                       May 4, 2017.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the American Public       Health Association, a diverse community of public health       professionals who champion the health of all people and       communities, I write to express our continued strong       opposition to H.R. 1628, the American Health Care Act of       2017, legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The       amended bill would be even worse for the nation's health than       the original proposal and does nothing to improve the health       of the American public. Additionally, the bill would have the       greatest negative impact on the health of the most vulnerable       Americans.        According to the March Congressional Budget Office       analysis, the legislation would result in 14 million       Americans losing health insurance coverage in 2018. By 2026,       CBO estimates 24 million individuals would lose coverage,       taking the uninsured rate up to a staggering 52 million,       nearly double the number of Americans who would lack       insurance under existing law. The bill would cut critical       premium subsidies for low- and middle-income families and       phase out the ACA's Medicaid expansion. Under the proposal,       many, especially low-income and older Americans, would pay       higher premiums, receive lower subsidies and be subject to       higher out of pocket costs, including higher deductibles and       co-pays for plans that provide less coverage. Health       insurance coverage is critical to preventing disease,       ensuring health and well-being and driving down the use of       costlier providers of care. Unfortunately, this proposal will       result in a greater number of people losing coverage than the       number of people who have gained coverage under the       Affordable Care Act, putting many at risk of premature death       due to the lack of access to critical health services.        The amended bill would be even worse for public health than       the original bill that was pulled from the House floor in       late March. The amended bill would allow states to opt-out of       requiring health plans to cover the 10 essential health       benefits such as maternity care, mental health and substance       abuse disorder services and prescription drug coverage. It       would also allow insurers to charge significantly higher       premiums for people with pre-existing conditions and possibly       allow insurers to charge older adults even higher premiums.       The inclusion of a mere $8 billion over five years will do       little to help people with pre-existing conditions who could       see drastically higher premiums leaving millions in the       individual and small group market with no protections from       insurer discrimination.        The bill would also eliminate the Prevention and Public       Health Fund, the first and only mandatory funding stream       specifically dedicated to public health and prevention       activities. The fund has already provided more than $6       billion to support a variety of public health activities in       every state including tracking and preventing infectious       diseases like the Ebola and Zika viruses, community and       clinical prevention programs, preventing childhood lead       poisoning and expanding access to childhood immunizations.       Eliminating the fund would devastate the budget of the       Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The fund       currently makes up 12 percent of CDC's budget and eliminating       this funding stream would force Congress to replace the       funding through the regular appropriations process where       resources for nondefense discretionary programs are already       too low.        Not only would the bill phase out the Medicaid expansion       under the ACA, it would also make other troubling changes to       the Medicaid program, converting it to a per capita program.       The most recent CBO analysis estimated the bill would cut       federal spending on Medicaid by $839 billion over the next       decade, drastically cutting resources to states, many of       which are already struggling with tight budgets. The bill       would also block Medicaid reimbursements to Planned       Parenthood for one year--which CBO estimates will lead to       less access to care, more unintended births and more costs       for the Medicaid program.        While the Affordable Care Act is not perfect, the law has       made progress in addressing the biggest challenges facing our       health system including the rising costs associated with our       health care system, uneven quality of care, deaths due to       medical errors, discriminatory practices by health insurance       providers and the shrinking ranks of the nation's primary       care providers. The ACA has made progress in shifting our       health system from one that focuses on treating the sick to       one that focuses on keeping people healthy. We ask you to       oppose this and future efforts to repeal or weaken the ACA.       Instead, we urge you to work on a bipartisan basis to improve       and build upon the successes of the ACA and to work to       provide health insurance coverage to the more than 28 million       who still lack coverage. We look forward to working with you       to create the healthiest nation in one generation.            Sincerely,                                           Georges C. Benjamin, MD,                                                Executive Director.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from  Wisconsin (Ms. Moore).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Vermont (Mr. Welch).    May I inquire of the gentleman how many more speakers  he has?    Well, I am not really prepared to close because my side  has a ton more to say, but I am out of time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time, and  given the fact there were no hearings or anything else, it would have  been nice to have a little bit more time.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule that would change the rules of the House to  prevent this bill or any other healthcare-related legislation from  being considered if it does not have a CBO cost estimate or if it would  deny health coverage or require higher premiums due to preexisting  conditions; impose lifetime limits on health coverage; prevent  individuals under age 26 from being covered under their parents' plan;  reduce the number of people receiving health care under the Affordable  Care Act; increase costs to seniors by reopening the doughnut hole and  raising prescription drug costs; require people to pay for preventive  services, including cancer screenings; reduce Medicare solvency or  change the Medicare guarantee; or reduce Federal taxes on the 1 percent  of the population with the highest incomes or increase taxes on the 80  percent of hardworking Americans earning moderate to low incomes.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous materials, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, none of us on this side are claiming that  the Affordable Care Act is perfect. In fact, for 7 years, we have been  prepared to work with our Republican colleagues in a bipartisan way to  make it even better, to cover more people, to find ways to lower costs;  but for 7 years, my Republican colleagues had no interest in doing  that. All they wanted to do was repeal the bill, repeal the bill,  repeal the bill and offer no alternative.   Now we see their alternative, and it is an awful alternative. It is a  disaster. It is an alternative that came not out  [[Page H4136]]  of a deliberative process, but out of some back room somewhere. People  haven't even read this bill. They don't even know what it does because  we are not even waiting for a CBO score. This is a pathetic process  that everybody should be ashamed of.   Let me just say, to claim or to imply that the Republican plan covers  people with preexisting conditions, it is a lie. It is a lie. Let's be  honest about it. This does not cover people with preexisting  conditions. To come on the floor and say it does, to try to fool  people, well, you may get away with it in the short term, you may get a  headline, but I will tell you, people will figure out soon enough when  they are denied healthcare coverage, when they see their costs rise and  rise and rise.   To have a healthcare bill that throws 24 million Americans off of  health insurance, you should be ashamed.   To have a healthcare bill that cuts Medicaid by $880 billion to give  a tax cut to the wealthiest people in this country, you should be  ashamed.   I spent a good deal of my time reading letters from organizations  like the National Farmers Union, the AARP, the Cystic Fibrosis  Foundation, Paralyzed Veterans of America, March of Dimes, the American  Medical Association, on and on and on, organizations that have  dedicated their lives to helping people in this country that know  something about this subject.                                time  1030    And when it comes down to who do I trust, them or you, on whether or  not your bill covers people with preexisting conditions, there is no  contest. I trust them. They see what you are trying to do. They  understand that this bill is a fraud.   It is unconscionable to not only me and to people on our side, but to  people who are watching this debate--Democrats, Republicans, and  independents alike--that we would be spending time debating a  healthcare bill that will make life worse for people in this country.  Any kind of healthcare bill that came to this floor ought to be about  expanding coverage and lowering cost. We want to work with you on that.  Instead, you come to a bill that is going to rip health care away from  tens of millions of people.   How can you do this? How can you do this to the American people? How  can you do this to your constituents?   This is a terrible bill. You should vote ``no'' on it or, better yet,  pull it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
