 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  appreciate his working with me on this important issue.   I do want to say that I appreciate the floor staff and staff in the  Parliamentarian's Office over the last few days. Obviously, we have had  some interesting activities on the floor of the House that I think are  important because I think it is important to vote and that this issue  is important.   I do want to thank the staff for all of their hard work in support of  what goes on on the floor. As a former staffer, I know the amount of  time that goes into that.   Madam Speaker, I do believe that we should defeat the previous  question. I do believe that we should move immediately to consideration  of H.R. 3056, which my good friend from Alabama has put forward, as an  important reflection of what the President and his Office of Management  and Budget have asked for to deal with the humanitarian crisis at our  border.   We have gone over quite a bit of what has been going on on our  border. Lost in all of that are the people, the humanitarian reality of  what is happening at the border, the children, moms, families; the lack  of places to put people; a Border Patrol that is overwhelmed, literally  overwhelmed trying to do its job to secure the border of the United  States.   They literally don't know where to put people. They have them and  they are going, ``What do I do with them?''   They have to follow the law. They have to try to do screenings. They  have to try to do health screenings. They have to try to perform the  basic functions of their duty. Yet, they don't have the resources  necessary to do it because this body, for whatever reason, refuses to  do that.   I know there are ongoing negotiations. There are ongoing  conversations in the Senate and the House about trying to reach some  agreement. But let's be honest: This has taken far too long since the  President's initial request, leaving Border Patrol, ICE, and those who  are dealing with this crisis at the border without the knowledge of  whether they are going to have the resources necessary to do it and  without any support for what they are doing today.   Today, somebody is going to be abused at the border. Some little  girl, some family, is going to be abused at the hands of the cartels  that have operational control of our border.   If you talk to anybody with deep knowledge of what is going on at the  border, they know the cartels have operational control of our border.  They are making hundreds of millions of dollars moving people, not just  fentanyl, not just dangerous narcotics, but people. It is something  that should end today.   We have the power, this body, to end it today. We should just call up  H.R. 3056 and pass it. It would solve the problem. It would at least  solve the problem of what they are dealing with in the humanitarian  crisis.   What it won't do is solve the asylum problem. What it won't do is  solve the catch-and-release problem. What it won't do is solve the  problem of being able to take unaccompanied children safely back to  families at home.   None of that will be solved in H.R. 3056. But H.R. 3056 is the bare  minimum of what we ought to do in this body to ensure that people have  the resources necessary to care for people when we are trying to manage  a broken border overrun with crime, where communities in Texas are  being ravaged, where yesterday a mayor came here and gave a press  conference talking about car chases in the streets, where fentanyl is  pouring across our border.   I urge this body to defeat the previous question and to move to H.R.  3056.    Mr. Chair, on rollcall No. 364, I mistakenly voted ``no''  when I intended to vote ``yes''.
