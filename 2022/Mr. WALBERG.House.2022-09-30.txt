 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor World War II veteran  Herb Elfring of Jackson, Michigan, for his distinguished service to our  country. Herb truly embodies the very best of America and the Greatest  Generation.   Herb turned 100 years old earlier this year, and he is one of a very  few survivors of the Pearl Harbor attack to still be alive.   From 1940 to 1945, Herb served in the U.S. Army National Guard and  was stationed in Hawaii at the time of the attack, barely avoiding fire  from Japanese planes. Herb would earn promotions and various medals for  his bravery in the line of duty.   Herb and his late wife, Ruth, were married for 57 years and had five  children, eight grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.   To this day, Herb remains active in the Jackson community.   Thank you, Herb, for your service to our country and legacy in the  Jackson community.                            ____________________
