 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize New York's  Capital Region radio station, WGY, on the occasion of its 100th  anniversary.   Through decades of informing and entertaining Capital Region  listeners, WGY has long stood as a pillar of the Schenectady community.   This pioneering station, established by engineers at General Electric  in 1922, has spent a century at the forefront of innovations in radio  technology.   From conducting the first two-way radio transmission to England to  being one of the first two radio stations to broadcast baseball's World  Series, WGY has played a key role in establishing New York's Capital  District as a global and national hub for technological advancement.   I extend my warm congratulations to everyone at WGY for reaching this  historic milestone. Throughout its first 100 years, the station has  connected with listeners through its talented and revered hosts.   Here is to many more successful years delivering powerful stories and  quality news to our communities. Congratulations to WGY.                            ____________________
