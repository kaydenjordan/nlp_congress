 Mr. President, yesterday around the country, Americans  gathered to honor the women and men who built our economy and continue  to power it today--American workers.   Almost every year when we return after Labor Day, I speak about  American workers--those who work with their hands, their shoulders,  their arms, their brains--because all work has dignity. All work  matters to our country.   Martin Luther King said, ``All labor that uplifts humanity has  dignity and importance.'' He told the Local 1199 hospital workers union  more than 50 years ago that ``no labor is really menial unless you're  not getting adequate wages''--something that is too often the case  today. Let me talk a little bit about that.   All work has dignity. That is what Labor Day is all about. Over the  last week, I traveled all over Ohio, meeting with workers who power our  State and support our families. Last week, I talked with mineworkers  and Teamsters in Cambridge, in Eastern Ohio, in Appalachia. They are  fighting to protect the pensions they earned over a lifetime of work.   One retired coal miner, John Vargo, who was there with his wife  Linda, gave me a coal-black beer stein that was given to his father.  Five thousand of those steins were given out to UMWA members 40 years  ago. The front features a miner with a pickax doing his job working  through a black tunnel. The inscription on the bottom says that it  ``represents the long struggle historically for humane working  conditions.''   On Sunday, I talked to firefighters and steelworkers and so many  others--several hundred workers in Lorain; auto, steel, iron workers,  carpenters, and other tradespeople; machinists, service workers, SEIU,  AFSCME, and others.   Yesterday in Cleveland, I spoke with workers at the 47th annual Labor  Day parade and festival. This event was started nearly half a century  ago by Mayor Carl Stokes, continued by his brother Lou Stokes and by  Stephanie Tubbs Jones, and carried on today by my friend Congresswoman  Marcia Fudge. It is a reminder of the historic connection between the  civil rights movement and our labor movement. Both are movements for  justice. They are about treating Americans--no matter whether you work  in a hospital, punch a clock, work construction, are an hourly wage  worker, work for tips--treating all Americans with dignity and respect.   This morning, I met with a group of firefighters, several of them  retired--union firefighters and fire chiefs--in Shaker Heights,  Lakewood, and Cleveland, all of whom talked to me about how we know  that when there is a fire, firefighters rush into danger while all of  us civilians flee and rush out. What we don't think about enough--and  we know the dangers of the job: a collapsing roof, a floor falling in-- what we don't think enough about is the chemicals they are exposed to.  That is why we pushed legislation here--and then the dollars to go with  it--for a cancer registry, so we can figure out why so many  firefighters are dying from cancer and why so many have developed  cancer after 10, 15, or 20 years on the job exposed to these chemicals.   All these workers--retired firefighters, mineworkers, Teamsters,  steelworkers--all of these workers are part of the struggle.   On my lapel, I wear this pin depicting a canary in a birdcage. It was  given to me at a workers Memorial Day in Lorain, OH, as a reminder of  what American workers have done for this country.   At the turn of the last century, in 1900, mineworkers took a canary  in a cage down in the mines. If the canary stopped singing, if the  canary died from toxic gas or lack of oxygen, the mineworker knew he  had minutes to get out alive. He didn't have a union strong enough to  protect him. He didn't have a government that cared enough to protect  him.   American workers in the labor movement changed all that. Workers  organized. They ended child labor. They pushed through Congress the 40- hour workweek and overtime pay. They helped to create Social Security  and Medicare. They fought for workers' rights, women's rights, and  civil rights.   The economy grew, and workers' wages grew along with it. Profits were  up, compensation for executives went up, productivity went up, and  workers' wages pretty much went up with it. That was then. American  workers have been the engine behind all that success.   You build an economy from the middle out, not from the top down-- although, from the tax bill this Congress passed, you would think my  colleagues believe that if you shovel enough money to the rich, it will  trickle down and help the middle class. It has never really worked that  way.   When I say that workers are the engine behind that success, I mean  all workers--whether you punch a clock, swipe a badge, earn a salary,  or make tips. But today this hard work isn't paying off. Corporate  profits have gone up, executive compensation has exploded, stock prices  have gone up, workers are ever more productive, but wages have barely  budged. Wages have declined this year in spite of the administration  singing its own praises for a growing economy.   At the same time, do you know what else has gone up? Healthcare costs  have gone up. Healthcare costs go up while executive compensation goes  up, while profits go up, but workers' wages have simply plateaued.  Workers are getting squeezed at both ends. Paychecks aren't growing  fast enough. Workers' budgets are being stretched thin with the cost of  everything--particularly housing, prescription drugs, and college  tuition.   We need to think differently about the American economy. Corporations  don't drive the economy; workers do. We grow the economy from the  middle class out. If work isn't valued, Americans can't earn their way  to a better life for their families no matter how hard they work.   Millions of Americans work long hours but struggle to get by, and  they don't feel as though anyone notices or cares. That feeling was  captured pretty well by my friend, Ohioan Rita Lewis, the widow of  Teamster Butch Lewis. She herself has become an advocate, fighting for  the pensions her husband and other Teamsters earned. Not long ago, Rita  said, ``It's like we're invisible.'' Too often, she is right.   To the millions of Americans working too many hours for too little  pay, let me tell you this: You aren't invisible. You may be invisible  to most Members of the Senate, you may be invisible to Washington, you  may be invisible to the corrupt State government in Columbus, OH, but  you are not invisible to me, and you are not invisible to some people  in this body. We see you. We hear you. We fight for you. We fight for  paid family leave. We fight for paid sick leave. We fight for the  overtime pay that you earn.   We fight to give workers a say in their jobs. We fight to save  American pensions, give people a break, and make it a bit easier to  save for retirement. We work to encourage companies to invest in their  greatest asset: you, the American workers. That is what we will fight  for not just on Labor Day but the next day and the day after that and  every day throughout the year.   If you love this country, you fight for people who make it grow, and  you fight for people who make it work.   I encourage my colleagues to reflect this week on what we do to honor  American workers who make our country great.                             Honoring Journalists     Mr. President, last week, we were reminded again of the  important work journalists do in their communities, breaking stories  that affect Ohioans. We know what comes out of the White House, as the  President calls journalists and reporters enemies of the people. Last  Wednesday, I saw something again to underscore and illustrate how wrong  that is.   The Chillicothe Gazette--a town 50 miles south of Columbus--reported  that 28 people at an Ohio correctional institution were sent to the  hospital after being exposed to a mysterious substance, prison guards  and inmates alike. The reporters talked to the Ohio  [[Page S6025]]  Highway Patrol. They were able to confirm that the incident began when  an inmate began showing signs of an overdose. They learned that more  than 20 staff members had potentially been exposed and were sent to a  hospital for treatment. They reported that some received the drug  naloxone, which is used to reverse an overdose.   After investigating, the reporters at the Chillicothe Gazette were  able to confirm that it was fentanyl-laced heroin that sent workers to  the hospital. Reporters talked with one corrections officer who told  them: We were trying to keep up with everything. It was a form of  controlled chaos.   The journalists at the Gazette did what good reporters do in a  rapidly unfolding incident like this one: They talked to witnesses.  They reached out to the institutions involved. They established a  hotline. They tracked down a pair of 911 calls, tracing the first call  to 8:45 a.m. on Wednesday.   They didn't stop there. They published multiple followup stories.  They looked into the prison's history. They found that the institution  had a history of high drug use. They tracked down the most recent  prison report. They found that Ross Correctional led the State in  positive random drug tests in 2015.   Like so much good reporting, these stories were a team effort among  journalists at the Gazette. I happened to be at the Gazette that  morning around the time the story broke. I talked to Mike Throne, the  editor. Mike understands, as all of his reporters do and as the  community does, that people don't see the Chillicothe Gazette--people  don't see these hard-working reporters, who are not paid a lot of  money--not paid anything close to what they earn, frankly--they don't  see them as enemies of the people; they see them as serving their  community. These reporters do their job. They were informing us, the  citizens of their State and this country. They were serving their  communities in Chillicothe, Bournville, Circleville, Waverly--all over  Southern Ohio. They deserve our respect.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
