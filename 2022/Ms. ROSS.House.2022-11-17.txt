 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of National Veterans and  Military Families Month.   Last week, I joined communities across Wake County to celebrate  Veterans Day, a time when we honor the courageous men and women of our  Armed Forces who put their lives on the line to defend our democracy.   As the proud daughter of an Air Force veteran, I know that behind  every servicemember is a family making sacrifices every day. But  thanking our veterans and their families is simply not enough. We must  recommit ourselves to providing them with the care and benefits they  have earned.  [[Page H8578]]    We, in North Carolina, support our veterans. Just last week, Raleigh,  in my district, was named the best place in the country for veterans to  live.   Mr. Speaker, let's strive to make every community an incredible place  for our veterans to call home.                            ____________________
