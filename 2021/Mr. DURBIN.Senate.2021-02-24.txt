 Mr. President, last week, I was home, as most Members of  the Senate were, but I was asked to participate in a Zoom call with two  people I highly respect, Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Collins, with the  National Institutes of Health. While sitting at my dining room table in  Springfield, IL, there were about a dozen Senators who had access to  Zoom to be a part of that conversation. I felt like I was privileged to  really hear some information which most Americans wanted to hear, and I  knew it had to be important for them to ask for a briefing in the  middle of the week.   What they were talking about during the course of that hour were  variants, what is happening to this coronavirus as it replicates over  and over and over again millions of times. What they told us--and I am  a liberal arts lawyer, so I don't profess any sort of medical expertise  here--was that there were dominant variants that were starting to  emerge, and they told us the shorthand description that they used in  the laboratories.   I just remember that the first one was the UK, United Kingdom,  variant. They said, by the end of March, which is not that far away--4  weeks plus--it will be the dominant strain of coronavirus in the United  States. I was taken aback by that to think that a variant could become  that dominant that quickly, but it was fair warning that it was about  to occur. Then they talked about the South African variant, which is  just starting to appear.   The good news is they have done enough testing to believe that both  of the major vaccines we are now using across America, which are  Moderna and Pfizer--I have Pfizer, and my wife has Moderna--are  effective against the UK, United Kingdom, variant. The jury is still  out when it comes to the South African variant. There is a third  variant, and I won't venture into trying to remember exactly what that  was about, but I remember it had some origin in South America.   I heard that news, and I thought to myself, this is an ongoing  battle. We haven't run up any kind of score against this coronavirus.  We can't sit back and relax. We are in a very busy third quarter in  trying to vaccinate America and in watching for each and every new  threat.   So, in that circumstance, if you were the President of the United  States, what would you do?   Well, Joe Biden, President Joe Biden, decided that we needed to be  aggressive, that we needed to face reality, not only with regard to the  half a million Americans who have died but that we need to put together  the tools to fight this coronavirus as we know it and as it is likely  to evolve. He needs an army to do that. It is that big a war. He came  to us with a proposal to start that effort, in a substantial way, under  his leadership. He calls it the American Rescue Plan. I hear my  colleagues come to the floor and really raise the question as to  whether this is needed, and I just heard the speech of the minority  leader, Senator McConnell.   What President Biden wants to do to deal with this pandemic, as we  know it and as it is likely to evolve, is to provide $20 billion more  for our vaccination program. Does anyone doubt the need for that? I  don't. I think it is the key to getting America back to business.   He provides $50 billion for testing, lab capacity improvements, and  genomic sequencing of this virus mutation. Again, I am not an expert in  science, but it seems perfectly reasonable to me, after listening to  Drs. Fauci and Collins, to make that investment right now.   President Biden wants to invest in 100,000 community health workers  to help with the vaccinations and contact tracing--100,000. It seems  like a lot, but in a nation of 350 million, I am not sure it is that  overwhelming a number. He wants to fund the community health centers so  that they will be able to tackle this issue and particularly address  the issue of health disparities;  [[Page S838]]  use the Defense Production Act to provide $10 billion for America's  manufacturer of the key equipment we need to fight this pandemic and  the next one, God forbid, whenever it may be; and to expand healthcare  coverage for Americans in this time of pandemic by subsidizing COBRA  coverage. What does it mean? If you had health insurance with your job  and you lost your job and you lost your health insurance, we allow  people to buy that health insurance that the employer offered, but they  have to pay for the whole ride, both the employer's and employee's  sides of it, and it turns out to be prohibitive. It doesn't work unless  we give a subsidy for that coverage to be extended into your  unemployment situation.   And then $4 billion, which sounds small when we are talking  trillions, but $4 billion for community health--pardon me--behavioral  health and addiction services and counseling services.   I learned the hard way over that break as well that we are ignoring  the opiate crisis in America, but it is not ignoring us. It is  dramatically increasing, primarily because we are not devoting the  resources to it. And the mental health situation of many Americans is  aggravated by isolation and social distancing, and addiction is even  worse.   So I have just described for you the health side of President Biden's  American Rescue Plan. I would like to hear any of my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle argue with me--I am ready to take them on--that  that is not needed. Of course it is needed. It is needed now, and it  needs to be an investment we make because if we don't break the back of  this pandemic, we are not going to get this economy reopen again, we  are not going to get our kids back in school, we are not going to get  to see our grandkids the way we want to, our children or grandkids, and  we are not going to see America return to what we all desperately want  it to return to.   The reason I raise that this morning is when I heard the Senator from  Kentucky raising skeptical observations about this plan, I thought  back. It was a year ago on the floor of the Senate--nothing short of a  political miracle--that the first CARES Act, under President Donald  Trump, the first CARES Act passed this Senate with an overwhelming vote  of 96 to nothing. That doesn't happen much around here, even for  resolutions on motherhood. But 96 to nothing--bipartisan support for  the relief bill proposed by President Trump and the Congress in March  of last year. It was a good feeling, and we knew we had to do it. We  were in it together, and we knew we had a challenge.   Then came last December, just a few weeks back, and again under the  Trump administration a proposal for a $900 billion relief bill for  COVID-19. It passed the Senate with 92 votes, 92 out of 100 Senators.  It just showed the bipartisanship that we mustered, thank goodness,  when we needed it because the Nation needed it, and we did it  together--96 in March, 92 Senators in December. We stood behind that  plan even though it had the blessing of a President of a different  party at a controversial moment in history. We stood behind it because  the American people needed it.   Now comes President Joe Biden, 5 or 6 weeks into his Presidency, and  says: Let me take my leadership opportunity and responsibility  seriously, and let me come with a $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan.  Where is the bipartisanship that we saw last year?   I do want to dispute the conclusion of Senator McConnell when it  comes to the state of the economy. I did take a few economics courses.  I don't profess to be an expert. Let's listen to someone who is:  Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, testifying on Capitol Hill.  What did he have to say? Well, he told us that we are in a situation  that is far from over. We have an economy that is still challenging.   Here are some things that were left out of the rosy analysis by the  Senator from Kentucky:   ``There are still 10 million more unemployed people than before the  pandemic began.'' Ten million unemployed American workers. ``While many  parts of the economy have recovered,'' Chairman Powell said, ``the  unemployment rate for the lowest-paid quarter of the labor force is  probably above 20 percent.'' Above 20 percent. ``There's a long way to  go,'' Chairman Powell said.   Economic activity rebounded in the summer after much of the economy  reopened from spring shutdowns. But that momentum ``slowed  substantially,'' in the words of Chairman Powell, with sectors that  rely on person-to-person contact, like hospitality and entertainment,  enduring the worst blows. ``That burden has also largely fallen on low- wage workers, Black and Hispanic Americans, and other minority  groups,'' Powell said.   I don't believe we are out of the woods yet. I believe we have got a  long way to go. The American people believe that too.   President Biden believes it, and when he starts talking about getting  us back on our feet, he is suggesting extending unemployment insurance  programs that expire in just 2 weeks. On March 14, unemployment  programs will start to expire, and he wants us to move quickly to make  sure that doesn't happen.   I support that effort for two reasons. First, it is humane. We are  talking about fellow Americans out of work through no choice of their  own. Secondly, putting money into unemployment benefits for unemployed  workers is the single best investment when it comes to revitalizing the  economy. They do not turn to the Wall Street Journal when they receive  those checks; they turn to the mailbox and try to figure out how they  are going to pay the rent and pay for the food on the table. They spend  the money. That is what unemployment is all about.   So to have the other side question President Biden's proposal to give  unemployment benefits beyond March 14 really says that they are turning  their backs on millions of Americans who have no place else to go.   Oh, there is a fear on the other side that we just may be paying  people too much. You know, if you give them a little too much money on  unemployment, they just might sit home and binge on Netflix and  chocolate-covered cherries. Well, I suppose that is always going to  happen no matter how you write the laws, but I think a lot more of  American workers. I believe they want to get back to work anywhere near  the salaries that they left behind. I think they are desperately  looking for those opportunities, and we ought to help them in the  meantime keep their families together.   Emergency paid leave is still an absolute necessity in light of this  coronavirus and the way it deals with us.   I want to also make a plea here for the minimum wage, and I know  there is some controversy associated with it.    Mr. President, glad to have you. You are new to the Senate.   Back at that desk there, a fellow named Ted Kennedy used to stand. I  used to love to come to the floor when Senator Ted Kennedy of  Massachusetts would give his speeches. When he got into it, he was  amazing. His booming voice could be heard all over the Senate Chamber,  and I never heard him more energized than when he argued for increasing  the minimum wage.   Oftentimes he was a lonely voice--there were no proposals before us  and none likely to appear--but he never failed to come to this floor  and remind us on a regular basis of how we had failed year after year  after year to increase the minimum wage.   He would tell the story of people in America getting up and going to  work every single day, sometimes two jobs a day, to try to keep their  families together and still qualifying for food stamps and assistance  from our government. He would ask us when we were going to give them  the dignity of passing an increase in the minimum wage.   I can still hear him thundering across the Chamber. I wouldn't want  to be in the place of arguing a different position than the one he held  because he took it over. I don't have that skill; I wish I did. I am  glad to have seen him use that skill so effectively to help people who  were just doing their best to get by and struggling.   How many times do all of us give speeches about inequality in America  and why we have to do better for the working people? We do it all the  time, and everybody knows it is a fact. Wages in America, salaries have  not kept up. People at the top have done quite well, thank you, but  those at the bottom have struggled to get by.   Try to make it on $7.25 an hour. I was trying to do a calculation  earlier on  [[Page S839]]  just what that is. Is that $15,000 a year? Is that $1,200 a month? Is  that $300 a week? Could you make it on $300 a week? I am talking about  everything, now. I am talking about rent and mortgage and car payment,  food, utilities--the basics. I couldn't. I don't know how anyone can,  and most can't. They fall deeply into debt and into despair.   So when President Biden talks about us reopening the conversation  about our Federal minimum wage, it is long overdue--long overdue--and  it is an easier issue for me than some because our Governor, J. B.  Pritzker, when he took over the State of Illinois, set us on course to  reach $15 an hour as a State over the same period of time that Joe  Biden has suggested, by 2025.   I just want to say that those people who are really struggling with  the notion of increasing the minimum wage in all fairness really ought  to think about the people out there who are struggling to get by week  to week and month to month.   There is another proposal that is in this bill that is currently  being debated, and it is the $1,400 addition to the cash payment for  many families. I put it in the same category in order to restore equity  and opportunity to a lot of people who otherwise wouldn't have it. This  is the second installment. The first was $600 in the bill we passed  last December. This $1,400 payment will help many families.   I want to add one element that was debated a few weeks ago. Senator  Todd Young of Indiana, whom I respect and is a friend, had offered an  amendment at what was known as a vote-arama as to who would receive  this $600 payment. I think the payment amount has been increased in the  latest Biden proposal.   But the point I tried to make and I think he and I agree on, although  I won't speak for him, is that if a child legally in America, a citizen  of this country, with a Social Security number, lives in a household  with parents who are undocumented--they may be working and paying taxes  with something called an ITIN--but that child should not be  discriminated against or at a disadvantage because of the parents'  immigration status. If the children qualify, the children should be  receiving those payments. I believe the House reconciliation bill does  that, and I hope that any measure that we consider will do the same.   So let me close. I see the Senator on the floor asking for an  opportunity to speak.   Yes, I support the American Rescue Plan. Is it possible that I would  have written it differently? Yes. Are there provisions I would change?  Yes. But I want to tell you, when we passed the CARES Act measure last  December, that was true as well.   We are in a time of a national challenge and a national crisis. We  have a President who is facing it squarely, taking it on, accepting  responsibility, and asking for our help. Can we do anything less?    I announce that the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Warnock),  is necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 426         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
