(3) Policies that seek to ensure the effective use of the       Homeland Security Information Sharing Network in accordance       with section 4, based on the metrics developed pursuant to       such section.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5079, the DHS Field Engagement  Accountability Act. The sharing of counterterrorism and other homeland  security information with State and local officials is vital in our  efforts to protect the homeland.   Fusion centers as hubs for information sharing and analysis play a  critical role in the domestic homeland security information-sharing  environment. Over the years, there have been vast improvements in DHS'  support for these key stakeholders, including the Nebraska Information  Analysis Center, known as NIAC, in my home State of Nebraska.   H.R. 5079, the DHS Field Engagement Accountability Act, builds on  ongoing efforts to hold DHS more accountable for supporting fusion  centers and fully utilizing them as a resource to the Federal  Government.   First, it requires DHS to develop a strategy for engagement with  fusion centers. With the maturation of the national network, many  fusion centers have adopted an all-threats, all-hazards mission to  ensure they are keeping pace with the changing threat environment. A  strategy that incorporates all the components of the Department will  ensure DHS is supporting and leveraging fusion centers effectively and  efficiently.   Second, this bill mandates performance metrics to hold DHS personnel  in the field accountable. Among other responsibilities, these personnel  serve as ambassadors of the Department and are integral in shaping and  strengthening the relationship between fusion centers and DHS. As such,  the Department must have appropriate performance objectives and metrics  in place to ensure greater transparency in the expectations of these  officers and accountability when issues arise.   Finally, this bill requires additional training and improvements for  both the classified and unclassified information-sharing systems that  the Department makes available to fusion centers and other law  enforcement agencies.   While DHS has made strides in facilitating fusion center access to  information and information systems, there are gaps in the Department's  efforts to ensure these partners are adequately trained to utilize  these systems.   So, for example, while all fusion centers now have access to DHS'  classified HSDN, many fusion center personnel are not proficient in  this system, and DHS does not currently provide any standardized, in- person HSDN training. Granting the appropriate clearances and  credentials to access DHS systems is just as important as ensuring  competency when using these systems.   Additionally, I have learned that many DHS components do not  routinely share analytic products on the Homeland Security Information  Network-Intelligence portal, and many documents are not posted on a  timely basis.                                time  1645    It is incumbent on the Department to ensure the appropriate policies  and metrics are in place to incentivize component use of this critical  information-sharing program.   In that regard, I am pleased to report that, as of this month, both  the Federal Protective Service and the United States Coast Guard have  started participating on the HSIN-Intel Partner Products page. I  encourage other components of the Department that do not participate to  follow suit. This is a commonsense bill with bipartisan support that  will enhance DHS' relationship with State and local fusion centers  across the country.   In short, we have learned many lessons this past year in analyzing  and studying fusion centers. This bill fixes the multiple problems that  we have encountered.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to thank the gentlewoman from New  Jersey for her comments and her support making this bill a bipartisan  bill. Part of the work that we are doing is we are going to improve 70  different fusion centers with this bill and standardize the performance  of all of them.   Mr. Speaker, once again, I urge my colleagues to support this bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 5131) to improve the effectiveness of Federal efforts to identify  and address homeland security risks to surface transportation, secure  against vehicle-based attacks, and conduct a feasibility assessment of  introducing new security technologies and measures, and for other  purposes, as amended.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and  include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5131, the Surface  Transportation Security Improvement Act of 2018, as amended.   As you may be aware, TSA was created in response to the terrorist  attacks on September 11. While the impetus behind its creation was the  threat to aviation security, TSA is responsible for securing all  transportation modes, including surface transportation assets such as  railroads, mass transit, pipelines, buses, and ports. Given the  persistent threats facing aviation in the post-9/11 era, TSA's main  focus has been securing the aviation sector. However, in recent years,  threats emanating against surface transportation modes, especially mass  transit hubs, have steadily increased.   Attacks against these surface targets often require less  sophistication than attacks against aviation, making them especially  attractive to lone wolves or homegrown violent extremists.   Surface transportation systems are also a very attractive target due  to their large volume of daily ridership and open infrastructure. The  most recent example of an attack targeting surface is the attempted  suicide bombing in December 2017 at New York City's Port Authority Bus  Terminal.   Given the current threat environment, a review of TSA's approach to  securing all transportation modes and an assessment of the degree to  which surface transportation security should be prioritized is  certainly warranted. Specifically, this bill mandates a GAO review of  the national strategy for transportation security, the development of  risk-based priorities for all  [[Page H1671]]  transportation modes, and a feasibility assessment of utilizing  security technologies for surface transportation assets.   Furthermore, the bill requires TSA to disseminate best practices for  enhancing security against vehicle-based terrorist attacks and  authorizes a surface-focused Innovation Task Force.   Finally, the bill requires a threat assessment of certain security  technologies tied to foreign countries and a strategy for TSA's surface  transportation inspectors. In the face of emerging threats, it is  imperative that Congress ensure TSA is adequately executing its mission  to protect all transportation modes, not just aviation.   I thank the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Transportation and  Protective Security, Mrs. Watson Coleman, for authoring this  legislation, as well as the chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. Katko,  for his support and leadership on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, again, I want to commend the gentlewoman from New  Jersey's work on this bill and Mr. Katko, the chairman of the  subcommittee.   This is obviously very important. Airports aren't the only target. We  have bus transportation, we have seen those targeted in Europe; our  rail centers are also targets. We have seen that in Europe, and we have  seen indications of those attacks being planned here as well.   Once again, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 4467) to require the Federal Air Marshal Service to utilize risk- based strategies, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4467         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Strengthening Aviation       Security Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2.

(b) Report.--Not later than 270 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the       Transportation Security Administration shall submit to the       Committee on Homeland Security of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and       Governmental Affairs and the Committee on Commerce, Science,       and Transportation of the Senate a report that describes the       compliance of the Federal Air Marshal Service with the       requirements specified in paragraphs (9) through (12) of       subsection (a) of section 44917 of title 49, United States       Code, as added by this Act, and the documented methodology       used by the Federal Air Marshal Service to conduct risk       assessments in accordance with such paragraphs.        (c) Effective Date.--The Transportation Security       Administration shall begin carrying out the requirements       specified in paragraphs (9) through (12) of subsection (a) of       section 44917, United States Code, added by this Act, by not       later than the date that is 180 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and to include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4467, the Strengthening  Aviation Security Act of 2018.   Described by Chairman McCaul in his State of National Security  Address as ``the crown jewel of ISIS and other terrorist groups,'' the  American aviation industry remains a key target of terrorism.   The Transportation Security Administration has made great strides in  securing commercial flights, but the threat of evolving terror tactics  requires a comprehensive, multilateral approach informed by data  collected from industry.   The TSA's risk management strategy for passenger aviation security is  characterized by a multilayered approach, whereby the TSA deploys a  variety of security countermeasures to detect and deter threats.   Federal air marshals, also known as FAMs, are armed law enforcement  officers deployed on passenger flights as part of the TSA's  comprehensive security strategy to protect air passengers and crews  against criminals and terrorists.   Due to the high volume of passenger flights and limited resources at  the TSA, it is imperative that FAM deployment is risk-based and  strategic in order to achieve the greatest security value. However, a  recent GAO report from September 2017 found that the TSA does not  measure data on the efficacy and deterrence value of FAMs.   Without viable metrics, it is impossible for the TSA to truly employ  a calculated risk management strategy for passenger aviation security.  Accordingly, the Strengthening Aviation Security Act of 2018 requires  the Federal Air Marshal Service to utilize risk-based strategies for  international and domestic flight coverage.   This bill ensures that FAMs are deployed in a manner that adds  strategic value to the TSA's multilayered security approach. As  amended, the bill also requires the TSA to take their risk-based  approach a step further by ensuring that FAMs are seated in tactical  positions when deployed on the aircraft.   Strategic seating arrangements will provide FAMs with a distinct  advantage in the event of a threat to aviation security and ensure that  they are more relevant to the important mission for which they are  tasked.   The Strengthening Aviation Security Act emphasizes the importance of  intelligence-driven, risk-based decisions to make the best use of the  Federal Air Marshal Service's resources and personnel.   I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Jody B. Hice) for authoring  this legislation, as well the chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. Katko,  for his work on this bill. Additionally, I wish to thank the chairman  of the full committee, Mr. McCaul, for moving the bill through the  committee process.   This bill will promote public confidence in the security of the  Nation's aviation system and ensure that armed Federal law enforcement  officers are deployed on passenger flights, where they are most needed.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Jody B. Hice), the sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill makes total sense. If you are going to use  Federal air marshals where they are needed most, it should be  analytical and scientific-based so that we get the most bang for the  buck.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 5089) to improve threat information sharing, integrated  operations, and law enforcement training for transportation security,  and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have five legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.  [[Page H1674]]     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5089, the Strengthening  Local Transportation Security Capabilities Act of 2018.   As evidenced by recent attacks in New York, London, and elsewhere  around the world, the threat against surface transportation is real and  unwavering. While the Department of Homeland Security, the  Transportation Security Administration, and other Federal entities have  made significant progress in providing support to State and local  surface transportation assets, the current threat environment  necessitates a coordinated approach.   Intelligence sharing is the backbone of informed, risk-based  security, yet the top-down dissemination of this information is often  stymied by bureaucracy and classification barriers.   This begs the question: How effective is intelligence collection and  analysis if it does not reach the front line and inform subsequent  decisionmaking?   H.R. 5089, the Strengthening Local Transportation Security  Capabilities Act of 2018, requires the DHS Secretary to prioritize the  assignment of officers and intelligence analysts and, as appropriate,  the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis--or I&A--to fusion centers  in jurisdictions with high-risk surface transportation assets.   High-risk surface transportation assets transport millions of people  and commodities daily and are critical for the vitality of the American  economy. This legislation will streamline and enhance the intelligence- sharing process so these high-risk systems are better prepared to be  resilient against emerging threats.   A common complaint from owners, operators, law enforcement, and first  responders is that the TSA, and the Federal Government in general, does  not provide sufficient information for them to adequately prepare for  threats. This is primarily due to issues surrounding classification,  where key personnel at the State and local levels do not have access to  pertinent security information.   As such, this bill requires the Secretary to make security clearances  available to appropriate stakeholders, thereby making important and  relevant threat information more accessible to the people who are  heavily involved in the day-to-day security operations of surface  transportation systems.   H.R. 5089 also requires the TSA Administrator to share with owners  and operators a framework for unified operation centers to ensure  robust response to security incidents.   Recent terror attacks and plots illustrate the challenges of  effective coordination in a ``system of systems.'' This bill will  streamline coordination efforts between Federal, State, and local  entities to bring the right information to the right people.   The interconnected, diverse, and readily accessible nature of surface  transportation systems creates unique security challenges that are best  addressed by communication, coordination, and collaboration.   H.R. 5089 will create a structural framework to connect the  Department of Homeland Security, the Transportation Security  Administration, and surface transportation stakeholders, and it will  facilitate timely information sharing.   I thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Barragan) for her  leadership on this issue. I also thank the chairman of the Subcommittee  on Transportation and Protective Security, Mr. Katko, as well as the  ranking member of the subcommittee, Mrs. Watson Coleman, for their  dedication to improving surface transportation security.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, if we have important information we can't serve to the  right decisionmakers at the local level, we fail, which we have learned  from 9/11 and other places where information is bottled up and doesn't  get to the people who need it. This bill helps solve that.   Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support this bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
