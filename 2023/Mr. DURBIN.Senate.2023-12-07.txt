 I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Lujan)  is necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I want to first rise to congratulate my  colleague from Iowa. I am glad that he has told the story for all to  hear about Medicare Part D and the benefits that he has brought to his  State and mine and to the Nation. It was a remarkable achievement, and  I congratulate him on the anniversary of enacting that legislation.   I say, even though we are of different political parties, we are  friends, and we find common ground, and we have repeatedly. One of the  issues we are both fighting for now is that of a simple disclosure on  the television ads for prescription drugs to tell consumers across  America what they cost. What a radical idea--the cost of the drug. We  think--and we share the belief--that disclosure to the consumer is  important, and an understanding of how some of these drugs--which, I  guess, have become so common in our daily lives that we can actually  not only print out but spell Xarelto--that we ought to know what it  costs so that those who think it might be the right drug for them will  at least have an idea of the thousands of dollars a month they have to  pay for these drugs.   It is not a radical idea. We passed it before in the Senate, and it  was signed by the President. Questions were raised, so we are at it  again. Like your prescription drug Part D, this is something that helps  basic consumers in Iowa and Illinois, and I am proud to be a part of  that effort with the Senator. I congratulate him again on that  achievement.                            ____________________     Mr. President, it is pretty well-known by Members of  Congress--but it bears repeating--that on October 7, an atrocity  occurred. The innocent people living in Israel were attacked by Hamas  terrorists. What happened during the course of that attack is not a  subject of just speculation; it is a fact.   Those of us who serve in the Senate had an opportunity 2 weeks ago,  at the invitation of Senator Rosen, to see the actual videotapes of the  horrible scenes that occurred when Hamas terrorists attacked innocent  people in Israel, and 1,200 individuals were harmed. They were the  victims of systemic rape, violence, murder, mayhem. Every single list  of war crimes was checked off that day when the Hamas terrorists  attacked. For those of us who are committed to the survival and future  of Israel, it was a horrible occurrence. More Jews died on October 7 of  this year than at any time since the Holocaust during World War II--a  terrible tragedy.   Does Israel have the right to exist? The answer is, clearly, yes.  Does Israel have the right to defend itself? The answer is yes. Should  Israel make sure that they are safe in light of all of the Hamas  terrorists in Gaza? Certainly.   Having said that, there is another part to this story. The reaction  of  [[Page S5843]]  Israel to what happened on October 7 has been measured by many  different people in many different ways.   This is what we know: There are 80 percent of the people who live in  Gaza who have been displaced and moved to locations that are supposedly  safe, which sometimes are and sometimes are not; 60 percent of the  dwelling places in Gaza have been destroyed so that families can no  longer live in the areas they once lived in.   The third point I want to make is, the number of people who have died  as a result of this conflagration between Hamas terrorists and  Israelis--which is now in the range of 13,000 to 17,000 people--70  percent of those who have died--innocent people who have died--have  been women and children. It is the largest loss of life of children in  a wartime setting in modern times, and it gets worse every single day.  We see the pictures. We see the videos. We see the news reports. It is  a humanitarian crisis of epic proportion.   Once President Biden made it clear that, on behalf of the United  States, we stand behind Israel, he has spent every moment since urging  the Israelis to show caution in their activities and military campaigns  because too many innocent people are being victimized.   Yesterday, the Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Guterres,  said that we have to return to a situation where there is at least an  opportunity for peace and to stop the fighting. A ceasefire, he called  for. Some have criticized him for it. I applaud him. I think it is the  only thing that we can do to stop the wanton killing of innocent people  in Gaza.   There are solutions to the problem in that area that are not military  entirely, only partially. Primarily, they are political. There has to  be an understanding between the Palestinian people and those living in  Israel that there is an opportunity for peace, and they have to trust  one another to enact that. You can't do that with the end of the barrel  of a gun.   I believe this idea of having an end to hostilities so that we can  complete the exchange of hostages is critical. The longer we wait, the  less likely these hostages can survive. They are calling on the Israeli  Government and I am joining them in saying that we need another period  of peace to try to negotiate more releases before these hostages die-- and the military operations that are taking place.   So I urge the leaders in our government and those involved to think  of the innocent people who are dying--the children, the women, elderly  folks--as a result of this campaign and to find a peaceful solution,  which starts, as far as I am concerned, with the decision not to move  forward with the military operations.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on a different subject matter completely,  I want to explain a bill that I have introduced that is so  controversial that when you go to the airport here in Washington, DC,  they have billboards flashing about how dangerous this bill is. Let me  tell you about the bill.   Most Americans pay for their purchases with credit and debit cards. I  know I do. However, most Americans don't know that, when they go to the  register to pay or to enter their card information online, there are  fees that are being charged when they use their credit cards that are  known as swipe fees, or interchange fees. Each time a credit card is  used to make a donation to the Red Cross, to purchase groceries, fuel,  Christmas gifts, or something else, Visa and MasterCard charge a fee  you never see. Some of that fee they keep for themselves; most is given  to the bank that issues the credit card.    Today, Visa and MasterCard control around 80 percent of the credit  card market in the United States of America--two companies, a duopoly-- wielding enormous power over the American economy. Visa and MasterCard  set these interchange fees, or swipe fees, on behalf of thousands of  banks, leaving merchants, retailers--many of them just small businesses  and restaurants--without a choice but to accept the outrageous fees.  There is no negotiation on this fee. There is no competition. Small  business owners and consumers face a ``take it or leave it'' choice. In  2022 alone, U.S. merchants and consumers paid $93.2 billion in credit  card interchange fees to line the pockets of the biggest banks on Wall  Street. That is absolutely unacceptable and unfair, and we can and must  do something about it.   That is why I made it a priority to pass my bipartisan Credit Card  Competition Act. The legislation, which I introduced with Senators  Marshall, Welch, and Vance, would finally bring competition and choice  to the credit card market and bring down the excessive credit card fees  by requiring only the largest 30 banks in this country to enable at  least two credit card networks to be used on the credit cards they  issue. It would be provided with at least one network outside the Visa- MasterCard duopoly. My bill is estimated to save merchants, retailers,  businesses, and consumers $15 billion every year.   Given this threat to their ability to exorbitantly profit off of  consumers and small businesses, it is no surprise that the credit card  industry is paying a pretty penny to convince consumers that my bill  will take away the credit card rewards programs, like frequent flier  miles. In fact, a new report found that Visa, MasterCard, Wall Street,  and the industry trade groups they fund, such as the Electronic  Payments Coalition, have spent a combined $51 million in lobbying  against my bill since 2022.   They also have recruited allies, including some in the airline  industry, to breathlessly claim that my bill would make frequent flier  rewards programs disappear. United Airlines' CEO Scott Kirby recently  said that my bill would ``kill the rewards program.''   Let me be very clear: That is a patently false statement. A recent  study found that if my bill were enacted, it would have a negligible  impact, at most, on rewards and noted that banks' swipe fees profits  provide a more than sufficient margin to maintain a current reward  level.   What I have come to find out and what most people would be surprised  to hear--and United Airlines is a good example--is that we think of it  as an airline that also has credit cards, but when you look at the  profit statement for United Airlines, it turns out it is a credit card  company that happens to own some airplanes. That is a fact. More  profits are made by United Airlines off their credit card than their  flight operations. Think about that for a second. All the planes and  all the schedules and all the people who work don't generate the same  level of profit as their credit cards from these interchange fees.   So you say to yourself: Well, the credit card companies that are  offering all of these special programs, if they make less money, they  will provide fewer programs.   Well, let's take a look across the pond at Europe for comparison.   In 2015, the European Union capped credit interchange fees at 0.3  percent compared to the U.S.'s rates for United Airlines and others--a  U.S. rate between 2 to 3 percent. Compare that 2 to 3 percent to 0.3  percent, and you say to yourself: Well, surely, they don't offer the  frequent flier programs in Europe if they have so dramatically cut this  interchange fee. But major European airlines still offer co-branded  credit cards and frequent flier programs that are comparable to, if not  better than, anything offered in the United States.   Moreover, this past July, Forbes magazine published an article saying  that compared to other nations, the airline rewards program in the  United States has made it more challenging to earn and redeem miles. I  am going to be taking a look at these frequent flier programs now that  United Airlines wants to make such a to-do about it. I think we have  got to make sure that the American consumers are getting what they  think they are getting.   So let me repeat: My bill is not coming after your airline rewards  programs or any other program, and any effort by the airline industry  or big banks to convince you otherwise is just a scare tactic. They are  feigning concern for hard-working Americans to protect their bottom  line.   Since I introduced the bill, those who oppose it have falsely claimed  the legislation would hurt unions and benefit billionaires. What a  claim. Just a few weeks ago, multiple unions, including the  International Brotherhood of Teamsters and the Service Employees  International Union, endorsed my Credit Card Competition bill.  [[Page S5844]]    The Teamsters' general president, Sean O'Brien, said:         Union members and American families cannot afford to       sacrifice so much of their hard-earned wages to predatory and       consolidated credit card corporations trying to skim every       last dollar they can from vulnerable consumers.    That is exactly the problem this legislation was introduced to fix.   And just before Thanksgiving, a diverse group of organizations  representing workers, small businesses, and competition advocates  launched the Lower Credit Card Fees Coalition, urging Congress to pass  my Credit Card Competition Act.   Few things could unite unions, businesses, consumer groups, and a  bipartisan group of Senators. This bill does just that because it will  benefit hard-working Americans.   Far from threatening rewards programs or hurting workers, the bill  will benefit Americans who currently are paying the price for the  credit card industry's price-gouging schemes. It will give a fighting  chance to small businesses and restaurants that we want to see stay  open; support the mom-and-pop shops that make our communities feel  whole; and, ultimately, keep money in the pockets of hard-working  Americans. It is time we bring this commonsense, consumer-protecting  bipartisan legislation to the floor for a vote.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to  be determined by the majority leader, in consultation with the  Republican leader, the Senate proceed to executive session to consider  Calendar No. 415, Martin O'Malley, of Maryland, to be Commissioner of  Social Security; that there be 1 hour for debate, equally divided in  the usual form, on the nomination; that upon the use or yielding back  of time, the Senate vote on the nomination without intervening action  or debate; that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table, and the President be immediately notified  of the Senate's action.
