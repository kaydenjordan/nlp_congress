 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment to ensure  transparency in our elections.   The American people have a right to know whether a candidate for  President or Vice President has unethical foreign entanglements or  compromising debts that can be leveraged against their administration-- or worse.   My amendment requires the Federal Election Commission, FEC, to make  an income tax return publicly available within 48 hours after receipt  of return. In cases where a return requires extensive redactions, the  Federal Election Commission may make the return available after 48  hours but no later than 30 days after receipt of return.   Only a full release of tax returns can ensure that our President and  Vice President are working for us, the American people, not anybody  else.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment  and ``yes'' on H.R. 5314.
