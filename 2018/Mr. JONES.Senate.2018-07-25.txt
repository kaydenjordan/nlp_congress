 Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of the line workers  at our Alabama auto plants. I rise on behalf of our soybean and cotton  farmers. I rise on behalf of countless other Alabama businesses that  have contacted me because they feel threatened by proposed tariffs but  are afraid to speak out publicly for fear of reprisal. In some cases  they simply don't want to be seen as inflicting political damage on the  President.   I came to this body to work on solutions, not to raise partisan  threat levels. I am not one to unfairly level criticism at the  President of the United States, but I have called it as I see it when  his actions hurt our economy and my State, in particular, and I will  continue to do so.   Today, I want to talk about his proposed tariffs on our allies and  our trading partners. These actions have prompted retaliatory tariffs  on countless Alabama goods, including cotton and soybeans. American  industries overwhelmingly oppose these tariffs or, really, they are  taxes on their products.   I share President Trump's desire to see continued growth in our  manufacturing sector and to secure trade deals that benefit our  country. His tariffs are not leading to more manufacturing jobs in  Alabama. Instead, they have manufactured a crisis that threatens to  permanently harm our businesses and our farms. This is a self-inflicted  wound.   I am well aware that China has been a rogue actor when it comes to  trade, and I support a strong response. Alabama's steel industry, for  example, was hurt by the illegal dumping of Chinese steel into the  global market. I witnessed it firsthand in my hometown of Fairfield,  AL, once home to one of the country's largest U.S. steel facilities,  which now sits virtually idle. Globe Metallurgical in Selma has been  hit by the dumping of silicon metal from China. China has time and  again shown a blatant disregard for American intellectual property  rights. I have spoken out against these abuses and will continue to do  so when they occur in the future.   We should not sweep our friends with the same brush with which we  sweep China. Antagonizing allies like Canada, South Korea, and Germany  for no reason at all only weakens us. According to the U.S. Chamber of  Commerce, more than half a million Alabama jobs are supported by global  trade, meaning more than one in every four Alabama jobs are tied to  trade. Those jobs are needlessly at risk to date.   I have spoken with representatives from industries across my State.  Some are already hurting from the tariffs; others are OK for the moment  but are fearful of consequences down the road, such as losing suppliers  or taking a direct hit from retaliatory tariffs.   Many of these workers or business owners tell me they support  President Trump. They want him to do well. They voted for him, and they  are hesitant to speak out because they don't want to appear to be  disloyal or harm him politically. They are confused as to why the  President is taking steps that hurt their businesses and put their jobs  at risk. They want help.   They say what we in this body already know: Tariffs are nothing more  than tax increases. They are taxes that hurt American businesses,  American workers, American consumers, and the American economy. In a  cruel twist, they seem to be doing the most damage in the places and  sectors that make up the President's base of support: farmers,  autoworkers, truck drivers. These are the exact folks he promised to  take care of. Nowhere is that more prevalent and evident than in our  automotive industry. It is not just really an ``industry'' as we think  of it in abstract terms. It means people, jobs, families, and the  ability to support a family.   One of those people is a man named John Hall. John has been a  maintenance worker at the Hyundai Motor manufacturing plant in  Montgomery, AL, for nearly 14 years. He recently came to Washington to  tell folks about what the industry has meant to his community.   At a rally last Thursday, he said that the transformation of  Montgomery and the Alabama River Region has been breathtaking-- breathtaking--since the Hyundai plant arrived in our State. He went on  that day to testify at the Commerce Department at a hearing about  whether or not imported automobiles, trucks, and parts posed a national  security threat.   That bears repeating. These tariffs on automobiles--foreign  automobiles and parts--are being proposed because somehow, some way  foreign vehicles and parts are a threat to national security.  [[Page S5367]]    I don't know how else to say it, but that is a ridiculous premise,  and everyone knows it. Even the President implicitly acknowledged that  in one of his Twitter rants the other day when he threatened to raise  auto tariffs in response to the antitrust fine levied against Google by  the European Union. Not only is it not a national security threat, this  industry has brought untold opportunity to Alabama and other States,  particularly in the Southeast.   Before the automakers came to Alabama, our manufacturing industry was  still reeling from NAFTA. Many Alabama facilities, like textile  manufacturers, were closing down and moving to other countries. These  automakers came to Alabama--Mercedes, Honda, Hyundai, Toyota's engine  factory, which is now a Toyota and Mazda automobile factory, breaking  ground soon, and they have breathed new life into our economy. They  have all announced planned expansions in the last year or so.   Alabama's automotive sector employs some 50,000 people, and motor  vehicle exports from Alabama reached $11 billion in 2017. Simply put,  Alabama is a trade State, an exporting State. It is not just cars,  either. We export about $170 million annually in soybeans to China, and  that industry contributes 11,000 jobs to our State.   The day China released its list of U.S. goods that could be tariffed,  soybean prices fell 40 cents that morning. Stan Usery, the president of  the Alabama Soybean & Corn Association and soybean farmer, said:         If you weighed that out in dollar figures, it was in the       billions of what the value of the U.S. soybean crop lost in       just that one day. Just based on the fear of an imposed       tariff.    I have heard from other farmers too. Peanut contract prices have  fallen flat. Pork prices have fallen $18 a head since March. Cotton  prices dropped 10 cents in the wake of the initial round of tariffs.  Our cattle farmers share these concerns and are anticipating potential  production cost increases as a result of more expensive fuel and grain.   Just yesterday, we learned that the administration is going to spend  $12 billion in taxpayer money to help offset the damage its trade war  has done to American farmers. These farmers need the money. It is a  self-inflicted wound, but they need it. This money might help some of  the farmers somewhat in the short term, but it is a slippery slope for  the President of the United States to start down.   What about the meatpackers who see less work because of reduced sales  or truckdrivers who transport these goods across the country? These  folks want trade, not aid. If tariffs are not reversed soon, the damage  to supply chains and markets cannot be undone.   A company like Harley-Davidson can move a plant from Wisconsin  overseas to avoid tariffs. My farmers in Alabama can't do that. You  can't move a soybean farm. You can't move a cotton field. You can only  move plants, hardware, and people.   China is one of the top markets for Alabama's cotton, poultry, pork,  and soybeans. When China chooses to source these goods from Brazil,  Australia, or Vietnam to avoid the President's tariffs, they will not  go back to purchasing from Alabama once common sense prevails and the  tariffs are rescinded. By then, it will be too late. A market will be  lost, and family farms cannot recover from the loss of a business.   I know some folks back home in Alabama don't like it when the  President gets criticized. They certainly don't like it when I do, and  I understand that. They don't like it even when the policies of the  administration may hurt Alabama.   One of my own delegation colleagues in the House went so far as to  suggest that we shouldn't be worried about these automobile tariffs; we  are all getting worked up over nothing. I like to think he is right,  but I don't think he is, and neither do the thousands of folks who work  in Alabama's automobile industry or their family members who have  written or called my offices, nor do the industry representatives they  have sent to Washington to plead with their elected officials for help,  nor does my good friend, the senior Senator from Tennessee, with whom I  am proud to be standing here today.   I believe these tariffs are bad for Alabama and bad for America.   Senator Alexander, who is a strong supporter of the President on many  issues, agrees that these tariffs represent a very real threat to the  hundreds of thousands of jobs in the automotive industry. No region in  the country would be hit harder than the Southeast, where textiles used  to be king but where automobiles now reign supreme.   That is why I am here today, to stand up for my constituents and to  do what I think is right. It is why, last month, Senator Alexander and  I wrote to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, urging him to reconsider the  auto tariff tax proposal before it damages the automotive sector, which  contributes more than 200,000 jobs to our two States. It is why I have  reached out to the Commerce Department and the U.S. Trade  Representatives on behalf of a number of Alabama businesses, from  textiles to heating and air conditioning companies, to businesses in  the energy sector, each facing their own unique crisis because of the  proposed tariffs.   In fact, since I was sworn in, I have invited representatives from a  number of impacted industries to come to my office to share their  stores, to offer suggestions on what we can do, and to be honest about  outcomes if we fail to act.   I did not come to this body to simply sit by and watch and do  nothing, especially when I see a need and I need to step up. I said I  would follow my conscience and do the right thing to make Alabama and  America a better place. In that spirit, a short time earlier today,  Senator Alexander and I followed up on our letter to Secretary Ross--to  which, quite frankly, we have not yet received a response--by  introducing the Automotive Jobs Act of 2018. It is a bipartisan effort  to halt President Trump's proposed tax on imported cars, trucks, and  auto parts, which would raise the price of every automobile produced in  the United States.   Our legislation would require the International Trade Commission to  conduct a comprehensive study of the well-being, health, and vitality  of the U.S. automotive industry. The ITC will be required to deliver  the report to Congress before these tariffs could be applied.   Tariffs should be used to protect American jobs, not hurt them. In  the coming weeks, I will be looking at other legislative solutions to  help other sectors impacted by the President's tariffs, but the  President can save our auto industry today by simply calling off the  232 investigation.   If we are not vigilant, hard-working Alabamians are going to be the  losers in this game of chicken with China, the European Union, and  others. The small family farmers, the line workers at our auto plants,  the truckdrivers who transport Alabama-made products to market, and our  port, all stand to lose the gains that we have made in the last couple  of decades.   It is my hope that through this legislation we can demonstrate beyond  any doubt the positive benefits the auto industry brings to Alabama,  Tennessee, and many other States across the country.   Instead of pursuing these tariffs, we should be partnering with our  allies who have also been treated unfairly by countries like China and  present a united front against bad actors and their harmful trade  practices.   I believe in the great potential of our Nation's automobile industry,  and I want to empower both the American and foreign automakers who have  already invested significantly in this country. This is a thriving  industry and one supported by the greatest workforce in the world.  Let's help it to continue to grow and support good-paying jobs in our  communities. We need to stand united against these proposed tariffs.   President Trump, Alabamians are counting on you to do the right thing  by those who stood with you. I hope you will do so.   I yield for my friend, the senior Senator from Tennessee, Mr.  Alexander.    Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of the line workers  at our Alabama auto plants.
