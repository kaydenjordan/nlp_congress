 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today for a solemn occasion. Tonight we honor our  friend, brother, colleague, the conscience of the Congress, a true  American icon: Congressman John Lewis.   Words cannot convey the loss to this body as well as to the Nation,  but very few can claim to have altered the course of American history  the way that John did. He was a guiding light to all of us and was a  leader trying to make America a more perfect Union. His steadfast moral  leadership will be deeply missed, particularly at this complex time in  our history.   Those of us here today are standing on his shoulders. His historic  life and legacy will undoubtedly live on, but we must be sure to  continue his life's work, particularly when it comes to voting rights  and restoring the Voting Rights Act. We must make some ``good trouble''  to honor his enormous legacy.
