 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentleman for his extraordinary leadership on H.R. 2, the Moving  Forward Act, and I support it.   Mr. Speaker, this is landmark legislation that would make investments  not only in highways, transit, and bridges but also for schools and  housing. Importantly, it would set America on a path toward a greener  future by encouraging investment into zero-emission technologies.   The bill would authorize $25 billion for the Postal Service, which  has bipartisan support to modernize their aging fleet. It is critical  that the Postal Service begin replacing its fleet of small trucks, most  of which are now over 25 years old, and the bill includes $6 billion  for this. The bill would require the Postal Service to purchase zero- emission vehicles and to install publicly accessible electric charging  stations at Post Offices to help expand the infrastructure needed for  electric vehicles.   Mr. Speaker, these measures will help the Postal Service meet its  mission and advance sound environmental policy, and I urge a strong  ``yes'' vote on H.R. 2.                                time  1345
