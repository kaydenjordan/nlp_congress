 Mr. Speaker, this is National Catholic Schools Week.  Every year, I introduce a resolution to recognize the outstanding  contributions that Catholic schools make to our Nation.   My own education at Saint Symphorosa and Saint Ignatius provided the  foundation that enabled me to earn 2 degrees in engineering, and a  Ph.D. in political science before I began my career as a teacher. My  experience, my wife's experience, and the experience of so many others  across our Nation have made me a lifelong supporter of Catholic  schools.   This year's Catholic Schools Week theme is ``Learn. Serve. Lead.  Succeed.'' And that is exactly what Catholic schools teach students to  do.   Earlier this week, I visited Saint Christina in Chicago and Saint  Albert the Great in Burbank, and later this week I will be at Saints  Cyril & Methodius in Lemont, as well as Saint Richard and Saint Daniel  in Chicago.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to take time this week to recognize  the great work of the Catholic schools in their districts.  [[Page H647]]                                ____________________
