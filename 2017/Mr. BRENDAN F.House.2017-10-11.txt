 BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)    BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to  recognize MaST Community Charter School, an incredible institution in  my district that was just named a 2017 Blue Ribbon School of Excellence  by the Department of Education.   MaST is a groundbreaking educational community that emphasizes  collaborative, technology-driven, hands-on learning. They are preparing  the next generation of American leaders and visionaries who will change  the future in ways we can only imagine.   Blue Ribbon schools are characterized by the highest level of  academic excellence and by their success in closing achievement gaps  across student populations.   These elite institutions are a gold standard of instruction,  inclusion, and innovation. MaST Community Charter School was one of  only 342 schools across the country to earn this honor this year.   I want to congratulate the teachers, staff, administrators, parents,  and students of the MaST Community Charter School on their remarkable  and well-deserved achievement.                            ____________________
