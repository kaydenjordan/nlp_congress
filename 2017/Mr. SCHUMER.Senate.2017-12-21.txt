 Mr. President, I very much thank my friend from  Pennsylvania. As always, he is a gentleman as well as a great  legislator and great leader. I meant those words very sincerely,  unrelated to his yielding to me.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on year-end issues, we are staring down a  litany of unresolved issues, and we are quickly running out of time to  solve them. Not only do we need to pass an extension of government  funding, but as I have said many times, we need to deal with budget  caps, CHIP, community health centers, 702 FISA, a disaster  supplemental, and of course the Dreamers.   I believe we could have resolved all of these issues had my  Republican colleagues, especially in the House, not put them on the  back burner while jamming through their tax bill. It is unclear still  what the House is going to send us to keep the government open and  whether it will be acceptable to the Senate.   At the same time, the House may move forward on an unacceptable  disaster supplemental which still does not treat fairly California,  Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. It doesn't include, as best  we know--they are still working on it--cost sharing for Puerto Rico and  additional funding for Medicaid, mitigation resiliency, and drinking  water infrastructure. While House Republicans included some tax  provisions in the disaster supplemental, they failed to extend the ITC  for Puerto Rico, extend the childcare tax credit consistent with other  States, and the tax bill also includes a devastating new business tax  that treats Puerto Rico as if it is a foreign country, which could  encourage manufacturers to leave the island. This tax could cost  thousands of jobs and decimate Puerto Rico's economy at exactly the  time when Puerto Rico is hurting from the hurricanes and needs all the  help it can get. Those issues must be fixed before a disaster  supplemental can move forward. Because of these inadequacies, the  disaster supplemental may have to slip to next year. I think we can  work it out in a bipartisan way--I certainly do--but just jamming it  through without consulting us and not being fair to so many other parts  of the country doesn't make sense.   Unfortunately, we still have not reached a deal yet on the Dreamers,  who are very important not only to my caucus, not only to some on the  Republican side but to the American people. They have overwhelming  support. These kids were brought here very young, through no fault of  their own. They learn in our schools, work at our companies, serve in  our military, and pledge allegiance to our flag. They are Americans in  every single important way but one--their paperwork. This is an issue  we have a moral imperative to solve here in Congress.    Democrats want to make sure that we have equal bargaining, and we are  not going to allow things like disaster relief go forward without  discussing some of the other issues we care about that I have  mentioned. We have to solve these issues together, even if that means  passing a clean, short-term CR extension of government funding with  some anomalies--we always understand there always have to be some  anomalies but not those that change the structure--and continuing the  negotiations into January.                            ____________________     Now, Mr. President, on tax. Earlier this week, the  Senate passed one of the worst pieces of legislation in at least a  decade, maybe longer. The Republican tax bill will go down in history  as a rushed, sloppy, partisan rewrite of the Tax Code that benefited  those who already have so much while doing little or hurting those who  have too little. It will be remembered as throwing the extraordinary  income inequality we see today into overdrive and fulfilling very few  of the ambitious Republican promises about growth, job creation, and  deficit reduction. But perhaps most of all, the Republican tax bill  will define the Republican Party as the party of the rich and powerful,  the party against the middle class, and that will be a rubric we will  hear from now until next November and even further on.   Yesterday in the Oval Office, President Trump admitted that cutting  the corporate tax rate was ``probably the biggest factor in our plan.''  Despite all his rhetoric about this being a middle-class tax bill, as  soon as it passes, he admits that lowering the corporate rate was the  Republicans' primary goal.   As corporations get a massive, permanent tax break, individuals will  get small and temporary ones. By 2027, 145 million American families  making under $200,000--83 percent of the middle class--will be either  paying more in taxes or get a cut of less than $100. That is according  to the Joint Committee on Taxation--no partisan affiliation. Meanwhile,  the top 1 percent of income earners in our country will reap 83 percent  of the benefits from this tax plan. Those facts are what make this bill  so dramatically unpopular with the American people by a 2-to-1 margin  in some polls, and next year the American people will have the  opportunity to reject this bill and move our country in a different  direction.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on Special Prosecutor Mueller, I want to  take a moment to praise my friend from Virginia, Senator Mark Warner,  vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, for his speech  yesterday about Special Counsel Mueller. It was an eloquent speech. I  would like to associate myself with the substance of his fine remarks.  If the President were to fire Special Counsel Mueller, our country  would face a constitutional crisis. As my colleague from Virginia said,  it would cross a redline. Additionally, there are steps below that  brash and brazen act that would also cross redlines here in Congress,  as Senator Warner noted, including the use of the Presidential pardon  on members of the Trump campaign who have been convicted, whether those  pardons are intended to subvert the investigation or prevent testimony  and further cooperation.   So I say to my colleagues, just as firing Special Prosecutor Mueller  would cross a redline, so would pardoning people like Manafort and  Flynn. The bottom line is this: President Trump must allow this  investigation to proceed without a scintilla of interference. He would  be wise to listen to Senator Warner's speech yesterday and act  accordingly.                            ____________________     Finally, Mr. President, since this is the last time I  might be able to address this Chamber before the end of the year--let's  hope so--I would like to look back at what the Senate has accomplished  this year. The long and short of it, though, is that the Senate has not  accomplished much to be proud of.   Despite winning only a slim majority in the last election--a  condition that made this year ripe for cooperation between the  parties--the Republicans used their power not to seek consensus or  bipartisanship but, rather, to try to jam through a partisan agenda.   My friend the majority leader once promised that if he were ever  given the majority, he would return the body to regular order. He  cautioned against the Senate becoming an ``assembly line for one  party's partisan legislative agenda.'' That is what Mitch McConnell  said a few years ago. Sadly, that is exactly what the Senate has become  under his leadership this year. For a man who professed to love the  Senate and relish bipartisanship, this is probably the most partisan  Senate that I have served in in all the years I have been here, and we  have departed from regular order and the customs of the Senate in ways  never seen before. For what end? Well, this Chamber, under Republican  leadership, has devoted itself to furthering the interests of the  wealthy and powerful, while ignoring or harming the interests of the  middle class and working America.  [[Page S8192]]    Republicans will argue that they had a great year, pointing to three  things--Judge Gorsuch, the use of the Congressional Review Act to roll  back regulations, and their tax bill. All three of those things help  the rich and they will help corporations, but they won't help the  middle class.   Senate Republicans engaged in historic obstruction to keep a Supreme  Court seat open so the Heritage Foundation and Federalist Society could  pick a Justice who would rule on the side of corporations instead of  people.   Senate Republicans jammed through Congressional Review Act bills that  rolled back protections for women, students, and workers, while lifting  requirements placed on bad actors in the big oil, gas, mining, and gun  industries.   They capped the year by passing a tax bill that provides huge tax  breaks for the rich and biggest corporations, while providing crumbs  and even tax hikes for the middle class.   They tried for months to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which would  send costs soaring for millions of Americans and cause millions more to  lose coverage.   They failed to fully authorize CHIP, the Children's Health Insurance  Program, and failed to rebuild our infrastructure, despite the  President's promises.   The stock market is up, but wages are flat or nearly flat. The  President and Republicans promised that they would stop outsourcing,  and that hasn't happened. Even companies the President said he would  personally save have sent jobs to Mexico, leaving families in the  Midwest and across the country without the income they need this  holiday season.   Time and time again, the middle class was an afterthought or simply  forgotten by Senate Republicans and President Trump. That has been the  story of the year. Republicans haven't accomplished much, but what they  have accomplished has only benefited the wealthy and well connected.   The Senate's record this year has exposed the faux populism at the  center of President Trump's political identity. Although he rode into  office promising to help the forgotten man and woman, those are exactly  the people he has forgotten, abandoning them in favor of wealthy  special interests. Populism, unfortunately, under President Trump, has  been traded for plutocracy.   The millions of Americans in 2016 who were frustrated at a Washington  that didn't work for them feel more frustrated today, and the millions  of working men and women who voted for President Trump--many of them  are already feeling betrayed.   We hope that the future will be different and that our Republican  friends realize that their legislative and political goals are better  served by bipartisanship and compromise rather than gridlock and  strife. If they do, we are willing and ready to work with them, but if  they don't, voters will have a chance to move our country in a  dramatically different direction in 2018. We are already seeing a  yearning for that new direction in elections in Virginia, New Jersey,  Tennessee, and even in deep red Alabama. If the Republicans continue to  hurt the middle class and give handouts to big corporations and the  wealthy, they are in for a reckoning next November.   I yield the floor, and I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania for his  courtesy.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.                            ____________________     I object.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.    I object.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.    I object.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.    I object.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.    I object.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.    I object.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.    I object.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.    Mr. President, today we are adopting S. Res. 327, the  National Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Awareness Week resolution. In 2015 I  sponsored a similar resolution, National Carbon Monoxide Poisoning  Awareness Month, which was inspired by the story and memory of Amanda  Hansen. Ms. Hansen was a 16-year-old, living in West Seneca, NY, when  she tragically lost her life to carbon monoxide poisoning while  attending a sleepover at a friend's home. Her heartbreaking story  focused attention on this issue and spurred action to prevent future  deaths from exposure to this deadly gas. As a long supporter of this  resolution, I believe that every home across our great Nation should  have carbon monoxide alarms installed that can detect and prevent  carbon monoxide poisoning, a silent and odorless killer. By bringing  awareness to carbon monoxide poisoning and reminding our fellow  Americans to diligently check their home-detection systems, Americans  can take the necessary actions to ensure the safety of their loved  ones.   I again send my deepest condolences to the Hansen family for their  loss and to the many American families who have suffered from the  passing of their loved ones due to carbon monoxide poisoning.   With the help of Amanda's spirit, I will continue to fight for  congressional action to help prevent future tragedies. Today I stand  proud to be a Member of a body that unanimously supports the adoption  of National Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Awareness Week.   Mr. McCONNELL. I further ask unanimous consent that the resolution be  agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   The resolution (S. Res. 327) was agreed to.   The preamble was agreed to.   (The resolution, with its preamble, is printed in the Record of  November 9, 2017, under ``Submitted Resolutions.'')                            ____________________
