 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 849, the Protecting Seniors'  Access to Medicare Act of 2017.   The Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, was created in the  Affordable Care Act to reduce per capita rate of growth in Medicare  spending. If a spending target is exceeded, cuts must be made, and the  HHS Secretary is directed to implement the proposals made by this 15- person board automatically unless Congress affirmatively acts to alter  the proposals or to discontinue automatic implementation of the  proposals. This board has not yet been formed, but the statute requires  the HHS Secretary to come up with the required reductions instead.   Medicare is crucial for our Nation's seniors to see their doctors,  and the program's viability must be protected. There is no question  that Medicare must be modernized in order to continue for future  generations, but IPAB is not the right approach, and a bipartisan group  of my colleagues agree that IPAB is not the answer to fixing Medicare's  shortfalls.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Walden), the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee  and my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Costello), a member of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, one, this IPAB effort is bipartisan. We have even heard  on the floor both sides of the aisle support passage of the bill. It  has been bipartisan.    First, a couple of things. On the value-based payments--which I think  is the direction we need to go to rein in the costs and make sure we  have sustainable programs, but the IPAB's annual short-term focus  savings provision would affect Medicare and the wider health system in  unpredictable ways with potentially many negative unintended  consequences by doubling down on the traditional practice of squeezing  payment rates in order to slow spending with no meaningful eye to how  these changes impact long-term incentives--the IPAB could work at cross  purposes to broaden reform that would base Medicare payments on quality  and value.   On the offset, we did offset CHIP and the community health centers.  We know that money is going to be spent. We know that when we authorize  it, it is going to be spent. We believe it is going to be spent wisely.  That is why we are moving forward with these bills.   The IPAB has not been constituted, and repealing it should not have  to be offset since it has not spent any money nor been charged yet with  finding any savings. The IPAB trigger has never been hit. The CBO  estimates that the IPAB would be triggered in 2023, 2025, and 2027. But  by their own admission, and I quote from the report, ``Given the  uncertainty that surrounds these projections, it is possible such  authority would be invoked in other years,'' or we could also assume  possibly never at all.   The CBO estimate also has to assume the level of cuts required by the  amount Medicare is spending that exceeds the trigger. The CBO also then  has to speculate on how reductions made in any one year would impact  the trigger in future years, further laying assumption upon guesswork.  As the CBO notes in their estimate, the estimate represents a broad  range of possible effects.   The CBO admits they do not know if the IPAB will be triggered or what  policies they might pursue if activated. Some of their assumptions are  one-sided bets that may or may not achieve savings, and the CBO must  further speculate on the probabilities associated with such variations.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I believe the IPAB will not be effective  providing real solutions for Medicare solvency. It contributes  disproportionately little to the projected cost savings needed in  Medicare, but it has the potential to hurt seniors' access to care.  Fundamentally, I believe it is a constitutional affront to the  legislative branch.                                time  1645    The IPAB decisions don't come to Congress to be approved or  disapproved. We can undo the IPAB decisions if we have dollar-for- dollar replacement, but that could even be blocked by a minority vote  in the Senate.   So I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 849, to repeal the  Independent Payment Advisory Board, and I hope there will continue to  be bipartisan support for this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 849, the  so-called ``Protecting Seniors' Access to Medicare Act of 2017,'' which  repeals the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), that was  established under the ACA in response to high rates of growth in  Medicare expenditures and charged with developing proposals to ``reduce  the per capita rate of growth in Medicare spending.''   I opposed this bill when it came to the floor as H.R. 1190 in the  114th Congress and I oppose it now because by repealing IPAB, the bill  would eliminate an important safeguard that will help reduce the rate  of Medicare cost growth responsibly while protecting Medicare  beneficiaries.  [[Page H8420]]    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 849 is nothing but another attempt, in a long line  of House Republican efforts to undermine both the Medicare guarantee  and the Affordable Care Act.   Repealing IPAB would cost over $17.5 billion during the course of a  ten year period according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).   Mr. Speaker, Republicans do not even make an attempt to find an  offset for this $17.5 billion increase to the deficit resulting from  repeal of the IPAB, while at the same time they plan to bring to the  floor a partisan bill to reauthorize CHIP, Community Health Centers,  and other public health extenders by cutting Medicare and slashing  funding for programs relied upon by Medicaid recipients, low and middle  income families with Affordable Care Act health coverage.   After more than seven years under the Affordable Care Act, more than  20 million Americans have gained health coverage; up to 129 million  people who could have otherwise been denied or who faced discrimination  now have access to coverage.   Mr. Speaker, given the real challenges facing our nation, it is  irresponsible for the Republican majority to continue bringing to the  floor unpaid for bills that would do serious harm to millions of  Americans if they were to be enacted.   House Republicans have tried more than 65 times to undermine the  Affordable Care Act, which has enabled more than 20 million previously  uninsured Americans to know the peace of mind that comes from having  access to affordable, accessible, high quality health care.   Their batting average to date is .000; they have struck out every  time because the American people appreciate and strongly support the  Affordable Care Act.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to look at the facts and abandon  this misguided effort to undermine the ACA and impose significant  negative impacts on Americans currently insured.   The Independent Payment Advisory Board is to recommend to Congress  policies that reduce the rate of Medicare growth and help Medicare  provide better care at lower costs.   IPAB membership by law is to be made up of 15 members appointed by  the President and confirmed by the Senate and been comprised of the  non-partisan CBO, economists, and health policy experts as contributing  to Medicare's long-term sustainability.   Mr. Speaker, the IPAB is already prohibited from recommending changes  to Medicare that ration health care, restrict benefits, modify  eligibility, increase cost sharing, or raise premiums or revenues.   Under current law, the Congress retains the authority to modify,  reject, or enhance IPAB recommendations to strengthen Medicare, and  IPAB recommendations would take effect only if the Congress does not  act to slow Medicare cost growth.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, let me point out to our friends across the  aisle that according to the CMS actuary, IPAB will not be triggered  until 2021, so the timing of today's repeal is premature and  politically motivated.   IPAB was enacted as a backstop to the other cost saving and quality  improvement efforts in ACA, such as accountable care organizations,  patient-centered care models like medical homes, programs that pay for  quality not quantity, and value based purchasing.   Because of the ACA and these programs, Medicare spending growth has  slowed and Medicare's solvency has been extended.   Increasing the deficit by $17.5 billion as a result of repealing the  IPAB would is fiscally irresponsible, especially now that Republicans  have introduced a tax package that will saddle our country with $1.5  trillion of debt in order to give tax cuts to the wealthy and  corporations.   Mr. Speaker, despite the Supreme Court's upholding of the law's  constitutionality, the reelection of President Obama, and Speaker  Ryan's admission that ``Obamacare is the law of the land,'' Republicans  refuse to stop wasting time and taxpayer money in their effort to take  away the patient protections and benefits of the Affordable Care Act.   Mr. Speaker, I call upon House Republican leaders to stop wasting our  time trying to take away healthcare protections that Americans depend  on and to start addressing pressing national priorities.   And they should start with working with Democrats on a bipartisan and  responsible plan to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program  (``SCHIP'') which insures more than 9 million kids and fully funding  the relief efforts needed to help American communities recover from the  devastating effects of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against H.R. 849.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.   Pursuant to House Resolution 600, the previous question is ordered on  the bill, as amended.   The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.   The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was  read the third time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the bill.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.
