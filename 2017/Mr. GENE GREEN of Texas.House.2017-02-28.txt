 Mr. Speaker, health care is important to  every family in America. The Affordable Care Act increased access to  health care for about 20 million Americans.   Is the Affordable Care Act perfect?   No bill that has ever been debated on this floor and passed is  perfect.   Let's make our goal not to have anyone who received access to health  care to lose it. We need to make it better and to guarantee access to  quality health care for all Americans. America can do better.                            ____________________
