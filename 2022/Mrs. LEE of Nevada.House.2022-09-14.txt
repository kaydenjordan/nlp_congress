 Madam Speaker, I rise today as this week marks  300 days since we signed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act  into law.   But we didn't stop there, we have accomplished so much more in the  last 100 days.   For years, Washington has been all talk, no action when it comes to  infrastructure. Congress after Congress, President after President, all  promised to finally tackle our Nation's crumbling infrastructure. This  Congress finally delivered--and delivered with bipartisan support.   It was truly a historic moment, but in the 300 days since it was  signed into law--on this very floor, amidst all of the noise and  divisiveness--this Congress has continued to make history.   The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the most significant gun  violence legislation in nearly 30 years. Now law.   The PACT Act, to provide generations of veterans and their families  the care and benefits they have earned and deserve. Now law.    The CHIPS and Science Act, which will allow us to compete with China,  boost our supply chains and American innovation, and bring jobs back to  America. Now law.   The Inflation Reduction Act, the biggest step our country has taken  to tackle climate change, while also delivering lower prices for  prescription drugs and expanded access to affordable healthcare. This,  too, is now law.   Nevada was ground zero for the economic devastation of this pandemic.  Nevada was also ground zero for the most urgent effects of climate  change, but Nevada also stands to gain the most from the Inflation  Reduction Act. A record 14.5 million people--and more than 100,000  Nevadans--have signed up for coverage through the ACA marketplaces.  Now, that coverage will be even more affordable with the expanded tax  credits in the Inflation Reduction Act.   Medicare can finally negotiate lower drug prices, which means savings  for our seniors and every single taxpayer. Not only that, the Inflation  Reduction Act caps out-of-pocket costs for part D drugs and insulin for  seniors and individuals with disabilities on Medicare.   All of this means better, more accessible healthcare, and more money  in Nevadans' pockets. I am also incredibly proud that this bill will  tackle our climate crisis and stand up for Nevada's future. The West is  facing the worst drought in 12 centuries. In my district, the dire  situation at Lake Mead is making headlines all over the world.   This bill will help mitigate the harmful effects of our drought by  funding environmental restoration projects and investing in  conservation projects to increase water levels in the Colorado River.   It is going to take all of us to fight the climate crisis. This bill  supports Nevadans on the ground in their effort to save energy and save  money all along the way.   Do you need to replace a stove or a refrigerator? Do you need to  install solar panels or perhaps buy an electric vehicle? This bill will  help you with direct rebates to buy more energy-efficient options.   Overall, Nevadan families that take advantage of the clean energy tax  credits could save more than $20,000 in a single year. All of this is  fully paid for by cuts to our deficit by $300 billion, by finally  making the ultra-wealthy and big corporations finally begin to pay  their fair share. Let me be clear, not  [[Page H7792]]  one person earning less than $400,000 a year will pay a penny more in  Federal taxes.   Madam Speaker, a lot can happen just in 300 days--from infrastructure  to gun violence prevention to helping our veterans and building a  stronger American economy. The Inflation Reduction Act is perhaps the  biggest achievement of this Congress, and House Democrats delivered it  alone.   Not one Republican voted to lower the cost of prescription drugs and  insulin. Not one Republican voted to lower healthcare costs. Not one  Republican voted for a fairer tax system.   Not one Republican voted to put people over their politics. The fight  continues, and House Democrats will do everything in our power to  deliver the results and put the American people first.                            ____________________
