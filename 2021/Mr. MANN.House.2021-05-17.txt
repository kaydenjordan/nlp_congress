 Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight veterans bills  before the House floor.   I appreciate the opportunity to first highlight legislation that  Representative Pappas and I introduced, aimed at helping veteran  homelessness.   H.R. 2878 and the Affordable Housing for Homeless Veterans Act of  2021 would increase the number of affordable housing options to help  reduce the recent uptick in veteran homelessness due to the ongoing  pandemic.   Our job on the House Veterans' Affairs Committee is to ensure that we  are taking care of and doing right by our veterans. This legislation  works to do just that. Curbing veterans' homelessness and ensuring our  Nation's heroes are not without shelter for themselves and  their families is a top priority for me. There are over 37,000 veterans  experiencing homelessness in America. This is not acceptable for our  veterans, and we must be part of the solution.    I was pleased to see the Department of VA and the Department of  Housing and Urban Development align efforts to join forces to find ways  to end veteran homelessness. One of the priorities mentioned by VA and  HUD is increasing the supply and access to affordable housing.   My legislation reauthorizes and amends the program that allows the  Secretary of VA to sell, lease, rent or donate a home which was  acquired by VA because a veteran defaulted on their VA-guaranteed home  loan to a public housing authority, grant and per diem provider, or a  Supportive Services for Veterans Families service provider.   The public housing authority or providers could then use these homes  to shelter other veterans and their families who are homeless or at  risk of becoming homeless.   By reauthorizing this program and removing some burdensome  regulations from the old program, the number of affordable housing  options in higher cost areas will increase and provide relief to  veterans who have limited affordable housing options.   I was pleased this legislation received bipartisan support from my  colleagues on the committee, as well as many members not on the  committee. This broad support shows a willingness by this House of  Representatives to implement these impactful changes for our veterans  across the country.   I also had the opportunity to speak with VA Secretary McDonough when  he visited VA facilities in Kansas. I spoke to him about the Affordable  Housing for Homeless Veterans Act, and he was encouraged about the work  we were doing in the committee to help veterans. I look forward to my  continued partnership with Secretary McDonough and the VA.   I also want to quickly highlight another piece of legislation I  introduced along with Representative Lamb, the VA Equal Employment  Counseling Modernization Act.                                time  1515    This legislation removes burdensome regulations by simply removing  the cap on the number of full-time employees at the Department of  Veterans Affairs who provide equal opportunity employment counseling.  It is a small, incremental change, but changes like this help the VA  get our veterans into jobs quickly and ensure we are giving them the  best care and guidance possible.   I thank Chairman Takano and Ranking Member Bost for allowing me to  speak on behalf of the Affordable Housing for Veterans Act. I look  forward to passing these pieces of legislation and continuing to work  with everyone to help veterans.
