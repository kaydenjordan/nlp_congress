 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment to increase  funding for the VA adaptive sports equine-assisted therapy program by  $5 million.   This grant program provides much-needed resources for evidence-based  equine-assisted therapy that helps treat veterans suffering from unseen  psychological wounds such as post-traumatic stress disorder, military  sexual trauma, and traumatic brain injury. Increased funding for  equine-assisted therapy will greatly improve mental health treatment  for our veterans.   As the chairman of the Congressional Horse Caucus, the representative  for the horse capital of the world, and as someone who cares deeply for  our veterans, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
