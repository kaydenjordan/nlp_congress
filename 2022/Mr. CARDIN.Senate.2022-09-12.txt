 Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to Renee  Cohen, a member of my staff who is retiring after more than 37 years of  service to the people of Maryland. Renee has been with me since I  served as speaker of the house in the Maryland General Assembly before  I won election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1986.   W.H. Auden said, ``We are all here on earth to help others; what on  earth the others are here for I don't know.'' Certainly, Renee has  devoted her life to helping others, and she has made an extraordinary  difference in the lives of so many people and families. She is a native  Baltimorean and a graduate of Forest Park High School, where she was an  officer in her sorority and excelled academically. She grew up  surrounded by aunts and uncles, especially the Pollakoffs on her  mother's side of the family. She attended Temple University, where she  earned an associate's degree that allowed her to work as a dental  hygienist. She worked to help support her mother, who was widowed when  Renee was a young teenager.   Renee married the love of her life, Jonas Cohen, in 1960, and they  had three wonderful sons, Mark, Adam, and Ethan. Renee has been a  devoted mother and grandmother. When her sons  [[Page S4538]]  were old enough, she returned to school, to Notre Dame College of  Maryland, now known as Notre Dame of Maryland University, to earn a  bachelor's degree in fine arts. She is a gifted artist.   Renee and Jonas found many opportunities for volunteer work and  leadership roles through the Associate Jewish Charities. Her influence  and reach in local civic life and politics continued to expand to the  point where I knew I needed her on my staff as a constituent liaison.  When I entered the House of Representatives in 1987, Renee became a  caseworker, focusing on healthcare and senior citizen issues. She has  had a special interest and insight into these issues after caring for  her mother, Rose Katz, who lived to be 105, and her husband, who had a  progressive illness before he passed away in 2020. Since I joined the  Senate, Renee has been an indefatigable field representative for me on  health and senior issues and a liaison to the Jewish community.   Try as we might, Senators cannot be in two places at once. We depend  on staff to represent us. If you were to Google Renee, you would find  numerous articles and pictures of her representing me in Baltimore and  around the State, at healthcare fairs and other events, where she  shared her knowledge, contacts, and other information with constituents  who needed Federal assistance of some kind. She particularly relished  helping people to understand and navigate the Affordable Care Act.   Much of what Senators do can seem ethereal or intangible. Staffers  like Renee represent where ``the rubber hits the road.'' Casework and  the sort of outreach Renee performed is intensely personal. Renee  helped people receive their Social Security retirement, Social Security  disability, and supplemental security income payments and Medicare  benefits. She excelled because she is empathetic and has a passion for  service, for problem-solving, and for strategic thinking. If, for any  reason, she was unable to offer assistance--which was exceedingly  rare--she had a knack for finding agencies that the rest of us never  knew existed for a referral. She would never end a call with, ``I'm  sorry, we can't help you.'' She always went the proverbial extra mile.   Another keen interest of Renee's has been science, technology,  engineering, and mathematics--STEM--education. Renee was instrumental  in helping to establish STEM programs for underserved students in  schools across Maryland and the annual STEM Expo at Morgan State  University. She calls these projects ``my baby,'' and educators  affectionately refer to Renee as ``the STEM Queen.''   Renee has worked for me longer than any other member of my staff. It  was inevitable that I would consider her as a member of my extended  family and vice versa. I have been so fortunate to have her by my side  for nearly 40 years. The positive difference she has made in so many  people's lives is incalculable. She has run the race and is ready to  retire--sort of. Renee is not someone who lets the grass grow under her  feet so she will return to the office occasionally as a ``senior  intern,'' helping answer the phones and pitching in on casework. I am  grateful we will stay connected. But she will have more time to devote  to her family and friends and her avocation, which is painting. Renee  sees the beauty in the people she has faithfully served and in the  natural world, which she captures on canvas. On behalf of my Senate  colleagues and the people of Maryland, I want to express my undying  gratitude to Renee for nearly four decades of exemplary service,  congratulate her on her retirement, and extend my best wishes to her as  she turns the page, paint brushes in hand, to a new chapter in a life  well-lived.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to Robert  ``Bob'' Hand as he retires this week after 40 years of faithful service  to the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, also known as  the Helsinki Commission. The Commission is an independent U.S.  Government agency Congress created in 1975 to monitor and encourage  compliance with the Helsinki Final Act and other commitments undertaken  since then by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe,  OSCE. The Commission consists of nine members from the House of  Representatives, nine members from the U.S. Senate, and one member each  from the Departments of State, Defense, and Commerce. The House and  Senate share the positions of chair and cochair and rotate every 2  years, when a new Congress convenes. For the Commission to function, it  relies on expert professional staff who must be as nonpartisan as they  are expert in their fields.   I am, during this 117th Congress, the chair of the Helsinki  Commission, though for these remarks it is important to note that I  have served on the Commission since the 103rd Congress, dating back to  my time in the House of Representatives. When I joined the Commission  in 1993, as the several Balkan Wars were unfolding in the former  Yugoslavia, Bob Hand was already the go-to person on Capitol Hill for  news and information--and explanations--of what was happening in the  Western Balkans. I have worked with Bob for 29 years now. I have relied  on him for 29 years. I have respected his intellect and his prodigious  work ethic for 29 years.   This month, Bob retires as the longest serving staff person on the  Helsinki Commission, with 40 years of service. Bob earned a B.A. in  international relations and Russian area studies, with a minor in  economics, from the School of International Service at American  University in 1983 but actually started at the Commission in 1982 as an  intern. After he graduated, he quickly moved to full-time staff in  1983. Throughout the years, he has shown exceptional professionalism  and has always been willing to go above and beyond the call to do  whatever was necessary to ensure that the Commission served mandate  defended human rights. His deep expertise on the Western Balkans has  made him renowned among policy professionals in Washington, and his  appearances on Voice of America and TOP channel in Albania nearly made  him a household name there.   Bob worked tirelessly throughout the wars in the former Yugoslavia in  the 1990s to ensure that members of the Helsinki Commission had the  best information and analysis of developments when formulating  legislation and policy responses to address the aggression, war crimes,  and ethnic cleansing which took place in Bosnia-Herzegovina from 1992  to 1995. He helped to document these atrocities through numerous  hearings and briefings and reports. He also advised Helsinki  Commissioners as they pressed U.S. leadership to use NATO assets to end  the siege of Sarajevo and protect UN-designated safe havens and to lift  the arms embargo imposed on Bosnia-Herzegovina.   Bob was an early proponent of the establishment of the International  Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia--ICTY--to hold those  responsible for atrocities to account, including for the Srebrenica  genocide, which he has ensured the Commission commemorates each year in  memory of those murdered. He has also ensured that other cases stay at  the forefront of policy attention, particularly the Bytyqi brothers,  three Albanian-Americans whose murdered bodies were found in Serbia in  2001 and for whom Bob has never stopped seeking justice.   Bob is also an expert on Albania, and he helped organize a Helsinki  Commission visit to Albania in 1990, the first U.S. Government agency  visit to that nation since relations were severed in 1946. He returned  to Albania numerous times over the years, observed most of the  country's elections over the past two decades, and through his  thoughtful and in-depth analysis of political developments in the  country, became a respected commentator on Albanian radio and  television.   Bob served on numerous U.S. delegations to OSCE Meetings, observed  dozens of elections, and he even served as a mission member on one of  the OSCE's first field missions: the OSCE Missions of Long Duration in  Kosovo, Sandjak and Vojvodina, stationed in Novi Pazar in 1993. He is  not just one our Nation's top experts on the Western Balkans; he is  also a fount of knowledge on the OSCE itself, and especially the OSCE's  Parliamentary Assembly, PA.   Bob has served for many years as the Secretary of the U.S. Delegation  to the Parliamentary Assembly. In that role,  [[Page S4539]]  he deftly ensured that our delegation was not only well-prepared both  logistically and substantively, but also through working diplomatically  with other delegations, he ensured that our proposals, resolutions, and  amendments had the best possible chance of being successfully adopted.  Most recently at the OSCE PA annual session in Birmingham, Bob worked  diligently with several other delegations to ensure that a critical  resolution condemning Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine was  adopted with the strongest possible language.   Bob has also always been a voice of reason, humanity, and fairness.  He did not refrain from criticizing U.S. policy when it was warranted  and several times advocated that the United States proactively discuss  its own shortcomings with other OSCE countries, including after reports  of prisoner abuse in Abu Ghraib, Iraq, surfaced in 2003. Among  Commission staff, he was always quick to support his colleagues, but  also did not shy away from debating the pros and cons of ideas. Above  all, Bob has always sought to do what is right--for the Helsinki  Commission, for the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, for the  United States, and for the promotion of human rights, democracy, and  rule of law throughout the 57 nations of the OSCE.   A little over 2 years ago, I paid tribute to another Commission  staffer, Erika Schlager, on her retirement after 34 years of service.  It so happens that Bob and Erika are husband and wife. Bob and Erika  have devoted their lives--75 years and counting--to defending and  promoting human rights. They have been passionate and remarkably  effective advocates for the world's downtrodden and disenfranchised.   The Most Reverend Desmond Tutu, former Anglican Archbishop of Cape  Town, South Africa, remarked, ``It means a great deal to those who are  oppressed to know that they are not alone.'' For the past 40 years,  oppressed people around the world, but especially in Eastern and  Central Europe, knew they weren't alone because Bob Hand was fighting  for them. I know I speak on behalf of my Senate colleagues, my fellow  Commissioners, and Bob's wide circle of professional colleagues and  admirers when I say that I will miss him. I am grateful for his  stalwart service and wish him all the best for his future endeavors.                            ____________________
