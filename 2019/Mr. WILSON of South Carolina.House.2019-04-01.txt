 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on  the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order  that a quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, South Carolinians are  grateful that President Donald Trump has nominated Michael Kratsios,  son of John and Maria Kratsios of Columbia, to be the U.S. Chief  Technology Officer. He is a very successful and qualified leader to  develop technology initiatives for the White House.   Under Michael's leadership, the White House has been able to develop  plans for artificial intelligence, quantum computing, 5G, STEM  education, and advanced manufacturing. Michael is a global leader and  has proven that he is the best person to serve our country in this  position.   Among many accomplishments, Michael led the American Artificial  Intelligence Initiative, which secures American leadership and  artificial intelligence research and development and opens the door for  greater innovation.   Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has praised the nomination of Michael  Kratsios as putting a ``knowledgeable leader at the helm of American  technology.''   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
