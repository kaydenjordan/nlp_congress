 Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentleman from  Michigan for his yielding and for his leadership and for the pleasure  that I have in working on the Judiciary Committee. Let me thank the  chairman and Members as well, particularly working on the Crime,  Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations Subcommittee, of which  this underlying bill comes to the floor on.  [[Page H4337]]    This is a very important week, Mr. Speaker. It is National Police  Week. A number of our constituents have been here, and we have had the  opportunity to hear from a number of outstanding leaders: a sheriff  from Los Angeles County; the sheriff from South Carolina; the police  department leader from Houston, Texas; and the head of the FOP.   So I think that we have had a good week in terms of hearings in the  Judiciary Committee, and certainly this past Monday we honored those  who tragically ascended to the memorial wall where we honor police from  across the Nation.   So I think it is important to put on the record that none of us, I  would hope--I certainly don't--take a back seat to the respect,  admiration, and the work that we do to keep our law enforcement and  first responders safe. We commend them for their service as we continue  to work on police and community working together.   We also are grateful for those who are engaged in enhanced community  relations as well as working with diverse communities.   So let me acknowledge individuals from Houston that we have lost:  Assistant Deputy Chief Clint Greenwood; Officer Richard K. Martin;  Harris County Sheriff's Deputy Darren Goforth.   We lost Jerry Ronald Walker of Little Elm Police Department.   Then officers who died in Dallas: Officer Brent Thompson, Sergeant  Michael Smith, Senior Corporal Lorne Ahrens, Officer Patricio  Zamarripa, and Officer Michael Krol.   I have had the chance to work with a number of chiefs of police,  including Chief Lee P. Brown, one of the first police chiefs in Houston  that I was able to work with as I began to engage publicly; Chief  McClelland; now Chief Acevedo; and chiefs in-between.   I particularly thank them for working with the community during  stressful times, during times when violence was evidenced out in the  community; not against police, but against communities--keeping the  peace, if you will, as we tried to work together.    So I support policies that are necessary, and I certainly support the  idea of protecting our law enforcement. Of course, the underlying bill  has that provision and indicates a protection of law enforcement  officers. In actuality, it provides the opportunity for the protection  as well as the utilization of the death penalty.   This particular legislation continues to want to add aggravating  factors, making it 17. If we had a hearing and if we were able to  determine that this would actually have an impact, there would be  reason to at least have a vigorous debate over whether there is an  impact or not.   But H.R. 115 is a duplicative bill and unnecessary because under 18  U.S.C. 3592(c), there already exists mechanisms that achieve the goal  of punishing by death a defendant who kills a law enforcement officer  or first responder.   First of all, it should be stated that the bill is based upon  underlying offenses, drug offenses. There is a whole myriad of actual  laws that are Federal criminal offenses, and if a death occurs under  that Federal criminal offense, then you are eligible for the death  penalty.   Let me cite as an example the Boston Marathon terrorists act and the  killing of the MIT officer who was killed. The Federal prosecutor was  able to take that case to the Federal court and to pursue a death  penalty because it was pursuant to a terrorist act.    The most heinous tragedy of those who were lost in  9/11, the mourning of firefighters, first responders, and law  enforcement who lost their lives, certainly there is no doubt that that  was a heinous terrorist act. If those terrorists had lived--there would  have been firefighters and first responders included, and their deaths  would have been, in essence, tried under the Federal death penalty; and  those heinous perpetrators would have been tried, given capital  punishment, if the jury had convicted them--there probably was no  doubt--and ultimately might have seen their end through the exercise of  the death penalty.   That is, I think, clearing up that we are standing here adding any  measure of difference to this particular legislation. If the act falls  under Federal criminal laws, you can be, or the murderer of you can be,  in fact, charged with a Federal death penalty.   On the other hand, if you go into a burning building and,  unfortunately, the owner of the building--or there is some unfortunate  incident and you are shot as a firefighter, you do not fall under this  statute. That is not a Federal offense, but you can fall under your  State death penalty cases.   Why would we be concerned about this idea of additional death  penalties?   Let me cite for you the case of Buck v. Davis, where the death  penalty verdict was based merely on whether the defendant is likely to  commit acts of violence in the future, and a psychologist opined that  being Black did increase the probability. The trial court reasoned  that: ``introduction of any mention of race was de minimis.'' In other  words, insignificant, completely ignoring that the largest number of  individuals that go to their death are African Americans. Thank  goodness for the Supreme Court and the reasoning of Chief Justice  Roberts.    Justice Roberts stated for the court in reversing  the lower court: ``Some toxins can be deadly in small doses.''   Likewise, in the Gregg v. Georgia case, decided after Furman, the  court held that if death penalty is mandatory, such that no permission  for mercy is granted, and where capital punishment is based on  characteristics of the offender, then it is unconstitutional and  ``arbitrary and capricious.''   The underlying bill has mandatory death penalties. It will cover  first responders if they are killed pursuant to Federal crimes. We are  standing here, not adding anything to the underlying bill. First  responders are protected. Law enforcement are protected.   I would hate to see any of them lose their life, but under a Federal  crime, their case will be tried as a death penalty case. In other  instances, it will be tried by State law. We respect these heroes and  sheroes. It is shameful if we use that to add another aggravating  element to the death penalty, and continue to discriminate based on  race.   Mr. Speaker, I would ask my colleagues to oppose this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I want to first acknowledge and commend the law  enforcement community throughout our country that work tirelessly to  help protect and serve our communities.   I especially want to thank Chief Acevedo for his leadership,  commitment to Houston, and for his vision on unifying communities  through police relations with the people they take an oath to serve and  protect.   As we celebrate police week, I would like to take a moment to thank  and honor all the officers that served selflessly and died in the line  of duty.   Especially, Assistant Deputy Chief Clinton Greenwood of Harris County  Constable's Office-Precinct 3, TX, died on 4/3/17;   Officer Richard K. Martin of Houston Police Dept., died on 5/18/15;   Deputy Sheriff of Harris County Sheriff office, Darren Goforth, 8/28/ 15;   And Detective Jerry Ronald Walker of Little Elm Police Dept., TX,  died 1/17/17 and the five officers killed in Dallas, TX on 7/7/16-- Brent Thompson, Sgt. Michael Smith, Sr. Corporal Lorne Ahrens, Officer  Patrick Zamarripa, and Officer Michael Krol.   Additionally, I would like to acknowledge Houston's former Chief, Lee  P. Brown who laid the strong foundation for HPD's strong community  liaison practices with all communities; Harris County Sheriff Ed  Gonzalez; Alan Rosen, Harris County Constable, Precinct 1 and all of  our other men and women in uniform.   I know personally the level of stress and challenges posed, because I  have many friends that have and are currently serving my Congressional  district in Houston and our country very well and with great  distinction.   I support our policies that are necessary, so long as we are doing so  with fairness, in accordance with our Constitution, and in a manner  that is not duplicative of statutory measures already in place.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 115 imposes the death penalty for the killing or  targeting of law enforcement officers, firefighters, and first  responders as a 17th aggravated factor for homicide.   Although this bill is presented as a proposal to protect police  officers and first responders, it does much more.  [[Page H4338]]    H.R. 115 is duplicative and unnecessary because under 18 U.S.C.  3592(c), there already exists mechanisms that achieve the goal of  punishing by death, a defendant who kills a law enforcement officer or  first responders.   Prosecutors are already armed with prosecutorial discretion to seek  capital punishment in death penalty cases as demonstrated in the cases  below:   U.S. v. Ronell Wilson--2 NY City detectives were killed during a gun  sting operation. Defendant was sentenced to death.   U.S. v. Donzell McCauley--a Washington, DC police officer was killed  and defendant received a sentence of life without parole.   U.S. v. Kenneth Wilk--a deputy sheriff was killed while attempting to  serve a search warrant; defendant was sentenced to life without parole.   U.S. v. Kenneth Barrett--a state law enforcement officer was killed  during a drug raid, defendant was sentenced to death.   LaShawn Casey, an undercover police officer was killed in a  carjacking related to a drug transaction; a capital jury sentenced the  defendant to life without the possibility of parole.   These cases illustrate that prosecutors have the discretion under the  current law to seek the death penalty. By adding a 17th aggravated  factor under the vague, arbitrary and capricious language of H.R. 115,  we are heading down a dangerous path.   Please take note that the death toll of firefighters/first responders  reported by the National Fire Protection Association illustrates a  drastic decline in deaths overall, most of which were fire and accident  related.   The statistics available do not support the need for this duplicative  measure in H.R. 115.   This bill does nothing to protect our law enforcement or to ensure  public safety; instead, it raises constitutional questions as to its  validity because ``targeting law enforcement'' is substantially vague  language that will subject many innocent lives to death, based purely  on their desire to exercise their First Amendment rights about the  well-documented racial disparity in treatment throughout our  communities.   We must ensure that we do not create legislation of broad scope and  vagueness that will have a chilling effect on an insular group.   H.R. 115 is laced with a discriminatory effect that will trigger  strict scrutiny under the 14th Amendment, and open the gateway for  draconian habeas laws.   This bill will create a slippery slope, further adding to recent  turbulence caused by Attorney General Jeff Session's memo and  destroying whatever trust remains between law enforcement and  communities.   This bill sends troubling messages around the world about how we view  and measure life in America in this 21st century.   It is time to get serious about this epidemic and not hide behind  vague language because `all' lives matter, blue, black, brown, white.   Mr. Speaker, while some may say that any adverse effects of the bill  before us are de minimis, and thus, will not severely impact the racial  disparity found in the use of the death penalty, it is neither the  amount of words in this bill nor the amount of time used to utter them  that is significant; rather, it is the discriminatory effect that will  result in communities disproportionately impacted by the death penalty.   Let us take for example, the case of Buck v. Davis, 580 U.S. __  (2017) where the death penalty verdict was based merely on `whether  defendant is likely to commit acts of violence in the future' and a  psychologist opined that being black did increase the probability. The  trial court reasoned that ``introduction of any mention of race was de  minimis,'' in other words, insignificant.   As Chief Justice John Roberts stated for the Court in reversing the  lower court; ``Some toxins can be deadly in small doses.''   Likewise, in Gregg v. GA, which was decided after Furman (invalidated  death penalty across the country), the court held if death penalty is  mandatory, such that no permission for mercy is granted, and where  capital punishment is based on characteristics of the offender, then it  is unconstitutional and ``arbitrary and capricious.''   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 115 is extremely deadly because it is arbitrary and  capricious, imposing the death penalty based solely on the status of  the victim.   The death penalty is already available both at the state and federal  level and is reserved for matters of extraordinary circumstances.   While we want to ensure that law enforcement officers, firefighters  and first responders received protection as they protect our  communities, we cannot and should not attempt to do so by weighing the  worth of lives and arbitrarily impose the death penalty based on our  measuring sticks of who should live and who should die.   H.R. 115 will undoubtedly contribute to the continuation of well- documented and pervasive racial disparities in the imposition of the  death penalty.   Since 1976 only 20 white prisoners have been executed for the murder  of an African American victim, while an alarming 286 African American  prisoners have been executed for the death of white victims, and 42% of  African Americans currently remain on death row.   Death penalty generally, has been criticized over the years by legal  scholars and by Supreme Court Justices who have opined in several  instances, that `the death penalty violates the Eighth Amendment, which  prohibits cruel and unusual punishment.'   Even in 1958, when the Court first explicitly spoke about the death  penalty as having constitutional challenges, it said in Trop v. Dulles,  ``the Eighth Amendment's Cruel and Unusual Punishment clause must draw  its meaning from the `evolving standards of decency that mark the  progress of a maturing society' rather than from its original  meaning.''   Mr. Speaker, there is no argument that we have evolved and matured  significantly since we first implemented the death penalty in the 1600s  and thus, we must evaluate cautiously, laws that seek to further  advance this flawed, astronomically costly and unjust practice.   Tax payers currently spend $740,000 for cases without the death  penalty, while cases where the death penalty is sought cost $1.26  million. Maintaining each death row prisoner costs taxpayers $90,000  more per year than a prisoner in general population.   Capital punishment does not work; it is discriminatory and is used  disproportionately against the poor, minorities and members of racial,  ethnic and religious communities.   Since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976,  82% of all executions have occurred in the South (37% in Texas alone),  which contributed to the United States status as one of five countries  in the world to account for the most executions in 2012.   FBI data has shown that the death penalty is not a deterrent and in  fact, 14 states without capital punishment in 2008, had homicide rates  at or below the national rate.   Taking another life does not stop violence.   Like mandatory minimums, public opinion for the death penalty is  currently at its lowest with a 42% opposition, evidenced in a 2016 Pew  Research report, which found that the U.S. now dropped to number seven  worldwide in countries accountable for the most executions.   Mr. Speaker, over two-thirds of the world's countries have abolished  the death penalty either in law or practice, and the U.S. is the only  Western country that still uses the death penalty.   Even family members of murder victims and other individuals who have  witnessed live executions of death row inmates, particularly, in the  recent botched and questionable executions, have called for a repeal of  this practice and ask instead for alternative sentencing.   In fact the death penalty solves nothing, and may even perpetuate the  suffering of the parents, children, or siblings left behind.   We do not need to expand the use of the death penalty where public  opinion is at its lowest, but instead, implement sound and practical  legislation that will save lives of our officers and the people they  serve.   This measure is what public opinion suggests.    Mr. Speaker, I think it is clear that we are all in  support of the protection of our officers. I think that there is no  competition on sympathy or wanting to appropriately assure that those  who go up against our officers in a vile and violent manner would be  brought to justice.   I think the point on race disparity as relates to the death penalty  is relevant. It is about life. But I want to make it very clear: Under  this underlying bill, our officers who are State police officers are  protected already, including the example that I used about the MIT  officer in the Boston Marathon terrorist act. It is if you are in the  furtherance of a Federal crime. The bill itself is all Federal. You  have to be engaged in an act that is a Federal crime.   Clearly, if the terrorists on 9/11 had lived, the cases of the  firefighters who lost their lives certainly would have been tried-- those cases of the tragic, heinous deaths of firefighters who are our  friends, and certainly are my friends--under the Federal death penalty  law.   In the case of U.S. v. Kenneth Barrett, a State law enforcement  officer was killed during a drug raid. That is one of the underlying  offenses. The defendant was sentenced to death.   In the case of Lashaun Casey, an undercover police officer was killed  in a carjacking related to a drug transaction. A capital jury decided  to sentence the defendant to life without the possibility of parole,  but it was a capital jury.    And so I want to honor them, too, but I also want to  show the disparities.   Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize the very valuable point that Chief  Justice Roberts made in the particular case of Buck v. Davis and the  statistical documentation of the disparities in the death penalty  cases. We cannot ignore it.   Chief Justice Roberts stated before the Court, in reversing the lower  court, ``some toxins can be deadly in small doses,'' when the district  court wanted to ignore or diminish the fact that race was involved in  this case.   A psychologist had the audacity to say that being Black did increase  the probability that you would commit an act of violence prospectively.  How sad is that?   We are saddened by the death of our officers, but we are already  protecting them and the first responders. Pursuant to a Federal  criminal act, the prosecutor, at their discretion, can charge the  defendant with a death penalty case.   I just hope my colleagues will recognize that we are not divided in  our love, affection, and respect for the men and women that serve as  first responders and law enforcement throughout this Nation.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman  from Maryland and the distinguished gentlewoman from Washington. Just  by coincidence, Mr. Speaker, all three of us are members of the  Judiciary Committee and had a very vigorous constitutional discussion  this morning in a hearing on the responsibilities of the Judiciary  Committee and, as well, the responsibilities of this Congress to the  American people.   I think many of us offered our comments in the context that we did  not speak as a Democrat or a Republican, though we are here on this  floor as members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. We really  spoke to our views and commitment as Americans.   Having served in this House for a period of time where I have seen  the Judiciary Committee engage vigorously in impeachment proceedings  for judges and Presidents, I know that the role of the Judiciary  Committee is to be assured that the government--the executive, the  legislature, the judiciary--works within the context of the  Constitution.   So that is the spirit and the position in which I rise this evening:  to share a few thoughts and to recount for our Members why this is a  week that requires further oversight and insight and further assessment  of whether the actions of the Oval Office, the executive--in this  instance, the White House--have really complied with the Constitution  of the United States.   I would, first of all, indicate that much of what I will say I will  qualify and say that the President, or a President, or any President,  would have the authority to do. So although, for example, the FBI  Director is given a 10-year term, the individual serves at the will of  the President of the United States of America. That means that  President Trump, President Obama, President Bush, President Clinton,  and others would have the authority to fire this particular individual  as they would have the right to fire Cabinet officers and others. They  have the right to fire the Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney  General, which may be one of the concerns we now have as we proceed to  try to get to the facts of just a whole litany of issues.   Let me recount for you, as I discuss the firing of Director Comey,  that in the last couple of days we have discerned that the Trump  campaign operatives spoke to Russian operatives, Russian Government  officials, 18 times in the last 7 months of the campaign.   We are well aware that the former NSA Director, something I think we,  as Members of Congress--I will speak for myself--have never heard of in  the tenure that I have been privileged to serve in the United States  Congress, that an individual who was advising the President of the  United States not in the form of a lobbyist, but in the form of an  adviser in national security issues, was being paid by a foreign  country.   So the advice that was given, two different recommendations: one, to  drag out and throw to an unknowing future a Turkish citizen who is  here, who has been involved in a number of schools and good charitable  work, who lives in Pennsylvania; one of his recommendations was to  throw this individual who is statused, not undocumented, out into the  hands of the present President of Turkey, who has been known over the  years, recently, to deny political and religious rights and human  rights. That was one recommendation.    The second recommendation, whether you liked it or disliked it, was  to not arm the Kurds to help with the fight in Syria. That advice was  given, both of those proposals as advice were given while General Flynn  was on the payroll of a foreign government.   So you would have to wonder in the series of incidents how we have  come to the point where the FBI Director, who was actively engaged in  investigating--or the FBI, investigating General Flynn, as were  congressional committees--General Flynn is now under a subpoena by, I  believe, the Senate Intelligence Committee. All of that, all of those  elements certainly respond that the Congress and the FBI were engaged  in active investigations. I think the American people understand that.   The American people understand that if their chief of police was  engaged in an active investigation of murder, one that the whole  community was just outraged about, as any murder, as all the homicides  that take place in a community that you desire to be safe, and one  local elected official indicated that you are investigating my neighbor  or you are investigating me and had the authority to fire the chief of  police with the reason of one thing and then it became very clear that  you were firing the chief of police who was actively engaged in a  murder investigation that was going to help the whole community find  the truth and bring the perpetrator to justice, you fired that police  [[Page H4347]]  chief because it was either you that was being investigated, local  elected official, or it was your neighbor that was being investigated,  you just took it upon yourself to cease and desist of that  investigation, and that is a simple explanation of what has happened  here in Washington.   Because Washington is big, because this government is huge, because  it is the leader of the free world, because all the nations look up to  it gives it no greater authority to stop an active investigation that  is based upon the duties of the FBI, but also the laws of this land,  and that is just what happened. Director Comey was unceremoniously  fired; a man who has had great tenure in law enforcement as an attorney  and prosecutor and, now, over the FBI.   Of course, the so-called explanation--which, by the way, has just  been repeated in the last 45 minutes on international television,  saying the same thing, that his firing was based upon Deputy Attorney  General Rosenstein's representation in a memorandum that many of us  question that gave a whole explanation of the incidents regarding  former Secretary Clinton, which, of course, she was not found to have  warranted any further review or investigation or prosecution. But that  was what was used by President Trump just in the last, as I said, 30 to  45 minutes, when we know that the Deputy Attorney General has already  denied that he was the cause and center of the firing of FBI Director  Comey, yet it is still being repeated over and over and over and over  again.   You would also know that not only did he deny--and we look forward to  hearing him tomorrow, the House Members, as the Senate has already  heard him. What he also indicated, or what was also said to vindicate  him, is that the President came out on last Thursday with interviews  with Lester Holt on NBC News that it wasn't anybody but him, and it was  connected to this fake Russian thing. I am paraphrasing. I may not have  all of the words.   So you have an executive that, one could analyze in a number of court  decisions, may have been credited with an abuse of power. There was no  legitimate failing in the work of Director Comey on this Russian  investigation.   Just 30 to 45 minutes ago, another comment that was made is that he  was unpopular, and that he did very, very poorly in the hearings last  week. None of those are elements of dismissal. Maybe reprimand, maybe  study a little bit more before you go to Senatorial hearings or House  hearings, but that has nothing to do with being fired.   I don't know whether any of us want, every single day, as we make  very tough decisions in this House, that we are assessed on whether or  not we are very popular. What we want to do is do what is right for the  American people. And whatever you might say, I assume Director Comey  felt that he was doing what is right for the American people.   Many disagreed with his handling and assessment of the issues dealing  with former Secretary Clinton, particularly in the October surprise.  That is legitimate. But it is not legitimate to say, way past that  incident and when this individual is actively engaged--and there is no  question or no guarantee that, in spite of our displeasure as  Democrats, if the Office of the Presidency had gone the other way that  Director Comey would be fired. There was no suggestion of that, none  whatsoever, even with disagreeing with actions.    But here we have not only the misrepresentation of the reason, but  the declaration that the reason was because of this Russian thing.   Let me share with you the comments of Professor Tribe in a Washington  Post article on May 13, 2017, as he recounts the whole issue of this  action bearing upon the actions that are in the Constitution, such as  impeachment, that relate to the questions of whether or not the  Presidency or the President has acted appropriately:   ``The question of Russian interference in the Presidential election  and possible collusion with the Trump campaign go to the heart of our  system and ability to conduct free and fair elections.''   Therefore, it was free. It was what we do.   ``Consider, too, how Trump embroiled Deputy Attorney General Rod J.  Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, despite Sessions'  recusal from involvement in the Russia investigation, in preparing  admittedly phony justifications for the firing on which Trump had  already decided. Consider how Trump used the Vice President and White  House staff to propagate a set of blatant untruths--before giving an  interview to NBC's Lester Holt that exposed his true motivation.   ``Trump accompanied that confession with self-serving--and manifestly  false--assertions about having been assured by Comey that Trump himself  was not under investigation. By Trump's own account, he asked Comey  about his investigative status even as he was conducting the equivalent  of a job interview in which Comey sought to retain his position as a  Director.''   So I believe that what we have here is a reasonable basis, those of  us who have come to the floor tonight, to raise these questions and to  be able to make sure that we do have a system of laws and that we do  adhere to the rule of law.                                time  1715    We know that, subsequently, the Deputy Attorney General has appointed  a special counsel under the provisions of the Attorney General. Of  course, that individual could be fired. The regulation could be  dismantled. But we hope that former Director Mueller of the FBI, who  has impeccable credentials, will go forward and ensure that the  American people know the truth.   That will be one part of it. I repeat, that will be one part of it.  But, as I look at my closing remarks here, I want to ensure that we  know that this is not something that is made up; that it continues to  shock us, and it shocks the American people. It is not a made-up  entity. It just continues with a long list of incidents, starting from  the firing and then going up.   A comment Bill Moyers said: ``The ensuing White House cover-up tries  to pin the blame on a newly confirmed Deputy Attorney General whose  hastily prepared memo criticizes Comey's 2016 statements. . . .''   But the late summer of 2015, a member of Trump's campaign staff  called Lieutenant General Mike Flynn to ask if he is willing to meet  with Trump. Trump agrees. Later Flynn says, four other Presidential  candidates also reached out to him. There is a long list of items that  may be true, may not be true, but clearly set a pattern, a pattern of  the achilles heels of this Oval Office.   And so I would say to my colleagues that we should not turn a blind  eye on this. I believe it is important to follow the facts. I have no  quarrel with that. But neither am I afraid to use the term  appropriately, an impeachment inquiry, but at least to find the facts  of whether or not any of the actions that swirled around Director  Comey, that swirled around General Flynn's and Director Comey's or the  FBI's investigation of this particular series of incidents are in  keeping with the responsibilities of the Congress, the Judiciary, in  any elements there, or the Oval Office, the Presidency of the United  States of America.   I think that the special prosecutor, for Americans to understand,  deals specifically with pursuing or possible criminal acts. On the  other hand, it is well known that the Congress can address how we fix  this; how we make sure it doesn't happen again; how we work on behalf  of the American people.   And so I hope that, as we conclude this Special Order, no one will  point to any of the Members on this floor as taking this up as a  personal cause against the President of the United States, or any  President, and that we will respect the office, as we have always done.  But it is our duty to shed light on these issues and shed light on  these potential failures. It is our responsibility to take up the cause  of curing, responding, fixing, and serving the American people.
