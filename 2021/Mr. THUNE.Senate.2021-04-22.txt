 Mr. President, today we are wrapping up consideration of  the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act. Next week the majority leader has  indicated the Senate will take up the Drinking Water and Wastewater  Infrastructure Act of 2021. These are both bipartisan pieces of  legislation.   The COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act was an initially partisan bill that has  now been improved by input from Republicans and I expect will receive  strong bipartisan support on final passage.   The Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act has been 100  percent bipartisan from the very beginning. Senators Duckworth and  Capito developed this legislation, along with Democratic Senators  Carper and Cardin and Republican Senators Lummis and Cramer. The  legislation went through regular committee consideration and was  reported out of the Environment and Public Works Committee to the full  Senate with a unanimous vote. It is a model of how we should work here  in the Senate.   Mr. President, after a very partisan start to this Congress, with  Democrats and the President steamrolling through a massive, partisan  COVID bill packed with non-COVID-related priorities, it is encouraging  to see the Senate working the way it should: Senators from both parties  talking, negotiating, coming together to work out legislation that both  parties can support.   It is particularly encouraging to see the Drinking Water and  Wastewater bill--a bipartisan effort from start to finish and a too- rare example of legislation that went through the committee process,  which should be our goal for most bills in the Senate. I hope this  trend will continue.   Democrats want the Senate to take up infrastructure legislation in  the near future--a goal that Republicans support. What we don't support  is Democrats' threat to shove through another massive, partisan bill-- this time on infrastructure--using reconciliation rules to ensure  Republicans don't have a voice in the legislation.    The Senate was designed to promote moderation and consensus. It was  intended to be a check on the more partisan--or as the Founders would  put it, factious--House of Representatives. The Senate fulfills its  constitutional role best when it engages in serious, bipartisan  consideration and negotiation and ensures that Members of both parties  are heard. This is the framework we should adopt for infrastructure.   I am encouraged by President Biden's decision to meet with  Republicans to discuss infrastructure legislation. Republicans have now  met with the President at least twice, and more meetings are expected.  I anticipate meeting with the President and other Senators soon to  discuss broadband infrastructure priorities. I hope we can reach  bipartisan agreement on priorities in this area, including closing the  digital divide by increasing broadband access in rural America and  removing obstacles to digital infrastructure deployment. I know it can  be done.   When I served as chairman of the Commerce Committee, for example, we  passed bipartisan legislation that reduced the redtape associated with  building broadband networks. I introduced bipartisan legislation to  accelerate 5G infrastructure deployment. There was a lot of bipartisan  agreement to be found on infrastructure in general.   Congress has a history of bipartisan collaboration on infrastructure  legislation. Our last major infrastructure bill, the FAST Act, went  through regular order and several committees, including the one I led  at the time, and was supported by both Democrats and Republicans, and  it was a remarkably successful bill.   Not long thereafter, our committee spearheaded enactment of the  largest reauthorization of the FAA since the early 1980s, including  critical programs to improve airport infrastructure.   Last Congress, the Environment and Public Works Committee here in the  Senate developed bipartisan infrastructure legislation.   There is no reason that we shouldn't reach bipartisan agreement on  another substantial piece of infrastructure legislation. Senator Capito  and other Republicans will be releasing a Republican proposal today  that will reflect a lot of the bipartisan infrastructure priorities. I  hope that after she releases this proposal, Democrats and Republicans  will be able to sit down and engage in serious negotiation on our two  plans.   Our Founders established a democratic republic instead of a pure  democracy because they wanted to balance majority rule with protection  for minority rights. They knew that majorities could be tyrants, so  they wove protection for minority rights into our system of government.  The Senate was one of those protections. That is why we should be  preserving rules like the filibuster, which ensures that the minority  party and the many Americans it represents have a voice in legislation.   It is always important that the minority party's voice be heard and  the Senate engage in bipartisan negotiation and discussion, but it  should be especially obvious that in a 50-50 Senate, any major  legislation should be bipartisan. If one thing is for sure, it is that  a 50-50 Senate is not a mandate for one side to force through its  agenda unchecked.   It is absurd for Senate Democrats or House Democrats to pretend they  have a mandate for a partisan revolution. Yet much of the legislation  that they have been pushing since taking office appears to have been  drafted by Members of the extreme left wing of their party.   In his inauguration address, President Biden appeared to recognize  the bipartisan character of his mandate and his obligation to work with  Members of both parties and promote unity in the country.  Unfortunately, to date, his administration has not delivered on that  promise of bipartisan leadership. As I said, I am encouraged that it  appears he may be changing that when it comes to infrastructure. I hope  the Senate and House Democrats will follow his lead.   The ball is in Democrats' court. We can pass a substantial,  bipartisan infrastructure bill, or Democrats can continue down the  extremely partisan path that they have been pursuing. For the sake of  our country, Mr. President, I hope they will choose bipartisanship.   I yield the floor.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Utah (Mr. Lee).
