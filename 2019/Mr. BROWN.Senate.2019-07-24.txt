 Will the Senator from Pennsylvania yield?    Mr. President, I appreciate Senator Casey's advocacy for  disabled Americans and for children especially.   I just want to make a brief comment, for I know he has some other  comments to make, on his support for Medicaid and on the efforts that  we have made together on the Finance Committee in fighting against  President Trump's attacks on Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act.   I know, in my State, the expansion of Medicaid and what came out of  that meant that 900,000 more people had insurance, including a whole  lot of people who were disabled. I know that Pennsylvania is the same  way. So I thank Senator Casey.
