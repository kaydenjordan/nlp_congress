 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and advocacy  of Reverend Dr. Randolph Bracy, Jr., a true giant and selfless servant  in our central Florida community who transitioned this past weekend.   Reverend Dr. Bracy was an educator, a pastor, a husband, father,  organizer, and true community leader. The former president of the  Orange County NAACP, Reverend Dr. Bracy was on the front lines and in  the fight for justice and equity for all Floridians.   Through his faith and love of God, Reverend Dr. Bracy devoted his  life to serving and seeing the world through the eyes of the most  vulnerable. He truly woke up every day with the commitment of loving  our neighbors and leaving our State a better place.   Mr. Speaker, I send my deep condolences to the entire Bracy family as  his passing has left a huge hole in our hearts and in the central  Florida community. In his memory, we continue to fight for the better  world that we all deserve. May he rest in power.                            ____________________
