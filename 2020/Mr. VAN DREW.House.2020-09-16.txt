 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 3659, Danny's Law, bipartisan  legislation that would establish an antibullying roundtable to examine  bullying in elementary and secondary schools in the United States.   One-third of the world's youth are bullied. This is a saddening  statistic.   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, students  who are bullied are more likely to experience low self-esteem and  isolation, perform poorly in school, have fewer friends, have a  negative view of academics, and experience physical symptoms and mental  health issues.   We all agree that no child should be bullied in any school, and as  elected representatives, we are in a position to coordinate on our  efforts to support our schools in preventing such mistreatments.   The legislation before us today is named in honor of Daniel  Fitzpatrick, a 13-year-old boy who tragically died by suicide in August  2016 after being bullied by his peers.   Before taking his own life, Daniel wrote a note to his family  detailing the struggles he faced with bullying and the lack of response  by his teachers. This is heartbreaking, and it is unacceptable.   Unfortunately, devastating stories like Daniel's are becoming far too  common throughout our country and have lasting impacts on American  families and our communities.   Today, we are here to act.   Under Danny's Law, Members of Congress and the Secretary of Education  will appoint 15 individuals representing a variety of community members  with insight into bullying and its effects on children. These parents,  school leaders, teachers, school security, and psychologists will serve  on an antibullying roundtable to consult with State and local  educational agencies regarding the growing issue of bullying and to  discuss prevention measures to reduce its increasing toll on our  Nation's youth.   By addressing the mistreatment and harassment of school-age children,  we can help create a safe learning environment for students. They are  our future. We have a vested interest in giving families, schools, and  communities the tools they need to shape young Americans to be  successful leaders.   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for  taking action to combat bullying in our Nation's elementary and  secondary schools, and I urge a ``yes'' vote on H.R. 3659 for children  like Danny and millions of others who face bullying every single day.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no other speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Today, we are here for one reason, and that is to take action to  ensure that children like Danny never feel as if they have nowhere to  turn. No child should be subject to cruel treatment from his or her  peers under any circumstances, especially in the classroom. H.R. 3659,  Danny's Law, is a unified effort to combat bullying and to ensure  students have a safe and healthy environment to learn and to grow.   I would like to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for  taking a stand against bullying for our Nation's children. I strongly  urge a ``yes'' vote on H.R. 3659 so we can move this bill swiftly  through the legislative process and to President Trump's desk for  signature.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise today in strong support of H.R. 8162, the 21st Century  Community Learning Centers Coronavirus Relief Act, bipartisan  legislation that expresses Congress' support for actions the Department  of Education is taking to expand access to in-person care and academic  support for students during the COVID-19 pandemic.   The 2020-2021 school year looks very different for parents, teachers,  and students. Schools are operating on varying schedules of in-person,  remote, and hybrid instruction to ensure that students remain safe  while not falling behind academically.   Most students will be saddled with the challenges of beginning a new  year of school while making up for lost learning caused by the  disruptions from COVID-19.   Working parents of school-aged children face unique challenges during  the pandemic. Finding childcare when in-person instruction is not  offered has become a burdensome task for many families, especially low- income families.   If these hardworking families aren't able to return to work, our  Nation's economic recovery will be severely impeded. Today, we are here  to address this growing problem by passing the bipartisan 21st Century  Community Learning Centers Coronavirus Relief Act.   The 21st Century Community Learning Center, CCLC, program, is a  federally funded after-school program. The grantees are locally  operated, often by school districts and community-based organizations,  and primarily serve students attending schools with high concentrations  of low-income families.   Students at 21st CCLCs participate in academic and enrichment  programs, receive support services such as tutoring and mentoring, and  their families are encouraged to actively participate in their  children's studies.   Since after-school program staff have established relationships with  students and have experience providing supportive services, they are  uniquely qualified to assist students during the 2020-2021 school year.   Under current law, 21st CCLCs must operate during ``non-school  hours,'' such as before and after school or during summer breaks. The  Department of Education announced plans to address this by offering  waivers to States to allow 21st CCLCs to expand their hours of  operation during the 2020-2021 school year.   The legislation under consideration today expresses Congress' support  for the Department of Education to grant flexibility for 21st CCLCs to  operate outside of this year's constraint for the upcoming school year.   With these new flexibilities, 21st CCLCs will be able to provide  programming during regular school hours and offer in-person care to  students who cannot be in school throughout the regular day. Further,  21st CCLCs will be able to serve students in person or virtually in  order to better accommodate the various needs of the families during  the year.   I thank Representative Wild for leading this important legislation,  and I strongly urge a ``yes'' vote on H.R. 8162.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Madam Speaker, working parents across the country are currently  grappling with the challenge of finding affordable childcare as COVID- 19-related school closures force many students to stay home. Parents  are eager to return to work, but without reliable, affordable childcare  options, students, workers, and the economy will be impacted  significantly.   H.R. 8162, the bipartisan 21st Century Community Learning Centers  Coronavirus Relief Act, supports the Department of Education's efforts  to extend a commonsense solution that will help parents return to the  workforce by increasing access to safe, supportive environments for  students. By giving 21st CCLCs greater flexibility to provide normal  programming during school hours and in-person care to students during  the regular school day, parents can return to work with peace of mind,  knowing that their children are in good hands and not falling behind  academically.   Again, Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Wild for introducing  this legislation. I strongly urge a ``yes'' vote on H.R. 8162, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the special  education staff at Mainland Regional High School in Linwood in South  Jersey.   After being given approval by the State and the health department,  students went back to school this summer after being gone since March  13 because of coronavirus. The students received instruction in  English, math, social-emotional skills, and physical education and  health.   The education and instruction that these students received was much- needed and was greatly appreciated by the students and the educators  alike. Students were able to receive face-to-face instruction, which  for some students is the key to their success.   Thank you to the educators, assistants, and administrators for being  so engaged and involved in the success of our students. It is  appreciated. It is very much appreciated. You are appreciated. You are  very much appreciated.   Thank you for all that you do and what you continue to do for our  community. May God bless you and God bless all those students.                            ____________________
