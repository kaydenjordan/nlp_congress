 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Biggs) for yielding me the time.   Lawlessness has broken out across our Nation. It is absolutely  outrageous, and it has to be stopped. Mobs are taking over parts of the  city of Seattle. They took over a police precinct.   Just last Saturday, people were shot, and one man was killed.  Criminals are looting stores and businesses all over the Nation,  including in Arizona in the upscale Scottsdale Fashion Square.  Protestors are throwing bricks at police officers. They are throwing  water bottles at police officers. And I have seen them shine  flashlights right up close into the police officers' eyes and call them  all kinds of names. Rioters are burning the flag, the American flag.  And the Lincoln Memorial and World War II Memorial have been defaced.   Madam Speaker, a few days ago, St. Serra, the patron saint of peace,  was torn down in San Francisco.   Francis Scott Key's statue was torn down.   The statue of Ulysses Grant, who was the general for the Union was  torn down by thugs in San Francisco.                                time  1730    And then we saw the other night how they were trying so hard, these  criminals, to tear down the statue in Lafayette Park. And they almost  had it torn down, if it wasn't for the Trump administration sending in  the National Guard to stop.   And do you know what they wrote and spray-painted on that statue,  that Federal statue? ``Killer scum.''   Does any of this show tribute to George Floyd? No.   Does any of this help? Absolutely not.   Now, I was really surprised to see that one of our colleagues,  Congresswoman Norton, who is a nonvoting Member but represents  Washington, D.C., has introduced legislation to have a statue of  Abraham Lincoln taken down, a statue that was funded by the freed  slaves.   What has our country come to? We need to return to a semblance of  civility in our country. And so that is why I call on Democrat-run  cities to clamp down on these criminals. No more autonomous zones. No  more looting. No more destructing statues. Let's bring back law and  order.   That is why I stand with President Trump and his calls to arrest and  prosecute criminals. Let's stop the lawlessness. Let's try to heal our  country.
