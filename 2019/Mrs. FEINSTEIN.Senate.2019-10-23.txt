 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business, please.    Mr. President, the Senate this week is honoring our  former colleague, Senator Ted Stevens, with the unveiling of his  official portrait. I come to the floor to say some words about a friend  and former chairman.   Ted Stevens' life in public service started early when he joined the  Army Corps in 1943. So great was his desire to serve our country that  he joined after attending just one semester of college. During the war,  he flew dangerous, unescorted missions in China and India, earning two  Distinguished Flying Crosses for flights behind enemy lines. After the  war, he returned to his studies and graduated from UCLA and Harvard Law  School. Not long after that, he moved to Alaska to practice law, and  there he began a life of service to the State he called home for the  rest of his life.   Ted served as a district attorney and became known for accompanying  U.S. Marshals on raids, and that was really an early hint of his  temperament and intensity on the job. Of course, all Senators devote  their careers to their States, but few have the distinction of working  to achieve statehood. Senator Stevens was one of them. Working in the  Department of Interior in the 1950s, he became known as ``Mr. Alaska''  for his focus on achieving statehood. He worked tirelessly to assuage  the concerns of then-President Eisenhower to get statehood passed  through both the House and the Senate.    When the Alaska Statehood Act finally passed, Ted returned to Alaska  and served as a representative in the State House, becoming majority  leader after just one term. Then, in 1968, he came to the Senate, where  he would go on to serve for 40 years.   Once here, he distinguished himself as a fierce advocate for Alaska.  He fought relentlessly for funding to build rural hospitals, highways,  courts, and military bases across the State he helped create. His  efforts only increased when he ascended to the powerful chairmanship of  the Appropriations Committee. He often quipped that being such a young  State, Alaska needed extra help to catch up to its elder siblings; and  help is exactly what he secured. One estimate says he steered more than  $3.4 billion in Federal funding to Alaskan projects in just the last 14  years of his tenure.   Those of us who served with him on the Appropriations Committee got  to know Ted's Incredible Hulk tie, which he would wear on days with  especially difficult debates. He was a fighter and a fierce advocate  for his State and his party. When a reporter once asked about his  reputation for losing his temper, Senator Stevens replied:         I didn't lose my temper. I know right where it is.    But he would also cross party lines and work side by side with his  appropriations colleagues, especially Bob Byrd and Daniel Inouye. They  would trade the gavel between them, serving as chair and ranking member  of subcommittees and the full committee.   Beyond Federal funding, Stevens settled many longstanding issues that  faced his young State. Chief among them was the settling of Tribal land  claims. The Alaskan Native Claims Settlement Act would become the  largest land settlement claim in U.S. history. It was hailed as  groundbreaking for its involvement of Alaskan Native communities from  the outset.   Always with an eye to the future, Ted Stevens not only supported  Native leaders in asserting land claims, but he also supported economic  development measures in the final bill.   Personally, I remain thankful for Ted's support with the Ten-in-Ten  Fuel  [[Page S6065]]  Economy Act, a bill I authored in 2007 with Senators Olympia Snowe,  Maria Cantwell, Tom Carper, and others. The bill was drafted to  increase fuel economy by 10 miles per gallon within 10 years, but it  was responsible for much more. The Obama administration went on to use  the Ten-in-Ten Act to set rules that will increase fuel efficiency to  more than 50 miles per gallon by 2025 and save consumers more than $460  billion at the pump.   Here is how it got done. I couldn't get it done. It was controversial  at the time and, believe it or not, Ted Stevens played a big role in  getting this bill passed. As ranking member of the Commerce Committee,  he and Senator Inouye included the language as part of a broader energy  bill that President Bush signed into law in 2007.   So this was a big deal, and it was controversial. Senator Stevens  knew that, but he understood the importance of the issue, and he  included the language in one of his bills, and it could not have passed  any other way. It was a very big event for me, and it really sealed my  respect for this Senator from a different party, a different State; but  he cared, you could go to him, and he helped.   I remember back then. Now our mileage is going up, and I think of  Ted, when I talked to him, saying: OK. We will get it done--and he and  Dan Inouye did do that. He said: ``My motto has always been `To hell  with politics, just do what's right for Alaska.'''   I don't think anyone who had the pleasure of knowing Ted Stevens  would know him as anything other than a great legislator for the State  of Alaska and a great legislator for the United States of America.   I yield the floor.
