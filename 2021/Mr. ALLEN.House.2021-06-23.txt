 Mr. Speaker, when considering any legislation, Congress  first should determine whether the legislation is needed and, next,  whether the bill under consideration will provide a workable, feasible,  and effective response to the issue at hand.   Proponents of H.R. 2062 claim that the Supreme Court's decision in  Gross, 2009, and Nassar, 2013, have harmed workers who faced age  discrimination or unlawful retaliation. Publicly available data does  not show that the Supreme Court decisions in Gross or Nassar have  discouraged individuals from filing Equal Employment Opportunity  Commission charges of discrimination, which is a signed statement  asserting employment discrimination.                                time  1515    Unfortunately, the one subcommittee-level hearing earlier this year  in the Committee on Education and Labor on H.R. 2062 also covered  several other unrelated bills.   At the very least, this far-reaching legislation deserves more than a  cursory examination.   Furthermore, a Democrat-invited witness who testified at the hearing  in favor of H.R. 2062 acknowledged that ``it is difficult to quantify  the impact that the Gross decision has had on the number of older  workers who bring cases and the number of those who win them.''   The reality is that a review of EEOC data shows that the rate of EEOC  age discrimination charges as a percentage of all charges filed is  approximately the same for the 11 years before and after the Gross  decision.   In fact, there has been an uptick in title VII retaliation charges as  a percentage of all charges filed in the 7 years following the Nassar  decision, which does not indicate individuals have been discouraged  from filing these charges.   Court decisions show that plaintiffs have continued to win age  discrimination and title VII retaliation cases in the wake of the  Supreme Court's decisions in Gross and Nassar.   Like other Democrat-sponsored legislation in the 117th Congress, H.R.  2062 has been rushed through the committee without necessary  examination, discussion, or consideration.   We should go back to the drawing board on this bill, because H.R.  2062 begs for reliable data and evidence, thoughtful deliberation, and  genuine consideration.    Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier, when considering any  legislation, the House should first determine whether legislation is  needed and, next, whether the bill under consideration will adequately  address or improve the situation.   Before H.R. 2062 was brought to the House floor, the Committee on  Education and Labor did not have a standalone hearing on the bill and  instead held a subcommittee-level hearing on multiple, wide-ranging  topics.   This complex and sweeping legislation deserves further examination by  the committee so Members can gather more information from a variety of  experts to make an informed decision regarding its practicality.   Supporters of H.R. 2062 claim the Supreme Court's 2009 decision in  the Gross case and 2013 decision in the Nassar case have harmed workers  who faced age discrimination or unlawful retaliation for claiming  discrimination. Publicly available data does not show that the Supreme  Court decisions in the Gross or Nassar cases have discouraged  individuals from filing EEOC charges.   A Democrat-invited witness who testified acknowledged that ``it is  difficult to quantify the impact that the Gross decision has had on the  number of older workers who bring cases and the number of those who win  them.''   This witness also acknowledged that ``when we might have expected a  drop in charges due to Gross-inspired discouragement from employment  attorneys, there was a sizeable jump in the number of ADEA charges  filed with the EEOC.''   In addition, a review of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,  or EEOC, data shows that, as a percentage of all charges filed, the  rate of EEOC age discrimination charges is approximately the same as 11  years before the Gross decision, with a slightly higher percentage of  age discrimination charges filed after the Gross decision.   As a percentage of all charges filed in the 7 years following the  Nassar decision, there has also been an increase in title VII  retaliation charges, which shows that individuals have not been  discouraged from filing these charges.   Further, a review of court decisions shows that plaintiffs have  continued to win age discrimination and title VII retaliation cases in  the wake of the Supreme Court's decisions of Gross and Nassar.   Bottom line, we must ensure that before we continue to legislate on  an issue that may not need additional Washington interference, we have  accurate data.   My amendment simply states that before H.R. 2062 goes into effect,  the Government Accountability Office must conduct a study and report to  Congress on whether individuals have been discouraged from filing age  discrimination or title VII retaliation charges and from filing  lawsuits following the decisions in Gross and Nassar and whether there  have been fewer plaintiffs winning age discrimination and title VII  retaliation lawsuits.   If the GAO finds that individuals have not been discouraged from  filing charges and lawsuits, and have, in fact, won more lawsuits than  prior to the Supreme Court decisions, then the bill would not go into  effect.   Let's not put the cart before the horse. I urge my colleagues to vote  in favor of my amendment to ensure this legislation is actually needed  and adequately addresses the purported concerns of the bill's sponsors.    Mr. Speaker, again, I simply state this: My amendment says  that the Government Accountability Office must conduct a study and  report to Congress on whether individuals have been discouraged from  filing age discrimination or title VII retaliation charges and from  filing lawsuits following the decisions in Gross and Nassar, and  whether there have been fewer plaintiffs winning age discrimination and  title VII retaliation lawsuits.   We must have the data before we move in this body. We do not have  sufficient information at this point. Again, no one wants  discrimination in the workplace, but we have a justice system that  provides for relief for people who bring these cases. And I have just  cited the cases presented here today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a vote for this amendment so that we can get the  proper data.
