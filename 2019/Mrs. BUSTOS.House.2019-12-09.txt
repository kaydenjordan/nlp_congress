 Madam Speaker, I rise today to share with you a  framework of principles to give rural America a seat at the table as we  work to combat climate change. I call it the Rural Green Partnership.   For generations, farm families in Illinois have worked hard to  provide food for our country and for the world, but this year has  brought a challenging growing season. Farmers have seen shifting  weather patterns and severe flooding delay and even prevent planting  and harvesting.   Rural economies in Illinois and across the country depend on a stable  climate to survive. Weather chaos means it is more difficult to grow  our crops and put food on the table.   I am proud to put forward the Rural Green Partnership, and if we  follow the principles in this plan, we can lower greenhouse gas  emissions and spur economic growth.   Madam Speaker, I say to my colleagues: It is our moral and economic  imperative to address this climate crisis and its impact on rural  America.   I urge them to join me in enacting the policies outlined in the Rural  Green Partnership so we can provide our farming communities with more  than just a path forward but, also, an opportunity to prosper.                            ____________________
