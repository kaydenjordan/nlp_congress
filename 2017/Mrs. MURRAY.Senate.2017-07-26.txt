 Mr. President, I hope all Senators in this Chamber took  the time to listen to the very wise words from the Senator from  Virginia as to the fact that we are facing real issues in this country  and that when we work together and go through the regular process of  having committee hearings and no secret negotiations or backroom deals,  we can lead this country in the way it should be led.   I thank the Senator for coming to the floor and reminding us that is  how we get things done in a way that America accepts it.   Yet we are not here after having had committee hearings or process or  anything. We are here because of backroom deals that have brought us to  this floor at a time when no one can accept the fact that all of the  proposals are as a result, so far, of how many millions of people will  lose insurance--22 million, 15 million, 24 million. That is what we are  debating here, and that is a terrible debate. That is not what we  should be talking about, but those are the proposals we are being  offered.   Again, the Democrats are here. We are not giving up, and we are going  to fight any effort to pass TrumpCare until the last possible moment  because that will be the result. We are going to speak out for families  nationwide--children, parents, patients, people with disabilities,  seniors, and people who have called and tweeted and marched and filled  our office halls. So many people are worried and, frankly, scared right  now. These are families who are being kept in the dark by our  Republican colleagues and who are being left to wonder what might  happen to their healthcare, their financial security, and even their  lives.   It is appalling the majority of Republicans who are willing to go  along with this plan and move to begin debate without even knowing what  bill they will be debating. Yet, last night, the vast majority of the  Senate did something unusual. It showed just how much agreement there  actually can be among us, when 57 Republicans and Democrats agreed to  reject a full TrumpCare replacement bill and sent a message that we  agreed with Senator McCain in that we should stop letting the  ``bombastic loudmouths'' drive our work and instead return to regular  order and get back to work on policies that actually help the people we  are here to represent.   There are responsible Republicans who disagree with the way the  Republican leaders have hidden their legislation from Democrats and the  public throughout this process, who think there should be an open,  transparent process, with both sides at the table, and who want  hearings and public debate rather than backroom deals and secret  negotiations. I do as well, and I know many of my Democratic colleagues  agree.   Now that it is clear that there is absolutely no path to full  TrumpCare in the Senate, what is the reason for continuing this  damaging, rushed, deeply partisan effort on the floor to jam just any  bill through the Senate? Together we can do a lot better than the  lowest common denominator bill that simply sends TrumpCare to  conference with the House and then gives the Freedom Caucus a blank  check to gut Medicaid and put insurance companies back in charge of  people's healthcare, and more. Let's be clear. The only reason to pass  a cobbled-together, last-minute bill on the floor is to keep the  extreme conservative dream of repealing ObamaCare alive, no matter what  that means for patients and families.    I truly believe there is a better way to get this done right, and it  is to stop what Senate Republican leaders are doing right now and start  over.   So, once again, I ask my Republican colleagues to drop this partisan  effort and join us at the table. Let's work together to improve  families' healthcare, as so many of us truly want to do. My door is  open, and I am ready to get started.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Madam President, with the support of Senators  Gillibrand, Blumenthal, Shaheen, Stabenow, Hirono, Baldwin, Cortez  Masto, Hassan, Van Hollen, Leahy, Whitehouse, Brown, Harris, Franken,  Feinstein, Udall, Kaine, Coons, Cantwell, Menendez, Reed, Duckworth,  Durbin, Warren, Booker, Baldwin, Carper, Nelson, Heinrich, and  Klobuchar, I intend to make a motion to commit H.R. 1628, the American  Health Care Act, to the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor,  and Pensions for further consideration to ensure that it does not  endanger the health of women. This closed-door, fast-track process is  no way to make decisions that affect the health of every single woman  in this country. It is imperative that we fix this legislation in an  open, regular-order committee process.   I ask unanimous consent that the motion be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Mrs. Murray moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions with       instructions to report the same back to the Senate in 3 days,  [[Page S4297]]       not counting any day on which the Senate is not in session,       with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) eliminate provisions that make it harder for women to       access health care, by--        (A) preventing women from accessing care through trusted       health care providers;        (B) allowing or requiring insurance companies to offer       plans that do not fully cover women's health care needs;        (C) charging women more for coverage; or        (D) ripping away women's access to the coverage they       receive today.    The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.                            ____________________
