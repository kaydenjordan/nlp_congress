 Mr. President, Kentucky is approaching the 1-year  anniversary of one of the deadliest tornado outbreaks in our  Commonwealth's history--1 year since 80 lives were lost and a deep scar  was cut through Western Kentucky. We still remember the lost and pray  for their loved ones.   A few days after the storm, I visited some of the hardest hit towns.  I saw how the pictures of the damage in the newspaper and on television  didn't even begin to capture the local devastation in places like  Mayfield, Campbellsville, Bowling Green, and Dawson Springs. Homes were  literally ripped off their foundations; trees scattered like twigs;  whole neighborhoods gone in an instant. The pain is still fresh, but as  I have seen in multiple return visits, slowly but surely, Western  Kentucky is coming back.   This weekend, Kentuckians are carving out time to honor those whose  lives were lost and continue helping those whose lives were severely  disrupted. Dawson Springs just erected a beautiful, solemn memorial to  the 19 residents that the city lost that day. In Bowling Green, an  organization is delivering handmade Christmas ornaments to storm  victims. In Mayfield, even as members of the high school football team  fought to rebuild their families' lives off the field, the community  cheered the team to an undefeated regular season. Even in tough times-- actually, especially in tough times--Kentuckians stick together.   I am thankful to all the volunteers and charities helping us in  Kentucky remember this tragic anniversary and for all the men and women  who spent days and weeks working tirelessly to remove debris and to  rebuild.   Things are looking hopeful in the region this Christmas. Homes and  businesses are coming back. Families will gather again under one roof.  The road to recovery remains quite long, but Kentuckians will stand  shoulder to shoulder until the rebuilding is done, and I will keep  standing right beside them.
