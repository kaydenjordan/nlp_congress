 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the passion I have  heard from colleagues on both sides of the aisle and from Hoosiers on  all sides of this issue. The issue of health care is personal for  people, and it should be. But today, health care isn't personal. Under  ObamaCare, healthcare coverage has been a one-size-fits-all approach.   I have heard from so many of my constituents in my more than 4 years  in Congress about how ObamaCare has cost them and their families--lost  doctors, higher premiums and deductibles, and a lack of options for  coverage.   As an example of just one of those Hoosiers, Lon told me his premiums  and deductibles doubled last year when he lost his healthcare plan. He  has had to change his insurance 3 times in 3 years. That is not how  healthcare coverage should work.   The American Health Care Act makes healthcare coverage more personal  for every American. This bill empowers you, and every American, to  choose the best health care for you and your family. It empowers our  Governors and our State legislatures to meet the individual healthcare  needs of their citizens, including the people struggling to make ends  meet and the most vulnerable: the elderly, pregnant moms, kids, and  people with disabilities.   I applaud our Hoosier Governor Holcomb, who wrote a letter to  Congress with other Governors from around the country who support this  bill, he, too, believes it is in the best interest of Hoosiers. I agree  and I urge my colleagues to join me in support of the American Health  Care Act.
