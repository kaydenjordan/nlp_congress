 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support  of Jim Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act. He is my friend, and  he will be missed. He also will be missed as the former chairman and  ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.   I thank Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Rogers for their hard work  and my subcommittee friend,  [[Page H8843]]  Ruben Gallego, who is the chairman of the Subcommittee on Intelligence  and Special Operations.   We have done many things in the area. We have gotten new authorities  for them to operate. We have gotten resources for them to operate  throughout the world, to help us both in the counterterrorism fight and  global power struggle with some of our competitors.   Our Nation faces unprecedented challenges. I am very proud that this  includes the COVID mandate being removed, that we will not be losing  any more soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines; that we also will not  keep recruiting to stay low; that we will have more people who join a  force that now is not hitting its commitment goals.   I am committed to free-cost healthcare for all of our servicemembers,  which includes our National Guard and Reserve.   I thank Ms. Speier, who I served with on the Subcommittee on Military  Personnel. We are going to miss her and also you, Mr. Speaker.
