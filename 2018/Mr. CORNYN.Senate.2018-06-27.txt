 Mr. President, I understand that the Democratic leader  may be on his way, and I will yield the floor when he comes, but I do  want to respond to the comments that have been made by my friend, the  Senator from Illinois, the Democratic whip.   I think what he is proposing is a false choice. He says we need to do  away with zero tolerance when it comes to enforcing our immigration  laws. Basically, what that means is an argument for the nonenforcement  of our immigration laws. We can actually enforce our immigration laws  and keep families together. Indeed, we have a proposal, which I know he  is very familiar with, to do precisely that--proposed by Senator Tillis  and Senator Cruz. I know he and Senator Feinstein are talking to them,  and hopefully they can come up with a bipartisan solution. Yet the  argument that somehow this is a new phenomenon is just not borne out by  the facts.   We all remember 2014, when the vast wave of unaccompanied children  who came across the border from Central America was called a  humanitarian crisis by President Obama. It was because we simply were  not prepared to deal with the medical and other needs, feeding,  housing, and taking care of these tens of thousands of children who  were streaming across the border.   Central America, basically, has some very serious problems which  result in there being people who flee from those countries and seek, in  many cases, asylum in the United States. Yet the idea that President  Trump started something new when he decided to enforce the law or that  this phenomenon of children coming across the border is something new  is simply not the case. It has been happening for a long time.   Back when President Obama was detaining families and was separating  families, on some occasions when the accommodations were not available  to deal with them together, we didn't hear a peep out of our friends on  the other side of the aisle. When 1,500 unaccompanied children from  Central America--those placed with sponsors here in the United States  who were not American citizens, who were not even family members, and  who had not had criminal background checks--were unaccounted for, as  reported in a New York Times story recently, that was as a result of  the flawed policies of the past in dealing with this humanitarian  crisis.   We do agree on one thing; that is, that families ought to be kept  together, and the President has said as much. Yet what every single  Democrat across the aisle has agreed to is a bill by our friend from  California Senator Feinstein, which, simply goes from zero tolerance,  when it comes to violating the immigration laws, to zero enforcement.   What that bill would result in is a return to the flawed catch-and- release policies of the past because, if you can't enforce the law--if  you don't have the immigration judges, if you don't prioritize these  family cases--then you will have to give people notices to appear at  some time in the future. Of course, most of them will not show up for  their court hearings, and the cartels and human smugglers, whose  business models depend on their ability to exploit these gaps in  American law, will win. They will win because they will have  successfully circumvented the enforcement of America's immigration  laws. Those are the people who benefit the most from this.    I am very sympathetic to the circumstances of these children and  their families living in Central America, but as my colleague said, we  simply can't accept anybody and everybody who wants to come to the  United States under any and all circumstances. That  [[Page S4465]]  is why we have a legal system of immigration. That is why we have due  process to consider asylum claims, which should be considered and  should be expedited, in my view, while these family units are detained,  and not simply say that we are going to go from zero tolerance of  immigration law violations to zero enforcement and return to a catch- and-release policy, which is associated with huge surges in additional  illegal immigration. According to Manuel Padilla, the Rio Grande Border  Patrol Chief, who I was with this last Friday, that is a big mistake.   The American people understand that we need to enforce our  immigration laws. They are as compassionate as we all would hope to be  about keeping these families together as much as we can, but at some  point we need to enforce our laws. In this case, that means family  units need to be detained in a secure, safe, and humane facility, but  then they need to present those claims to an immigration judge on a  prioritized basis. If they don't meet the legal criteria, then we  simply don't have any alternative but to return them to their home  country. That is the law of the land.   So 83 percent of the children in U.S. custody now came unaccompanied  because their parents sent them from Central America by themselves.  Only 17 percent came as part of a family unit. This is a longstanding  problem, and we need to fix it. We have legislation that can do that,  and we need to pass it this week in my view.   I see the distinguished Democratic leader here.    Sure.    Mr. President, I am sorry; I did not mean to suggest that  the Senator from Illinois didn't object back then, but my point is that  Senator Obama--President Obama had the same policies that are now being  objected to under President Trump.    Mr. President, I would respond to my friend from Illinois  that I think alternatives to detention are a reasonable thing to look  at, but the point is that people need to show up for their court  hearings because right now, without detention, based on catch-and- release policies, these people simply fade away into the landscape and  basically win the lottery when it comes to immigrating illegally to the  United States without making a legitimate asylum claim.   I would say on the representation issue that I certainly support pro  bono legal counsel being allowed to represent the asylum seekers, and I  believe that is the practice now. I would be reluctant to ask an  American taxpayer to fund a lawyer for every immigrant who shows up at  the border and makes a claim for an immigration benefit. I think that  might be a bridge too far. But I do think that pro bono legal counsel  makes a lot of sense.                      Recognition of the Minority Leader
