 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business for 5 minutes.    Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the life and  legacy of Clint Roberts, who passed away in the early morning hours of  February 13 at the age of 82.   Clint is a former Member of the U.S. House of Representatives, the  South Dakota State Senate, and a former South Dakota secretary of  agriculture. He helped give birth to the Conservation Reserve and the  Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program, which have been extremely  beneficial to farmers, ranchers, and landowners, not only in South  Dakota but across the country. These programs helped increase farm and  ranch family incomes at a time of great economic turmoil.   But more importantly, Clint was a mentor and a hero to me and to many  others and, I am proud to say, a lifelong friend to me and Jean. I have  always looked up to Clint and sought him out for advice.   I first met Clint when I was an intern in the South Dakota State  Senate in 1976. He was serving in a leadership position. He taught me  many valuable lessons over the years about politics, policy, family,  and public service, just to name a few. He also is credited with  introducing me to that exquisite combination of water and Scotch over  40 years ago at the Kings Inn in Pierre.   Clint grew up on a ranch near Presho, SD, in Lyman County, and never  let go of his cowboy roots, his hat, or his boots. He was an iconic  symbol of a cowboy and of the Wild West, so much so that he was one of  the finalists to be the ``Marlboro Man'' in the mid-1970s. He also  appeared in minor roles in films and even in a Super Bowl commercial.   But even off camera, he was a cowboy through and through. He was down  to earth, a straight shooter, and a practical conservative who believed  in freedom and helping those in need. He was also a problem-solver who  fixed what was wrong instead of just talking about it.   He was one of the true conservationists in South Dakota, promoting  wildlife and conservation on his operating farm and ranch. He taught  many the importance of the CRP, or the Conservation Reserve Program,  and preserving our natural resources. During pheasant hunting season,  he always opened his ranch to hunters, and loved making his secret  recipe for chili for all to enjoy. But most of all, he understood the  importance of family. He was a great husband to Bev, a father,  grandfather, and great-grandfather, and he was a great friend to all  who knew him. He had a tremendously positive impact on the many  thousands of people whom he met and touched with his kindness,  selflessness, and generosity. South Dakota is truly a better State, and  we are a better people because of his hard work and dedication to  making things better.   With this, I welcome the opportunity to recognize and commemorate the  life of this public servant and my friend, Clint Roberts. We will  treasure his legacy for years to come.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I have six requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.
