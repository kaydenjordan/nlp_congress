 Mr. Speaker, too many working families still struggle  to pay their bills, to take care of their families, and to save for  their kids to go to college or to take care of aging parents.   The middle class--households with an income between 67 and 200  percent of median income--is shrinking and income inequality is  growing. Wage stagnation means more families will need safety net  services like SNAP--food stamps--and housing assistance at a time when  the majority in Congress is trying to cut those programs.   What should we be doing?   Consider this. Unions helped build the middle class. Unionized  teachers, nurses, and firefighters have better access to paid holidays,  paid sick leave, and retirement benefits, and less need for safety net  services.   When workers have the right to join together and have a voice in the  workplace, it is also good for nonunion workers who benefit from those  higher standards.   Unfortunately, here in Congress and across the street at the Supreme  Court, with the Janus v. AFSCME case, working families and organized  labor are under attack.   To grow our economy and reduce the need for safety net programs, we  should make it easier, not harder, for workers to form unions and  collectively bargain. Until we do, we will continue to see a shrinking  middle class.                            ____________________
