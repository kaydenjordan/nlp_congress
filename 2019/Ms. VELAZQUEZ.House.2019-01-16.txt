 Mr. Speaker, as of this week, the Trump shutdown has  become the longest government shutdown in American history.   It is bad enough that the President has doubled down on his demand  for a senseless, expensive, and hateful border wall. It is even worse  that he is holding Federal workers hostage, needlessly inflicting pain  and suffering on dedicated public servants.   Last week, Federal workers began officially missing a paycheck. These  800,000 workers, both employees and subcontractors, are fathers,  mothers, brothers, and sisters. They have mouths to feed and mortgages  to pay. They must put groceries on the table and gasoline in their car.  Yet because one person in Washington decided to throw a political  temper tantrum over a foolish wall, many of them are now having to cut  expenses, endure sacrifices, and make tough choices in their family  budgets.   The latest outrageous development occurred when, last week, Donald  Trump threatened to take disaster funds away from the Army Corps of  Engineers to pay for this wall. He even suggested taking funding away  from Puerto Rico as the island struggles to recover from historic  hurricanes, the aftermath of which cost 3,000 of our fellow citizens  their lives.   Think about that. The President wants to take money away from  Americans who are suffering from natural disasters in Puerto Rico,  Texas, California, and elsewhere to fund a hateful wall aimed at  demonizing immigrant communities. This is shameful and it is immoral.   Now we have gotten word that HUD may be using the shutdown as a  predicate for reducing disaster funding to  [[Page H606]]  the people of Puerto Rico. Last week, HUD put out a surprise notice  claiming that the shutdown is preventing them from proceeding with  disaster recovery efforts, funds Congress allocated on a bipartisan  basis almost a year ago. Yet HUD's very own contingency plans dictate  that shutdowns, under no circumstances, should affect disaster-related  operations.   I fear that Secretary Carson is playing politics with the shutdown  and the people of Puerto Rico, putting the island's recovery at risk.   Mr. Speaker, this shutdown must end. The President's shameful  insistence on a border wall is harming our workers and families.  Everything, from the food we eat to counterterrorism, to travel safety,  is impacted by the Trump shutdown. And now HUD is threatening to  inflict greater pain on those who have survived natural disasters. That  is unacceptable.    Mr. President, the American people implore you: Stop holding Federal  workers and other Americans hostage. Stop threatening parts of our  Nation that are recovering from natural disaster. Don't put people's  lives at risk. Do your job. Reopen government, and get back to work.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of my amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of my amendment, which  I believe will make meaningful strides to help alleviate problems of  poverty and hunger in Puerto Rico.   Unlike the States, Puerto Rico has been forced to work with the  limited NAP block grant since 1982. This has led to a systemic  underfunding of the nutritional needs of these American citizens for  nearly 4 decades.   Sadly, with a severely restricted budget resulting in reduced  benefits and eligibility on the island, we are leaving thousands of  families hungry every day.   Already tragic, these problems were made worse when Hurricanes Irma  and Maria made landfall. Puerto Rico was devastated, leaving a large  share of the population out of work and unable to meet their basic  needs.   In the year since the immediate aftermath, the island is still  suffering. Poverty levels have risen dramatically and the economy  continues struggling. Sixty percent of the children in Puerto Rico live  in poverty.                                time  1545    This has meant an increase in the share of individuals who would  otherwise be eligible for NAP, except for the fact that the program is  capped. NAP is simply incapable of meeting the needs of Puerto Ricans,  particularly given the current circumstances resulting from the  disaster.   The underlying bill we are debating today will provide Puerto Rico  with an additional $600 million for disaster food assistance. I thank  the chairwoman for including this critically needed funding.   This funding, and previously appropriated disaster resources, address  two critical needs in Puerto Rico. First, it is providing NAP  recipients with a bit more support to feed their families. Second, it  aids an additional 200,000 people who lost their jobs and homes.   However, I believe Hurricanes Maria and Irma taught us some painful  lessons with regard to nutritional support in Puerto Rico. We should be  evaluating the benefits that adequate nutritional assistance has on  Puerto Rican's health and economy.   My amendment would provide up to $5 million to support the  Commonwealth in conducting such a study. This will be an independent  analysis that includes a survey of NAP participants on the island and  fully investigates the impact disaster nutrition assistance has on the  food security, health status, and well-being of the people of Puerto  Rico.   I should note that the USDA conducted similar studies for the SNAP  program that operates in 53 jurisdictions during and after the Great  Recession. It is my hope that this analysis will provide Congress with  additional insight and tools to further reduce poverty, hunger, and  hardship on the island.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise to offer my amendment, No. 5.    Madam Chair, I rise to discuss an environmental and  humanitarian crisis affecting the people of San Juan.   For decades, Cano Martin Pena has been a repository for sewage  overflow, mercury, and PCBs. The Cano Martin Pena was once a navigable  and commercially used channel. Today, it is so clogged that it is  possible to walk across it on some parts.   Due to the clogging, the approximately 25,000 U.S. citizens who live  near the Cano Martin Pena face significant public health and safety  challenges. Combined stormwater and the regional sewage system  contribute to high concentrations of coliforms in the channel.   Frequent flooding is a constant risk that can put residents into  direct contact with polluted water. Exposure to these polluted waters  causes an elevated risk of gastrointestinal diseases and a higher  prevalence of chronic diseases and asthma. Sadly, we often see these  ailments in children 5 years old and younger. Those who reside near the  canal live in constant fear that the next rainfall could become a major  flood, dumping raw sewage into homes, schools, and businesses.   After the 2017 hurricanes, which exacerbated the Cano Martin Pena  crisis with greater flooding, the communities that live near the 3.7  miles of this channel need our help more than ever.   Because of the hurricanes, more than 1,200 families partially or  totally lost the roofs of their homes, and 70 percent of the community  flooded with wastewater in the immediate aftermath.   These are the working people of San Juan, with one of the highest  labor participation rates in the island. All they want is to be able to  raise their families in safe and healthy communities. If we are ever to  bring justice to these afflicted communities, we must dredge this canal  and work toward its long-term remediation.   Puerto Rico has spent millions of dollars attending to the problem,  but without additional Federal funds, this project will stall. The U.S.  Army Corps of Engineers is ready to initiate construction as soon as  Federal funding is made available.   My amendment will jump-start the most important flood mitigation  project for Puerto Rico, ensuring the resiliency of critical  infrastructure and doing justice to the working families living in this  vulnerable area.   Madam Chair, this is not only an environmental project but a pressing  issue of social and environmental justice. The people who live along  this troubled canal have suffered long enough, but Hurricanes Maria and  Irma underscored how quickly these problems can worsen with extreme  weather. We have an obligation to act before the next hurricane or  flood.   Madam Chair, I have been there and seen with my own eyes the  devastation and hardship caused by this ecological disaster. I have  seen children wading in contaminated waters after every heavy  rainstorm. I ask my colleagues to join me in helping Puerto Rico by  voting in support of this amendment.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
