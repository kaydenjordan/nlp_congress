 Mr. President, I am proud to recognize Salem High  School's cheerleading team as April's Granite Staters of the Month for  coming together, even while social distancing, to help raise the  spirits of residents at a local nursing home.   Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Salem's cheerleading team was unable to  compete at their New England conference meet, a moment that the  athletes had worked hard for all season. In an effort to cheer up her  teammates, as well as bring joy to residents at their local nursing  home, Gabrielle Driggers, a sophomore on the team, suggested throwing a  parade for the residents, which included Gabrielle's grandmother.   Gabrielle, who has led previous efforts to support her local  community by organizing donation drives and fundraisers with the help  of her teammates, texted the team's group chat to see if anyone would  be willing to participate in a parade for residents at  [[Page S2286]]  Salemhaven Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation Center. A few days later,  between 25 to 30 members of the cheerleading team gathered in the Salem  High School parking lot, pom-poms in hand, to greet their fellow  teammates from the safety of their cars and prepare for the procession  to the nursing home.   The parade, which was carefully planned to ensure that all of the  athletes were at least 6 feet away from one another and the residents,  consisted of a line of cars where cheerleaders, one to a car, waved  their pom-poms and blasted music to the delight of the residents.   I commend the members of the Salem High School cheerleading team for  recognizing the importance of ensuring that those who are the most  vulnerable to the virus feel supported and seen during this public  health emergency. This is a difficult time for all Americans, which is  why this straightforward act of kindness and recognition of community  resonates with Granite Staters and all Americans and reflects the very  best of our State.                            ____________________
