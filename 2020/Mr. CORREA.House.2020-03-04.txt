 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 1140, the Rights  for Transportation Security Officers Act.   Mr. Chair, I want to thank, again, Chairman Thompson for his  leadership on this issue and bringing this bipartisan piece of  legislation to the floor that I am cosponsoring.   Today, finally, we acknowledge that the TSA workers deserve a pay  structure and personnel management system that recognizes their value.  These employees have had a higher turnover than the average Federal  employee, and, in fact, many went unpaid during the government  shutdown.   These hardworking men and women are effectively the thin blue line  that stands between us and our families while they are traveling by air  and those who would do us harm by smuggling items onto planes through  checkpoints. That is what a TSA officer does: protect us and our  families.   We need to have professional TSA employees. We need to make sure that  they are the best of the best. Our family's safety is worth it.   As chairman of the Transportation and Maritime Security Subcommittee,  I am proud to stand with these men and women of TSA in strong support  of this legislation, and I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``aye.''
