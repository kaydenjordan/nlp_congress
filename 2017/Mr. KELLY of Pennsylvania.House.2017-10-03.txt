 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of  the rule and the underlying legislation.   We come here today, of course, as Members of Congress, but as we look  at what happened in our country the last several weeks, one of the  things that has been lauded very much is first responders, those who  are rushing to the scene to help people who have been affected, who are  going through pain and suffering.   I would like you to consider today's legislation and the rule, as we  are first responders. We stand for life. We stand for the ability, as a  people, and there is no other nation in the world like the American  people who respond when other people are in trouble, when they are  suffering, when they are in pain, when their lives are in danger. And  yet we turn a blind eye and a deaf ear to what we are doing to these  children. These are little boys and little girls waiting to be born.    If we do not stand for them, who will stand for them?   If we are not the first responders, who will be the first responders?   If it is not us in the people's House who go beyond the hypocrisy of  a political statement and go about the reason we are here--it is the  people's House because we defend those people--let us be the first  responders when it comes to pain and suffering. Let us pass this bill  and stop this inhuman activity that we are doing.
