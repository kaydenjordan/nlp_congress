 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague Mr. McGovern  for yielding me the time and doing such a wonderful job on a very  challenging bill.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong opposition to the  current version of the farm bill. There are many reasons why--among  them, the unrealistic challenges to food assistance programs that will  have a big negative impact on my State in Maine.   What I want to focus on in my limited time is how much this  legislation does a disservice to the farmers in rural communities we  represent.   The public is very clear. They want greater access to healthy,  locally grown food. They want more of it grown organically, and they  want to support local farmers in rural economies. But Federal policy is  way behind the times, and this legislation would make it much worse.   Farmers aren't ignoring the trends that consumers are asking us for.  They are capitalizing on them. In my State, the changing market and the  demand for locally grown and organic food has reinvigorated the State's  agriculture economy.   Josh Girard, who is pictured here, is one of those farmers. After  earning a master's degree, working abroad in the Peace Corps, and  apprenticing at local farms, Josh decided to return to his hometown to  start his own farm.   The small sources of Federal support available to farmers like Josh  pale in comparison to what commodity farmers receive, but it can make  all of the difference.
