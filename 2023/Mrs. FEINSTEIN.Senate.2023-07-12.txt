 Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Fire  Safe Electrical Corridors Act of 2023 and thank my colleague Senator  Padilla for joining as an original cosponsor.   Our bill would allow the U.S. Forest Service to approve removal of  hazardous trees near power lines on Federal forest lands without a  timber sale, thereby reducing administrative burden and reducing the  risk of catastrophic wildfire.   Californians are all too familiar with the potential for electrical  power lines to cause devastating wildfires. Three of the largest and  most destructive wildfires in California history--the 2017 Thomas Fire,  the 2018 Camp Fire, and the 2021 Dixie Fire--were started by electrical  equipment. Together, these wildfires burned more than 1.2 million  acres, destroyed more than 15,000 homes, and killed 87 people.   When power lines cross Federal land, the Forest Service generally  requires utility companies to keep the area around them free of trees  that could touch or fall on the lines or otherwise ignite. Removing  those cut trees, however, requires the Forest Service to hold a timber  sale, which imposes administrative costs. Meanwhile, cut trees often  linger on the landscape, posing a continued risk of igniting during a  wildfire or damaging other infrastructure during a flood.   Our bill would make targeted changes to existing Forest Service  authorities to encourage quicker and less costly removal of the trees.  Specifically, we would allow the Secretary of Agriculture to grant  utilities permission to cut and remove trees or other vegetation near  their power lines without a separate timber sale, provided that that  removal is consistent with existing forest management plans.   Included in this legislation is a requirement that any proceeds  obtained from timber or forest products removed under this authority be  returned to the Forest Service. This removes any financial incentive to  remove trees other than those necessary for wildfire mitigation. After  all, the goal is to streamline actions that protect against devastating  wildfires--protecting, not removing, our Nation's forests.   Congress has an opportunity this year to make this small change to  Forest Service authorities to ensure better stewardship of our national  forests and prevent catastrophic wildfires. I thank Senator Padilla for  his partnership on this bill, and I urge the full Senate to take it up  and and pass it as soon as possible.                                  ______                                         By Mr. BARRASSO (for himself, Ms. Lummis, and Mr. Carper):   S. 2274. A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 112 Wyoming Street in Shoshoni, Wyoming, as the  ``Dessie A. Bebout Post Office''; to the Committee on Homeland Security  and Governmental Affairs.
