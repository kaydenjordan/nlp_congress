 Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the  people of Nevada's Third District.   The pandemic has ravaged our economy, especially in Nevada, where the  travel and tourism industry is the bedrock of our economy.   Nevada is one of the hardest-hit States by this pandemic. Currently,  we have one of the highest unemployment rates in the country at 9.2  percent, but we have an opportunity to put this pandemic behind us and  to begin to rebuild our economy. That answer lies in vaccine  distribution. We are doing everything we can to get vaccines to those  who are eligible, but with limited resources, we are not able to get  them out quickly enough.   This week, we were able to work with Clark County Commissioner  Michael Naft to establish a temporary vaccine site for the residents of  Laughlin, a rural community on the border of Arizona, California, and  Nevada. Before this site was established, these Nevadans had no  vaccination options within an hour's drive of their community.   This pandemic needs to be treated like the crisis it is. We need to  act swiftly and get States more funding for distribution. I am urging  my colleagues: we must act quickly. We cannot let partisan games get in  the way.                            ____________________
