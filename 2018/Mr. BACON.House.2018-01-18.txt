 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize our critical public  health programs. Months ago, the House passed a bundle of  reauthorizations for key health programs. Amongst them are funding  extensions for the community health centers, CHIP, and the National  Health Service Corps.   Today, we will vote for CHIP reauthorization for a third time. I will  be voting ``yes'' for a third time, and it appears that most of my  Democratic colleagues will be voting ``no'' for a third time. Programs  like these help ensure that millions of Americans and hundreds of  thousands of Nebraskans receive the care they so desperately need. It  is abhorrent that these programs have become a political football, and  it is unacceptable that the healthcare that so many depend on has been  put to the side.   This upcoming spring, Nebraska will run out of funding for community  health centers and CHIP. While a contingency plan may be in the works,  these lifesaving programs should not require a fallback. I count on my  colleagues in the Senate and the House to pass legislation, to vote  ``yes'' today on CHIP and community health centers and many other key  programs in the future.                            ____________________
