 Madam Speaker, I rise to raise the concerns of Floridians  and Georgians who still await a supplemental appropriation from the  Congress.  [[Page H2877]]    Every other major storm and disaster received a supplemental  appropriation, but for some reason, victims of Hurricane Michael remain  waiting.   The Air Force, expecting an appropriation, began the process of  rebuilding Tyndall Air Force Base. This morning, the Air Force put out  news that they have run out of O&M funds.   What does this mean? It means that, as of this morning, we have  deferred 61 required facility projects at bases in 18 States across our  country.   It means that, on May 1, we will stop work on Tyndall Air Force Base,  failing to meet our obligations to rebuild.   It means that, on May 15, the Air Force will cut aircraft repairs,  potentially endangering our pilots' safety when flying and limiting  their training capacity.   Ultimately, it means that, on September 1, we will cut 18,000  training flying hours.   This is unacceptable in the current global environment. We must act  now to ensure that the men and women serving in the Air Force are  furnished with the tools to accomplish their missions.   This is our job as the Congress, and we need to do it immediately,  since there are very few legislative days remaining before the Easter  break.                            ____________________
