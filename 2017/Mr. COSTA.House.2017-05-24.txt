 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about Asian Pacific  Heritage Month.   In May of each year, we come together to celebrate the Asian and  Pacific heritage cultures that have made up America for generations. It  is time to recognize those important significant roles that Asian  Americans play in our American story.   We are very lucky in the San Joaquin Valley to have a community rich  with culture and ethnic diversity. Our Asian-American and Pacific  Islander neighbors are an integral part of that richness.   From the Chinese Americans, who helped build the transcontinental  railroad in the 1860s, to the Japanese American farmers, who cultivated  our valley in the early 1900s, to the Hmong and Vietnamese Americans  who joined our community beginning in the late 1970s and 1980s after  the Vietnam War, these Asian communities all have an important story  that have added value to our country.   As we reflect upon Asian Pacific Heritage Month, I am proud to join  all Asian Americans and the Pacific Islanders in my district and across  our country in celebration. So let me thank all of our Asian Americans  for their contributions to our country.                           Celebrating Memorial Day     Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak about the significance of  Memorial Day this coming weekend, which we will celebrate across our  Nation.   This weekend, I will have the honor and the privilege to participate  in three Memorial Day ceremonies in my district. We will pause to  memorialize and thank those American servicemen and -women who have  made the ultimate sacrifice and to mourn the loss with their families.   Words, for me, never seem adequate to express a profound thank-you,  having members of families and my own family that have served and that  have made those sacrifices, for these men and women are our heroes.  They gave America the most precious thing they had: the last full  measure of devotion to country. Because they did, we are who we are  today: a free and prosperous nation that is reflected around the world  in most positive ways.   Our valley and our Nation owe an immeasurable debt of gratitude to  these individuals and their families who so selflessly answered the  call of duty, and our Nation can never, ever say thank you enough.   Their sacrifice, bravery, therefore, must never, ever be forgotten.  We must continue to work on behalf of veterans and their families.  Whether it is cutting through red tape with their veterans' claims or  helping with assistance programs or educational benefits, we can always  and should do more.   As President John F. Kennedy said: ``As we express our gratitude, we  must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words,  but to live by them.'' So each day, not just on Memorial Day, we must  work to ensure that our veterans and soldiers who today are on Active  Duty in harm's way all around the world and their families receive the  benefits that they have earned.   On Monday, we will honor and we will remember and we will pledge  never to forget, and we will say, in our most humble way, thank you.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia for  yielding, and I also want to take this time to thank the gentleman from  Florida and my colleague and good friend, Congressman Valadao, for the  introduction of this legislation, H.R. 624, which I support.   Mr. Speaker, as we know, identity theft throughout the country is a  very significant problem. It becomes even more compounded in this day  of the internet when we have to deal with a whole host of issues that  make the ability to steal one's identity even more easily done. This  measure attempts to try to address a part of that challenge by dealing  with the issue of Social Security numbers.   We all know Social Security numbers are key information used to  identify ourselves, and we know that if they fall into the wrong hands,  they can be used to commit identity theft.   I think all of us remember when, at some point in our age, we got our  Social Security number and we memorized it, and it is something that is  very important in our society today. But many thieves find these  numbers are incredibly valuable because they are a link that can  connect a person's information across a whole host of agencies,  systems, and databases in this age of the internet.   Criminals can use stolen Social Security numbers to file fraudulent  tax returns, obtain loans, and commit other kinds of crimes. An  estimated 13 million Americans experienced financial identity theft in  2014 alone, resulting in over $16 billion--with a B--$16 billion lost  to fraud.    In 2007, to combat these issues, there was an Identity Theft Task  Force that made recommendations to the administration on ways to  eliminate the unnecessary collection, use, and display--the display,  which this legislation attempts to address--of Social Security numbers.   Yesterday, the Government Accountability Office released testimony on  these efforts by the Federal Government to reduce the collection, use,  and display of Social Security numbers. In conclusion, the GAO  testified that, until the Office of Management and Budget adopts more  effective practices for guiding agency Social Security number reduction  efforts, overall governmentwide reduction will likely remain limited  and difficult to measure, and the risk of Social Security numbers being  exposed and used to commit identity theft will remain greater than it  need be. Again, this legislation attempts to help address that.   The Social Security Number Fraud Prevention Act would enact measures  to help protect American citizens, especially children, veterans, and  senior citizens, from identity theft and fraud. It does so by reducing  the number of mailed documents the Federal Government sends to  individuals that include full Social Security numbers.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia.   In addition, it also takes steps to ensure that, if inclusion is  necessary, the number is not visible from the outside of a mailing. I  think, probably, many of us have received mail that, in fact, had our  Social Security number there and identified.   As I said at the outset, this is no silver bullet to stopping  identity theft; it is a commonsense measure to reducing it.   Social Security, as we all know, is a promise made to those who have  worked hard throughout their lives to contribute to the system, to  contribute to the American way of life. It also provides those seniors  who are living on their Social Security the ability to have dignity and  additional security during their golden years. As a result, Congress  must do what it can to reduce the strains on the program, particularly  from fraud and theft.   For all of those reasons, I support this legislation, and I support  Congressman Valadao's efforts and my  [[Page H4535]]  good friends from Florida and Virginia for bringing this commonsense  measure to the floor.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 953,  Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of 2017. This legislation eliminates  the requirement to acquire two permits for the same pesticide  application under two separate laws and, I might add, if you live in  California, there is a separate requirement under the California Clean  Water Act that requires an additional permit. That would still apply  regardless if this legislation is passed.   In order to be permitted to use a pesticide, that pesticide must be  approved under FIFRA, which includes an analysis that must be performed  that finds it will not generally cause unreasonable adverse effects to  the environment or to the health. However, current law requires another  permit to be acquired for the same action under the Clean Water Act if  you happen to be close to a water body, and that is where the  duplication occurs.   Not only are these requirements redundant, they are expensive, and  the cost of the individual Clean Water Act permit ranges from $150,000  to $270,000 and can take up to 2 years. No one wants to risk human  health, not I, not anyone, but in my opinion this would not do so. We  have Zika, we have West Nile, and we have a host of spreading of these  diseases by mosquitoes in which this, in fact, can address those  issues.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this bill in order to  remove this unnecessary, unneeded regulatory burden and expense.
