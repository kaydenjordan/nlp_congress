 Mr. President, in 2006, I was successful in enacting  much needed updates to the IRS whistleblower program. Up until that  time, the program was entirely a voluntary award program. There was  also no central office within the IRS for handling whistleblower  claims. Given this, there was little incentive for whistleblowers to  step forward potentially risking their careers.   My 2006 amendments sought to bolster the IRS whistleblower program by  making a special program targeted at going after high-dollar tax  cheats, such as corporations. It did this by making awards mandatory in  cases where a whistleblower discloses tax fraud totaling $2 million or  more. Moreover, the 2006 amendments established the Whistleblower  Office within the IRS to formalize and manage the program.   The IRS whistleblower program has turned into one of the most  effective programs in addressing tax evasion--leading to the recovery  of more than $3 billion in taxes that otherwise would have been lost to  fraud. I firmly believe the program has the potential to collect even  greater sums going forward. However, for this to occur, the IRS is  going to have to completely embrace the program and start to view  whistleblowers as their allies.   The Government Accountability Office, GAO, issued a report on the  program in 2015 that expressed concerns that long timelines and poor  communication may be discouraging whistleblowers. This is exactly what  I have been hearing from whistleblowers for years. Too often  whistleblowers are waiting in the dark for years with no communication  on where their claim is in the system.   While the IRS has made improvements in this area, I fear that without  further improvements some whistleblowers may start to question whether  stepping forward is worth their time and effort. My concern is  exacerbated by the fact that under current law, IRS whistleblowers have  no protections against employer retaliation for good-faith disclosures.   That is why I am pleased to be joined by Senator Wyden today in  introducing legislation that seeks to address these issues. The IRS  Whistleblower Improvements Act would increase communication between the  IRS and whistleblowers, while protecting taxpayer privacy, and provide  legal protections to whistleblowers from employers retaliating against  them for disclosing tax abuses.   To increase communication, our bill would specifically allow the IRS  to exchange information with whistleblowers where doing so would be  helpful to an investigation. It would further require the IRS to  provide status updates to whistleblowers at significant points in the  review process and allows for further updates at the discretion of the  IRS. It does this while ensuring the confidentiality of this  information is maintained.   Moreover, to protect whistleblowers from employer retaliation, our  bill extends antiretaliation provisions to IRS whistleblowers that are  presently afforded to whistleblowers under other whistleblower laws,  such as the False Claims Act and Sarbanes-Oxley.   Too often, whistleblowers are treated like skunks at a picnic. This  is unfortunate, as often the only way to discover fraud and abuse is  for a whistleblower to step forward. It is time we roll out the welcome  mat for IRS whistleblowers. Our bill takes a good step in that  direction.   I urge my colleagues to join Senator Wyden and me in supporting this  commonsense legislation.                                  ______                                         By Mr. BENNET (for himself, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Booker, Mr. Cardin,          Mr. Sanders, Mr. Markey, Mr. Merkley, Mr. Reed, Mr. Durbin, Mr.          Whitehouse, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Udall, Ms. Cortez Masto, Mr.          Heinrich, Ms. Warren, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Franken, Ms. Hassan, Mr.          Nelson, Ms. Harris, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Coons, Mrs. Feinstein, Ms.          Klobuchar, Mr. Schatz, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Blumenthal,          Mr. Carper, Ms. Hirono, Mr. Murphy, and Mr. Van Hollen):   S. 767.
