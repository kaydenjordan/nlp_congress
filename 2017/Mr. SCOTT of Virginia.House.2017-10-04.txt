 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  Republican budget resolution and its intent to fast-track tax cuts to  the wealthiest Americans and corporations. This resolution, first of  all, is not serious. It assumes $800 billion in savings from the repeal  of the Affordable Care Act, which we know will not happen. We have the  Treasury Secretary being quoted as saying that ``massive tax cuts will  actually reduce the deficit. . . .''   Well, we know how that works. You cut taxes for the wealthy and say  they are going to pay for themselves. When that doesn't work and the  deficit explodes, you come back and demand massive tax and massive cuts  in Medicare, Social Security, and education.   Anyway, the Republican budget resolution, even if it did add up,  makes the wrong choices for America. By calling for trillions of  dollars in spending reductions, the Republican budget undermines  America's investments in infrastructure, the environment, scientific  research, and much more.   I wanted to use my limited time to focus on its harmful impacts on  the jurisdiction of the Education and the Workforce Committee, where I  serve as the Democratic ranking member. Under the Republican budget  resolution, children in need of a healthy school meal, students in  pursuit of an affordable college education, and workers in search of  skills and training to get a better job all take the back seat to tax  cuts to the wealthiest Americans and corporations.    In education, the budget harms students and families by undermining  our Nation's education system, and instructs the House Education and  the Workforce Committee to eliminate $20 billion in investments in  higher education by providing less funding for Pell grants and student  loans.   In terms of other instructions, it instructs the Department of Labor  to reduce funding designed to provide job training, protect workers  from wage theft, and ensure that there is a sufficient number of  inspectors to make sure that workers can come home safely from their  jobs.   The budget also threatens child nutrition programs. In fact, during  the Budget Committee's hearings, it was made clear that child nutrition  programs are a target for savings to pay for tax cuts.   Today, almost 10 million children and 20,000 schools have access to  universal, healthy school meals, where children are served nutritious  meals without the stigma or need for paperwork. Cutting investments in  programs to ensure that children have healthy school meals to partially  fund tax cuts shouldn't be our Nation's goal.   Mr. Chairman, the Federal budget is a statement of our values. Unlike  other Democratic substitutes that responsibly strengthen our economy  and expand opportunity for all Americans, the Republican budget  undermines priorities in which students, workers, and their families  take a hit, and lays the groundwork for a return to a regressive  framework benefiting a wealthy few.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting the  Republican budget resolution.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Congressional Black Caucus  budget, which is a more credible and responsible alternative than the  underlying Republican budget.   The Nation's budget reflects its priorities, but the Republican  budget continues to highlight the wrong priorities. It fast-tracks tax  cuts for the wealthiest Americans and claims that unrealistic economic  growth will pay for these cuts when, in reality, those tax cuts will  ultimately be paid for by children, seniors, and those in need.   It cuts $1.5 trillion from Medicaid and Medicare and also cuts  programs that support basic living standards, including nutritional  assistance, and undermines national security by cutting diplomatic  programs and foreign aid.   The Republican budget also cuts education, job training, research and  development, and infrastructure. Their budget leaves hardworking  American families out in the cold and would devastate our economic  recovery after years of consistent job growth.   The Congressional Black Caucus budget is in stark contrast to the  Republican budget. It is compassionate. The numbers add up. It  addresses the needs of the most vulnerable and improves our economy.  Unlike the Republican budget, the CBC budget uses real numbers, not  overly optimistic growth projections and assumptions of things that  won't happen.   The CBC budget proposes $3.9 trillion in revenue enhancements, and  unlike the Republican budget, we show exactly how Congress can  realistically reach this revenue target by outlining almost $11  trillion in revenue options from which Congress could pick and choose  $3.9 trillion.   With the additional revenue, the CBC budget protects and strengthens  the social safety net and commits the Federal Government to eradicating  poverty in America.   Our budget includes a comprehensive infrastructure and jobs program,  totaling over $1 trillion over 5 years, and according to the Economic  Policy Institute, it will create 2 million jobs next year.   In addition, the CBC budget eliminates any further threat of  sequestration, eliminating the arbitrary budget caps and across-the- board budget cuts that are scheduled for next year.   It allocates $200 billion for hurricane relief, $100 billion to  address the looming pension crisis, and additional funding for our  veterans.   Even with the elimination of the sequestration and strong investment  in programs that we know will create jobs and economic opportunity, the  CBC budget is still estimated to reduce the deficit, when compared to  the baseline, by approximately $2.5 trillion over the next 10 years.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1845     Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Richmond), who is the chairman of the  Congressional Black Caucus.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee), who is a member of the  Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis), the co-chair of the  Congressional Black Caucus' Budget Task Force.    Mr. Chairman, can you advise how much time is  remaining on both sides?    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 15 seconds just  to point out that the healthcare plan in the budget is a public option,  which CBO scores as a savings of over $100 billion. We have $1 trillion  in spending for infrastructure, the same as the President has promised,  but at least we pay for it.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 1 minute  to the gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 30 seconds  to the gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\1/4\ minutes to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Brown).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson).    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 15 seconds  to the gentlewoman.    Mr. Chairman, the Congressional Black Caucus  is a more compassionate, fiscally responsible alternative to the  underlying Republican budget and does not rely on unrealistic growth  projections or bizarre suggestions that massive tax cuts can pay for  themselves. It makes our Tax Code fairer, protects and strengthens the  Affordable Care Act, makes college more affordable, and ensures more  Americans are lifted out of poverty. It also improves retirement  security for our seniors.   With these targeted investments, our budget creates 2 million jobs  next year and reduces our Nation's deficit by $2.5 trillion over the  next decade and puts us on a more sustainable path compared to the CBO  projections of our budget. I urge my colleagues to support the CBC  budget.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
