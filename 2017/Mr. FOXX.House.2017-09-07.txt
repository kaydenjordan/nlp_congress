 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the efforts of the CVCC  Alexander Furniture Academy, located in Taylorsville, North Carolina.  This fantastic facility hosts a program where students are taught the  basic skill levels required to gain employment as a sewing operator or  upholstery craftsman within the furniture trade.   Under the leadership of Center Director Eunice Mays and thanks to the  generous scholarships awarded by many groups like Craftmaster  Incorporated, AHFA, and others, nearly 50 students have graduated, and  almost all are now employed.   I wholeheartedly commend Eunice and the Alexander Furniture Academy  as well as all of its sponsors for putting together a program that  doesn't just teach valuable skills to would-be job seekers, but a  program that literally helps individuals build the skills they need to  succeed from the bottom up.   In the last 6 months, students have crafted 90 sofas and chairs and  20 loveseats which have been sold. The profits from the students'  creations are invested in scholarships and help to keep the academy  open.   I commend the Catawba Valley Community College Alexander Furniture  Academy teachers, staff, and students on this terrific program.                            ____________________
