 Mr. Chair, I also rise in opposition to the amendment.   Chair Rogers is exactly right. I want to emphasize one of the points  that he made.   The language in the bill that this amendment is proposing to strike  is effectively the same language Congress agreed to last year. As the  chair said, this is a commonsense provision that extends a restriction  Congress passed on a bipartisan basis last year.   The administration wants to retire a nuclear weapon, and we are  saying to tell us how they are going to replace the capability before  they retire it.   That is a responsible policy, and I strongly oppose the amendment  striking this provision.
