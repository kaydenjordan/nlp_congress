 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart, but to  honor the life of a friend, retired United States Coast Guard  Commander, Mike Smith.   Mike is fondly remembered by many as the director of the annual Coast  Guard Festival in Grand Haven, Michigan, also known as Coast Guard City  USA, a cherished event where our west Michigan community comes together  to celebrate the Coast Guard's service  [[Page H2298]]  and sacrifice on the lakeshore and across the country.   Mike lived a life of service, both in the Coast Guard and outside of  it. In fact, in 2016, he received the Department of Defense's annual  Spirit of Hope Award, an honor that is presented to individuals who  embody Bob Hope's core values of serving and supporting our military  members. He was so proud of that he actually put it on his own  challenge coin.   Mike exemplified the bold character of the Coast Guard and its motto,  ``Semper Paratus,'' always prepared, and his influential impact will be  forever felt.   Mike is survived by his wife, Cathy, and their six children: Maxwell,  Mollie, Moira, Maggie, Matteson, and McHale.   I, and so many others, remember Mike for his service, but we cherish  his friendship and his contribution to the Grand Haven community, to  the U.S. Coast Guard, and to our Nation.   Rest well, my friend. Rest well.                            ____________________
