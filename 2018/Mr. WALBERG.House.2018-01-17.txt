 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   This past Sunday, I stood at the side of a casket of a beloved  longtime friend who had just turned 95 years of age 5 days before. Up  until almost her dying day, she was vibrant, was committed to life,  touching lives of people, changing lives and making an impact in the  world.   I am rejoicing today in a different way because of two brand-new  lives that have been born: one to a staff member, and another to a  former staff member of mine. Brand-new babies with an opportunity to be  dreamers in this world.   Who knows what their lives will be, but isn't this what it is all  about?   Life that is lived has impact and then goes on, and new lives to  follow, ultimately to have impact, have dreams, and make a difference,  and truly establish the divine plan that is the sanctity of life.   This week we are observing the 45th anniversary of Roe v. Wade and  the 44th March for Life. There are people like us, like Congressman  Smith, who have, for the past 35-plus years, been leading this  challenge here. It was 35 years ago that I left my dream job as pastor  of a local church to speak for life in the halls of the State  legislature and end taxpayer-funded abortion.   In Michigan, we still have a law that says abortion is not lawful,  but because of Roe v. Wade, we march again this year speaking for life,  speaking for the defenseless, speaking for those who would desire, who  would dream to be found in a world that they can change.   How did we get into this situation, especially when we have in that  Declaration of Independence the immortal statement that says: ``We hold  these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal and  endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights,'' among them,  the right to life--the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of  happiness?   John Adams, our second President, said: ``Our Constitution was made  only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the  government of any other.''   May we redouble our efforts to be that moral people that stand on  things that are timeless, that were designed by our Creator, God.   Let me end with this: one of our good friends and former colleagues  here in this Chamber, one night, gave me a poem that meant a lot to  him. As I read that poem, it changed me as well.   It is entitled, ``The Anvil,'' and it simply says:       Last eve, I passed a blacksmith's door      And heard the anvil ring the vespers chime;      Looking in, I saw upon the floor old hammers, worn with       beating years of time.      ``How many anvils have you had,'' said I, ``To wear and             batter all of these hammers so?''      ``Just one,'' said he;      And then with twinkling eyes, ``The anvil wears the hammers             out, you know.''      And so, thought I, the anvil, called the Master's word,      For ages, skeptic blows have beat upon;      And though the voice of fallen blows was heard,      The anvil is unharmed and the hammers gone.    Mr. Speaker, I believe the truth of miracle and blessing of life will  prevail and the right to life will be protected for all. Even as we  find the anvil stand firm, so will the truth of God's creation of human  life. It will remain. Let us all who honor life never give up.   Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I yield to the distinguished gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Banks), who is a member of the Navy Reserve and who serves  on the House Armed Services Committee; the Veterans' Affairs Committee;  and the Space, Science, and Technology Committee. He is championing the  Patients First Act to prioritize ethical stem cell research that will  help patients and do no harm to the youngest members of the human  family.
