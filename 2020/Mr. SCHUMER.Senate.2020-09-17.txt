 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, this morning I was planning to address  a number of topics, but the President held a press conference yesterday  afternoon that was so callous, so uninformed, so egomaniacal, so  divisive that I am compelled to respond to it this morning.   We are in the middle of a global pandemic that has killed nearly  200,000 Americans, far more than the number of Americans who died in  World War I--more than any other Nation on God's green Earth, more than  countries with larger populations, and more than countries with mere  fractions of our wealth and power.   Here is how the President spoke about the number of American deaths  yesterday at his press conference:         If you take the blue states out, we're at a level that I       don't think anybody in the world would be at . . . [If you       take the blue states out,] we're really at a very low level.    Yes, Mr. President, if you don't count the total number of Americans  who have died, you might think it is not so bad. If you close your eyes  and pretend that half of the country doesn't exist, maybe some might  think you didn't do such a spectacularly awful job.   What kind of person looks at the number of dead citizens in the  country he is supposed to lead, and in an attempt to glamorize himself,  dismisses every American who died in a State that didn't support the  President politically? What a disgrace. It is monstrous. There is not a  shred of empathy, not an ounce of sorrow. What kind of President do we  have?   The President just wants you to see a graph about how his  catastrophic failure to fight COVID-19 could have been worse.   I suggest President Trump spend some time reading the stories of the  men and women across the country who have passed away from this  terrible virus.   This isn't about a number. Oh, no, it is about the people families  and communities have lost, whether they be in red States or blue  States. Many of these families have been unable to hold  [[Page S5682]]  funeral services to properly mourn their loved ones for fear of  spreading COVID to another member of their family. That is why these  remarks by the President are so horrific.   What does the outcome of an election determine if these lives should  be counted? Isn't that awful? Why does the outcome of an election  determine if these lives should be counted? Does he mean that the loss  of Americans who lived in States with Democratic Governors shouldn't  count? If that is the case, President Trump is saying that the deaths  of David Pickman of Somerset, CT; and Patrick McNamee of Ypsilanti, MI;  and Virgil Sutton of Dallas, NC, don't count--don't count. How about  Ralph Davis, the high school basketball coach in Milwaukee, WI? Did his  life not count because he lived in a State with a Democratic Governor?  What kind of demented person would say that those American lives don't  count?   The President also said: ``But some of those states, they were blue  States and blue-state managed.''   I suppose that means that the life of Dennis Wilson shouldn't count  because he was an educator in Lenexa, KS. If only Mr. Wilson had lived  17 miles east in the Hickman Hills neighborhood of Kansas City, MO,  maybe the President would think his life should have counted.   How about Captain Doug Hickok? If he lived--I don't know--in  Cheyenne, WY, I suppose the President might have valued his life.  Unfortunately for Captain Hickok, he lived 1,700 miles east in Bangor,  PA, so President Trump says his life isn't worth counting.   Maybe I am giving the President too much credit. You never really  know what the heck he means when he talks. So it is possible that his  definition of blue States isn't limited to States with Democratic  Governors. Maybe his definition of blue States includes States with  more Democrats than Republicans in their congressional delegations.  That would mean Valentina Blackhorse's life didn't count because she  lived in Kayenta, AZ, nor would the life of a Des Moines toddler who  died from COVID in June.   What kind of demented person would make that calculation? President  Trump, that is who.   Of course, there is no bottom with President Trump. He is so  contemptuous of every virtue, so dishonorable, so dishonest that the  vices parade themselves forward one after another.   At the press conference after his disgusting comments about ignoring  American lives from blue States, President Trump lied, once again,  about his support for Americans with preexisting conditions, a lie he  has told and retold while his administration is in court suing to  eliminate those very protections.   Don't worry, though. President Trump promised that a brandnew,  fantastic Republican healthcare plan is just around the corner. He said  you will see it in 2 weeks, just like he told FOX News in July when he  said he would sign a healthcare plan in 2 weeks, a full and complete  healthcare plan, and again in August, just 2 weeks away--just like his  infrastructure bill, a new middle-class tax cut, lower prescription  drug costs, a new stimulus package, a report on COVID-19's impact on  minorities, and new COVID tests, all of which the President said would  be ``2 weeks'' away but, in fact, never materialized, not in 2 weeks,  not ever.   He must think the American people are chumps that he can say anything  he wants with no accountability, not do it, and then do it again and  again and again.   For centuries, American Presidents have faced challenges with honor  and with courage. They have stepped up to the podium and used their  bully pulpit to give honor to American lives. But when this President,  President Trump, stands at that great podium, he reveals his cowardice,  his callousness, his selfishness, his ignorance, and, most of all, his  insistence on dividing us. His inability and unwillingness to unite a  grieving nation will be his legacy.   When Donald Trump took the stage at the 2016 National Republican  Convention, he painted a false portrait of a country in crisis, and  declared, ``I alone can fix it.''   Four years later, the country faces actual crises--the greatest  economic crisis in 75 years, the greatest public health crisis in a  century--and President Trump now says: ``It is what it is.''   ``Could you have done more to stop it?''   ``I don't think so,'' he says.   ``If you take the blue States out. . . . We're really at a very low  level.''   ``I don't take any responsibility at all.''   ``It's going to disappear.''   ``A lot of people think the masks are no good.''   ``[W]hen it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away.''   ``I see the disinfectant, [where it] knocks it out in a minute . . .  and is there a way [we] can do something like that, by injection?''   ``I'm not a doctor, but I'm, like, a person that has a good, you know  what.''   This man, who said all these ridiculous, harmful things, is leading  the country through the worst public health crisis in a century.   Americans don't have to ask themselves, as Reagan once asked, if they  are better off now than 4 years ago. President Trump has told everyone  exactly what the score is.   When Donald Trump said he was running for office, he said: ``I alone  can fix it.'' When Donald Trump is running the country during the worst  pandemic in this century, he says: ``It is what it is.'' Five words.  Both times, five words. Five words that sum up an approach to  government and leadership that is completely antithetical to everything  the word ``leadership'' means.   Promise big, deliver zero, deliver small. That is President Trump's  view of government. Boast when you don't have any responsibility;  shrink from it when you do. That is President Trump's view of public  service.   It has diminished our institutions and our democracy. He has cost our  country its moral standing in the world; he has threatened the future  of our planet; and he has cost Americans their healthcare, their jobs,  and their lives. But it is not so bad if you don't count the numbers.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
