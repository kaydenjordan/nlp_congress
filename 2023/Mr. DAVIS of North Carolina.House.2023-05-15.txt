 Madam Speaker, I rise to honor our brave  men and women in law enforcement as we celebrate their service during  National Police Week.   This week, we must acknowledge the dedication and sacrifices of those  who serve our communities by honoring the fallen heroes who have paid  the ultimate price.   Madam Speaker, rural America has many challenges, and policing is  among them because of underinvestment. That is why I am fighting to  bring home nearly $3 million in support for the towns of Ayden,  Elizabeth City, Plymouth, and Greenville to ensure they have the  resources they need to safeguard our communities.   I am also proud to cosponsor the bipartisan Invest to Protect Act  which will provide critical investments to local police departments  across eastern North Carolina to keep their officers and communities  safe.   Madam Speaker, I join the First Congressional District in extending  my deepest gratitude to the men and women who protect our  neighborhoods, respond to emergencies, and ensure public safety.                            ____________________
