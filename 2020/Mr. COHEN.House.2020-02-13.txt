 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I rise in strong support of H.J. Res. 79, which takes a key step to  ensure that the equal rights amendment will become part of our  Constitution.   Nearly 100 years after women gained the right to vote, it is  difficult to believe we still haven't given women equal rights. It is  hard to believe it is a serious disagreement in this Chamber.    In the year 2020, it is unacceptable that women still make only 80  cents for every dollar earned by men and that women are still subject  to violence, harassment and attacks on their freedom to control their  own bodies.   In Judiciary Committee this morning, a brilliant female law clerk is  describing sexual harassment by a distinguished and respected ninth  circuit judge. This should never happen. And with ongoing efforts to  undermine progress we have made; the equal rights amendment is more  important than ever.   It took over 130 years to give women the right to vote. It is almost  100 years since they have gotten it. It is time to give women their  proper place in the Constitution of the United States, which most  modern constitutions have, equality regardless of sex.
