 Mr. President, I join my colleague from Alaska in  commending the U.S. Senate for confirming Mike Pompeo as Secretary of  State. I think he is the right person at the right time, and we need  somebody there. There is too much going on around the world to have  that job vacant, and there is an important meeting of Foreign Ministers  of the major countries in the world that is going on tomorrow that he  needs to attend. Whether it is North Korea and what is happening  there--where he has been very involved--or whether it is the continuing  concerns we have with regard to the nuclear agreement with Iran or  whether it is what is happening in Syria and certainly what is  happening on the eastern border of Ukraine, where I was recently, there  are lots of hot spots around the world right now, and there is the need  to have somebody in place who understands the importance of addressing  those issues and addressing some of the bigger and longer term  challenges we have with countries like Russia and China to be sure we  can have more constructive relationships. It is good to have somebody  in that job.   When John Kerry came up for confirmation in the Senate, not everybody  agreed with him on the policies. When Hillary Clinton came up for a  vote, not everybody agreed with her on the policies. They agreed they  were qualified, as Mike Pompeo clearly is, and they agreed that a  President should have the ability to have his or her person in that  job, particularly as the Secretary of State. Therefore, in both of  those cases, the vote was 94 Senators in favor.   Again, I am just glad the Senate chose to confirm him, but I do wish  we had had more of a bipartisan approach to it because I think it is  important for us to show around the world that we, indeed, do have  momentum behind this nominee and his ability to lead our country in the  area of soft power diplomacy all around the world. I think he will do a  good job, and I think he will earn the trust of those of us who voted  for him today. I also think he will be able to change the views of,  perhaps, some of my colleagues who voted no today.   Congratulations to Mike Pompeo, and I am happy for our country that  he is in place.                               Opioid Epidemic    Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about an issue that has  gripped my State and every State represented in this Chamber, and that  is the opioid epidemic. This is prescription drugs and heroin and  fentanyl-carfentanil. It is something we have talked about on this  floor more in the last couple of years than we have at any time,  really, in the history of this body. We have passed some good  legislation, but, boy, there is so much more to do. Sadly, this crisis  continues to unfold, and at least in my State and I believe in most  States in this country it is getting worse, not better. So we started  to take some important actions, but it is time to take more.    Just last week, a couple in Youngstown, OH, were cited for reckless  homicide and endangering children after their 16-month-old daughter  overdosed and died. She was exposed to carfentanil, one of these  synthetic forms of opioids that unfortunately has come into so many  communities in this  [[Page S2470]]  country and, in fact, is the biggest single concern we have right now  in Ohio and many other States.   In fact, in Ohio we had an increase of overdoses last year, and 60  percent of those overdoses were from fentanyl or carfentanil--this  synthetic form of opioids that was hardly present 5 years ago. So as we  made progress on prescription drugs, heroin came in. As we made  progress on heroin, fentanyl and carfentanil came in.   There is a need for us to push back and push back hard. Opioid deaths  are now the No. 1 cause of accidental death in my State of Ohio and the  No. 1 cause of accidental death in the United States of America. Think  about how many people are being affected by this. It is across the  board. It knows no ZIP Code. It is not just in urban areas, not just in  rural areas or suburban areas, it is everywhere. It is something on  which we can make a difference.   I have seen some programs that are actually working well to try to  turn the tide and push back. One I will mention is funded, in part,  from legislation we passed in this Chamber just 1\1/2\ years ago. It is  the Maryhaven Addiction Stabilization Center in Columbus, OH. It is an  attempt by Franklin County, which is largely Columbus, OH, to come  together and say: We have to do something to get more people who have  overdosed into treatment. One of the many challenges we face in the  crisis is the gap, and one huge gap is the fact that people who  overdose have their lives saved through this miracle drug called  Narcan, which reverses the effects of an overdose, but after coming out  of their overdose, getting conscious again, they simply go back into  the community and the environment that created this potential overdose  situation in the first place. Once again, a week later, perhaps, maybe  days later, in some cases hours later, the person may overdose again.  The answer is not just applying Narcan--as important as it is because  we do need to save lives. The important thing is to get that person  into a program where they can begin to deal with their addiction, where  they can get longer term support through a recovery program to stay  away from the old environment and the old gang that got them involved  in this issue in the first place.   Addiction is a disease. Treatment is required just as it would be for  other diseases. I am excited about what is happening at Maryhaven  Addiction Stabilization Center because at this center, they are  bringing people in who overdosed and then in the same facility there  are about 50 beds for treatment. Instead of having the vast majority of  people who overdose and come into an emergency room go home or go back  to the old environment, 80 percent of the people at Maryhaven are going  into treatment. That is a huge change. That is a sea change. That will  have an enormous impact in dealing with the 200,000 people or so in my  State of Ohio who are currently addicted. It will help them get into a  decent program, get through the detox, get into recovery, and have the  opportunity to get their lives back together.   That program is funded, in large part, from Federal funding that came  from this legislation we passed about 1\1/2\ years ago. Maybe $1.2  million has been matched by private funding and State and local  funding. We have this new project that I think can be emulated around  the State because it seems to be working really well.   The CURES Act, which we passed, has provided to Ohio just recently  $26 million in new funding, and we need it badly. We need to put it to  use in ways that work. This is an example of something that is actually  well-thought-out that is going to help close the gap and make a  difference.   In 2016, we were told we had the deadliest year on record in terms of  overdoses. Unfortunately, it looks like, in 2017, the numbers are going  to be worse. It certainly will be in Ohio.   In the Franklin County corridor, the Columbus, OH, area, the coroner  recently came out with their numbers in 2017. They had an overdose  death rate that was higher than 2016. We lost 520 of our citizens to  overdoses in Franklin County in 2017. That was a 47-percent increase  from 2016. So it is not just a little increase; it is a huge increase.  A staggering two-thirds of those--66 percent of those deaths--were from  this synthetic heroin we talked about, the synthetic opioids fentanyl  and carfentanil.   That is really the issue now in so many communities around the  country. Just last month, Franklin County experienced 18 overdoses in 1  week--1 county, 18 overdoses in 1 week. This was just last month. That  is an average of over two deaths per day. Think about that when you are  thinking about 1 county out of 88 and the impact this is having.   We need to do more at the Federal level to combat this epidemic, and  I would like to talk about a couple of pieces of new legislation that  would build on the success we had in this body in terms of legislation  that would help direct this money in ways that will make a difference,  toward evidence-based programs--not just throwing money at the problem  but making sure the money is well spent.   One of the pieces of legislation is critical to this issue of  fentanyl and carfentanil coming into our community. Unbelievably, this  poison that we talked about today, two-thirds of the deaths in this  county in Ohio last year were because of fentanyl. The 16-month-old  baby we talked about was killed through carfentanil and another  synthetic. Unbelievably, this stuff is coming in through our U.S. mail  system, primarily. It is coming not over the border, primarily, or not  in some other way like heroin might or even prescription drugs, but it  is literally coming through the mail primarily from China. So evil  chemists in China are mixing up this poisonous brew that becomes  fentanyl, and then it gets shipped through the mail system into our  communities--sometimes to a P.O. Box, sometimes to someone's home,  sometimes to a business. Unfortunately, we do not have the ability  within the U.S. Postal Service to push back. To me, this is an obvious  example where this body ought to come together and say: You know what,  let's provide law enforcement with the tools they need to be able to  stop some of this poison from coming in.   If you were to send this same fentanyl by FedEx, UPS, or DHL, a  private carrier, they would have to provide data to law enforcement in  advance: what is in the package, where it is coming from, where it is  going. With that data, law enforcement can target those packages and  pull them off the line and pull some of this poison out of our  communities.    I have been to these distribution centers where the carriers do  exactly that. They have Customs and Border Protection officials there.  They have rooms that have the proper venting to be able to open these  packages. This fentanyl and carfentanil is so dangerous, our first  responders are putting their lives at risk every day just by dealing  with it. What they are able to do is stop this poison from coming in,  which helps, at a minimum, to raise the cost. Right now, one of the  reasons it is expanding is because it is relatively inexpensive, but it  is also deadly. It is something that is causing many more overdoses and  deaths than ever before.   So our legislation is very simple. It is called the STOP Act. It is  cosponsored by Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota. The notion is  to say to our U.S. Postal Service to provide that same information  because law enforcement tells us that unless they have that  information, it is like finding a needle in a haystack. With 900  billion packages a year, it is hard to imagine how they are going to be  able to stop those packages without having at least the tools of  knowing what is in those packages, where it is coming from, where it is  going, so they can use their analytics, the big data, to be able to  identify those packages and stop them.   Last month, a man from Cleveland, OH, was charged after undercover  agents found he was selling fentanyl he had just bought online from  China. According to the prosecutor, ``The defendant ordered thousands  of deadly doses of fentanyl from China, brought it to a residential  neighborhood in Euclid and then mailed the dangerous drugs all over  Ohio and across the country'' using our own mail system.   The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations in the U.S. Senate,  which is a group I chair, did a yearlong investigation into this issue.  We completed this several months ago. Unfortunately, what it showed is  exactly what you would suspect. The traffickers, when asked: How should  we ship these drugs if we are buying them from you  [[Page S2471]]  online--because we had an undercover person working for us. He was a  member of the Homeland Security Department, someone who deals with  these issues every day. He actually contacted websites around the  country. Unfortunately, the websites all said the same thing: We will  sell you this deadly drug, but you have to ship it through the U.S.  mail system. We will guarantee delivery if you do that.   We were able to find five different websites that were openly selling  fentanyl. They all told us where to send it. By using some of the  information that we had based on the payment systems they were using,  we were able to identify the people who had been shipped drugs through  these sites. We found, incidentally, that just in a short period of  time, seven people had died of overdoses after getting drugs from these  particular websites. We also were able to refer to law enforcement some  other people who apparently were dealing these drugs by taking large  quantities.   Even with this person in Euclid, OH, we talked about, thousands of  deadly doses of fentanyl were found. That could be in a package about  this size. Three flakes of this stuff can kill you. So, at a minimum,  we have to be sure our U.S. Postal Service is giving law enforcement  the tools to be able to help stop this deadly poison.   The Postal Service has begun over the last year or so to make some  progress in this area. Still, they tell us that only 36 percent of the  packages transported into this country have any kind of advanced  electronic data. As we dug deeper, having researched and gone to some  of these sites where the U.S. Postal Service is providing information,  we found out it was not 36 percent because 20 percent of the packages  that had the required information still went into the community anyway  because of lack of communication with law enforcement.   Finally, we are finding out that it may be 36 percent of the  packages, but much of the information is not helpful. We need to have  new rules in place to say to countries: If you want to do business with  the United States and send packages here, you have to play ball with us  and provide this digital information upfront so our law enforcement can  deal with what is clearly a crisis in this country. It is a glaring  loophole in the screening process. It undermines the safety and  security of our country, not just for drugs but for other issues as  well, and it is time we fix it.   After 9/11 and the terrible tragedy of that day, this Congress  decided to require private carriers to require all of that  information--the advanced electronic data--because of the risk of  terrorism, frankly. At that time, we said the Post Office needed to do  a study on this to give them time to get ready. That was over 15 years  ago, and they still haven't done it. They need to provide law  enforcement the tools they need by requiring advanced electronic data  on all packages entering the United States. Thirty-one of my Senate  colleagues--19 Republicans, 12 Democrats, and 1 Independent--have  signed on as cosponsors to this legislation. It already has support of  one-third of the Senate. It has been endorsed by President Trump's  opioid commission because it is a commonsense solution to a growing  problem around the country. There is House companion legislation to do  this. Stopping this influx of fentanyl is going to happen only if we  stop how it is coming, which is through our Postal Service from  countries overseas, primarily China.   We also need a more comprehensive approach, of course, to the drug  issue. It is not just enough to stop the supply if there is a strong  demand. Dealing with the demand includes prevention efforts that are  included in legislation we passed in this body about 1\1/2\ years ago  and still needs to be implemented. We have new legislation to help  increase that comprehensive approach. The last bill was called the  Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act, signed into law at the end of  2016. We now have a new bill, CARA 2.0. It provides more resources for  evidence-based prevention, treatment, and recovery programs. It will  help people get into longer term treatment so they can truly overcome  their addiction. It has helped to overcome the stigma by treating the  addiction as a disease, and now it is time to ensure that we are  looking at what works and building on it.   I introduced this legislation with my colleagues, Senator Sheldon  Whitehouse and six others: Senators Shelley Moore Capito, Amy  Klobuchar, Dan Sullivan, Maggie Hassan, Bill Cassidy, who is the  Presiding Officer today, and Maria Cantwell--four Republicans and four  Democrats. We kept this bipartisan. Other Members have joined in as  well. Again, it picks up where the Cures legislation and the CARA  legislation left off, to provide a better framework, because now we can  spend the extra resources this Congress has wisely determined to put up  against this fight.   In the spending bill that was just passed, there was an additional $6  billion over 2 years put against this issue. Let's be sure the money is  well spent. Let's be sure we have a roadmap to build on the successes  we have had and ensure that that money is going to things that actually  can make a difference.   We talked about one earlier, the addiction stabilization center. We  also know that one way we could spend our money better is to have a  better prescription drug monitoring program nationally. So every State  now has some sort of prescription drug monitoring program, but often  they don't talk to each other. This is something that is required in my  State of Ohio. West Virginia, Kentucky, Indiana, Michigan, and  Pennsylvania are all States where there is also an opioid crisis. We  need to be sure that they are talking together, so that when someone  goes to get a prescription, the information is logged. If the person  goes out of the State to order a prescription across the border--maybe  just right across the border--that information is provided just as it  would be if it were within that State. That is in our legislation as  well.   We also target addiction at its source. About 80 percent of the  people who die of overdoses today probably started on prescription  drugs. That is the latest data we have. Some of that was prescription  drugs that were provided to that individual as the result of an  accident or an injury, and they became physically addicted because they  were prescribed an opioid for pain relief.   The stories are heartbreaking. The parents have come to me and say-- and this has happened twice: My son or my daughter went to get a wisdom  tooth extracted, and the dentist gave my son or my daughter opioids. In  one case, it was 60 pills of Percocet or OxyContin. Sure enough, that  young person had a physical addiction develop because of that. Then  when the pills were harder to get or more expensive, they turned to  something less expensive and more accessible, which was heroin or  fentanyl or carfentanil, and then overdosed and died. These are 17- year-old children who were prescribed this medication.   There are other cases as well. I have met adults who are well into  their thirties or forties and are leading successful lives, well  established in their community, well connected in their loving  families. They had an accident or injury. Maybe it was a car accident.  They were given pain medication--opioids--and they became physically  addicted.   This addiction is a tough one to climb out of. So many people then  turn to another substance that is more available, more accessible, or  maybe less expensive and then overdose and then the death.   People say how could this have happened? When you go back, it  happened because of a prescription drug--something was overprescribed.   Others might buy prescription drugs on the street. This Saturday is  National Prescription Drug Take Back Day in America, and I hope that  everybody who is listening here will think about whether they could go  into their own medicine cabinet or maybe their parents' or  grandparents' and take out some of these opioids and then have those  disposed of properly at a police station or someplace else. I know  Kroger is doing this in Ohio and other States.   Find out where your drug take-back location is. Take these drugs in  and get rid of them because I have just heard too many cases,  unbelievably, of people stealing these drugs and using them and then,  again, developing that addiction or selling them and someone else  [[Page S2472]]  develops the addiction. Again, the thought is that probably 8 out of 10  people dying of overdoses started with prescription drugs. So our  legislation does deal with that.   Our legislation deals with overprescribing because it must be dealt  with. It requires doctors and pharmacists to use drug monitoring  programs to ensure that we are not overprescribing, and it sets a 3-day  limit on prescriptions for acute pain.   We except chronic pain. We have exceptions for cancer. But for acute  pain--the surgeries we have talked about--we are using the good science  from the Centers for Disease Control, or CDC, and others that say two  things: One, after the third day of using these opioids, on that fourth  day, fifth day, and sixth day is when the opportunity for an addiction  grows dramatically, and the chances of your falling into that addiction  increases significantly.   Second, in terms of pain and dealing with pain, we have also learned  that for acute pain for most kinds of procedures, there are other kinds  of pain medications available.   I have talked to the dentists a lot on this. There is a dentist from  Ohio who is a good man, Joe Crowley, who is now President of the  American Dental Association. He is working with the dentists to try to  ensure that we have new policies in place that discourage the use of  opioids altogether for things like a wisdom tooth being removed. But to  the extent it is used, after the first, second, and third day, it is  much, much less necessary and much less useful, and other pain  medication can take its place. So, as a result, we do have in our  legislation something that is a dramatic difference from the  unfortunate overprescribing that continues to go on in our country in  too many instances, and that is a 3-day limit. After 3 days, if you  continue to have the kind of pain that can only be dealt with opioids,  if you are one of the few individuals for whom that is true, you go  back to the doctor and get another prescription, but you have to go  through a process to do that. The alternative is that we are going to  continue to see more and more people become addicted through  prescription drugs as a gateway and then again getting into this  terrible cycle of overdoses and eventually overdose and dying in too  many cases.   So CARA 2.0 has these policy changes, as well as the additional  funding for prevention programs, treatment programs, and recovery  programs. It also helps our first responders by saying: If you can't  afford the cost of Narcan, we will help you out but also give you  training in Narcan and also to deal with this gap between the immediate  overdose reversal using Narcan and then going into detox--between detox  and treatment, between treatment and longer term recovery--to try to  ensure that you have continuity. This is something that just makes so  much sense and can save so many lives.   These legislative efforts we are talking about here are important. So  for those who are watching--and maybe some staff members are watching  from some of the offices--please check it out. Check out the STOP Act,  if you are not already a cosponsor. Check out CARA 2.0, if you are not  already a cosponsor.   Let's be sure that we are doing everything we possibly can here to  make a difference and begin to reverse this tide, begin to save lives  again rather than having this discouraging increase in addiction.   It is not all about overdoses and deaths, as tragic as that is. It is  about the millions of Americans whose lives are getting off track, who  may not overdose and may not end up needing Narcan but who are pulling  away from their family, who are not working, who are not engaged in  their community, who are giving up on their friends and their loved  ones.    A lot of people in this Chamber are concerned about the fact that so  many Americans are out of work today and not showing up even on the  unemployment rolls because they have left work altogether. They are not  even looking for work. Economists say our labor force participation  rate for men is historically low. It is probably the lowest it has ever  been in the history of this country. When you combine men and women,  you have to go back to the 1970s to see as many people who are out of  work altogether. I agree that is a big problem, and I would urge my  colleagues to look at the impact of opioids on that problem.   There are two recent studies, one by the Department of Labor and one  by the Brookings Institution, which indicate in the strongest possible  terms that opioids are driving much of this dysfunction in our  workforce today. So to employers out there who are saying, ``The  economy is growing, the tax cuts are working, regulatory relief is  working, but I can't find workers,'' 44 percent of those who are out of  the workforce, according to a Department of Labor study from the Bureau  of Labor Statistics, took a prescription pain medication the day  before.   The Brookings study shows that 47 percent of able-bodied men between  22 and 55 are taking pain medication on a daily basis. These are  frightening numbers. By the way, I can't imagine that is overreported.  I imagine it is underreported because of the stigma attached to this  issue of opioid addiction and because of the potential legal liability  people could be in for admitting it. Even so, almost half of those  surveyed say they are not working. They are not even looking for work,  but they are taking pain medication on a daily basis. So this affects  all of us.   Go to your firehouse in your community and ask them if they are doing  more overdose runs or more fire runs? I will bet you that they will say  the former. They are doing more drug overdose runs than they are fire  runs. We are all paying for that. Talk to your sheriff or your local  police chief and ask them what the No. 1 driver of crime is in your  community. I bet they will say it is opioids. Often it is people who  are committing crimes like theft or shoplifting or fraud to be able to  pay for the habit--$300 to $400 a day or more. Particularly if you are  not working, there is a temptation to commit those crimes and there is  a craving for this drug that puts people in positions they never would  have imagined they would find themselves in.   Think of the families who are broken up. Think of the kids who have  lost their parents to this epidemic. In Ohio, we have more kids in  foster care or under the care of the State than ever in our history.   Go to your neonatal units at your hospital and ask them about this.  They will say it is the No. 1 issue affecting them because so many kids  are being born to a mother who was addicted, and these kids have to be  taken through withdrawal themselves--little babies. You can hold them  practically in the palm of your hand.   I have gone to these neonatal units in Ohio and have seen these  babies, and it is heartbreaking because, just like adults, they have to  go through this tough withdrawal process. No baby should have to do  that.   So this issue is one when Congress has taken steps in the last year  and a half, and I congratulate this body and the House for moving  forward with some positive steps. There is so much more to be done, and  these two bills are a start. These two bills will help. They will help  to save lives. They will help to get people back on track and help to  ensure that people can live out their God-given purpose rather than get  distracted through this epidemic, rather than getting off track with  regard to family, work, dignity, and self-respect.   These two bills will help, giving law enforcement in our communities  the tools they need and helping our communities to be able to have a  comprehensive approach here to turn back this assault of addiction in  our country.   I hope we can move quickly in the Senate to pass this legislation so  the President can sign it into law and we can begin to make a bigger  difference.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I wish to honor 591 high school  seniors in 12 northeast Ohio counties for their decision to enlist in  the U.S. Armed Forces. Of these 591 seniors, 163 will enter the Army,  134 will enter the Marine Corps, 107 will enter the Navy, 19 will enter  the Air Force, 7 will enter the Coast Guard, 153 will enter our Ohio  Army National Guard, and 8 will enter the Ohio Air National Guard. In  the presence of their parents-guardians, high school counselors,  military leaders, and city and business leaders, all 591 will be  recognized on May 9, 2018, at the Northeast Ohio Foundation for  Patriotism ``Our Community Salutes'' event.   In a few short weeks, these young men and women will join with many  of their classmates in celebration of their high school graduation. At  a time when many of their peers are looking forward to pursuing  vocational training or college degrees or are uncertain about their  futures, these young men and women instead have chosen to dedicate  themselves to military service in defense of our rights, our freedoms,  and our country. They should know that they have full support of this  Senate Chamber and the American people who are with them in whatever  challenges may lie ahead.   These 591 young men and women are the cornerstone of our liberties.  It is thanks to their dedication and the dedication of an untold number  of patriots just like them that we are able to meet here today in the  U.S. Senate and openly debate the best solutions to the many diverse  problems that confront our country. It is thanks to their sacrifices  that the United States of America remains a beacon of hope and freedom  in a dangerous world. We are grateful to them, and we are grateful to  their parents and their communities for instilling in them not only the  mental and physical abilities our Armed Forces require, but also the  character, the values, and the discipline that leads someone to put  service to our Nation over self.   I would like to personally thank these 591 graduating seniors for  volunteering to risk their lives in defense of our Nation. We owe them,  along with all those who serve our country, a deep debt of gratitude.   I ask to have printed in the Record the names of the 591 high school  seniors.
