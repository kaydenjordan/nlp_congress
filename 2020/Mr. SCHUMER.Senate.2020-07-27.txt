 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, a short time ago, a ceremony honoring  the life of the great Representative John Lewis was held in the Capitol  Rotunda--the first time in our Nation's history that an African- American lawmaker had laid in state.   Last week, I shared my reflections on the life and legacy of John  Lewis here on the floor. In the story of America, John was one of those  special heroes whose moral clarity shown out like a beacon for others  to follow, a North Star who inspired his fellow Americans to join him  in the glorious work of perfecting our Union.   Today, as we honor his extraordinary life here in the Capitol, many  of us--his friends, his colleagues--are filled with a deep sense of  loss, but I want to share a short message of hope. It seems easy to  forget that John Lewis was just a teenager when he started the work of  ``redeeming the soul of America,'' as he put it. He was 18 years old  when he first met Dr. King, 21 when he was arrested as a freedom  fighter, 25 when he was beaten bloody on a Sunday in Selma.   The fight for civil rights has always been driven by the righteous  indignation of our young people, and our time is no different. Once  again, young people across the country are rising in a mighty movement  for justice and equality, supported by the vast majority of Americans.  The memory and legacy of John Lewis's life lives on in each and every  one of them, and that fills me with hope    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 4328         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
