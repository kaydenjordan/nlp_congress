 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, there are certainly many concerns over this bill. The  one that I would like to highlight today is that they are greatly  increasing the expansion of eligibility for the bill.   Now, that doesn't necessarily mean the bill is going to make things  more expensive, but you know very well if we are going to bring a whole  lot of new areas into the bill, if we don't increase the spending, the  areas that are currently part of the community services block grant are  going to go down.   I don't believe the majority party is going to let anybody go down,  which means this bill anticipates a significant increase in spending on  this program. This is one of many programs that I would argue, under  the Constitution, really even should not be a Federal concern. It  should be a local concern.   To double the eligibility to 200 percent and make that permanent is  resulting at a time when our spending is just completely out of  control, setting up a situation in which there will be dramatic  spending on another government program.    Mr. Speaker, as we break for the weekend, I remind the  other Members of this body that when we come back, there is no greater  crisis this country faces than the crisis at the border.   I leave Members with just a few numbers that we want to turn around  quickly: first of all, the number of people coming here who are not  appropriately vetted who are sometimes referred to as illegal aliens;  two Marches ago there were 11,000; one March ago 63,000; and the most  recent March Border Patrol puts at 150,000.   Think of that: in 2 years from 11,000, 63,000, 153,000 per month. And  the Cabinet Secretary in charge of this says that he inherited a mess.  He inherited great laws including the Migrant Protection Protocol, and  now we have a true mess.   The second number: 110 deaths in the past year in this country from  fentanyl, a horrific drug, almost all of which comes across the  southern border. By comparison, 57,000 Americans died in the Vietnam  war. Twice as many people die every year in this country from illegal  drug overdoses as died in 12 years in the Vietnam war.   I sincerely hope this body will deal with the southern border and  make it a priority when we come back.                            ____________________
