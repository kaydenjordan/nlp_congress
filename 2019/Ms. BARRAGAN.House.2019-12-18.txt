 Madam Speaker, it is with a solemn sense of duty that I  rise today in support of impeachment.   As this Chamber debates two Articles of Impeachment against the  President for his abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, I want  history to know that I stood up to say that I stand for the  Constitution and our democracy.   When my immigrant mom became a United States citizen, she took an  oath of allegiance to our country and Constitution. When I stood on  this floor as a new Member of Congress, I took an oath to uphold and  defend our Constitution.   The President abused his power when he used his official office and  power to ask a foreign government to interfere in our elections. When  he asked a foreign government for a personal favor to dig up dirt on  his political opponent so he could cheat, the President got caught, and  then he tried to cover it up.   Today we say no more. Today we say we will not allow this President  to abuse his power and endanger our national security. I stand to say  that no one is above the law, not even this President.
