 Thank you, Mr. President.   I rise to speak in support of the nomination of Mark Calabria to be  Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, FHFA, for a 5-year  term.   For over a decade, the FHFA has served as the regulator and watchdog  of the government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and  the Federal Home Loan Bank System. Since 2008, when Fannie and Freddie  were placed in conservatorship during the financial crisis, the FHFA  has also served as conservator of these mortgage giants, charged with  preserving and conserving their assets and helping to return them to  stable financial footing.   As long as Fannie and Freddie remain in conservatorship, the FHFA  Director will play an integral role in setting the strategic direction,  the guardrails, and the day-to-day management of these companies, which  have a combined $5 trillion in assets.   It is critically important for the Senate to quickly confirm a  qualified, experienced individual to this important post. Fortunately,  Mark Calabria meets these requirements.   Dr. Calabria is a leading expert on housing and mortgage finance and  a respected Ph.D. economist. He has almost 30 years of experience  interacting with the housing market from nearly every perspective-- academia, industry, trade associations, think tanks, as a congressional  staffer, and as a regulator.   He has dedicated the majority of his career to public service,  including as Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Department of Housing  and Urban Development, nearly a decade as a senior professional staff  member on the Senate Banking Committee, and now as Chief Economist to  Vice President Mike Pence. He has also worked for the National  Association of Realtors, the National Association of Home Builders, the  Farm Credit Council, the Harvard University Joint Center for Housing  Studies, and recently at the CATO Institute as director of financial  regulation studies.   Over the course of his public service career, Dr. Calabria has worked  to champion market reforms that benefit consumers and enhance the  safety and soundness of our housing finance system. He also has a long  history of working across the aisle to deliver meaningful and lasting  reforms.   As an official at HUD, Dr. Calabria oversaw HUD's regulation of the  mortgage market, primarily under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures  Act, or RESPA.   During his time as a Senate staffer, he worked on over 20 pieces of  legislation that became law, mostly in the areas of housing and  mortgage finance.   In 2009, he worked on the Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid  Transition to Housing Act, or the HEARTH Act, which strengthened our  Nation's homelessness assistance programs.   Perhaps most notably, he played a key role in drafting the Housing  and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, or HERA, which established the FHFA  and created the position to which he is now nominated. From his work on  HERA, Dr. Calabria has a keen understanding of the congressional intent  behind the law and therefore also a respect for FHFA's responsibilities  and boundaries as a regulator.    During his hearing a few weeks ago, Dr. Calabria made a commitment to  carrying out the clear intent of Congress in protecting taxpayers while  also underscoring the importance of maintaining access to affordable  housing. Before considering any action, Dr. Calabria has said he will  first ask: What does the statute say?   He is also committed to working with me and other Members of this  body to reach a comprehensive solution on ending the conservatorship of  Fannie and Freddie once and for all. He agrees with me and many others  that the action on housing finance reform that is needed today is the  prerogative of Congress and that after over a decade of  conservatorship, it is long overdue.   As Fannie and Freddie continue to dwell in government control, it  appears that the old, failed status quo is slowly beginning to take  hold again, with the government in some ways expanding its reach even  further, entering new markets where it has never been before.   This status quo is not a viable option, and finding a comprehensive  solution remains a top priority for me and the Banking Committee. The  FHFA can also play an important role in helping us to move toward a  more sustainable housing finance system, facilitated by an engaged and  strongly capitalized private sector.   If confirmed, I look forward to working with Dr. Calabria on these  and other efforts. Dr. Calabria's nomination has been met with  substantial support from the housing industry. Many key stakeholders  have written to the Banking Committee to emphasize the experience and  trusted perspective that Dr. Calabria will bring to the Agency.   The National Association of Home Builders wrote:         Throughout his long career, Mark has proven himself to be a       keen expert in housing finance policy, adding significant       value to key policy discussions both on and off Capitol Hill.       NAHB has full confidence that Mark is an excellent choice to       be Director of the FHFA. We believe he will bring his usual       high-level policy experience, outstanding communication       skills, and consummate professionalism to this important       regulatory Agency at a critical time for the housing finance       industry.    The National Association of Realtors added:         Dr. Calabria's decades of experience in housing and finance       policy have prepared him to implement the FHFA's mission. It       has also helped him to understand the need for enhanced       transparency at the FHFA and a methodical approach in the       development and enforcement of its policies.    The Mortgage Bankers Association noted:         Dr. Calabria will utilize his significant experience in       government and knowledge of both the single and multifamily       business lines within the secondary mortgage market to       protect taxpayers through an appropriate mix of risk-sharing       and private capital, work  [[Page S2247]]       to maintain deep, stable, and liquid mortgage markets, and       ensure sustainable access to affordable housing for all       Americans.    The Manufactured Housing Institute added:         Without question, Dr. Calabria is well-qualified to lead       the effort to strengthen the Nation's housing finance system       and ensure access to safe, affordable homeownership       alternatives.    It is important to have a Senate-confirmed leader at the FHFA,  overseeing our mortgage markets and making sure taxpayers are well  protected from another financial crisis.   Dr. Calabria is highly qualified, highly experienced, and well  prepared for this new role. I support Dr. Calabria and urge my  colleagues to join me in voting yes on his nomination.   Thank you.
