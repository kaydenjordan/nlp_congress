 Mr. President, this week, I have the distinct  honor of recognizing Jim Sinclair of Plains for the leadership he has  provided to his community in northwest Montana. As the senior pastor of  his church, Jim has provided a helping hand to others for over two  decades.   The people of Sanders County know Jim and his wife, Renee, for the  admirable work their ministry has done to support those in need. Before  becoming a pastor, Jim made a living harvesting timber, and those  skills have been valuable with helping the most vulnerable members of  their community stay warm during the cold Montana winters. In addition  to distributing firewood, Jim's church harnesses the talents of many  volunteers in order to provide a food bank, soup kitchen, and clothing  bank. Jim's hands on approach to ministry has empowered his community  to help each other overcome challenges.   Communities like Plains depend on folks like Jim and Renee, as well  as the dozens of volunteers they have mentored over the years. I thank  them for all the hard work they have done and wish them the best as  their ministry continues to grow in the service of others.                            ____________________
