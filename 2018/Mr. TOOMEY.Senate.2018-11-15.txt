 Mr. President, I rise to bring this Chamber's attention  to an overlooked part of our Nation's shining legacy during the Battle  of the Ardennes in World War II: the heroic actions of the 110th  Regimental Combat Team--RCT--28th Infantry Division from December 15- 19, 1944.   As the last major German offensive on the Western Front, the Ardennes  campaign was crucial for both sides. With the stakes high, the 110th  RCT valiantly rose to the occasion. At a devastating cost, the 110th  was instrumental in the American victory. Despite being thinly extended  across the American front on the Luxemburg border, the 110th RCT held  back and slowed the advance of nearly four reinforced German divisions.  The Americans were outnumbered nearly ten to one, and were vastly  outgunned in artillery and armor.   As records have shown, it was not the unit's weapons or numbers that  kept them fighting at this critical juncture of the war but sheer  bravery and strength of character. The U.S. Army Center for Military  History wrote in 1965 that, ``without the gallant bargain struck by the  110th Infantry and its allied units--men for time--the German plans for  a coup-de-main at Bastogne would have turned to accomplished fact. In  the last analysis . . . the final measure of success and failure would  be in terms of hours and minutes won by the Americans and lost to the  enemy.''   While the 101st Airborne and 82nd Airborne raced to entrench at  Bastogne, their defense of the city would not have been possible  without the delaying actions of the 110th RCT. As the soldiers of the  110th RCT dug into the hillsides and small towns of Luxemburg, holding  their position at all costs, the weight of the enemy attack proved  deadly. By December 19, the 110th RCT made its last stand at Wiltz with  just over 500 soldiers. Following the attack that day, the 110th RCT  was effectively destroyed as a fighting force, and the few remaining  survivors were sent to fill in other units.   The 4 days that the 110th RCT delayed the Germans proved vital, even  as Bastogne was surrounded amid heavy fighting. It was not until nearly  a week later, on December 26, when units from Patton's army finally  started to break the encirclement and offer relief to the units in  Bastogne.   History has shown the 110th RCT to be one of the unsung heroes in the  opening days of the Battle of the Bulge, and its gallantry has garnered  enthusiastic recommendations from senior leaders, commanding generals,  and historians. I am pleased to honor and remember these heroes and  provide proper recognition to the lineage of the unit, which resides  today within the Pennsylvania Army National Guard.                            ____________________
