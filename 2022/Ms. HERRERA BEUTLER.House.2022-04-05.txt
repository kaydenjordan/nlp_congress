 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Pfluger for his  leadership on not just this legislation but the issue as a whole  because securing our border is so important for Americans and really  for security in the rest of the world. It is not an extreme view to  make sure that we have control for the safety and security of our  people over our borders. So I thank the gentleman for his leadership  here, and I am very proud to lend my support to this legislation.   I recently met with a Joint Narcotics Enforcement Team in Lewis  County, southwest Washington which I represent, and it is a community  bisected by the West Coast's largest freeway, I-5, that runs from  Mexico to Canada. These officers reported confiscating hundreds of  thousands of pills laced with fentanyl, not to mention record amounts  of other illicit drugs.   They told me, about 95 percent of the drugs that they have  confiscated come via Mexico and the amount that they confiscate is just  a tiny fraction of the flood of drugs that are never seized by law  enforcement.   That means what is happening on our borders has a direct and  devastating impact on the lives of those in southwest Washington and  across our Nation.   A big factor in the success of these drug cartels is underground,  illegal tunnels along the southern border.   Last year, U.S. officials found a 183-foot-long subterranean tunnel  near the border used by drug traffickers to conduct illegal activities  completely undetected by border patrol.   The bill I helped advance for House consideration today would help  the Border Patrol shut down these illegal underground tunnels used by  cartels to smuggle drugs and conduct human trafficking underneath our  southern border.   This is a commonsense and very necessary step to slow the trafficking  of drugs and human beings which is being felt not just along the border  States but in southwest Washington State and across this country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the bill.
