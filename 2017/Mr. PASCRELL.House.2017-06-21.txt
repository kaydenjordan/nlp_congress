 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule.   Here we are again. We are debating a bill to roll back regulations  that protect the public, if I am not mistaken, Mr. Speaker. I think we  are a little bit tone deaf.   Here is a news flash: The whole country is focused on defending blue- collar jobs, bolstering our industrial manufacturing base. Americans  broadly agree that keeping United States jobs from moving overseas is a  top priority. Yet despite campaign promises, the administration has  awarded government contracts to companies that continue to offshore.                                time  1315    You can't make this up. So we say one thing and then we do another.  Now, look, both parties do it. Neither party is privy to virtue. But  let me tell you something, there is a plethora of these before us on  saying one thing when you are campaigning and not following through.  That is not good.   The flow of jobs overseas is not stopping. Just this week, it was  announced that Ford is canceling plans to build the Ford Focus in  Mexico, ending North American production entirely and making the model  almost completely in China beginning next year, as soon as its output  ends at a plant in Michigan.   Yet, right now, when companies move overseas, as the gentleman from  Colorado just said, we actually give them a reward. We give them a tax  break for the cost of moving. Do you think that is going to impede or  help people deciding whether they should stay or go? A tax break for  leaving. The average citizen never gets that kind of a break. I mean,  that is the law. I am not making it up. I will stand corrected, if need  be, Mr. Speaker.   We need to stop offshoring these jobs. And this Congress should start  by defeating the previous question and bringing up the Bring Jobs Home  Act.   Around 5 million U.S. manufacturing jobs have been lost since 1994.  Just ask folks in places like Ohio and Pennsylvania who have seen steel  mills and rubber factories shipped overseas.  [[Page H5011]]  Come to my hometown of Paterson, New Jersey, formerly the hub of the  textile manufacturing industry.   My bill eliminates this tax deduction to those companies and those  corporations who want to bring their jobs overseas, and it gives a tax  credit of up to 20 percent of the cost to U.S. businesses that bring  jobs back to the United States of America. The companies would have to  add jobs to claim the tax benefit.   So let's stop subsidizing companies that ship jobs overseas and start  bringing jobs back to our shores.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Mr. Speaker, it doesn't get much simpler than that.   This is not a new idea. President Obama and Democrats in Congress  have raised this bill for years, and the Republican Congress has  blocked our bill at every turn. Senator Stabenow of Michigan leads this  bill in the Senate, where it cleared a procedural vote 93-7 in 2014.   I challenge you, today, to take up and pass this bill to stand up for  American manufacturing and the workers here at home. Talk only goes so  far. Let's act.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has again expired.    Mr. Speaker, isn't it good to hear good news? I just  got this on my electronic device here.   The MedStar: ``Congressman Steve Scalise continues to make good  progress. He is now listed in fair condition and is beginning an  extended period of healing and rehabilitation.''   Isn't that good news?    Mr. Speaker, how are you today?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does the gentleman from New Jersey wish to  be heard on the question of order?    Mr. Speaker, how are you today?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does the gentleman from New Jersey wish to  be heard on the question of order?    Yes, I do, thank you.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized.    Mr. Speaker, I think we need to define a few terms here  what we are talking about. We are talking about tax returns. What does  that mean? It doesn't mean the 1040. It doesn't mean the 278.   In this particular case, Mr. Speaker, we are talking about close to  12,000 pages of tax returns; that is what we are talking about, the  integrity of the House, the integrity of myself and you. I know you are  a person of integrity. And I say it like it is, so I am not blowing  smoke. That is why this is important.   So a 2-page, 3-page 1040 doesn't mean anything to what we are doing;  12,000 pages, just on this President's tax returns.   The stunning potential conflicts of interest are piling up. Every  day, we  [[Page H5015]]  all read about it. The President was told by the Ethics Commission,  divest yourself of your holdings. That doesn't mean you give your money  away, your assets away. It means what it says, you divest.   But I think that there is nothing more of a threat to the integrity  of our House than ignoring our duties, to provide a check and a balance  to the executive branch. To restore the dignity of the House, we must  use our authority to request the President's tax returns. Give the  American people the transparency that they deserve.   In addition, it is reported that the President's hotel in Washington  received $270,000 from Saudi Arabia when they were here to lobby  against the bill allowing families of 9/11 victims to sue the Saudi  Government.   Now, last week, the District of Columbia and Maryland filed a lawsuit  against the President, arguing that he is violating the anticorruption  clauses in the Constitution by allowing his businesses to accept  payments from foreign governments and other government entities. We  have no way of knowing whether the President or his firms have received  Russian income or loans or entered into Russian-linked partnerships. In  fact, you are going to read a lot about that this week. There are  hearings going on as we speak. A certified letter from paid attorneys  does nothing to assuage these concerns.   Two weeks ago, we heard from the former Director of the FBI, James  Comey, who confirmed that the President tried to influence him to stop  the Russian investigation.   Isn't it great that we live in a body where they can't stop us? The  President can't stop us. We can only stop ourselves.   The legislative branch has the responsibility and authority to check  the executive branch, and section 6103, you have heard me say that  number many times, section 6103 of the Tax Code, which allows for the  examination of tax returns--that authority, put in place specifically  so Congress could examine conflicts of interest following that scandal  which we all know about in 1923.   Nothing could be more of a threat, to me, to the integrity of the  House and our Members, than ignoring our duty to fully examine the  personal financial entanglements of this President or any President,  and particularly those, at this time, which we are reading about, that  he may have with the Russian entities and individuals or whether he  abused the tax laws of this country.   We have a right to know who our public officials are and what  investments they have made, and every member of the executive branch of  government--and this was made clear in the decision in 1924,  particularly Interior Secretary Fall at that time, to examine his tax  records, and that is how people were brought to justice in 1924.   It also protects the privacy of the very taxpayer. And we are having  exceptions. We have exceptions to that. Three years ago, we had an  exception in the Ways and Means Committee.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does the gentleman have any further argument  on whether this resolution constitutes a question of the privileges of  the House?    Yes, it does constitute a question of privilege, Mr.  Speaker.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Then the gentleman will confine his remarks  to the question of the privileges of the House.    Yes, I can, Mr. Speaker. May I continue?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. As long as the gentleman confines his  remarks to the question of privilege.    Very good. Thank you.   Just let me say this in conclusion: if and when, if and when such  conflicts are revealed, I don't want to say to you, my constituents,  that we had the power to review the conflicts, but we chose not to. I,  for one, do not want my integrity or the integrity of my brothers and  sisters on this floor to be demeaned by a shameful failure. To restore  the dignity of the House is what this privilege is all about.   I have a question of the Speaker at this particular time, if I may.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman may inquire.    I think that I would like to present today what  Congress should do immediately about the question of privilege before  us. May I proceed?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. As long as it pertains to the question of  privilege.    The Chair is good on that answer, Mr. Speaker.   I think that we should do this. I think we should require the  President and the Vice President, whomever that will be in the future,  for now, and their families, to resolve their conflicts of interest by  selling their assets, using a truly independent asset manager.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman's remarks are wandering from  the question of privilege.    I don't believe so, Mr. Speaker.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. You might not believe so, but the Chair  does.    I don't believe so, Mr. Speaker.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. You might not believe so, but the Chair  does.    But I am compelled to follow your direction.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. If the gentleman has no further argument on  the question of privilege, the Chair is prepared to rule.    Well, my final comment is this: I know you don't take  the question of integrity lightly. That is not a joking matter at all.  Nor do I take the integrity of the President of the United States  lightly. I have an obligation and a responsibility.   As I said on February 1, I will not yield. This is important to all  of us, and it is not partisan. Read my letter of February 1.   I thank the Chair for his indulgence.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair is prepared to rule.   The gentleman from Texas seeks to offer a resolution as a question of  the privileges of the House under rule IX.   In evaluating the resolution under rule IX, the Chair must determine  whether the resolution affects ``the rights of the House collectively,  its safety, dignity, and the integrity of its proceedings.''   The first resolving clause of the resolution offered by the gentleman  from Texas seeks tax returns and tax return information of the  President and certain of his business entities.   Section 702 of the House Rules and Manual states that ``rule IX is  concerned not with the privileges of the Congress, as a legislative  branch, but only with the privileges of the House, as a House.''   As the Chair ruled on March 28, 2017, a resolution offered under rule  IX seeking information from actors entirely extramural to the House,  such as the President and certain business entities in which the  President may be involved, is not uniquely concerned with the  privileges of the House, as a House. Accordingly, the resolution  offered by the gentleman from Texas does not constitute a question of  privilege under rule IX.
