 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 99, I  call up the bill (H.R. 428) to survey the gradient boundary along the  Red River in the States of Oklahoma and Texas, and for other purposes,  and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 428         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Red River Gradient Boundary       Survey Act''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Affected area.--        (A) In general.--The term ``affected area'' means land       along the approximately 116-mile stretch of the Red River,       from its confluence with the north fork of the Red River on       the West to the 98th meridian on the east.        (B) Exclusions.--The term ``affected area'' does not       include the portion of the Red River within the boundary       depicted on the survey prepared by the Bureau of Land       Management entitled ``Township 5 South, Range 14 West, of the       Indian Meridian, Oklahoma, Dependent Resurvey and Survey''       and dated February 28, 2006.        (2) Gradient boundary survey method.--The term ``gradient       boundary survey method'' means the measurement technique used       to locate the South Bank boundary line in accordance with the       methodology established in Oklahoma v. Texas, 261 U.S. 340       (1923) (recognizing that the boundary line along the Red       River is subject to change due to erosion and accretion).        (3) Landowner.--The term ``landowner'' means any       individual, group, association, corporation, federally       recognized Indian tribe or member of such an Indian tribe, or       other private or governmental legal entity that owns an       interest in land in the affected area.        (4) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary       of the Interior, acting through the Director of the Bureau of       Land Management.        (5) South bank.--The term ``South Bank'' means the water-      washed and relatively permanent elevation or acclivity       (commonly known as a ``cut bank'') along the southerly or       right side of the Red River that--        (A) separates the bed of that river from the adjacent       upland, whether valley or hill; and        (B) usually serves, as specified in the fifth paragraph of       Oklahoma v. Texas, 261 U.S. 340 (1923)--        (i) to confine the waters within the bed; and        (ii) to preserve the course of the river.        (6) South bank boundary line.--The term ``South Bank       boundary line'' means the boundary, with respect to title and       ownership, between the States of Oklahoma and Texas       identified through the gradient boundary survey method that       does not impact or alter the permanent political boundary       line between the States along the Red River, as outlined       under article II, section B of the Red River Boundary Compact       enacted by the States and consented to by Congress pursuant       to Public Law 106-288 (114 Stat. 919).

SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.         There is authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary to       carry out this Act $1,000,000.     I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and insert  extraneous material on H.R. 428.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Thornberry), the sponsor of this piece of legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. McClintock), chairman of the Committee on Natural  Resources' Subcommittee on Federal Lands that deals with this area.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. LaMalfa), chairman of the Committee on Natural  Resources' Subcommittee on Indian, Insular and Alaska Native Affairs.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert), who understands this, who is  coming from that State, and who also serves as the vice chairman of the  entire Resources Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Now, in summary of what we have heard today, this situation is a  result  [[Page H1159]]  of a silly and suspect survey that has slapped the citizens with  uncertainty and soured them for the security because seizing citizen  sites has taken place.   The question was asked: Where is BLM? That is a good question. Where  is BLM? They started this problem 8 years ago and have yet to do  anything to try and solve the problem. That is why this bill is here  before us because BLM has not done their job. Using a poor survey  process, they have simply put people who have done nothing wrong in  doubt of their ownership of their property which they have had for  generations and have been paying taxes on for years. Yet, in 8 long  years, BLM has done nothing to solve the situation to give them the  certainty so they know where they stand.   That is why the private citizens went to court. The only reason it is  in court is because these private citizens were so frustrated with BLM  taking so long to do something that could have been done within a  matter of weeks, and yet it is now 8 years into a process simply  because BLM used a flawed survey. Instead of using the gradient  boundary survey method that the Supreme Court suggests, they did  something else which brought them to the unusual conclusion that BLM  actually owned 90,000 acres of land on this riverbank that they have  never had in their history.   Later, they realized that was an unusual claim, so they lowered it  down to: I own 30,000 acres of land--but 30,000 acres of land that has  been in private property for years, for generations, they have been  paying taxes on it, and now their land is in limbo. They can't do  anything simply because BLM has refused to do its job.   It is not just here in Texas. Go across the State boundary to  Louisiana where Lake Bistineau has the exact same problem with the  exact same survey problems from the same agency, BLM. Go all the way to  Colorado with Elkhorn Ranch. Once again, survey problems done by BLM  which placed claims on private property that are exorbitant and yet  moves at a snail's pace to try and solve the problem.   One of the first issues I dealt with when I came to Congress was Hyde  Park, and, once again, the Federal Government--this time it was the  Forest Service--taking claim on lands that had been, for generations,  in private property and refusing to try and work with the property  owners to solve the problem. That is what has been going on for 8 long  years with the boundary line between Texas and Oklahoma.   Why are we coming here with a bill? Simply because you have got to  solve the problem. You have got to fix the problem for people.   I have to also say something. The misrepresentation of the BLM  planning rule that was presented is a total misrepresentation. In fact,  when we removed that rule, the 2.0 planning rule, we did it because  people want to have their voices heard and are eliminated if that  planning rule goes into effect. That is why it has to stop, so this  type of situation does not happen again.   Some people have said this may be an unprecedented concept. Actually,  our realization that somebody has to handle the situation by actually  allowing Oklahoma and Texas to pick qualified surveyors, do the  survey--and do the survey--and then coordinate with the tribes so they  come up with a process, that is exactly what should have happened in  2009. Because BLM didn't do it, we are going to bring a bill to make  sure they actually get something done.   This has been supported by the Texas and Oklahoma Farm Bureaus, the  Texas General Land Office, Texas Southwest Cattle Raisers Association,  and the people who live in this area who want to have some kind of  conclusion so they can have their property rights respected.   Now, it has been said what we are doing is unprecedented--perhaps.  What we are doing is trying to solve the problem to help people; and if  it takes an unprecedented action by Congress to solve people's problem  and let them move on with their lives, then that is the responsibility  of Congress. We are the ones who establish what the policies should be,  not some executive branch agency of government. It is our  responsibility.   We are doing exactly what the people expect us to do by saying 8  years of unexpected and unanswered questions is far too long. Solve the  problem and help people so they know what is their private property and  what is not their private property and they can move on with their  lives. If that is unprecedented, then it is about time we did something  that is unprecedented. That is important.   That is why this bill is here, and that is why this bill is here now.  It is coming at the beginning of the session because we cannot wait  longer for the BLM to actually do what they should have done in 2009.   Now, Mr. Speaker, I want you to realize we are here on Valentine's  Day. There is nothing special about that, but this is an issue where  there has been no love lost. In fact, the landowners along this river  have been simply soaked. But deep in the heart of Texas--all right, I  know it is a boundary line, but I have got to get the heart in there  some way. Deep in the heart of Texas, we are coming forth with a bill  that is showing that the love for people who have paid their taxes and  lived on this land for generations is not forgotten and that BLM has  committed a crime of the heart with this land grab.   Indeed, Chairman Thornberry has passionately defended the interests  of his constituents who just want to know the government loves them.  That is why this bill is here. That is why it needs to be supported,  and that is why I urge you to vote ``yes.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
