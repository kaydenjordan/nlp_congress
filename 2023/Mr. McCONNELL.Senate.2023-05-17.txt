 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, yesterday, President Biden took one  step toward the debt limit solution we have been laying out for him  literally for months.   After meeting with Speaker McCarthy, the President, finally-- finally--designated specific members of his staff to negotiate with the  Speaker's office directly.   I am glad the President has taken the advice that I gave him back in  February; that this would ultimately end in a negotiation between the  President and the Speaker. It is encouraging that the White House is  now engaging seriously with the only counterpart who can help deliver  an actual solution. But because it took the President 3 months to start  dealing in reality, we now have a time problem.   So I am hopeful the President's team will join with House Republicans  to produce a responsible spending agreement to raise the debt ceiling,  and I will continue to support Speaker McCarthy 100 percent.    Mr. President, I just wanted to say to our new  colleague: Welcome to the Senate, and an outstanding opening speech. I  look forward to serving with you for many years to come.
