 Mr. Speaker, on Memorial Day, we honor  veterans who paid the ultimate sacrifice to protect our country.   Many veterans return home with lasting effects on their health and  well-being. This Congress should honor their service by making sure  they have access to quality healthcare, food, and housing.   The default on America act undermines this commitment. To preserve  tax cuts for billionaires, their plan would cut veterans' benefits and  programs by 22 percent.   We are told that if they don't get everything they want, they will  force a default, sending our economy into a spiral.  [[Page H2560]]    Under President Trump, the debt ceiling was raised three times. Now,  by holding veterans' and other American priorities hostage, they are  putting politics over people.   I urge my colleagues to honor our commitment to those who have served  and end this manufactured crisis.                            ____________________
