 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, it has been almost 5 years to the day that 20 6- and 7- year-old babies were slaughtered in Newtown. It has been about a year- and-a-half since 49 people were killed in my home State of Florida, 58  more being injured. In October, 59 people were killed and 500 injured  at an outdoor concert in Las Vegas. And in November, 26 people were  killed and injured as they worshiped in Sutherland Springs, Texas. The  response to all of this tragedy is a bill to make it easier for people  to carry concealed weapons in every corner of this country.   I don't know whose idea--other than the gun corporations, I don't  know whose idea it was that this would be the way that we honor the  memories of those who have been killed, that instead of commonsense gun  safety legislation that the overwhelming majority of people in this  country support, we get a bill to make it possible to carry concealed  weapons in every State, in every corner of this country.   When my friends on the other side say this doesn't override any laws,  that is absolutely untrue. In States that have State laws that govern  where you can and can't carry a gun, this bill overrides that and says  you can bring any gun into the State, whatever your regulations are  about what you can carry.   This is a bill that doesn't make us safer. It doesn't make us  stronger. But make no mistake, it makes the bottom line, the profits of  the gun makers in this country, a little bit healthier.   As we enter the Christmas season and we think about the 20 6- and 7- year-old kids whose lives were taken 5 years ago today, whose parents,  whose families suffer every day with that loss, whose kids aren't there  to receive Christmas presents, I ask my friends on the other side: Why  is it that we respond to that by giving this enormous Christmas gift to  the NRA?
