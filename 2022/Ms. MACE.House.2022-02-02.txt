 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to shed a very serious light on  what appears to be a seemingly light-hearted subject.   As the world prepares for the Olympic Games, I rise to denounce the  Chinese Communist Party and its worldwide panda propaganda campaign.   From the COVID-19 fiasco started in a lab in Wuhan to China's  coverup, to the ongoing genocide against the Uyghurs and the repeated  and increasingly hostile incursions by Chinese fighter jets over the  island of Taiwan, including when a bipartisan delegation visited Taiwan  just last November, this administration has decided to answer Chinese  aggression with a diplomatic boycott of the Winter Olympic Games. I am  sure Chairman Mao is trembling in his Tiananmen mausoleum at the  thought of our diplomats staying home.   Well, two can play at this game.   Not many people know the Chinese Communist Party has leveraged the  cuddly panda in an effort to soften their image around the world.  Indeed, Bing Dwen Dwen, the panda dressed in an astronaut suit, is the  official mascot of the Beijing Olympics. His costume is meant to  demonstrate their embrace of the future and technology. Or perhaps it  is a warm and fuzzy attempt to soften China's ambitions in space.   China claims all pandas the world over belong to China, and they  charge zoos a half-million dollars per panda per year for the privilege  of loaning these gentle creatures to us. Ultimately, every last panda  must be returned to China, property of the Chinese Communist  Government.   Every year, millions of Americans enjoy these pandas, not knowing the  sinister plot behind their all-too-brief stay here. We should not fund  China's panda propaganda campaign.   In the words of Sun Tzu: ``Begin by seizing something which your  opponent holds dear; then he will be amenable to your will.'' Let's get  serious with our diplomacy and hit China where it hurts. Give freedom  to the pandas and allow them to stay here in the United States.                            Honoring Robert Smalls     Mr. Speaker, America has always been a place known for its  citizens and its heroes who have gone above and beyond. In honor of  Black History Month, the State of South Carolina and the First  Congressional District in South Carolina has one such hero, a citizen  by the name of Robert Smalls. Robert Smalls is the epitome of a true  South Carolina hero.   Robert Smalls was born a slave in Beaufort, South Carolina, in 1839.  Robert Smalls faced countless afflictions in the early years of his  life, but he never gave up. During the Civil War, he hijacked a  Confederate ammunition ship and turned it over to the Union Navy,  delivering its 17 African-American passengers from slavery to freedom.   Robert Smalls then became the first African American to pilot a U.S.  vessel taking the helm of a Union warship in the first battle of  Charleston Harbor in 1863.   At the war's conclusion, Robert Smalls received a commission as  brigadier general in the South Carolina militia and eventually went on  to serve the South Carolina State General Assembly and Senate.   But his tireless work for the people of South Carolina did not end  there. Smalls would then go on to serve five terms in the U.S. House of  Representatives, from 1874 to 1886, for South Carolina's First  Congressional District, the district that I represent today.   So, on behalf of the Lowcountry and the people of the First District,  I am deeply honored to offer a bill being considered today in committee  that will designate the U.S. post office at 11 Robert Smalls Parkway in  Beaufort, South Carolina, as the Robert Smalls Post Office.                          Honoring Christopher Celiz     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the bravery and  heroism of Sergeant First Class Christopher Celiz, an Army Ranger and  proud son of South Carolina who made the ultimate sacrifice for his  Nation during his fifth deployment in Afghanistan.   Christopher was born in Charleston in 1986 and graduated from  Summerville High School in 2004. After graduating, Christopher joined  the United States Army, where he became a well-respected leader among  his peers.   During a mission in the Paktia province of Afghanistan, Sergeant  Celiz and the First Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment were taking heavy  fire from enemy combatants. When one of his men was hit, Christopher  used his own body to shield the wounded soldier as he was being  evacuated.   Sergeant Celiz took heavy fire and was wounded multiple times during  this moment, but instead of having the evacuation helicopter come back  to retrieve him, he instructed the aircraft to leave so his fellow  soldier and many other lives could be saved that day.   Christopher's sacrifice is an inspiration to us all. His heroic  actions deserve the recognition of our Nation, and I want to thank  President Biden for posthumously awarding Sergeant First Class  Christopher Celiz with the Medal of Honor. No one is more deserving.                            ____________________
