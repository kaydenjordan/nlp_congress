 Madam President, I come to the floor to discuss last  Tuesday's 2020 Democratic Presidential debate and specifically to  discuss the topic of healthcare.   Despite all of the political posturing, here are the key takeaways:  No. 1, the Democrats still want to take work-earned health insurance  away from 180 million Americans. No. 2, the Democrats want to raise  taxes on the middle class and on all Americans to pay for it.   Under the Democrats' plan, people will lose forever the health  coverage they have earned at work. That means union workers' hard- fought health benefits will disappear. It means that Nevada's food  service workers and Michigan's autoworkers will all lose their earned  healthcare.   Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders want to replace work-based  insurance with a one-size-fits-all, government-run scheme. At the same  time, the 2020 Democrats want to give free, taxpayer-funded health  insurance to illegal immigrants. It is hard to believe, but that is a  matter of fact. That is the Democrats' so-called Medicare for All plan.  Really, it is one-size-fits-all, government-controlled healthcare, and  it is extremely expensive, even more expensive than I mentioned before  on the floor, which is according to a new study that has come out by  something called the Urban Institute. This liberal group has just  reported that the cost of Medicare for All would be $34 trillion--that  is 34 with a ``t.'' Let's put that into perspective. How much money is  that? Over the next 10 years, that will be more money than we will  spend on Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security combined. It will be  an astronomically large number.   The Washington Post recently published a story with the headline  ``Will Medicare for-all hurt the middle class?'' The subheadline reads  ``Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders struggle with questions about its  impact.'' We have seen them struggle with the impact of this very  expensive, one-size-fits-all plan. The story notes that Senators Warren  and Sanders are scrambling to ease concerns over middle-class costs,  because that is what people are concerned about in this country--the  cost of healthcare.   Working families back home in Wyoming--and I talked with many this  past weekend at our University of Wyoming's homecoming football game-- and people from all around the State are not fooled by what is being  offered by the Democrats in their debates. They know they will have to  pay dearly if the Democrats' scheme is adopted and ever signed into  law.   The Washington Post's story quotes and cites Ken Thorpe, who is Emory  University's health policy chair. He says: ``The plan is, by design,  incredibly disruptive.'' He goes on to say: ``You create enormous  winners and losers,'' and he adds: ``There is no question it hits the  middle class.''   For the middle class, it is a double punch in the gut, and here is  why. Not only will those in the middle class lose their insurance, but  their taxes will also go up.   Senator Warren will not answer the middle-class tax increase  question. She will not talk about it. She dodged the question again and  again. As the Post reports, the Senator writes she will release a plan  to pay for her proposal in the next few weeks, but at the same time,  she continues to duck the tax question. Last Tuesday, she repeatedly  tap-danced around the issue on the debate stage. In fact, Senator  Warren's debate performance reminded me of the Artful Dodger in the  Dickens novel ``Oliver Twist.'' She said out-of-pocket healthcare costs  will go down, but she failed to mention that much, much more will be  taken out of middle-class pockets in huge tax hikes.   It is interesting when you see how this is covered around the world.  The British publication The Economist knows a lot about socialized  medicine, as they have been living with the British healthcare system  for many, many years. It points out that Elizabeth Warren repeatedly  refused to say how she would pay for the plan. They write that she  ducked the question six times.   During the debate, it was Senator Sanders who jumped in to set the  record straight. Bernie Sanders said: ``I do think it is appropriate to  acknowledge that taxes will go up.'' He has even promised to raise  taxes for lower income Americans. He said: ``If you're making more than  $29,000 a year''--and he is not talking about an individual; he is  talking about a family here--``you will be paying more in taxes'' under  the plan that is promoted by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.   Then there is this warning from University of Chicago's economist  Katherine Baicker, who says:         These are going to be big tax increases. The tax brackets       may have to shift.    In last week's Wall Street Journal editorial, headlined ``Warren's  Middle-Class Tax Dodge,'' it explains: ``The only way to pay for this  [plan] is to raise taxes on the middle class, which is where the real  money is.''   To sum up, while Senator Warren continues to dodge the tax issue,  Senator Sanders admits that Medicare for All will raise taxes on just  about everyone.   Under the Warren-Sanders plan, middle-class taxes will rise. Taxes  even rise for lower income families. We are talking about those with a  family income of $29,000.   Here is the bottom line. Americans will not tolerate having insurance  go away and will not tolerate having taxes go up. They want to keep  their healthcare plans, and they want them at lower costs. So we have a  choice to make. We can work together to lower costs without lowering  standards, or we can follow the 2020 Democrats who are pushing for  their $34 trillion, one-size-fits-all plan.   Don't let this Artful Dodger act fool you. Senator Warren and Senator  Sanders support the same plan. They will not lower healthcare costs,  but they will raise everybody's taxes. They will not improve care, but  they will take coverage away from 180 million  [[Page S5949]]  Americans who now get it through work.   As a doctor, I want to improve patient care. I want to make  healthcare more affordable. The Republicans are 100 percent committed  to protecting patients who have preexisting conditions. We continue to  work on bipartisan solutions and real reforms to lower the costs of  everyone's care.   Meanwhile, the solution we heard last week on the debate stage, the  2020 Democrats' solution, will force all of us to pay more and wait  longer for worse care. That is what they have seen in Canada, what they  have seen in England, and what we will see in the United States if this  one-size-fits-all plan ever goes into effect.   Let's give patients what they want, which is the care they need from  the doctors they choose and at lower costs.   I yield the floor.
