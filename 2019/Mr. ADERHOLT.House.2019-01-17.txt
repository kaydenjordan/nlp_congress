 Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to speak in opposition  yet again to this Democrat offer for a continuing resolution. As has  been said, this resolution today goes through February 28, and I am not  sure why our colleagues on the other side of the aisle expect a  different outcome just by changing the end date.   There is, however, one simple way to get a different outcome, and  that is to come to the table and negotiate and talk. Show up at the  table when you are invited to negotiate. There is a seat there waiting.   The people elected the President, and they elected each of us, and  they elected us to do our job. Quite honestly, legislating is a very  serious job, not putting veto-bait bills on the floor of the House to  be voted on over and over again, knowing what the outcome is going to  be.   All of the political points, I think, have been made over and over  again as we have debated these continuing resolutions. I think it is  important that we put partisanship aside. We have to work together. We  all have to sit down at the table and decide how we can move forward.   Just saying ``no'' to a physical infrastructure, in my opinion, is  not a negotiating position.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reject this bill  that is going nowhere so that we can get back to the serious business  of the legislative process. Let's show the American people that we  deserve the trust they have placed in us to govern.
