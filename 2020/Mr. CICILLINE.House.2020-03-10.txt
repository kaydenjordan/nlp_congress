 Madam Speaker, as the number of coronavirus cases  rises, it is important that our constituents have the information they  need to protect themselves, so I am going to use my 5 minutes today to  walk through what doctors and health experts know and what Congress has  done in response.   First, there is no vaccine to prevent coronavirus, so taking steps to  protect yourself is paramount.   As much as possible, avoid contact with individuals who are already  sick. If you yourself are sick, stay home. There is no need to go to  work and risk getting other people sick as well.   Try to avoid touching your face, especially your eyes, nose, and  mouth.   If you have to cough or sneeze, cover your mouth with a tissue. If  you don't have a tissue, use your sleeve.   Be sure that you are cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched  objects and surfaces, like doorknobs and phones.   If you feel compelled to wear a face mask, be sure that you check the  CDC's recommendations. Face masks are not recommended for people who  are trying to protect themselves from respiratory diseases. This  includes coronavirus. However, face masks are recommended if you are  showing symptoms of coronavirus or another respiratory disease.    Most importantly, the CDC recommends that you wash your hands  frequently. Do so with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You  should especially wash your hands after using the restroom; before you  eat; and after you blow your nose, cough, or sneeze.   If you are unable to wash your hands but have a sanitizer available,  the CDC recommends that it be alcohol-based with at least 60 percent  alcohol.   As the coverage of this ongoing outbreak continues and the number of  positive cases grows, it is also important that the American people  know what the symptoms of coronavirus actually are.   According to the CDC, coronavirus symptoms may appear as soon as 2  days and as late as 14 days after exposure. These symptoms include  fever, cough, and shortness of breath.   If you are suffering from these symptoms, you should stay home. Do  not rush to the emergency room, a minute clinic, or another medical  facility.   While you are at home, do your best to stay away from your family or  other people you may regularly encounter.   The next step is to call your doctors and let them know that you are  exhibiting symptoms of coronavirus. They will tell you the next steps  you should take.   If they want you to come in for a test, this call will allow your  healthcare provider to take the necessary steps to keep other people  from getting infected.   If you are going to the doctor or out in public with symptoms, now is  the time to wear a face mask.   If your symptoms continue to worsen, call your doctor and seek prompt  medical attention.   Be sure that your doctor is in contact with your local or State  health department. This will make the monitoring or self-monitoring  process easier for both you and health officials.   If you are instructed to self-quarantine, stay at home until you are  instructed to leave. This will minimize  [[Page H1560]]  the risk of transmitting the disease to others.   Finally, we have an obligation to each other to do everything we can  to prevent the further spread of this disease.   Again, if you do not feel well or you have any of these symptoms, do  not go to work. This includes my colleagues and my staff here in the  Capitol, some of whom have already made the responsible decision to  self-quarantine themselves.   We have had briefings from administration officials leading the  national effort to get this outbreak under control. We know how serious  this is. Now is the time to lead by example.   That is why, last week, Congress approved a massive $8.3 billion  emergency appropriations package to address the scale and seriousness  of the coronavirus epidemic. I was especially glad to see that this  package included several key provisions that meet needs specific to my  home State of Rhode Island, where we have three confirmed cases  already.   This includes nearly $1 billion for drugs, masks, lab tests, and  additional resources that will be provided to State and local health  agencies; $7 billion in low-interest loans to affected small  businesses, to help cushion the economic blow of this public health  emergency; $3 billion for research and development of treatments and  vaccines; and $300 million to ensure those vaccines are affordable.   Most importantly, this bill gives doctors and public health experts  the resources they need to do their jobs.   We have the best doctors, scientists, and researchers in the world.  Now is the time to let them do what they do best without feeling  pressure from politicians, including the President.   I am pleased also that the Speaker yesterday sent a Dear Colleague  letter which identifies some of the issues that remain of importance to  us that we are going to focus on in sort of the second effort by the  Congress: paid sick leave, enhanced unemployment insurance, food  security, clear protections for frontline workers, widespread testing  for the coronavirus, as well as affordable treatments for all, anti- price-gouging protections, and increasing the capacity of our medical  system.   I really want to thank the Speaker for identifying those issues which  remain unaddressed and which the Congress must address in a full and  comprehensive response to this public health crisis.                            ____________________
