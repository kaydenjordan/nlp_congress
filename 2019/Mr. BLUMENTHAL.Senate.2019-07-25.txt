 Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New York,  our distinguished leader, for his very powerful and compelling remarks  and for his steadfast leadership on this issue of election security.   The issue of election security goes to the core of our national  security. In the last Presidential election, this Nation was attacked.  It was an attack as pernicious and insidious as any in this country's  history, although it was less  [[Page S5079]]  visible than bombs dropped at Pearl Harbor and less dramatic than the  attacks on our troops elsewhere, whether in Iraq and Afghanistan. It  was an attack on this Nation, and some of us have called it, in fact,  an act of war on both sides of the aisle.   On both sides of the aisle there has been unanimity, in fact, that  the attack was by the Russians through social media and through other  means and tools of misinformation and disinformation to interfere with  our election. That unanimity comes not only from Robert Mueller, a  distinguished public servant and dedicated American, but also from our  entire intelligence community.   There is only one person in a position of authority who disagrees,  and that is the President of the United States, who finds Vladimir  Putin more credible than our intelligence community and has said so  publicly.   In a few moments, I will ask for unanimous consent for the passage of  S. 1247, the Duty to Report Act, which would address the President's  saying very explicitly that he would accept outside help from a foreign  power, again, in the course of an election.   The proof is overwhelming that the Trump campaign accepted it in the  last election. But even disputing those facts, even putting aside the  President's contention that there was never an attack from the  Russians, the opinion is overwhelming that we must act on a very simple  idea: If you see something, say something.   The Duty to Report Act that I have offered would require companies,  candidates, and family members to immediately report to the FBI and to  the Federal Election Commission any offers of Federal assistance.   It codifies into law what is already--I think we all agree--a moral  duty, a patriotic duty, a matter of common sense. It is already illegal  to accept foreign assistance during a campaign. It is already illegal  to solicit foreign assistance during a campaign.   All this bill does is require campaigns and individuals to report  such illegal foreign assistance directly to the FBI.   Yesterday, Robert Mueller came before Congress to answer questions  about his sweeping investigation and 448-page report. This report  documents compellingly and convincingly the most serious attack on our  democracy by a foreign power in our history. It tells the story of 140  contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian agents. It proves  Russian covert and overt efforts to influence the outcome of our  election by helping one candidate and hurting another. It shows  powerfully the Trump campaign's knowledge of that effort and  willingness to accept that help.   Mueller testified yesterday:         Over the course of my career, I've seen a number of       challenges to our democracy. The Russian government's effort       to interfere in our election is among the most serious. As I       said on May 29, this deserves the attention of every       American.    The legislation Senator Schumer is offering through unanimous consent  now, the legislation that I am offering by unanimous consent now, is  necessary as a matter of urgent national security. We have no choice  but to defend our Nation and our democracy. Given the sweeping,  sophisticated attack by the Russians outlined in the Mueller report and  confirmed by his testimony yesterday, we have an obligation to act now,  as we would against any impending attack in our history.   Just the day before yesterday, FBI Director Christopher Wray came  before the Judiciary Committee and warned that the Russians are  actively trying to interfere in our elections right now, in real time,  as we speak here. He has told this body that if a foreign agent or  government tries to help a campaign, the FBI would want to know about  it. That also is a matter of simple moral duty, patriotic duty, and  common sense.   When asked if he would accept foreign help in 2020, the President  said, ``I'd take it.'' This is much like when his son, Don Junior, said  ``I love it'' in response to Russia's offer of assistance to the Trump  campaign in the June 9th meeting now infamous in these Halls and in the  country.   When Mueller was asked about this yesterday, he said, ``I hope this  is not the new normal, but I fear it is.'' Well, it doesn't have to be  the new normal if Congress passes the Duty to Report Act. This  legislation would ensure that if any campaign--literally any campaign-- were offered any assistance from any foreign government in any future  election, the FBI would learn of it.   Mr. President, 2016 was just a dress rehearsal. We can expect that  the same will happen with greater intensity and sophistication in the  election to come. We have a duty to act against it--taking the measure  sent to us by the House of Representatives, introduced for unanimous  consent by Senator Schumer now, and the Duty to Report Act now--so that  we protect our democracy going forward.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I have a separate bill. It has not  come to us from the House, but it should have bipartisan support.   I ask unanimous consent that the Rules Committee be discharged from  further consideration of S. 1247; that the Senate proceed to its  immediate consideration; that the bill be read a third time and passed;  and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table with no intervening action or debate.
