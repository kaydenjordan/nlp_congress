 Mr. Speaker, our Nation faces an  affordable housing and climate crisis. That is why I have introduced  the People Over Parking Act to eliminate parking minimum requirements  near high-quality public transit.   Parking minimum mandates create a certain number of spaces,  regardless of the needs of people who live there. This could add tens  of thousands of dollars per space to construction costs.   Additionally, many spaces go unused, even as financial costs are  passed on to renters regardless of whether or not  [[Page H2300]]  they own a car. In one study, parking mandates increase rent costs by  20 percent.   Our legislation doesn't prevent property owners from providing  parking spots. It simply lets owners respond to local demand rather  than mandates.   Eliminating parking minimums would also help reduce harmful emissions  and reduce the heat island effect in cities.   By encouraging more people to live close to high-quality transit, we  can afford more housing, increase transit ridership, protect our  climate, and reduce transit congestion.   Mr. Speaker, it is both good housing and climate policy.                            ____________________
