 Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman (Mr. Blumenauer), my  friend, for introducing this amendment.   Earlier this year, I introduced a bill to codify the Roadless Rule  across the country. For nearly two decades, the Roadless Rule has been  an important tool for preserving pristine forests, clean water, and  wildlife. It has also protected taxpayers from subsidizing even more  costly road building in national forests.   No roadless place is more in need of this protection than Tongass  National Forest in Alaska. The Tongass National Forest is home to some  of the most undisturbed, temperate, old-growth rainforests in the  world.   These 16 million acres of beautiful landscape are also a critical  carbon sequestration tool and a resource for climate change mitigation.   Despite these facts and the opposition of many Alaska Native  communities, as well as the concerns of the Alaska tourism and  sportsmen industries, the State of Alaska has proposed to strip this  forest of full Roadless protection.   Stripping Roadless Rule protections from Tongass National Forest will  allow millions of taxpayer dollars to be funneled into incredibly  expensive road-building projects in one of the most remote, wild parts  of our country.   This amendment does not end discussion of how and where the Roadless  Rule should be applied in Alaska and other States. It is much simpler  than that. All this amendment does is prevent taxpayer dollars from  being used to subsidize more old-growth logging in Alaska's Tongass  National Forest.   Taxpayers should not have to foot the bill to construct  environmentally harmful roads for the logging industry in this pristine  place. This is the exact sort of fiscally responsible amendment my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle should support. That is why I  strongly urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in  protecting Tongass National Forest and American taxpayers by supporting  this amendment.
