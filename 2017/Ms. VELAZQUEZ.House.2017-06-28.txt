The truly vicious nature of this bill is  most clear when it comes to Medicaid.   Are you a working family relying on Medicaid for long-term care of an  aging grandparent? Well, with TrumpCare, you will pay more out of  pocket.   For a low-income working mom who insures her kids through Medicaid,  TrumpCare takes dead aim at you.   How about a person with a disability? TrumpCare means potentially  losing coverage.   Why did the Republicans make these cuts? To give billions of dollars  in tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans and corporations.   The President says the House-passed bill is ``mean.'' It is. So is  the Senate cold-hearted proposal.   A delay on this vote is not enough. Congress needs to pull the plug  on TrumpCare, not the American people. Then we can work together on  real, bipartisan healthcare legislation aimed at strengthening the  system, not harming the most vulnerable among us.                            ____________________
