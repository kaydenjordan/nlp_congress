 Mr. President, I wish we were not here facing these issues  yet again. In recent days, our Nation has seen yet another horrific  school shooting. In September of last year, I stood on the Senate floor  and tried to pass legislation to stop these school shootings. There  have been too damn many. I have been there on the ground at too damn  many of them.   Sante Fe High School in Texas, about 45 minutes away from my house-- the morning of that shooting, I got the call within minutes of the  shooting. I was down on campus just over an hour after it occurred. I  saw the tragedy, the tears, the grieving parents, the children in  shock.   Uvalde, I was there shortly after that shooting as well--the horror,  the mayhem.   Too many of our children have been murdered by deranged lunatics.   Mr. President, when you and I were kids, this wasn't a thing. When  you went to school, when I went to school, there wasn't a single day  that I woke up going to school worried that some idiot, some sociopath,  was going to shoot up the school. You might worry about getting punched  at recess, but this didn't happen 30, 40, 50 years ago. Now it is a  brutal reality over and over again.   There are lots of causes that we could debate for a long time: causes  in our culture; causes of disconnected, emotionally disturbed young men  who want to become famous. I think Columbine may have started this  whole tragic cycle where an angry young person seeks to lash out by  murdering little kids.   With respect to becoming famous, one rule I try to follow is that I  will never say the names of these mass murderers. If they want to be  well-known, I hope everyone in elected office--I would like everyone in  the news media to follow that rule as well. They deserve to be  forgotten in utter obscurity.   But we also have an obligation to stop this. Every time there is a  mass murder, there is a pattern that plays out. No. 1, there is an  expression of grief, of love for the community. There are millions of  us who lift the community up in prayer. Inevitably, that produces a  response from the political left where they scream in unison: Thoughts  and prayers aren't enough.   I will tell you, Mr. President, I believe in the power of prayer, and  I will continue praying for communities that are hurting, whether from  a natural disaster or a horrific crime or anything else. But I agree  with the sentiment ``thoughts and prayers are not enough.'' That is  exactly right. We need action.   And what is so infuriating is, every time there is a mass shooting,  Democrats in this Chamber stand up, and they don't actually want to do  something to stop the murderers. Instead, they want another gun control  bill to disarm law-abiding citizens that won't actually stop the  murders, that won't actually protect our kids.   In September of last year, I introduced legislation that would be the  most far-reaching school safety legislation ever enacted. It would  double the number of police officers on campuses, devoting $15 billion  to putting armed police officers on campus to protect our kids, the  single most important step we can do. It would also devote $10 billion  for mental health professionals on campuses because so many of these  troubled murderers had warning signs leaping off the page. It also  devotes $2.56 billion for physical security at schools to help enhance  the security of schools.   When I introduced this bill, it first came up as an amendment on the  much-touted bipartisan gun control bill last year that did nothing to  stop violent crime but satisfied the leftwing donors of the Democratic  Party. When my amendment was voted on, on the Senate floor, I am sorry  to say every single Democrat in this Chamber voted no--all of them,  every one.   Afterwards, I went to this floor, I stood on this floor, and I tried  to pass the bill by unanimous consent. And when that happened, the  Senator from Connecticut stood up and objected.   Now, I have to say, leading up to that unanimous consent request,  numerous reporters had asked me in the hallway: Why are the Democrats  objecting to this?   And I was forced to say ``I do not know,'' because, to date, they  have not articulated any reason. They have not explained why they  oppose more police officers in schools. They have not explained why  they oppose more mental health counselors in schools. They have not  explained why they oppose more funding for enhanced physical security  in schools.   So I was quite interested to hear the Senator from Connecticut give  his reasons. I was disappointed that day. The Senator from Connecticut  stood up and uttered two words: ``I object.'' Then he sat down. That  was it. His answer was just no.   Mr. President, I stood on this floor then, and I said something  that--I said: God forbid there is going to be another school shooting-- I pray to God there isn't--but we are going to find a day when another  one of these happens, another deranged lunatic commits this kind of  mass murder. And if there is not a police officer at the front door, I  said, remember this moment, remember this moment. Because if the  Senator from Connecticut had not stood up and said ``I object,'' this  bill would have passed the Senate unanimously.   If this bill had passed into law, $15 billion to double the number of  police officers on campus--and that was available at public schools, at  private schools, at parochial schools--what that would have meant is  that there is a very real possibility an armed police officer would  have been at the front door of the Covenant School in Nashville.   As we look at what happened, every one of us--every one of us--who is  a parent or a grandparent is beyond horrified at what sort of deranged  person murders little children, but we also know that that shooter came  to the front door and shot the front door open. If this bill had  passed, funding for school security, that front door could have been  made more secure so the shooter couldn't have blasted in.   But even more importantly, what many of us have watched in the body  cam footage is horrific. It is deeply disturbing. But, I will tell you,  it is also awe-inspiring. You saw the Nashville police officers arrive  on campus about 15 minutes after the shooting began. They enter the  campus. They are scared. They don't know what is going on, but they are  looking for the shooter. They are wearing bulletproof vests. They are  searching for the shooter. They are going up the stairs, and they hear  the sound of gunshots. The police officers do what police officers  should do: They head toward the shots. They risk their lives. And they  encounter the shooter and shoot the shooter dead.   The heroism of those officers saved lives that day. If this bill had  passed, those officers might not have been 15 minutes away; they might  have been standing at the front door. The purpose of this bill was to  have those officers at the front door so that when the deranged shooter  showed up and tried to shoot in the door, the officers could stop the  shooter right there and then, which would have meant that not a single  child needed to die.   I told this body that if we didn't act, the consequences would be  horrific. Yet the sad reality--I do not understand why our Democrat  colleagues in this body do not support having police officers keep our  kids safe; why, when it comes to this issue, the only thing that  interests them is disarming the people at home who pose no threat  rather than protecting our kids.   As I said, I wish I wasn't back here today. I wish this had passed  last year. I wish Democrats were willing to work together on really  solving this problem. But, sadly, this pattern replays over and over  again.  [[Page S1071]]    I have two different bills that I am going to put before this body,  but I am going to start with the first one, the one I have just  described--$15 billion for police officers to double the number of  police officers on campus to protect our kids.   You know, when you go to the bank and you deposit money in the bank,  there are armed police officers in the bank. Why? Because we want to  protect the money we save. Why on Earth do we protect a stupid deposit  more than our children? If there are parents who don't want police  officers protecting their kids, I don't know those parents.   We have the opportunity right now to double the police officers on  campus and keep kids safe. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 1082, which is at  the desk; further, that the bill be considered read a third time and  passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table.    So history has repeated. We still don't have an explanation  as to why police officers on campus is not a good thing. Maybe we will  get it. We were told we will get a speech, so we will see what that is.  That is what happened last time.   All right. The Democrats don't like that.                      Unanimous Consent Request--S. 1081    Let me give you a simpler bill--a simpler bill that would spend  unused COVID education funds. There is over $100 billion in funds that  Congress has appropriated to the schools. Under the restrictions put in  place from the Democrats, that money cannot be used for school safety.  That money cannot be used to make our kids safer.   In September, I introduced this bill as well. It is a one-page bill.  It is a very simple bill. It says schools can choose to use that money  to enhance school safety. It says if a school wants to use some of that  money to hire a police officer, the school can do so. It says if the  school wants to use some of that money to enhance their physical  security, the school can do so. It gives flexibility to the schools.   In September when I attempted to pass this, I asked: Why would anyone  possibly oppose this?   I don't know how a Democratic Senator goes home to your State--I  don't know how you go home to Connecticut or New Jersey or Michigan and  look in the eyes of a superintendent, look in the eyes of a teacher,  and say: No, I will not let you spend the money on school security. It  doesn't matter if your kids are afraid. It doesn't matter if your  teachers are afraid. We the Democrats in Congress know better than you,  and you may not spend a dollar of this on school security.   Let me be clear. This would have passed in September except for two  magic words uttered by the Senator from Connecticut: ``I object.''   Now, last time, he went on a discourse about how this was not the  full legislative process, that we hadn't negotiated with him, and,  goodness, that must be comfort to the parents who are scared at home,  that we hadn't sat there in a detailed negotiation.   Every year, this body passes bill after bill after bill by unanimous  consent. Every Senator here knows how to do that.   The reason it doesn't go through the committee process, by the way,  is because the Democrats control the committees, and they don't want to  debate this.   So if you hear a bunch of process arguments from the Senator from  Connecticut--``Gosh''--what he said last time--``this isn't real,'' it  is only not real because the Democrats are objecting. That is what  makes it not real, because they are blocking it. But to say it is not  passing because I am objecting is like the arsonist complaining there  is a fire.   I ask you in all seriousness, Mr. President, how do you explain to a  parent back home, how do you explain to a superintendent, how do you  explain to a teacher that there is something wrong with your having the  ability to spend this money on school safety? I don't know how to  articulate that. I am looking forward to hearing it. We will see if we  do.   Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the  immediate consideration of S. 1081, which is at the desk; further, that  the bill be considered read a third time and passed and that the motion  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    As the Senator from Connecticut walks away because he is  unwilling to debate the topic, I will note several things he said not a  word about.   But let's focus on--he said: Oh, this bill is very hard to figure  out; it is very complicated. Well, the second bill, the one he just  objected to, is all of one-page long. I am going to read you the  statutory text. The Senator from New Jersey is here. He is a learned  Senator. It says:         The unobligated balance of funds made available in the       COVID funding--    I won't read the actual citation, but the COVID funding:         The unobligated balance of funds made available . . . shall       be made available to local educational agencies to keep       elementary schools and secondary schools served by such       agencies physically secure.    That is the entirety of the bill. You can use the $100 billion that  Congress has appropriated to make schools safer.   Now, not a word from the Senator from Connecticut addressed that  bill. He just said: ``I object.'' And as for his caterwauling that the  first bill--gosh, he can't figure out what is in it; you don't do it  this way. I will point out the first time I introduced it, it was Cruz- Barrasso, and every Senator voted on it because I introduced it as an  amendment to the bill the Senator from Connecticut introduced.   Mind you, in the wake of Uvalde, with great fanfare, the Senator from  Connecticut passed a meaningless gun control bill that did nothing to  prevent what happened in Nashville. That is not going to prevent the  next mass murder. Why? Because it doesn't target criminals. It doesn't  go after the bad guys. It doesn't put police officers in a position to  protect our kids. I find some rich irony that the Senator from  Connecticut suggested: Gosh, the purpose of this is to get on cable  news. I don't know if the Senator from Connecticut has difficulty  getting on the news, but I can assure you that I don't.   What I do know is this is about stopping these damn murders. The  Senator from Connecticut suggests this is about conflict with him. I  can assure him, very few people outside of Connecticut have any  awareness of what he says. Why is that? Well, for one thing, when we  did this last time, there were zero reporters in the Gallery; now there  are two. The corporate media doesn't report on this. If you turn on  cable news, they won't tell you that the reason there wasn't a police  officer at the Covenant School is because every Democrat in the Senate  voted against it. Corporate media won't tell you the reason the  Covenant School couldn't spend these funds on hiring a police officer  and hardening that front door so you couldn't shoot through it is  because the Senator from Connecticut objected. He knows--he knows, to  an absolute certainty, that a dishonest press corps will not tell  anybody.   By the way, he made great fanfare of saying: Well, the legislative  text has a bracket. What he didn't tell you is his staff gave him an  old version of the bill, not the one that is filed. And he was focused,  in particular, on the one edit that was made, which was to change the  fiscal year because we are now 1 year later, so it was to alter the  date from the appropriate date last year to the appropriate date this  year. That was the amendment.   He reported: Gosh, no one knows what is in this. You all voted on it.  You know what he didn't say once? Why having police officers--more  police officers in schools--is a bad thing. He didn't talk at all about  $10 billion for mental health program counselors.   I am tired of these games. I told you that he would give you process  arguments and, oh, boy, did he. He said: Gosh, Cruz didn't call me. I  guess his feelings were hurt.    I have also done this a long time. I have seen the political  posturing that too many Democrats do on this issue. The Senator from  Connecticut suggests that this is a newfound interest. I served 11  years on the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. I have fought for 11  years. I have introduced legislation after legislation after  legislation to lock up gun criminals. If you commit a crime with a gun,  you should be prosecuted and go to jail. If you are a felon or fugitive  or someone with serious mental illness and you try to illegally buy  guns, you should be prosecuted and sent to jail, and, repeatedly,  Democrats block those bills.   The sad reality of this body is, if you are a mom at home who wants  to be able to protect your kids, the Democrats are really eager to  disarm you. But if you are a gangbanger in Chicago, they are not  interested in a gun task force to lock you up and take the murderers  off the street.   Why is it an unreasonable question to ask what is wrong with having  more police officers to protect our kids?   I want to show you how little interest the Democrats have. The  Senator from Connecticut is gone. He gave his little speech and ran  away. This is supposed to be the world's greatest deliberative body.  But as long as the press doesn't do its job, the Senator from  Connecticut can send out a fundraising email tonight to all the gun  control groups saying: Guess what. We are coming after the Second  Amendment. Please click here.   That is cold comfort to the parents who are scared at home right now,  to the kids who are scared at home right now.   The solutions put forth by the Democrats in this body are not  designed to stop crime; this bill is. You know, for a long time, in the  weeks and months following Uvalde, there has been a talking point  raised by the left on Twitter and echoed just moments ago by the  Senator from Connecticut that says: Well, we don't want more police  because the police don't stop these crimes, and they point to Uvalde. I  will say, having been in Uvalde right after  [[Page S1073]]  that shooting, what the police officers did there was tragic. Hundreds  of officers showed up at that school, and for an hour and 14 minutes,  they did nothing. They didn't go in and take out the shooter. That was  true even as shots rang out repeatedly. That was true even as little  children were calling 9-1-1 begging for help. For over an hour, they  didn't go in. I agree the conduct of law enforcement that day was  inexplicable and indefensible.   I will say, when I went to Uvalde immediately after the shooting,  senior law enforcement there in Uvalde sat in the room and lied to me  and lied to John Cornyn and lied to Greg Abbott, the Governor, about  what happened. The story they described was utterly false, as would  come out in the days to follow. One of the things they claimed that day  was to say: Oh, an officer was there when the shooter arrived. That was  not true.   You want to know why having an officer there matters? Watch the body  cam footage. In Nashville, those heroic officers who heard the sounds  of gunshots ran toward them, risking their lives. There are children  who are, thank God, alive because of the heroism of those officers. Is  it too much to ask how things would have been different if the officer  could have been at the front door to begin with? They could have been,  if not for Senate Democrats.   The Senator from Connecticut said, gosh, he hasn't had time to read  this bill that he voted on before; that he has objected to before. But,  you know, it really did make his head hurt to have to read this  legislative language. I tell you what. We are ready to go on a 2-week  recess. When we come back, we can do this again. Senator from  Connecticut, take 2 weeks to read the bill. It is not complicated. And  then I look forward to the Senator from Connecticut telling me why, on  behalf of the Democratic Party, he thinks having police officers on  school campuses is a bad idea.   By the way, I would note, even though it is just the Senator from  Connecticut objecting, every Democrat in this body voted against this  bill, and not a single Democrat has come to the floor to say they  disagree with what the Senator from Connecticut is doing. When he  stands up and does this objection, he is doing it on behalf of the  whole Democratic Party. I will make an invitation to any one of you. If  there is a Democratic Member in this body who actually believes that  having police officers protecting our kids would be a good thing; that  actually believes having mental health program counselors in our  schools would be a good thing; that actually believes that providing  funding to enhance physical security in schools would be a good thing,  then come join me. I don't have a whole lot of optimism that is going  to happen. But if it doesn't, this is all going to happen again.   The bill passed last fall. Nobody--nobody, nobody, nobody--thinks it  is going to do anything to stop mass murders. It wasn't designed to do  that. It was designed to assuage gun control activists. If you want to  stop mass murders, go after the murderers. If you want to stop mass  murders, protect our kids.   We can do this. But to do it, we have to have someone from the  Democratic Party willing to stand up and say: Let's actually get it  done. Right now, today, the answer from Democrats is thoughts and  prayers. I agree, thoughts and prayers are not enough. How about  action? By the way, they do want action. They would be happy to  confiscate all the law-abiding citizens' firearms, which doesn't work  and wouldn't have kept anybody safe. How about action to keep our kids  safe?   If the Democrats had that objective in September of 2022, this  horrific murder in Nashville could have been prevented. It should have  been prevented. And we have a responsibility to do everything we can to  prevent the next one.   I yield the floor.
