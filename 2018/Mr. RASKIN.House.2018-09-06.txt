 Mr. Speaker, thank you very much for this Special Order  hour, which we have decided to devote to the life and career of an  extraordinary former colleague, Ron Dellums, the giant who has fallen  and whose death has deeply affected this body. We have invited Members  who have reminiscences and appreciations to come forward and to  participate in remembrance of the life of Ron Dellums.   I just have a few things to say. I never had the good fortune of  serving with Congressman Dellums, but he was a very close friend of my  family's, so, as a little boy, I grew up admiring him.   He was an incredibly warm and dynamic, charismatic and brilliant man  who really exuded love of people wherever he went.   Among his many extraordinary achievements in public life, one of them  was to bring into politics and government service our distinguished  colleague Barbara Lee, who succeeded him in office and who will be  taking over the Special Order hour after I say just a few words, but we  should not understate the importance of that achievement.   Congresswoman Lee served as his chief of staff for many years; she  will tell you that story. Then he backed her for the seat that he  occupied, so she is the proud and worthy successor to Congressman  Dellums.   But I wanted to say that, in a professional field where so many  participants are known for putting their finger up to the wind and  following simply what the pollsters or campaign donors are telling them  to do, Ron Dellums was a diamond in the rough from day one. He always  put his ideals and his values first, and he didn't waver from them, no  matter how politically tough it became.   He was raised in a politically engaged environment. His father was a  longshoreman who was deeply involved in the labor movement. His uncle,  Cottrell Lawrence Dellums, was instrumental in helping A. Philip  Randolph organize the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters before being  elected president of that union in 1966.   Now, Ron, when he graduated from high school, enlisted in the United  States Marine Corps and spent several years in the Marines before an  honorable discharge.   He went on to college and to receive his master's in social work and  became a psychiatric social worker in the California Department of  Mental Hygiene.   He was elected to the Berkeley City Council in 1967 at the age of 32.  He was deeply involved in the movement against the Vietnam war, which  profoundly affected his political outlook and his development as a  leader. He was elected to Congress in 1972.   I will allow my colleague to talk about the various legislative  efforts they were involved in with Congressman Dellums, but I will say,  when I was in college, he was a great hero to college students across  the country and to anti-apartheid activists, not just across America,  but across the world for his leadership for comprehensive sanctions  against South Africa, the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986,  which was passed as a culmination of a movement that he organized that  involved civil disobedience at the South African Embassy.   I was very proud to have played a tiny part in that as a college  student, to have come and participated and submitted to arrest, along  with thousands of other people who did that at that time in order to  galvanize public opinion against American complicity and involvement  with apartheid in South Africa.   But I would say that one other thing that always made such a powerful  impression on me was that Congressman Dellums, like another great  leader for peace, George McGovern, was himself a veteran, and he saw no  conflict between the two. He was someone who proudly served in the  Armed Forces of his country and nobly did so, but thought that it was  equally noble to fight for peace and to make sure that our defense  budget was one that was very closely tethered to the actual military  and national security needs of the country, not one that is bloated and  subject to waste and corruption and graft and embezzlement and  kickbacks and so on.   That has been a historic struggle that goes back to the very  beginning of our Republic. We want a military that actually serves the  people, that serves the Republic, and is not an opportunity for other  people to rip off the taxpayers.  [[Page H7903]]    He was very focused on making sure that our military budget was  really targeted to the actual defense and security of the country, and  that America was a force for human rights and security of all peoples  and peace all over the world.   So he leaves an extraordinary and inspiring and difficult legacy for  all of us to live up to.   I am very proud at this point to turn it over to Congresswoman  Barbara Lee, who has become, in her years in office, also a great and  famous leader for peace, human rights, and social justice.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
