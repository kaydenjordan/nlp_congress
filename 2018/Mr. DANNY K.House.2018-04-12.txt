 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the  gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, the proposed bureaucratic approach of the balanced  budget amendment says nothing about our national priorities, about what  to do about massive and growing economic inequality, about addressing  the impact of globalization on the American people.   It says nothing about infrastructure for sustainable energy, water,  transportation, communication, health, education, housing, the opioid  epidemic, climate change, or Social Security. It says nothing about  addressing the great inequities facing women, African Americans,  Latinos, Native Americans, the LGBTQ community, the disabled, or the  homeless.   The balanced budget amendment would wipe out trillions of dollars of  Social Security, Medicare, military and civil service retirement trust  funds, and the FDIC and Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation trust  funds.   At a time when our Nation may be heading for a constitutional crisis  because Congress is unable to find a simple majority for legislative  guarantees, guaranteeing that no one man is above the law, a balanced  budget amendment would create an ongoing scenario of endless potential  constitutional crises should Congress be unable to find supermajorities  to resolve budget shortfalls, creating the threat of political  extortion by a congressional minority. The balanced budget amendment is  a direct attack on our citizens and our democracy.   Mr. Speaker, let us end this facade of reality and vote down this  assault on real government.
