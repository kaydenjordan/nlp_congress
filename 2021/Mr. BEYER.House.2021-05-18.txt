 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the COVID-19 Hate  Crimes Act, which incorporates my bill with you, Madam Speaker--Ms.  Chu, Representatives Upton and Buchanan--the Jabara-Heyer NO HATE Act.   This is a bill my team started back in 2015 to respond to hate crimes  in Northern Virginia, but it breaks my heart to hear about the abuse  our African-American friends in this body--Democrat and Republican-- have experienced in the last few years. But we are very proud of our  bipartisan, bicameral creation of a bill to address the underreporting  of hate crimes.   I want to thank the families of Khalid Jabara and Heather Heyer for  allowing us to use their names and highlight why we are here today.   I thank now-retired Representative Pete Olson and his team for being  true partners on this bill, along with Representatives Upton and  Buchanan.   I thank Senators Blumenthal and Moran for leading the fight in the  Senate and getting this packaged bill to the House.   Most importantly, I thank Judy Chu, Grace Meng, and Raja  Krishnamoorthi. Without their voices, and without the leadership of  Chairman Nadler, we would not be here today addressing anti-Asian hate,  and we would not be moving this legislation forward today.
