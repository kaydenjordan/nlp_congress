 Madam Speaker, as Republicans demonstrate their  inability to fund the Federal Government, 700,000 young people are left  with an uncertain future. These DREAMers exemplify what is best about  America. They have served in our military. They have built businesses  and contributed to our communities.   This administration has waged an all-out assault on these young  people, placing them in jeopardy and sowing fear that they will be sent  back to countries that they do not even know. And now Republicans in  Congress are turning their back on these young people as well.   We could have passed a fix to this problem as part of a government  funding bill. That would have been a bipartisan solution, and it would  have been supported by the vast majority of the American people.   Eighty-seven percent of Americans say DREAMers should be allowed to  stay in the United States, yet President Trump is holding these young  people hostage for a useless and offensive border wall. This is  unconscionable.   We have a moral obligation to act. Congress needs to stay here and  have an open vote on a clean DREAM Act. That is our moral obligation.                            ____________________
