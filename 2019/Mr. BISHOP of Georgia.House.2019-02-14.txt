 Mr. Speaker, when I spoke on the floor about  finishing the FY19 bills, we were in the midst of what turned out to be  the longest government shutdown in our history. Thankfully, that is  behind us. But to ensure it stays behind us, we need to pass this  conference report.   The bipartisan leadership and staff and the conferees have done an  admirable job. This bill is good but not perfect. It makes significant  investments in rural development; it includes language setting aside  funding for persistent poverty counties; it has a modest increase for  the Farm Production and Conservation mission area; and domestic  nutrition programs are all well-funded.   On the international side, the bill provides good funding for Food  for Peace and the McGovern-Dole Program.   Finally, FDA gets $3 billion, including significant investments to  fight the opioid epidemic.   But I must say, candidly, that I have some regrets. My strongest  regret, however, is that we are not considering the disaster  supplemental today.   The House and Senate passed separate bills a month ago that would  have provided desperately needed relief to our farmers, ranchers, and  communities coast to coast, in Hawaii and the territories that were  devastated by tragic disasters, but those bills must still be  reconciled. The country must get this disaster bill passed, and get it  passed soon.  [[Page H2022]]     Mr. Speaker, the conferees have done well;  nevertheless, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. It is a good  bill.
