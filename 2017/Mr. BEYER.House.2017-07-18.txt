 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Strike subsection (h) of section 3 (relating to exceptional       events).    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 451, the gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. Beyer) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment would strike the language that  weakens the definition of exceptional events for air quality monitoring  data. We know that air quality monitoring data is incredibly important  and that Americans value clean air.   I am a businessman, and it is axiomatic that we can't manage what we  can't measure.   Just last month, The New England Journal of Medicine published a  study that showed long-term exposure to air pollution increases  mortality for all Americans, but particularly those that are self- identified as racial minorities or people with low incomes.   That is why the EPA is responsible for setting the National Ambient  Air Quality Standards, or NAAQS, for outdoor--ambient--air to protect  our public health and the environment.   When States and the EPA identify areas that do not meet the  standards, States prepare their own plans specifying how they will  reach attainment in those areas.   States are currently allowed to exclude monitoring data for periods  affected by exceptional events--exceptional events like forest fires or  unusual weather conditions, volcanos or seismic activities. They can  exclude this data from the measurements used to make designation  decisions. This is appropriate and it makes sense.   I think volcanos are exceptional. But this bill changes the  exceptions provision in dangerous ways. It changes the definition of  what qualifies as exceptional. Instead of exceptional, call it routine.  Stagnant air, high temperature, or a lack of precipitation are not  exceptional events, but they would be considered exceptional by this  bill.   We live in Washington, D.C., with a record number of days of high  temperatures this summer already. But this fact shouldn't exempt D.C.  from keeping accurate NAAQS data.   Pretending that a heat wave is exceptional or that bad air quality is  not harmful to people's health doesn't make it so. Climate change,  global warming, and more frequent heat waves are likely to be the  reality of our Earth today. So weakening this definition means that, by  default, over time, States will never need to be in compliance with the  NAAQS. They can say it is an exceptional event.   So, frustratingly, by weakening this definition of exceptional  events, we nullify the standards altogether.   None of us wants to see the disastrous smog events--think of China  and India--erupt here in America. So by supporting this amendment, we  keep our commitment to the American people to support clean air. We  shouldn't weaken our definition of exceptional events to incorporate  everyday air occurrences like heat waves.   If this provision becomes law, it can mean more asthma attacks,  cardiovascular and respiratory harm, emergency visits, and even early  deaths from ozone pollution. So please support my amendment. It is  important that if we have standards that they actually mean something.  Exceptional is defined as unusual. Exceptional does not mean typical.  Let's keep it that way.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for the perspective on  corn. As someone who very much respects American agriculture, the worst  thing is to have a drought.   Around here, climate change is pretty controversial. We seem to  slowly be moving in the recognition that it is real, whether we believe  that it is caused by man or not. However, one of the things that we see  around the world with climate change is the ever-increasing frequency  of droughts.   The existing language in the original bill says that droughts and  lack of precipitation are not considered exceptional events. Certainly,  if they weren't exceptional before, they are going to be even less  exceptional as we move into the future.   I appreciated the debate on the last amendment from my friend, Mr.  Tonko, where he talked about the EPA Administrator saying: May, may,  may. Well, this is a case where the last thing we want to do is make  something like a drought a typical event. It is not going to be  exceptional in the years to come.   So, let's preserve these. The EPA Administrator will always have an  opportunity in the case of a drought once every 100 years to say that  is, in fact, exceptional.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia  will be postponed.                     Amendment No. 4 Offered by Mr. Polis    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4  printed in House Report 115-229.
