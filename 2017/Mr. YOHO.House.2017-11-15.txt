 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of my bill, H.R. 3893, which renames the  post office in Interlachen, Florida, to honor a great American hero,  Robert H. Jenkins, Jr.   Robert H. Jenkins, Jr., enlisted in the Marines in February of 1968.  In July of that year, as a Private First Class, he was transferred to  the Republic of Vietnam.   Serving as a machine gunner with Company C, south of the  demilitarized zone, he was killed in action.   On March 5, 1969, his reconnaissance team was assaulted by a North  Vietnamese Army platoon. During the firefight, a hand grenade was  thrown at him and a comrade. Realizing the consequences of his actions,  Private First Class Jenkins, Jr., pushed his comrade to the ground and  leapt on the hand grenade to shield him from the explosion. Absorbing  the full impact of the blast, he was seriously injured and succumbed to  his wounds.   John 15:13 states:         Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one's life       for one's friend.    On April 20, 1970, the Medal of Honor was presented to his family at  the White House by Vice President Agnew.   Private First Class Jenkins, Jr., is buried at Sister Spring Baptist  Cemetery in Interlachen, Florida.   The sacrifice Private First Class Jenkins, Jr., made cannot be  understated. Naming his hometown post office after him is just one  small way we as a nation can continue to honor this American hero.
