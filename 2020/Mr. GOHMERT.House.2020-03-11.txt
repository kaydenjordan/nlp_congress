 Madam Speaker, I appreciate my friend yielding to me,  and I appreciate my colleague, Ms. Lofgren's comments.    Any law that is based on a lie has a good chance of being a problem.  The lie starts with the initial FISA, the Foreign Intelligence  Surveillance Act. Yet, it is not foreign.   Now, since I have been here, whether it is the PATRIOT Act or  reauthorizing the FISA court, we are told: Look, American citizens have  nothing to worry about because the only American citizen that gets  caught up through the FISA court is somebody that is dealing with a  known foreign terrorist or a known foreign organization engaged in  terrorism. You know, just avoid dealing with terrorists, and you are  going to be okay.   The problem is, I keep hearing, this is a good first step. No, this  isn't the first step. This is the last step, and as my friend Ms.  Lofgren said, it doesn't go far enough.   As my friend   Michael Cloud said, under the current bill, they  ignored the penalty for lying to the judge, which was a 5-year  sentence. Now, under the new law, they can ignore an 8-year sentence.  That doesn't really help preserve anybody's rights.   This was not done in the committee. It did not have proper debate.  The secret court had the bill pulled away from the full committee, so  we couldn't debate it. We couldn't discuss it, and it was pulled into a  secret negotiation that many of us were not part of.   Look, having the Attorney General sign it doesn't work either, and it  shouldn't be a special category for Federal elected officials. In fact,  what it should be is all Americans.   Acting Attorney General Rosenstein, he signed off on one of the  applications himself. Obviously, that is not a deterrent.   We need to fix the FISA court. This doesn't do it, and I will vote  ``no'' until we have adequate reforms that do.
