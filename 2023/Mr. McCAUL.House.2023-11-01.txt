 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 559) declaring it is the policy of the United  States that a nuclear Islamic Republic of Iran is not acceptable.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 559         Whereas an Islamic Republic of Iran that possesses a       nuclear weapon would be an unacceptable threat to regional       and global security;        Whereas Iran continues to enrich and stockpile uranium far       in excess of the limits set under United Nations Security       Council Resolution 2231 (2015);        Whereas the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)       confirmed in May 2023 that Iran continues to enrich uranium       to 60-percent purity;        Whereas the United States Ambassador to the Vienna Office       of the United Nations and to the IAEA, Laura Holgate,       affirmed ``Iran's production of uranium enriched up to 60       percent has no credible peaceful purpose.'';        Whereas IAEA investigators found uranium particles enriched       to 83.7 percent at Iran's Fordow nuclear facility in January       2023;        Whereas uranium enriched to 90 percent is weapons-grade       material;        Whereas at a press conference in January 2023, IAEA       Director General Rafael Grossi stated regarding Iran: ``One       thing is true: They have amassed enough nuclear material for       several nuclear weapons.'';        Whereas, in March 2023, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of       Staff, General Mark Milley, testified that ``Iran could       produce fissile material for a nuclear weapon in less than       two weeks and would only take several more months to produce       an actual nuclear weapon.'';  [[Page H5188]]         Whereas Iran is now in possession of irreversible and       dangerous nuclear knowledge;        Whereas Iran's ongoing nuclear escalation poses a serious       threat to the United States and its partners and allies       including Israel; and        Whereas international complacency toward Iran's illicit       nuclear program threatens the global nonproliferation regime:       Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives declares it is       the policy of the United States--        (1) that a nuclear Islamic Republic of Iran is not       acceptable;        (2) that Iran must not be able to obtain a nuclear weapon       under any circumstances or conditions;        (3) to use all means necessary to prevent Iran from       obtaining a nuclear weapon; and        (4) to recognize and support the freedom of action of       partners and allies, including Israel, to prevent Iran from       obtaining a nuclear weapon.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, Iran is a destabilizing force in the region that poses a  threat to our allies and to our national security interests.   That is why I introduced this resolution with a bipartisan group of  cosponsors to make a clear, simple, and vital statement that it is the  official policy of the United States that a nuclear Iran is  unacceptable and that we will use all means necessary to prevent Iran  from obtaining a nuclear weapon.   This resolution is short and to the point. There is no hedging or  equivocation. If we project weakness, it will only embolden Iran.                                time  1415    In recent years, Iran has pushed its nuclear provocations to the  brink, enriching uranium to 60 percent and openly violating both the  JCPOA and its nonproliferation treaty obligations, and even kicking out  one-third of inspectors from the IAEA.   Iran is the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism. The Iranian  regime has funded Hamas and other Palestinian terrorist groups to the  tune of $100 million per year. Five hundred Hamas fighters reportedly  trained in Iran in September before the October 7 invasion and  terrorist attack.   What is Hamas doing right now?   It is waging a barbaric war against our friend and ally, Israel, and  now Iran's proxies are engaged in nearly daily attacks on our  soldiers--on U.S. troops--in the Middle East who remain in the region  to ensure the enduring defeat of ISIS.   Put simply, we need to restore deterrence against Iran. We need to  use every tool at our disposal to keep Iran from having a nuclear  weapon. It is critical that this body votes together to send a clear  and loud message that Iran cannot obtain a nuclear weapon under any  circumstances.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Brad Schneider from Illinois, for  joining me in introducing this resolution. I urge my colleagues to join  me in voting for this resolution today, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Self), who is a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve  the right to close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, we have seen repeatedly through history that  weakness invites aggression. We certainly saw that in World War II with  Hitler's aggression. Our adversaries, Russia, China, Iran, and North  Korea are increasingly working together to upend the global balance of  power. They are enabling each other's aggression against the United  States and our allies.   This body has a responsibility to project strength and protect the  American people. We will speak with one voice as we deliver a clear  message that Iran's nuclear escalation must stop, that a nuclear Iran  is simply unacceptable, and that the United States will never permit a  nuclear Iran to exist.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this  important resolution, which is an important voice of the United States  of America through its Representatives, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 340) to impose sanctions with respect to foreign support for  terrorist organizations, including Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic  Jihad, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 340         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, on October 7, over 2,000 Hamas terrorists invaded Israel  and brutally murdered over 1,400 people. The images from these gruesome  attacks will haunt us all for eternity.   There were beheadings, families were burned alive, and women were  raped and slaughtered, one of whom was dragged through the streets of  Gaza.   I was in one of the kibbutzim right on the border of Gaza last year  meeting with members of the community. I saw their daycare center and  the children who were there. That very same kibbutz, Mr. Speaker, was  overrun by 70 Hamas terrorists. Many of the residents whom I met were  slaughtered, but most viciously, the babies and the children I visited  in the daycare center were slaughtered, shot to death, beheaded, and  burned alive. Reports are that a pregnant woman was forced to watch as  they cut her baby out of her womb, killing her child before they killed  her.                                time  1430    On December 7, 1941, in response to the bombing at Pearl Harbor,  President Roosevelt said it was ``a date which will live in infamy.''  So, too, will October 7, 2023.   The United States must stand resolute and use every tool at our  disposal to support our friend and ally, Israel. Israel has been pulled  into a war with the Iran-backed terrorist Hamas and the Palestinian  Islamic jihad, who have launched more than 8,000 rockets at Israel  since this war started.   We know that Iran has historically provided around $100 million a  year in support to Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic jihad, and other  Palestinian terrorist groups. Hamas also generates hundreds of millions  of dollars every year from its secret international investment  portfolio. These accounts help fund Hamas' terrorist infrastructure.  They pay for its elaborate 500-mile tunnel network--500 miles of  tunnel--and for the rockets being fired into Israel.   This bill takes aim at Iran's support for Hamas and makes it clear  that banks cannot facilitate the toxic relationship between the largest  state sponsor of terror and its proxies. Unfortunately, the media seems  to have forgotten that for years Hamas has profited off innocent  people, prioritizing rocket production over supporting the basic needs  of their own people, exacerbating suffering.   I thank my colleague, Mr. Mast, who also served in the IDF with  distinction, for introducing this important piece of legislation. We  need every tool at our disposal to restrict Hamas and other Palestinian  terrorists' access to financing and hold the countries enabling them to  account.   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                   Washington, DC, February 9, 2023.      Hon. Patrick McHenry,      Chairman, Committee on Financial Services,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McHenry: Thank you for consulting with the       Foreign Affairs Committee and agreeing to be discharged from       further consideration of H.R. 340, the Hamas International       Financing Prevention Act, so that the measure may proceed       expeditiously to the House floor.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this measure or similar legislation in the future. I would       support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees from your committee to any House-Senate       conference on this legislation.        I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 340 into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration. I appreciate       your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward       to continuing to work together as this measure moves through       the legislative process.            Sincerely,      Michael T. McCaul,        Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Mast), the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on  Oversight and Accountability and the author of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Hill), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Mast).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Schneider for his strong, passionate  support, as well as Ms. Manning and the author, Mr. Mast.   Mr. Speaker, I think the gentleman makes a great argument. Hamas  stands between the expansion of the Abraham Accords and the destruction  of the Abraham Accords. They are the ones standing between peace in the  Middle East and war, a war that they provoked, a war that was barbaric  against our friend and ally, Israel. It is impossible to overstate just  how violent and horrific the terrorist attacks in Israel were. I have  seen it. Don't tell me it didn't happen because it is real.   We can't underestimate the determination of Hamas itself. Their  covenant explicitly states: ``Israel will exist and will continue to  exist until Islam will obliterate it, just as it obliterated others  before it.''   I don't think it can be any more clear about their intent. Hamas has  told us who they are and what they plan to do. We need to act here in  Congress, and we need to act now.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
