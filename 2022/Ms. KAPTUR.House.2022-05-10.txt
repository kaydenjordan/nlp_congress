 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chair DeLauro for her leadership in  moving this bill to the floor with such dispatch and content.   I rise tonight to urge passage of this essential $40 billion  supplemental security package for Ukraine.   The battle for Ukraine and what it is waging, for liberty, is not one  for her to fight alone. The world must recognize the true evil that  free people everywhere are confronting. Indeed, liberty's survival and  the global rule of law are on the line. Russia invaded an independent  sovereign nation without provocation. Ukraine is the scrimmage line for  liberty on the Continent of Europe today.   Untethered to reason or humanity, Putin will not stop his brutal  slaughter of innocents. Words and well wishes will not be enough. What  Ukraine needs most of all is reinforcement; it needs arms, ammunition,  combat vehicles, and air and sea defense.   Putin's Russia will never win this war. The courage and resolve of  the Ukrainian people is already legendary, but to hasten the demise of  Putin's murderous rampage, America must act without delay.   Ukraine's fight for liberty is the world's fight for liberty in this  modern era. Let us arm Ukraine with the tools for the fight and put an  end, sooner rather than later, to the bloodshed Putin's madness has  unleashed. ``Glory to Ukraine, ``Slava Ukraini.''   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman DeLauro for uniting all of the  subcommittees of Appropriations to bring this critical bill forward. I  thank her for her leadership.                                time  2045
