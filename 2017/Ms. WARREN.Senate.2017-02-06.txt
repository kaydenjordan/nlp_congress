 Mr. President, I rise today to call on my colleagues to  reject the nomination of Betsy DeVos as the next Secretary of  Education.   It is difficult to imagine a worse choice to head the Department of  Education. Betsy DeVos doesn't believe in public schools. Her only  knowledge of student loans seems to come from her own financial  investments connected to debt collectors who hound people struggling  with student loans. Despite being a billionaire, she wants the chance  to keep making money off  [[Page S696]]  shady investments while she runs the Department of Education. We need  someone in charge of the Nation's education policy who knows what they  are doing and who will put America's young people first, and that is  not Betsy DeVos.   Let's start with her record. Betsy DeVos has used her vast fortune to  undermine Michigan's public schools. She is sure she knows what is best  for everyone else's children, even though she has no actual experience  with public schools.   In Michigan, the K-12 policy she has bankrolled has drained valuable  taxpayer dollars out of the public schools and shunted that money into  private schools, sketchy online schools, and for-profit charter  schools. Even worse, DeVos believes these schools should get the money  with virtually no accountability for what these schools do with  taxpayer dollars. The results have been a disaster for Michigan kids.   Let's be perfectly clear. This is not a debate about school choice.  It is not a debate about charter schools. There are people on all sides  of this debate who are genuinely pouring their hearts into improving  educational outcomes for children. Massachusetts charter schools are  among the very best in the country, and they understand the difference.   Before her nomination hearing, I received an extraordinary letter  from the Massachusetts Charter Public School Association. The letter  outlines their opposition to Betsy DeVos's nomination, citing her  destructive record of promoting for-profit charter schools without  strong oversight for how those schools serve students and families.   People who work hard to build good charter schools with high  accountability are offended by the DeVos nomination. This abysmal  record is troubling because the Secretary of Education is responsible  for safeguarding the investments that the Federal Government makes in  public schools and for holding States accountable for delivering a good  education for all their students, especially those who need the help  the most.   The Secretary is also responsible for enforcing critical civil rights  laws, like the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and the  Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, but Betsy DeVos's  confirmation hearing demonstrated to the entire world she is  embarrassingly unprepared to enforce these laws.   Her apparent unfamiliarity with these critical civil rights laws has  terrified families who have children with special needs, terrified  families in Massachusetts and all across the country. These parents are  afraid we could have an Education Secretary who doesn't even have a  basic understanding of the Federal laws that guarantee their kids a  chance to receive a public school education.   We still have a long way to go to make sure all kids in this country  have a shot at a decent education, particularly children living in  poverty, children of color, children with disabilities, and children  who are immigrants or refugees. That is why the Federal Government got  involved in education in the first place, to make certain that all of  our children, not just some of them but that all of our children get a  chance at a first-rate education.   Public education dollars should come with some basic accountability  for how that money is spent and some basic expectations about what we  get in return for these investments, not just doled out to some for- profit school that doesn't even meet basic standards in educating our  children. This is also true in higher education, where the financial  stakes are huge for America's college students.   The Department of Education is in charge of making sure that the $150  billion that American taxpayers invest in students each year through  grants and loans gets into the right hands and that students get an  education that will help them pay back their loans.   The student aid program is not well understood, but it is vitally  important to get it right because $1 trillion of student loan debt  currently out there will impact the future of an entire generation.   Betsy DeVos has no experience in higher education. During her  confirmation hearing, I gave her the opportunity to show that she is at  least serious about standing up for students. I asked her basic,  straightforward questions about her commitment to protecting students  and taxpayers from fraud by these shady for-profit colleges. Her  response was shocking. She refused to commit to use the Department's  many tools and resources to keep students from getting cheated when  fraudulent colleges break the law.    In her responses to my written questions, she even refused to commit  to doing what the law requires by canceling the loans of students who  have been cheated by lawbreaking colleges. An Education Secretary who  is unwilling to cut off Federal aid to colleges that break the law and  cheat students would be a disaster for both students and taxpayers.  Betsy DeVos's refusal to guarantee debt relief for defrauded students  could leave thousands of Americans saddled with student loan debt that  by law they are not required to pay.   Betsy DeVos also refused to rule out privatizing the Direct Loan  Program. Think about this. As if our students don't have enough  problems already, DeVos is ready to let Wall Street banks get their  claws into our students and start charging extra profits on top of the  already high cost of student loans.   If Betsy DeVos won't commit to strengthening the Federal student loan  program and running it for students, then she is absolutely unfit to be  in charge of it.   I am also deeply concerned about the conflicts of interest and  potential government corruption if Betsy DeVos is allowed to take the  reins of the Department of Education. Betsy DeVos is a  multibillionaire, and that is fine, but for her, that is apparently not  enough. She already makes money off of several businesses that could  profit from decisions she makes as Secretary of Education--several  businesses, at least, that we know about. She said she will get rid of  the ones we know about, but she wants to keep her family trusts and  whatever investments two of them hold a secret--a secret from Congress  and a secret from U.S. taxpayers. She says she doesn't have to follow  rules that everyone else follows and tell the Senate what her  investments are or what they will be in those secret trusts. I want you  to think about that for just a minute. She already has billions of  dollars, but she won't give up her secret trust and her chance to make  investments that could create conflicts of interest while she is  running the Department of Education? Who exactly does Betsy DeVos want  to help out--the young people of America or her own bank account?   You know, I really don't get this. I disagree with her education  policy, but the one thing we ought to be able to agree on is that no  one, especially not some billionaire, ought to keep investments that go  up or down in value depending on the decisions she makes while she has  a job working for the U.S. Government. Because of that concern, I wrote  a letter with several of my Democratic colleagues to raise concerns  about her potential conflicts that aren't clearly resolved by her  public ethics agreement. We asked her some simple questions about the  lack of financial transparency and the shady investments she plans to  keep while she has a government job. What did we get back? Nothing.  Zero. Bupkes. She thought our basic questions about ethics weren't even  worth an answer. That stinks. This whole process stinks.   At every step along the way, the Republicans have made it clear that  no matter her inexperience, no matter her radical views, no matter her  potential conflicts of interest, no matter her secrecy, no matter her  blowing off basic anti-corruption practices, they will ram this  nomination down the throats of the American people sideways. Here are  just a few egregious examples.   First, committee Democrats were allotted 5 minutes--5 minutes total-- during her hearing to question Betsy DeVos on her troubling record.  Republicans suddenly invented a new rule that we couldn't ask  additional questions. This is an important job. I asked President  Obama's Secretary of Education multiple rounds of questions, and he had  led a public education system in the past, but I guess when a  Republican nominee and megadonor is in line to run education policy, we  are supposed to fall in line and keep quiet.   Second, breaking with standard practice and what we did for President  Obama's Education nominees, we were  [[Page S697]]  forced to hold Betsy DeVos's hearing before the ethics review of her  billions was completed. The complicated ethics review raised a ton of  additional questions, but we got absolutely no chance to question her  about it.   Third, Betsy DeVos is the first nominee ever to go through the HELP  Committee who has flat-out refused to fully disclose her financial  holdings. She will be the first nominee in recent history to hold  secret trusts. She was supposed to complete a form that requires  nominees to list in detail all of their assets, investments, and gifts  so that the committee has a full understanding of the nominees'  potential conflicts of interest. No, she wants to keep many of her  holdings in a family trust a secret, so she just won't tell.   Fourth, Republicans ignored and overrode the rules of the Senate in  order to barely squeeze the DeVos nomination out of committee as  quickly as possible. And now, with at least 50 Senators--Democrats,  Republicans, and Independents--publicly opposed to this nomination, the  Republican leadership has rigged the vote so that Senator Sessions can  drag her across the finish line just before he is confirmed as Attorney  General. Why is Senator Sessions even voting on this nomination? It is  a massive conflict of interest. As the AG, Sessions will be responsible  for enforcing the law against DeVos if her cesspool of unresolved  financial conflicts results in illegal behavior, but apparently the  Republicans just don't care.   Let's face it: The Republican leadership wants DeVos, and they are  willing to ignore her hostility to public schools, willing to ignore  her indifference to laws that protect special needs kids, willing  to ignore the giant ethical cloud that hangs over her--ignore it all so  that billionaire and Republican campaign contributor Betsy DeVos can be  Secretary of Education. The American people can see what is happening  here.    I commend my Republican colleagues, Senators Collins and Murkowski,  for standing up for what is right and saying they will vote against  Betsy DeVos's nomination on the floor. I know how difficult it can be  to stand up for what is right even under overwhelming pressure from  your own team to just keep your head down and go with the flow. They  have been listening to the teachers and parents in their States, and I  deeply respect their principled opposition to this nomination.   I have also heard from thousands of teachers, parents, and education  leaders in Massachusetts raising deep concern about Betsy DeVos's  nomination. I hear their concern, and I share their concern.   You know, this isn't just politics, this is deeply personal. It is  personal for me. My first job out of college was as a teacher. I taught  little ones, children with special needs, in a public elementary  school. I have never lost my appreciation for the importance of strong  public education because I have seen how public education opened a  million doors for me, and I know it opens doors for young people in  Massachusetts and all across this country. I believe that strengthening  America's public schools is critical for securing a better future for  our children and for our grandchildren. I also understand the vital  role the Secretary of Education plays in making sure every young person  has real opportunities and a fighting chance to succeed.   We are one vote away from making sure this job is not entrusted to  Betsy DeVos. One vote. We need just one more Republican to stand up for  the children of America, to stand up for public education, to stand up  for college students, to stand up for basic decency and honesty in  government. With just one more Republican, we can say this Senate puts  kids ahead of partisan politics. With just one more Republican, we can  say this Senate still cares about public officials who put the public  ahead of their own interests. Just one more Republican, that is all we  need. Just one.   I assumed that the rush to complete this nomination has something to  do with the fact that Republicans' phones have been ringing off the  hook from citizens who are outraged by the idea of this nomination.  Before these Republicans decide whether to help Donald Trump reward a  wealthy donor by putting someone in charge of the Department of  Education who doesn't really believe in public education, I want them  to hear from the people of Massachusetts, the people who on their own  have contacted me about this nomination.   I have received countless letters and calls from constituents in  Massachusetts, including a batch of letters from a new local grassroots  organization--Essex County #6 Indivisible--that is very concerned that  Betsy DeVos is a danger to our schools. So I just want to share a few  of those letters with my colleagues right now.   I heard from Matt Harden, who is a teacher from Plymouth, and he  wrote this:         I have been a teacher for fifteen years and a parent for       seven. I feel incredibly proud of the schools in the       Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and view my position as a       music educator not simply as a job but a vocation. The recent       referendum in the Commonwealth regarding the expansion of cap       on Charter Schools was soundly defeated by the electorate. I       have grave concerns about Ms. DeVos and her ties to corporate       interests in education. Schools are not businesses, and       students are not products on an assembly line. This line of       thinking is a clear and present danger to our students, and       reflects a lack of familiarity with the public education       system.        In this matter, my concerns are not limited to the borders       of our own state but the equitable access to education across       our nation. Ms. DeVos is not the right person to be an       intellectual and educational leader for our nation--we need       real change and ideas, not privatization and politicization       of our youngest and most vulnerable citizens.    I also heard from Alexandra Loos, a special education teacher from  Cambridge. She had this to say:         I am a special education teacher who works with children       with developmental disabilities, and I urge you to vote       against the confirmation of Betsy DeVos as Secretary of       Education.        I have grave concerns about the qualifications of Ms. DeVos       due to her lack of experience in the public education system       as well as her record of support for charter and private       schools that are not obligated to follow Federal education       standards or guidelines.        Most urgently, as a professional who specializes in       evaluating and treating children with autism, Down syndrome,       learning disabilities, ADHD, and other developmental and       behavioral disorders, I am extremely concerned about Ms.       DeVos's apparent lack of understanding of the Individuals       with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), the federal law that       guarantees ``a free and appropriate public education'' to       children with disabilities. During her confirmation hearing       this week, Ms. DeVos appeared to be unfamiliar with IDEA . .       . stating that she felt that enforcement of this federal law       should be left up to the states. This is unacceptable and       clearly indicates that Ms. DeVos is unqualified to serve as       Secretary of Education.        With approximately 13% of public school children in special       education, it is essential that an Education Secretary be       knowledgeable and supportive of the federal laws that guide       special education services. Please vote ``no'' on Ms. DeVos's       confirmation.    Yes, Alexandra. Yes.   My office also heard from Diana Fullerton, a school adjustment  counselor from Salem. Diana said she had never written to a politician  before, but she felt strongly enough about Betsy DeVos to write:         I am a school adjustment counselor in an elementary school       in Gloucester. I have never gotten involved much in politics       until this election. I went to the Boston Women's March on       Saturday and this is my first time writing to a politician. I       am extremely concerned about Trump's nomination for Secretary       of Education, Betsy DeVos. In my work I support students who       are very vulnerable: on IEPS, in high-poverty environments,       identifying as gay or transgender, and coming from       backgrounds where English is a second language. I believe       that Ms. DeVos' extreme and uneducated positions on the needs       of students in public schools could harm my children. Please       vote against her nomination as Secretary of Education.    Thanks, Diana. I will.   I heard from another teacher from Newton, who said:         I am opposed to Betsey DeVos as the next Secretary of       Education. I have spent my entire life as a teacher--first in       public and private schools for 14 years teaching French, then       as a member of the faculty of Lesley University for 26 years,       and now as a teacher in a Life Long Learning program at       Brandeis. I cannot imagine having a Secretary of Education       who has never had any direct educational experience. I am       also very worried about her views of public education and her       appalling record on civil rights. Strong education is the       foundation of our democracy. Please do what you can to       maintain and improve our current system.    Thank you.   Yet another teacher contacted our office, this one from Abington. She  wrote:         I believe in my community's public schools. In fact, I've       worked in them as a  [[Page S698]]       teacher for over 15 years. The nomination of Betsy DeVos has       me seriously considering a change of employment. Betsy DeVos       believes in school privatization and vouchers. She has worked       to undermine efforts to regulate Michigan charters, even when       they clearly fail, and yet she has never worked in a school.       The marketplace solution of DeVos will destroy our       democratically governed community schools. Her hostility       toward public schools disqualifies her. I am asking you to       vote against the confirmation of Betsy DeVos.    We also heard from parents all across the State, including Leslie  Boloian, a mother from Andover. Leslie said:         I am a mother of an 8 year old who is dyslexic. She is       smart and very capable of learning what other kids can learn;       however, she needs specialized education. Through the public       school system, she is learning to read and continues to reach       new milestones daily. I fear that Betsy DeVos could put my       daughter's education at risk.        I urge you to oppose Secretary of Education nominee Betsy       DeVos, who is best known for her anti-public education       campaigns!        The chance for the success of a child should not depend on       winning a charter lottery, being accepted by a private       school, or living in the right ZIP code. It is our duty to       ensure all students have access to a great public school in       their community and the opportunity to succeed. Betsy DeVos       has consistently worked against these values, and her efforts       over the years have done more to undermine public education       than support all students.        Betsy DeVos has no experience in public schools, either as       a student, educator, administrator, or even as a parent. She       has lobbied for failed schemes, like vouchers to fund private       schools at taxpayers' expense. These privatization schemes do       nothing to help our students most in need, and they ignore or       exacerbate glaring opportunity gaps.        We need a Secretary of Education who will champion       innovative strategies that we know help to improve success       for all students, including creating more opportunities and       equity for all. Betsy DeVos is not that person, and I urge       you to vote against her for Secretary of Education.    Thank you, Leslie.   Kate Brigham, a mother from Somerville, also wrote. She said.         My name is Kate Brigham, and I am a constituent of yours       from Somerville. . . . I'm writing to urge you to vote       against Betsy DeVos' confirmation as Secretary of Education.       The future of our kids here in Somerville and across the       country are depending on you to see the difference between       education progress and privatization.        The majority of America's school children attend public       schools. We cannot leave their futures and the future of our       country in the hands of a woman whose ideas to privatize       school funding have already left the state of Michigan and       its children in shambles. Her personal financial conflicts of       interest are staggering.        The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act--which       DeVos did not know was a federal law--guarantees rights to       both students with disabilities and to their parents. So this       isn't just about civil rights; it's also crucial to families.       We cannot afford a Secretary of Education who's ``confused''       on what the law is. My own 2-year-old daughter benefits from       MA's wonderful Early Intervention program and will need       special education services when she turns 3 in September.        IDEA and the ADA were both signed into law by Republican       Presidents. Disability rights are not and cannot become a       partisan issue. Thank you for ensuring that public education       for ALL will be protected. Somerville, and Massachusetts,       needs it. And we won't succeed with Betsy DeVos as Secretary       of Education.    Thank you, Kate. Thanks for writing.   Samantha Lambert, a mother of four from Everett, also contacted us  with her concerns. Samantha wrote:         I am a voter from MA who has struggled with the change       coming as a result of this election. . . . It is difficult to       focus when there is a new outrage at every turn.         No one frightens me more than Betsy DeVos. Why? The impacts       of her ignorance and disdain for public education will remain       with us for a generation. I have 4 children, all educated in       the Everett Public School System, one of whom benefits from       Special Education.        We have one opportunity to get it right with our children.       I was asked by a conservative friend who was curious why this       appointment brought such a backlash, and the answer was       simple for me. Our job is to protect our children, the       nation's children. Those unable to influence their future       with a vote. There is no mandate for the destruction of our       most treasured institution, the foundation of our democracy.        My son deserves a free and fair education, as do his       siblings. As do their peers. The children in our school       district are in the lower socioeconomic rung. Many rely on       public transportation and neighborhood public schools. That       takes the choice out of school choice, doesn't it? It favors       students on economic lines, furthering the divide and putting       an undue burden on the schools left behind who will struggle       to serve the students that need this gift of education most.        The public hearing demonstrated that Mrs. DeVos is wholly       unqualified for this appointment. Her answers or lack of       answers, specifically regarding IDEA and school choice, were       frightening. As a parent, I was literally shaking.        My nine-year-old son was listening to a portion and heard       Senator Hassan mention dyslexia in her question. He cheered       and asked if we were going to make sure all kids get special       help to read. I couldn't answer him because in her answer,       Mrs. DeVos seemed not to know that IDEA is a Federal law       protecting these beautiful minds. Protecting them from being       a line item that can be wiped away, their future successes       and achievements going right along with it.        I ask you, please oppose Betsy DeVos for Education       Secretary, for the good of ALL our nation's children.    Thank you, Samantha. Thanks for writing.   We also heard from Laura Fukushima, a mother and former teacher from  Dedham. She wrote to say:         Before having my own children, I taught in public schools       for five years--three in Boston and two in Tennessee (Sumner       Country)--and I'm writing to ask you to vote against       confirming Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education.        It's evident that Ms. DeVos is passionate about education--      judging from the enormous amounts of money she has poured       into shaping policy--and I have no reason to doubt her       intentions are good. But that doesn't qualify her for this       job. Here are my concerns:        1) Aside from having no experience in public schools,       either as a parent or a student, she has no experience in any       kind of school as an educator.        2) At her confirmation hearing, she demonstrated a lack of       basic understanding of many pertinent issues and concepts--an       intimate knowledge of which is required to shape good       educational policy.        3) Despite lacking both the prerequisite knowledge and       experience within the field of education, she actively used       her wealth to sway legislators in Michigan away from their       initial support of bipartisan measures, based on a broad       coalition of informed participants, to regulate and improve       charter schools. (For the record, I do support charter       schools, but understanding that there is a vast disparity in       their quality, I see the need for rigorous oversight.) Her       efforts, I believe, have been more detrimental than       beneficial to the children of Detroit.        4) Her suggestion that enforcing IDEA should be left to the       states is very troubling. Such policy would leave our most       vulnerable students very far behind.        While I agree with Ms. DeVos that our educational system       would benefit from some additional choice for parents, I       think she's wildly mistaken if she believes a completely free       market will fix our schools. We need a Secretary of Education       who believes in proper oversight and can help create       effective measures of assessment and accountability to       improve education for all our children. That's what the       Department of Education is for. To run it successfully, we       need a Secretary, unlike DeVos, who is well trained in the       field.    Thank you, Laura.   A mother from Clinton also wrote about how she would be personally  affected by Betsy DeVos, saying:         I have an 8-year-old daughter with Autism Spectrum Disorder       who receives services through our public elementary school. I       believe that every individual deserves an equal education.       IDEA must be upheld! My daughter is doing very well with her       studies because of the supports she receives. She is a very       smart girl but needs and deserves accommodations. I am       thankful there are laws to protect her.        Betsy DeVos thinks that states should decide how to fund       education for individuals with disabilities. I believe it       should remain federally mandated. I wouldn't be able to       afford a private education for my daughter in a special       school. I know there are many more parents like me.        I also opposed expanding Charter schools in our state. I       believe publicly funded schools should be publicly run and       overseen.        I request you reject Betsy DeVos for Education Secretary.    Thank you.   Another parent wrote to say:         I am writing to express my strong opposition to the       confirmation of Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education. She       has demonstrated NO commitment to public education throughout       her life, and her support of charter schools in Detroit has       been a demonstrated failure. The framing of for-profit       charter schools as providing ``choice'' for parents is a       false framing--it provides the illusion of a poorly regulated       and poorly supervised choice for some parents while limiting       the resources and choices left to the other parents and       leading to a downward spiral in the quality of public       education. Transferring public funding of education to for-      profit charter schools, creaming off the children of the most       motivated parents, and leaving the more difficult, lower       income, and children with special education challenges is a       prescription for failure of public schools and will result in       herding lower-income students into dysfunctional schools,       setting them up for a lifetime of underemployment.        I am not a teacher, nor a member of a teacher's union. I am       a mother, and I was  [[Page S699]]       proud to send my son to the Brookline Public Schools for his       entire K-12 education. I want other children to have a chance       for a quality education, not to be the fodder for a private,       for-profit charter school with no commitment to the public       good.        Quality public education is the foundation of a free       society and the key to sustaining a vibrant economy in the       future. Please oppose the confirmation of Betsy DeVos.    A woman from Canton also wrote in. She said:         As a parent of public school children, I urge you to reject       the nomination of Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education. A       free and appropriate education is the cornerstone of our       democracy, but Ms. DeVos has shown no interest in preserving       public education. In fact, she has worked tirelessly to       divert public funds into private pockets by way of       deregulating and expanding charter schools and to offer       vouchers which can be used at private and religious schools.       This is a clear violation of our principle of separating       church and State.        Ms. DeVos's strategies have had disastrous consequences in       Michigan. Eighty percent of charter schools there operate for       profit. When schools look first to satisfy investors, they       rely on teaching to standardized tests, not on educating       children. Here in Massachusetts, we overwhelmingly rejected       the idea, one funded by billionaires, and resisted by parents       and public school teachers.        Please join us in opposing a ``lead educator'' who has       never gone to a public school nor sent her children to one.       Please consider that the nation's future depends on educating       every child, and that to do so, we need to restore and       strengthen our public school system, not dismantle it in       favor of profiting off the backs of our youth.    Thank you.   It is no surprise that we also heard from many constituents  struggling with student loans. One of those was Liam Weir, a college  student from Brighton, who had this to say:         As a college student and a resident of the State of       Massachusetts, I am writing you to express my deep concern       over the potential appointment of Betsy DeVos to the position       of Secretary of Education. Ms. DeVos is extraordinarily       unqualified to lead such a department. The fact that the       President has chosen such a person, with no experience in       education administration in any capacity at any level, is an       insult to the millions of teachers, students, and school       administrators across the country. Ms. DeVos's policies will       undermine already struggling public school systems by       allocating taxpayer funds to advance a cynical and deeply       troubling agenda against established science. I myself am a       recipient of Federal college grants and loans, and I am       growing increasingly concerned about Ms. DeVos's competency       in managing the looming student debt crisis.        Now more than ever is a time for the Education Department       to be run by capable and caring individuals, not willfully       ignorant ones.    A young mother from Winthrop also reached out to us. She had this to  say:         I urge you to vote No on the confirmation of Betsy DeVos, a       singularly unqualified individual . . . among a veritable sea       of unqualified individuals this administration has chosen to       lead our country.        My husband and I have no personal stake in public education       over the next 4 years. Our daughter is only 7 months old. But       I am the child of two public schoolteachers in RI, my friends       are teachers, my friends' children are in school, my nephews,       cousins, etc. I believe in public schools and I believe that       Betsy DeVos is not the right direction for our public       education system. She is dangerous, and her lack of knowledge       is appalling.        Also, and I thank you so much for asking about this at her       hearing--student loans are not a business, they are a crisis       in this country. My husband has a six figure debt, with       interest rates at 7.5 percent. He had to take a job . . .       rather than pursue his dreams of working in criminal justice       because he needed a job that could pay his $1,000 a month       student loan bill. Our saving grace is that I have a good       job, and my student loan debt is nearly paid off--because I       was loaned a reasonable amount at a reasonable 2 percent       interest rate. We are a case study in how the program should       work vs. predatory lending.    That is so true. Thanks for writing.   Liz Bosworth, a mother of two from North Dartmouth, had this to say:         While I am fully aware that you do not support the       nominations for many of President Trump's nominees, I am       currently most concerned about Ms. DeVos. I watched parts of       her hearing and I remain concerned that there was a denial       for a second hearing. I hope this leads to continued       questions and a final opposition of her as Secretary of       Education. Your lines of questioning served to highlight her       lack of qualifying experience but still, in light of this       last six month's politics, I believe anything is possible.        As the mother of two small children and a daughter-in-law,       niece, cousin, friend, and wife of public school teachers, I       find her to be quite alarming and somewhat scary as the       potential leader of that office. We are strong proponents of       public education and of teaching our children to value their       time in school and to achieve high levels of success.        With that comes some anxiety around their aspirations to       higher learning. As a master's level social worker, I will be       paying off my loans until I start to pay for my son's higher       education. I do not want the debt for my children that I       have. At this rate, I am saving far much less money per month       for their college funds while paying off my own. I want my       children to go higher than myself, but I want them to do so       with a level of confidence in their finances that I was not       afforded. Ms. DeVos, highlighted by you in her confirmation       hearing, has not been involved with student loans on any       level and does not have the experience to become entrusted       with my current debt or the debt of my children.        Finally, I would like to highlight my abject fear of the       treatment of those students with learning disabilities,       particularly severe and profound disorders, if she is       confirmed. While I see many walks of life in my field, my       mother was a proud special education teacher in New Bedford       for 33 years. She was proud to be able to teach life skills       like budgeting, simple cooking and social skills to her       students who may not ever be college ready. We worry about       those kids and what will become of them if Ms. DeVos is       confirmed. My husband is currently employed in a       collaborative that works with mentally ill children who need       a different kind of educational process but can still achieve       the same goals. I am not sure they would ever qualify for a       voucher to attend some Charter school.        We are committed to families and community maintenance of       all students with the right care at the right time. I am not       sure that Ms. DeVos is committed in the same way.        Please vote to oppose Ms. DeVos.    Thank you, Liz. Thanks for writing.   I heard from another student in Boston who told me the following:         I am writing to you today as a public school teacher and a       Ph.D. Candidate in Urban Education, Leadership and Policy       Studies. I believe in public schools. Betsy DeVos believes in       school privatization and vouchers. She has worked to       undermine efforts to regulate Michigan charters, even when       they clearly failed. The ``marketplace'' solution of DeVos       will destroy our democratically governed community schools.       She has no professional experience in the education field.       She does not truly understand the nuances of public education       nor does she want to understand.        I managed to earn scholarships that took care of most of my       schooling, but I still have about $80,000 in student loans.       (Not bad for 2 expensive private institution degrees!) I am a       first generation college student and my single mother could       not afford to help me pay for my schooling. Betsy DeVos just       doesn't have experience in K-12 public schools, but she has       no experience in running the student loan department. The       Federal student loan program is far from perfect. We need       someone running it who is knowledgeable in the process,       believes in making college more affordable, and understands       what it feels like to not be sure how you will pay for       college. She has no qualifications of any kind in this area.        I am asking you to vote against the confirmation of Betsy       DeVos. Please consider this request and the thousands of       other people across the country who vehemently disagree with       Ms. DeVos's candidacy.    Thank you.   Sarah Rothery, a mother of two from Northborough, told me about her  two sons, saying:         I am writing to ask that you oppose the confirmation of Ms.       DeVos for the cabinet position for which she was nominated       under President Trump. I have put 2 sons through college       thanks to Stafford loans and personal savings and I think she       has no idea what is involved in middle class families       financing college educations today. One of my sons is now an       8th grade history teacher in a public charter school, Abbot       Kelly Foster, in Worcester, and worries that Ms. DeVos has no       real understanding of urban education as well.    Thank you, Sarah. Thanks for writing.   I have also heard from Alicia Bettano, a former student from Merrimac  who bravely shared with me her own experiences. This is from Alicia:         I suffer from a Non Verbal Learning Disorder. Up until I       was 13 years old I was not diagnosed with anything. I went to       aides, speech therapists, everyone. I had trouble in the       maths and in sciences. I was thought of as stupid. I was       yelled at by aides. When I was 13 and diagnosed, my teachers       didn't understand. They thought sitting me closer to the       white board would allow me to understand better, despite the       fact that it was their teaching methods that confused me. I       was told I would not go to college or graduate. My parents       had to hire an advocate to work for me to get my teachers and       school to understand my disability. It took me some time to       figure out what I wanted and needed, but in May I graduated       college.        Betsy DeVos would be a horror for those with disabilities;       not just learning ones, but mental ones. I was lucky I had       parents and one teacher backing me. What about the ones that       don't? Putting Betsy DeVos into office will hurt our children       in America--that's not making America great.    Alicia, thank you for writing. I really appreciate it.  Congratulations on your graduation.  [[Page S700]]    A man from Brookline also wrote in, saying this:         As someone passionate about education, especially the       education of students in Massachusetts, and as a graduate of       a public elementary school, middle school, high school and       college; as a young professional burdened by education debt;       as the husband of an early childhood educator working in a       struggling Boston neighborhood; as a member of a family       filled with men and women dedicated to careers in public       education, I strongly urge you to oppose Secretary of       Education nominee Betsy DeVos. My vote for or against       candidates in future elections will be informed by whether       the candidate publicly opposed this Secretary of Education       nominee.        Betsy DeVos has consistently worked against public       education and she is incredibly unqualified for this       position. At best, she should be an undersecretary focused on       public-private partnerships. If you must work with the       incoming administration, suggest her nomination for that       role, but you must oppose her cabinet-level appointment.        DeVos has no experience in public schools, either as a       student, educator, administrator or even as a parent. She has       lobbied for, and been employed by, initiatives that have       undermined public education in America.        We need a Secretary of Education who will champion       innovative strategies that we know help to improve success       for all students, including creating more opportunities and       equity for all. I urge you to vote against Ms. DeVos for       Secretary of Education.    What does Betsy DeVos have to say to Matt and Diana or to the  thousands of other teachers who have more experience in public  education than she does? What does she have to say to Leslie and  Samantha, whose children have benefited from the programs she wants to  cut? What does she have to say to Sarah, who relied on Stafford loans  to put her sons through college?   It is not just individuals who are worried about Betsy DeVos. We have  heard from groups across the State as well. The Massachusetts Charter  Public School Association wrote me, saying this:         Dear Senator Warren,        As the Association representing the 70 Massachusetts       commonwealth charter public schools, we are writing to       express our concerns over the nomination of Elisabeth DeVos       as U.S. Secretary of Education. We do not express these       reservations lightly, but we believe it is important to raise       certain issues that should be addressed by the nominee.        Both President-elect Trump and Ms. DeVos are strong       supporters of public charter schools, and we are hopeful they       will continue the bipartisan efforts of the Clinton, Bush and       Obama Administrations to promote the continued expansion of       high quality charters while pursuing reforms that will       strengthen traditional public schools.        But we are concerned about media reports of Ms. DeVos'       support for school vouchers and her critical role in creating       a charter system in her home state of Michigan that has been       widely criticized for lax oversight and poor academic       performance, and appears to be dominated by for-profit       interests.        As the senior Senator from Massachusetts and a member of       the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor &       Pensions (HELP), which will hold hearings on the nomination,       you will be in a position to ensure the nominee commits to       holding the national charter school movement to the highest       levels of accountability and oversight that are the hallmark       of the Massachusetts charter system.        By all independent accounts, Massachusetts has the best       charter school system in the country. We are providing high       quality public school choices for parents across our state.       Our urban schools are serving the highest need children in       Massachusetts, and are producing results that have       researchers double-checking their math. These gains held       across all demographic groups, including African American,       Latino, and children living in poverty.        The cornerstone of the Massachusetts charter public school       system is accountability. The process of obtaining and       keeping a charter is deliberately difficult. The state Board       of Elementary and Secondary Education is the sole authorizer       and historically has approved only one out of every five       applications. Once approved, each charter school must submit       to annual financial audits by independent auditors and annual       performance reviews by the state Department of Elementary and       Secondary Education. Every five years, each charter must be       renewed after a process as rigorous as the initial       application process. For-profit charter schools are       prohibited by Massachusetts law.        Our schools have also created partnerships with many       Massachusetts public school districts to foster collaboration       and best practices sharing, and have forged an historic       Compact between Boston charter public schools and the Boston       Public Schools that has become a national model.        Bipartisan support has been key to the development and       success of the Massachusetts system. Created in 1993 by a       Democratic Legislature and a Republican Governor, public       charter schools have continued to receive support from all       Governors, Republican and Democratic alike, and Democratic       legislative leaders.        If the new President and his nominee intend to advance the       cause of school choice across the country, they should look       to Massachusetts for their path forward.        The history of charter schools in Michigan offers a more       cautionary tale. The same researchers from Stanford that       declared Massachusetts charter public schools an unqualified       success, had mixed reviews for Michigan's charters.        According to media reports, last year Ms. DeVos actively       campaigned against bipartisan legislation that would have       provided more oversight for Michigan's charters. If these       reports are true, we are deeply concerned that efforts to       grow school choice without a rigorous accountability system       will reduce the quality of charter schools across the       country. We hope you agree that quality, not quantity, should       be the guiding principle of charter expansion. Without high       levels of accountability, this model fails.        We ask that you use the hearing to probe the incoming       Administration's intentions regarding education policy in       general and school choice and quality specifically.        We'd be happy to provide you with more information on the       Massachusetts model and would welcome a meeting with your       staff to brief them on our concerns.        Sincerely,        Massachusetts Charter Public School Association Board of       Directors.    The people of Massachusetts cannot afford Betsy DeVos. This is why I  will vote no on her nomination and why I urge my colleagues to do the  same.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    How do you plan to protect taxpayer dollars       from waste, fraud, and  [[Page S775]]       abuse from colleges that take in millions of dollars in       Federal student aid?        Mrs. DeVOS. Senator, if confirmed, I will certainly be very       vigilant.         How? How are you going to do that? You said you       are committed.        Mrs. DeVOS. The individuals with whom I work in the       department will ensure that federal moneys are used properly       and appropriately.         You are going to subcontract making sure that       what happens with universities that cheat students doesn't       happen anymore? You are going to give that to someone else to       do? I just want to know what your ideas are for making sure       we don't have problems with waste, fraud, and abuse.        Mrs. DeVOS. I want to make sure we don't have problems with       that as well. If confirmed, I will work diligently to ensure       that we are addressing any of those issues.         Well, let me make a suggestion on this. It       actually turns out there are a whole group of rules that are       already written and are there, and all you have to do is       enforce them. What I want to know is, will you commit to       enforcing those rules?        Mrs. DeVOS. Senator, I will commit to ensuring that       institutions which receive federal funds are actually serving       their students well.         So you will enforce the gainful employment rule       to make sure that these career colleges are not cheating       students?        Mrs. DeVOS. We will certainly review that rule.        Again, this goes back to somebody who is kind of walking       into a hearing saying: Look, I got the vote. I don't have to       learn about public education. I don't have to listen to       Democrats' concerns. I don't have to listen to teachers'       concerns or students' concerns or the concerns of experts in       education. I don't have to learn about higher education,       which is, by money spent, about three-quarters of the U.S.       Department of Education.         You will review it? You will not commit to       enforce it?        Mrs. DeVOS. And see that it is actually achieving what the       intentions are.         You will review it? You will not commit to       enforce it?        Mrs. DeVOS. And see that it is actually achieving what the       intentions are.         I don't understand about reviewing it. We       talked about this in my office. There are already rules in       place.    And so on--Senator Warren's exchange there is very revealing.   I know Republicans care very deeply about waste, fraud, and abuse. I  hear about it all the time, and I hope they will consider this  nominee's tepid commitment to this issue as they talk with their  constituents about how they are going to vote.   The third issue I am concerned about is college affordability. The  rising cost of college is one of the biggest middle-class issues of our  time, if not the biggest issue of our time. No generation escapes this  problem. If you are a student or a parent, you worry about paying for  college. I know plenty of grandparents who are worried about their  children who are still paying off their college loans and are now  trying to save up for their students.   The Federal Government is giving $140 billion in Federal aid to  institutions of higher learning in grants and loans. That is a good  thing, not a bad thing. That is Federal policy. We decided we wanted to  make college affordable because higher education is the straightest  line for us to develop the workforce we need and for people to move up  the economic ladder. But with that $140 billion, we need to be making  college more affordable, and we are actually getting the opposite  result. Both in raw dollars and inflation-adjusted dollars, we are  spending more in Federal grants and Pell grants, and the cost of  college goes up and up and up. Average Pell grant awards have increased  by almost 20 percent in the past 10 years. In the same period, Pell  grants covered 25 percent less.   We are officially paying more and getting less. This is because  college costs are growing faster than the cost of all other consumer  goods--twice as fast as health care costs. It is impossible to get  ahead nowadays without a college degree, but the growing cost of  college is preventing some from getting a degree in the first place and  leaving others with unmanageable levels of debt. It is clear that our  system isn't working.   If we are subsidizing higher education with Federal dollars, we have  a responsibility to incentivize institutions of higher education to  become more affordable, provide access to lower income students, and  deliver quality education. We want to reward those schools that are  focused on affordability and give incentives for the rest to make  affordability part of the mission. But based on Mrs. DeVos's testimony,  it is unclear whether or not she agrees.   In 2011, the Department of Education sent colleges and universities a  letter that made clear that sexual assault is prohibited under title  IX. It advised schools to be responsive to reports of sexual violence  and gave guidelines on how schools should process those reports. But  during Mrs. DeVos's hearing, she had an exchange with Senator Casey  that indicates she would roll back this progress. Let's take a look at  the transcript.          Mr. President, I rise to express my strong opposition to  the nomination of Senator Jeff Sessions to serve as Attorney General of  the United States.   I ask: Where are the Senators who will say no to the nomination of  Senator Jeff Sessions as Attorney General of the United States? I hope  there are at least enough Senators here who understand that America is  careening over a constitutional cliff and that all of us, regardless of  political party, need an Attorney General who can be relied on to  enforce the laws fairly and fight back against lawless overreach by an  out-of-control President.   On January 27, the world turned upside down for tens of thousands of  people directly affected by President Trump's Executive order turning  America's back on refugees around the world and immigrants from seven  Muslim-majority countries.   Last week, I recalled many of their stories. I spoke about students  and professors, about mothers and children, about friends and  neighbors, real people who were turned away, detained, or deported  based solely on their religion or the simple fact that they were  fleeing war. We all breathed a sigh of relief when a court temporarily  halted that order, but we know the fight continues to permanently  overturn this unlawful, unconstitutional, and deeply immoral Executive  order.   That isn't all that happened last week. Last week, the Acting  Attorney General of the United States refused to  [[Page S851]]  defend President Trump's unlawful and unconstitutional Executive order  so President Trump fired her. That is right, the President of the  United States fired the Nation's top law enforcement officer for  refusing to defend an unlawful, unconstitutional, and deeply immoral  order.   Last week, after days of slow-walking or ignoring judicial decisions,  President Trump went on the attack. He raged against the judge who  temporarily halted his order, calling him a so-called judge and  questioning his authority to act. That is right. The President of the  United States attacked the legal authority of an individual district  court judge, lawfully appointed by George W. Bush and confirmed  unanimously by the Senate, to pass judgment on Trump's Executive  orders.   These are dangerous times. At times like this, it is more important  than ever that the Attorney General of the United States has the guts,  the independence, and the good moral judgment to stand up to the  President when he seeks to violate the Constitution and ignore the law.   At his confirmation hearing last month, Senator Sessions claimed to  be that person. I have to say, I wish it were true. I really do. I wish  the President's campaign had been different. I wish his actions now  were different. I wish we could give his nominees the benefit of the  doubt, but I will not ignore the real world, as unpleasant as it is,  and neither can anyone in this Senate.   In the real world, Senator Sessions obviously isn't going to stand up  to the President's campaign of bigotry. How could he? In the real  world, Senator Sessions is one of the principal architects of that  campaign.   Senator Sessions made a special name for himself for being a  particularly vitriolic opponent of commonsense immigration policies. He  railed against legal immigrants. He attacked cities and States that  focus on keeping their communities safe instead of serving as a  national deportation force. He called Islam a toxic ideology and a  threat to our Nation. Despite the plain language of the Constitution,  Senator Sessions doesn't think that children born in the United States  should automatically become citizens. He wants to round up and deport  DREAMers, who were brought to the United States as kids. Does that all  sound familiar? Well, it should because Senator Sessions was an early  and energetic supporter of then-candidate Donald Trump, and the Senator  played a key role in shaping what has become the most extreme, most  divisive, and most dangerous immigration policies of any President in  decades.   Senator Sessions' radical views are not limited to immigration. On  issue after issue, Senator Sessions has displayed open hostility to the  rights of all Americans.   He has made derogatory and racist comments that should have no place  in our justice system.   As a Federal prosecutor, he got involved in a voting rights case  against those who were trying to help American citizens who were  lawfully registered to vote. Yes, that is right--he brought a case  against civil rights workers who helped African-American voters submit  absentee ballots.   While serving as Alabama's attorney general, he reportedly made  numerous racist comments, including saying he thought the KKK was OK  until he learned that they smoked weed.   He called a White attorney representing Black clients in a civil  rights case a disgrace to his race.   He claimed that the NAACP and the ACLU were un-American.   In a speech in 2006, he said: ``Fundamentally, almost no one coming  from the Dominican Republic to the United States is coming here because  they have a provable skill that would benefit us and that would  indicate their likely success in our society.'' According to Sessions,  Dominicans come to the United States by engaging in fraud.   Senator Sessions is also extraordinarily hostile to any effort to  root out discrimination based on gender or sexual orientation.  According to Senator Sessions, marriage equality is a threat to the  American culture.   Roe v. Wade is constitutionally unsound.   Employers should be able to fire you because they don't like whom you  love.   He voted against equal pay for equal work.   He even voted against the Violence Against Women Act.   It doesn't stop there. On crime, Senator Sessions' solution is to  lock up people for even minor, low-level offenses; throw away the key.  He has advocated for expanding prisons for youth, aggressively  prosecuting marijuana offenses, and eliminating parole or reduced  prison time for good behavior.   During the 2016 Presidential campaign, he heaped praise on then- candidate Donald Trump for having once taken out a racially tinged  full-page newspaper ad advocating for the death penalty for the Central  Park Five, the Black and Latino teenagers who were falsely accused and  convicted of raping a young woman in New York's Central Park.   Senator Sessions is not a plain-old conservative Republican. No.  Senator Sessions occupies a place way out at the radical fringe of his  party, regularly taking positions that are far more extreme than his  other Republican colleagues. For example, when Republicans and  Democrats came together to pass a commonsense, bipartisan immigration  bill, Senator Sessions worked overtime to make sure the bill did not  make it through the House. When Republicans and Democrats came together  to propose legislation to reform our broken Federal criminal sentencing  laws, Senator Sessions was part of the handful of Senators who ensured  that the bill would not get a vote here in the Senate.   Senator Sessions has been a public figure for decades. None of this-- none of this is secret, and much of it is completely indefensible, but  President Trump wants this man. So the same Republican Senators who  once fought Senator Sessions tooth and nail have now launched a massive  PR campaign to try to repair his public image.   That case against the civil rights workers helping Blacks in Alabama  to vote? Hey, you go it all wrong. He was just trying to help out other  African Americans who were concerned about voting irregularities.   His vote against the Violence Against Women Act? His position on  LGBTQ rights? His opposition to a woman's right to choose? Hey, don't  worry about it. He says he will vigorously enforce the law once he  becomes Attorney General. Give me a break.   The law enforcement power of the United States of America is an  awesome thing. In the right hands, in steady and impartial hands, it  can be used to defend all of us, to defend our laws, to defend our  Constitution. In the wrong hands, it can be used to bully and  intimidate the defenseless, to destroy lives, to undermine American  democracy itself.   Senator Sessions is not misunderstood. Senator Sessions has never  been misunderstood. For decades, it has been absolutely clear where he  stands. Now the time is here for every Senator to make absolutely clear  where they stand as well.   Let's be clear. Winning a seat in the U.S. Senate does not exempt a  Cabinet nominee from the close scrutiny that all nominees to lead our  government deserve. It does not change the Senate's constitutional  responsibility to examine a nominee to make certain that nominee will  faithfully and fairly enforce the laws of the United States of America.  It does not relieve the Senate of its duty to reject nominees whose  records demonstrate that they will not stand up for American values and  constitutional principles.   When it comes to the Senate confirming someone to be Attorney  General--the highest law enforcement officer in this country--we are  all personally responsible for that choice. To put Senator Sessions in  charge of the Department of Justice is an insult to African Americans.  To put Senator Sessions in charge of the Department of Justice is a  direct threat to immigrants. To put Senator Sessions in charge of the  Department of Justice is a deliberate affront to every LGBTQ person. To  put Senator Sessions in charge of the Department of Justice is an  affront to women.   I ask again, where are the Senators who will say no to Senator  Sessions as Attorney General of the United States? Thirty years ago, a  Republican-controlled Senate took the extraordinary step of rejecting  Senator Sessions' nomination to serve as a Federal judge.  [[Page S852]]  They had the courage to stand up for the principles that transcend  party affiliation--fairness, equality, justice for all. Their rejection  sent a message that that kind of dangerous, toxic hatred has no place  in our courts. I urge them again today to exert that moral leadership  and to send a message that this kind of dangerous, toxic hatred has no  place in our Justice Department. I urge them to set aside politics and  do what they know is right.   I wish to read two statements that really stood out to me as I was  reviewing Senator Sessions' record on civil rights. One is the powerful  speech that the late Senator from Massachusetts, Ted Kennedy, gave in  1986, and the other is a very moving letter from Coretta Scott King, a  letter she wrote to the Judiciary Committee that same year.   I want to start with what Senator Kennedy said. He said:         The confirmation of nominees for lifetime appointments to       the Federal judiciary is one of the most important       responsibilities of the Senate mandated by the U.S.       Constitution, and the examination by the Senate of a       nominee's fitness to serve as a Federal judge is the last       opportunity to determine whether the candidate possesses the       education, experience, skills, integrity, and, most       importantly, the commitment to equal justice under law, which       are essential attributes of a Federal judge.        Once confirmed, a Federal judge literally has life and       death authority over citizens that appear before him, with       limited review of his decisions. Our Federal judiciary is the       guardian of the rights and liberties guaranteed to all of us       by the U.S. Constitution, and the decisions of fellow judges       are constantly shaping and reshaping those rights and       liberties.        This committee has a duty to our citizens to carefully       examine the qualifications of nominees for the Federal bench       and to give our approval only to those who have demonstrated       a personal commitment to the principle of equality for all       Americans and a sensitivity to the long history of inequality       which we are still struggling to overcome.    Mr. Sessions, as a U.S. attorney for the Southern District of  Alabama, comes to this committee with a record which regrettably  includes presiding over the now-infamous so-called Perry County voting  fraud prosecutions. In the Perry County case, the government indicted  three well-known and highly respected Black civil rights activists on  charges of voter fraud and assisting elderly Black voters to vote by  absentee ballot. But for the efforts of the defendants 20 years ago,  these Black citizens would not have been allowed to vote. All three of  the defendants were acquitted on all charges in the indictments, and  some of the elderly Blacks have responded to their experiences during  the prosecution, vowing never to vote again. Mr. Sessions' role in that  case alone should bar him from serving on the Federal bench.   There is more--much more. We just received a sworn statement from a  Justice Department attorney I know--which will be the subject of a good  deal of questioning during the course of this hearing--who has worked  on civil rights cases with Mr. Sessions over the period Sessions was  U.S. attorney. Mr. Huber has stated to the committee investigators that  Mr. Sessions on more than one occasion has characterized the NAACP and  the ACLU as un-American, Communist-inspired organizations. Mr. Huber  reports that Mr. Sessions said that these organizations did more harm  than good when they were trying to force civil rights down the throats  of people who were trying to put problems behind them. Mr. Huber also  stated that Mr. Sessions suggested that a prominent White civil rights  lawyer who litigated voting rights cases was a disgrace to his race for  doing it. Mr. Sessions is a throwback to a shameful era which I know  both Black and White Americans thought was in our past.    It is inconceivable to me that a person of this attitude is qualified  to be a U.S. attorney, let alone a U.S. Federal judge.   ``He is, I believe, a disgrace to the Justice Department, and he  should withdraw his nomination and resign his position.'' Those were  the words of Senator Ted Kennedy, and I will stand with Senator  Kennedy, and, like he did, I will cast my vote against the nomination  of Senator Sessions.   Coretta Scott King also wrote to the Judiciary Committee about the  Sessions nomination in 1986. This is what she wrote:         Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee:        Thank you for allowing me this opportunity to express my       strong opposition to the nomination of Jefferson Sessions for       a federal district judgeship for the Southern District of       Alabama. My longstanding commitment, which I shared with my       husband, Martin, to protect and enhance the rights of Black       Americans, rights which include equal access to the       democratic process, compels me to testify today.        Civil rights leaders, including my husband and Albert       Turner, have fought long and hard to achieve free and       unfettered access to the ballot box. Mr. Sessions has used       the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of       the vote by black citizens in the district he now seeks to       serve as a federal judge. This simply cannot be allowed to       happen. Mr. Sessions' conduct as U.S. Attorney, from his       politically-motivated voting fraud prosecutions to his       indifference toward criminal violations of civil rights laws,       indicates that he lacks the temperament, fairness and       judgment to be a federal judge.        The Voting Rights Act was, and still is, vitally important       to the future of democracy in the United States. I was       privileged to join Martin and many others during the Selma to       Montgomery march for voting rights in 1965. Martin was       particularly impressed by the determination to get the       franchise of blacks in Selma and neighboring Perry County. As       he wrote, ``Certainly no community in the history of the       Negro struggle has responded with the enthusiasm of Selma and       her neighboring town of Marion. Where Birmingham depended       largely upon students and unemployed adults [to participate       in non-violent protest of the denial of the franchise], Selma       has involved fully 10 per cent of the Negro population in       active demonstrations, and at least half the Negro population       of Marion was arrested on one day.''    Mrs. King continues:         Martin was referring of course to a group that included the       defendants recently prosecuted for assisting elderly and       illiterate blacks to exercise that franchise. In fact, Martin       anticipated from the depth of their commitment twenty years       ago, that a united political organization would remain in       Perry County long after the other marchers had left. This       organization, the Perry County Civic League, started by Mr.       Turner, Mr. Hogue and others, as Martin predicted, continued       ``to direct the drive for votes and other rights.'' In the       years since the Voting Rights Act was passed, Black Americans       in Marion, Selma and elsewhere, have made important strides       in their struggle to participate actively in the electoral       process. The number of Blacks registered to vote in key       Southern states has doubled since 1965. This would not have       been possible without the Voting Rights Act.        However, Blacks still fall far short of having equal       participation in the electoral process. Particularly in the       South, efforts continue to be made to deny Blacks access to       the polls, even where Blacks constitute the majority of the       voters. It has been a long, up-hill struggle to keep alive       the vital legislation that protects the most fundamental       right to vote. A person who has exhibited so much hostility       to the enforcement of those laws----    The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is reminded that it is a violation  of rule XIX of the Standing Rules of the Senate to impute to another  Senator or to other Senators any conduct or motive unworthy or  unbecoming a Senator.    Mr. President, I don't think I quite understand. I am  reading a letter from Coretta Scott King to the Judiciary Committee  from 1986 that was admitted into the Record. I am simply reading what  she wrote about what the nomination of Jeff Sessions to be a Federal  court judge meant and what it would mean in history for her.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. This is a reminder--not necessarily what you  just shared--however, you stated that a sitting Senator is a disgrace  to the Department of Justice.    I think that may have been Senator Kennedy who said that  in the record, although I would be glad to repeat it in my own words.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The rule applies to imputing conduct or  motive, through any form or voice, to a sitting Senator; form or voice  includes quotes, articles, or other materials.    So quoting Senator Kennedy, calling then-Nominee Sessions  a disgrace, is a violation of Senate rules? It was certainly not in  1986.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. In the opinion of the Chair, it is, and the  Senator is warned.    So let me understand. Can I ask a question, in the  opinion of the Chair? I want to understand what this rule means.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state her inquiry.    Is it the contention of the Chair, under the rules of the  Senate, I am not allowed to accurately describe public views of Senator  Sessions, public positions of Senator Sessions, quote public statements  of Senator Sessions?  [[Page S853]]    The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair has not made a ruling with respect  to the Senator's comments. The Senator is following process and  tradition by reminding the Senator from Massachusetts of the rule and  to which it applies.    I am asking what this rule means in this context. So can  I continue with Coretta Scott King's letter?   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may continue.    I am asking what this rule means in this context. So can  I continue with Coretta Scott King's letter?   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may continue.    Thank you. I will pick up, then, with Mrs. King's letter  to the Judiciary Committee when the Judiciary Committee was  considering, not then-Senator Sessions, Nominee Sessions for a position  on the Federal bench.   She makes the point:         However, Blacks still fall far short of having equal       participation in the electoral process. Particularly in the       South, efforts continue to be made to deny Blacks access to       the polls, even where Blacks constitute the majority of the       voters. It has been a long, up-hill struggle to keep alive       the vital legislation that protects the most fundamental       right to vote. A person who has exhibited so much hostility       to the enforcement of those laws, and thus, to the exercise       of those rights by Black people, should not be elevated to       the federal bench.        The irony of Mr. Sessions' nomination is that if confirmed,       he will be given life tenure for doing with a federal       prosecution what the local sheriffs accomplished twenty years       ago with clubs and cattle prods. Twenty years ago, when we       marched from Selma to Montgomery, the fear of voting was       real, as the broken bones and bloody heads in Selma and       Marion bore witness. As my husband wrote at the time, ``it       was not just a sick imagination that conjured up the vision       of a public official, sworn to uphold the law, who forced an       inhuman march upon hundreds of Negro children; who ordered       the Rev. James Bevel to be chained to his sickbed; who       clubbed a Negro woman registrant, and who callously inflicted       repeated brutalities and indignities upon nonviolent Negroes       peacefully petitioning for their constitutional right to       vote.''        Free exercise of voting rights is so fundamental to       American democracy, that we can not tolerate any form of       infringement of those rights. Of all the groups who have been       disenfranchised in our nation's history, none has struggled       longer or suffered more in the attempt to win the vote than       Black citizens. No group has had access to the ballot box       denied so persistently and intently. Over the past century, a       broad array of schemes have been used in attempts to block       the Black vote. The range of techniques developed with the       purpose of repressing black voting rights run the gambit from       the straightforward application of brutality against black       citizens who tried to vote to such legalized frauds as       ``grandfather clause'' exclusions and rigged literacy tests.        The actions taken by Mr. Sessions in regard to the 1984       voting fraud prosecutions represent just one more technique       used to intimidate Black voters, and thus deny them this most       precious franchise. The investigations into the absentee       voting process were conducted only in the Black Belt       counties, where blacks had finally achieved political power       in the local government. Whites had been using the absentee       process to their advantage for years, without incident. Then,       when Blacks, realizing its strength, began to use it with       success, criminal investigations were begun.        In these investigations, Mr. Sessions, as U.S. Attorney,       exhibited an eagerness to bring to trial and convict three       leaders of the Perry County Civic League, including Albert       Turner despite evidence clearly demonstrating their innocence       of any wrongdoing. Furthermore, in initiating the case, Mr.       Sessions ignored allegations of similar behavior by whites,       choosing instead to chill the exercise of the franchise by       blacks by his misguided investigation. In fact, Mr. Sessions       sought to punish older black civil rights activists, advisors       and colleagues of my husband, who had been key figures in the       civil rights movement in the 1960's. These were persons who,       realizing the potential of the absentee vote among Blacks,       had learned to use the process within the bounds of legality,       and had taught others to do the same. The only sin they       committed was being too successful in gaining votes.        The scope and character of the investigations conducted by       Mr. Sessions also warrant grave concern. Witnesses were       selectively chosen in accordance with the favorability of       their testimony to the government's case. Also, the       prosecution illegally withheld from the defense, critical       statements made by witnesses. Witnesses who did testify were       pressured and intimidated into submitting the ``correct''       testimony. Many elderly blacks were visited multiple times by       the FBI, who then hauled them over 180 miles by bus to a       grand jury in Mobile when they could have more easily have       testified at a grand jury twenty miles away in Selma. These       voters, and others, have announced they are now never going       to vote again.        I urge you to consider carefully Mr. Sessions' conduct in       these matters. Such a review, I believe, raises serious       questions about his commitment to the protection of the       voting rights of all American citizens. And consequently his       fair and unbiased judgment regarding this fundamental       right. When the circumstances and facts surrounding the       indictments of Al Turner, his wife, Evelyn, and Spencer       Hogue are analyzed, it becomes clear that the motivation       was political, and the result frightening--the wide-scale       chill of the exercise of the ballot for blacks, who       suffered so much to receive that right in the first place.       Therefore, it is my strongly-held view that the       appointment of Jefferson Sessions to the federal bench       would irreparably damage the work of my husband, Al       Turner, and countless others who risked their lives and       freedom over the past twenty years to ensure equal       participation in our democratic system.        The exercise of the franchise is an essential means by       which our citizens ensure that those who are governing will       be responsible. My husband called it the number one civil       right. The denial of access to the ballot box ultimately       results in the denial of other fundamental rights. For, it is       only when the poor and disadvantaged are empowered that they       are able to participate actively in the solutions to their       own problems.        We still have a long way to go before we can say that       minorities no longer need to be concerned about the       discrimination at the polls. Blacks, Hispanics, Native       Americans, and Asian Americans are grossly underrepresented       at every level of government in America. If we are going to       make our timeless dream of justice through democracy a       reality, we must take every possible step to ensure that the       spirit and intent of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the       Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution is honored.        The federal courts hold a unique position in our       constitutional system, ensuring that minorities and other       citizens without political power have a forum in which to       vindicate their rights. Because of this unique role, it is       essential that the people selected to be federal judges       respect the basic tenets of our legal system: respect for       individual rights and a commitment to equal justice for all.       The integrity of the Courts, and thus the rights they       protect, can only be maintained if citizens feel confident       that those selected as federal judges will be able to judge       with fairness others holding different views.        I do not believe Jefferson Sessions possesses the requisite       judgment, competence, and sensitivity to the rights       guaranteed by the federal civil rights laws to qualify for       appointment to the federal district court. Based on his       record, I believe his confirmation would have a devastating       effect on not only the judicial system in Alabama, but also       on the progress we have made everywhere toward fulfilling my       husband's dream that he envisioned over twenty years ago. I       therefore urge the Senate Judiciary Committee to deny his       confirmation.        I thank you for allowing me to share my views.    Mrs. King's views and words ring true today. The integrity of our  Justice Department depends on an Attorney General who will fight for  the rights of all people. An honest evaluation of Jeff Sessions' record  shows that he is not that person.   My concerns regarding Jeff Sessions go far beyond his disappointing  record on civil rights. Take immigration, for example. The Daily Beast  published an article a few weeks ago entitled, ``Donald Trump's Refugee  Ban Has Attorney General Nominee Jeff Sessions's Fingerprints All Over  It.'' Here is what the article says:         To longtime Jeff Sessions observers, the chaos that       unfolded in American airports on Saturday morning wasn't a       surprise. At all. Rather, the refugee ban was the predictable       culmination of years of advocacy from two of President Donald       Trump's most trusted advisors: White House Senior Advisor       Stephen Miller, and attorney general designate Jeff Sessions.       For years, Sessions and Miller--who was the Alabama Senator's       communications director before leaving to join the Trump       campaign--pushed research and talking points designed to make       Americans afraid of refugees.        Press releases, email forwards, speeches on the Senate       floor--Miller and Sessions used it all to make the case       against Obama's refugee program was a huge terror threat. The       executive order Trump signed late in the day on Friday is       just the logical conclusion of their work.        I started getting press releases that Miller sent on behalf       of Jeff Sessions in March 2013, shortly after I moved to D.C.       to cover Congress. The emails went to my Gmail, and kept       coming over the years--hundreds and hundreds of them. By the       time he left Sessions' office to join the Trump campaign,       Miller's press releases were legendary among Hill reporters:       There were just so many of them at all hours of the day, and       they never stopped. Some were lengthy diatribes; some were       detailed, homemade charts; some were one-liners; one was just       a link to Facebook's stock page on Google Finance with the       subject line, ``Does this mean that Facebook has enough money       now to hire Americans?''        ``I wanted to put together a little book of the best emails       I ever sent,'' Miller told Politico last June. ``I spent       hours and hours of research on those.''        Some of that research had serious methodological problems,       according to Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration expert at the       libertarian Cato Institute.  [[Page S854]]         ``Miller's work vastly overstates the threat of foreign       terrorists to the homeland,'' Nowrasteh said.        He pointed to Miller's efforts to chronicle cases of       refugees implicated in terrorist activity. It is true that       some refugees in the U.S. have been indicted for terrorism-      related crimes, Nowrasteh said. But instances of refugees       actually planning terror attacks on American soil, he added,       were vanishingly rare.    ``Almost all the refugees that I was able to specifically identify in  his set were trying to support a foreign terrorist organization, mostly  Al Shabab in Somalia, by giving them money or something like  that,'' Nowrasteh said. ``I don't know about you, but I think there's a  big difference between sending a militia in your home country funds and  trying to blow up a mall in Cincinnati.''         The collective effect of Miller and Sessions' messaging was       to enthusiastically push a narrative that now dominates the       Trump administration: that refugees and other immigrants       steal Americans' jobs, suck up too much welfare money,       incubate terrorists in their communities and, overall, are a       big problem.        The conclusion was always the same: The government should       let in far fewer refugees, and it should think twice about       welcoming Muslims.        And now, that's exactly what Trump is doing.        For instance, in one ``Dear Colleague'' letter that       Sessions co-authored with conservative Republican Rep. David       Brat--a letter Miller blasted out to his press list--the       would-be Attorney General ripped into the refugee program.        ``There can be no higher duty as lawmakers than to keep our       constituents and their families safe,'' Brat and Sessions       wrote. ``Yet our reckless refugee programs, lax green card       and visa policies, utter failure to enforce rampant visa       overstays, along with our wide open southern border, put the       U.S. at grave and needless risk.''        ``Grave and needless risk''--it is a view that clearly       informs Trump's decision to temporarily ban refugees.        And a Miller press release, blasted out on November 25,       2015, included this ominous title: ``U.S. Issued 680,000       Green Cards to Migrants from Muslim Nations Over the Last 5       Years.''        Sessions then forwarded that email to his email list on       Jan. 12, 2016, the day of Obama's final State of the Union       address, and added this note: ``Some numerical context for       any discussions of refugee policy that may arise tonight. As       further context, the top-sending country for migrants are       Iraq and Pakistan, according to Pew, `Nearly all Muslims in       Afghanistan (99%) and most in Iraq (91%) and Pakistan (84%)       support Sharia law as official law.' ''        The implication was clear as a bell: Muslim immigrants are       flooding into the U.S., and they are bringing Sharia with       them. Someone who agreed with Miller's assessment would do       what Trump just did.        Just about any time a refugee living in the U.S. was       charged, implicated, or otherwise connected to terrorism,       Miller emailed his list about it.        Another Sessions press release, sent jointly with Sen.       Richard Shelby, also included ominous intonations about       refugees and Muslims.        ``Congress must cancel the President's blank refugee check       and put Congress back in charge of the program,'' Sessions       and Shelby said. ``We cannot allow the President to       unilaterally decide how many refugees he wishes to admit, nor       continue to force taxpayers to pick up the tab for tens of       billions of unpaid-for welfare and entitlement costs.''        ``The omnibus''--    Still quoting the letter from Senators Shelby and Sessions--       would put the U.S. on a path to approve admission for       hundreds of thousands of migrants from a broad range of       countries with jihadist movements over the next 12 months, on       top of all the other autopilot annual immigration--absent       language to reduce the numbers,'' the release continued.        That same statement also suggested that refugees were       robbing elderly Americans of their benefits.        ``Refugees are entitled to access all major welfare       programs, and they can also draw benefits directly from the       Medicare and Social Security Disability and retirement trust       funds--taking those funds straight from the pockets of       American retirees who paid into these troubled funds all       their lives,'' Sessions and Shelby said.        Now that Trump is president, those numbers are getting       reduced--and fast.        Another foreboding subject line from Miller showed up in       reporters' inboxes on Nov. 20, 2015: ``ICYMI: Each 5 years,       U.S. issuing more new green cards to migrants from Muslim       nations the population of Washington, D.C.''        Sessions also took to the Senate floor to argue that Muslim       immigrants are uniquely dangerous. On Nov. 19, 2015, the       Alabaman said the following about Muslims:        ``It is an unpleasant but unavoidable fact that bringing in       a large unassimilated flow of migrants from the Muslim world       creates the conditions possible for radicalization and       extremism to take hold.''        In the speech, Sessions argued that the U.S. should set up       safe zones in Syria where refugees could settle--instead of       allowing any of them into the United States. Miller emailed       reporters as Sessions spoke to highlight his argument. Now       it's Trump's position.        At Breitbart, Julia Hahn covered Sessions' speech, in an       article headlined ``Afghanistan Migration Surging into       America: 99% Support Sharia Law.'' News broke earlier this       week that Hahn got a job in the White House as an assistant       to Trump and senior advisor Stephen Bannon.        And on and on and on, for hundreds of emails, without even       a whisper of flip-flopping.        Trump's crack-down on Muslims and refugees should not       surprise anyone. He is just taking his advisors' advice.    Trump's Executive order sparked protests and resistance all across  the Nation. People across the country and around the world are standing  up to say that it contradicts our core values and that it violates the  law.   Massachusetts is on the frontlines of challenging this illegal and  downright offensive Executive order. Last week, Massachusetts Attorney  General Maura Healey joined a Federal lawsuit to challenge that  Executive order. This is what she said.
