 Mr. President, I am pleased to commend Evann Berry  for her contributions and dedicated service as a member of my personal  office staff.   A native of Jackson, MS, Evann earned her bachelor of science in  biological engineering at Bagley College of Engineering at Mississippi  State University. After her college tenure, Evann began her  professional career by serving as an emerging leader scholar for the  Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, followed by an internship with  the office of the late U.S. Senator Thad Cochran. In May 2016, Evann  was hired as a full-time staff member for Senator Cochran, where she  easily proved how indispensable her talents were for serving the good  constituents of Mississippi. Following Senator Cochran's retirement,  Evann maintained a model work ethic within my office that has proven to  be a testament to her good character.   Evann's contributions throughout her tenure have been invaluable to  the legislative functions of not just my office but my predecessor's  office as well, and her insightful input will be missed. I, along with  the rest of my office, have benefitted from Evann's knowledge and  experience. Her personal qualities are impeccable. She is a hard- working, courteous, and intelligent young woman, who has a strong sense  of responsibility, good judgment, and a pleasant demeanor that makes  her an easy person to like.   Mr. President, Mississippi and our Nation have been well-served by  the diligence, dedication, and commitment to excellence Evann provided  on a daily basis. She has put forth her best efforts to reflect credit  on me, our State, and the U.S. Senate and has been successful in doing  so. I will miss Evann's good counsel. She has my appreciation and  gratitude for the notable job she has done in the Senate. I wish Evann  all the best in her future endeavors.                            ____________________
