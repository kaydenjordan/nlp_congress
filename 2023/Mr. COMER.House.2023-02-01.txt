 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 75, I call up  the bill (H.R. 139) to require Executive agencies to submit to Congress  a study of the impacts of expanded telework and remote work by agency  employees during the COVID-19 pandemic and a plan for the agency's  future use of telework and remote work, and for other purposes, and ask  for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 139, the Stopping Home  Office Work's Unproductive Problems Act, or the SHOW UP Act.   This legislation is urgent. The Federal workforce needs to get back  to work. Federal agencies are falling short of their missions. They are  not carrying out their duties. They are failing the American people.   During the COVID-19 pandemic, most of the Federal workforce stayed  home. They relied on telework because they could, but as the rest of  America went back to work in person, many Federal workers did not.   The American people have suffered as a result. They have waited for  months for their tax refunds from the IRS. They have waited for months  for the Social Security Administration to answer their questions and  provide them benefits.   Our veterans have even waited for months to get their medical records  from the National Archives. The National Archives is responsible for  maintaining medical records for our veterans, but our veterans could  not get access to these records because the National Archives staff  were at home.   This is unacceptable, and it should be downright embarrassing to  these agencies.   The American people have struggled with high inflation, scarce goods,  prolonged and disruptive lockdowns, and other hardships. Meanwhile, the  Biden administration has showered Federal workers with perks and pay  increases all while working from home, but Federal employees not being  in the workplace hurt the Federal Government's ability to achieve its  missions and deliver vital programs.   House Republicans have fought hard to find out just how expanded  telework has decreased agencies' ability to deliver services to our  constituents. We have tried to get this information from the Biden  administration, but to no avail.   During the last Congress, as the House Oversight and Reform Committee  ranking member, I wrote to the administration, requesting information  on Federal workforce return-to-work policies. The Biden administration  failed to provide adequate responses to our inquiries. Instead, it kept  expanded telework policies in place long after the pandemic was over,  and it used its expanded telework policies not to help our constituents  but to help recruit new employees to the Federal Government.   The Federal workforce already enjoys many perks not enjoyed by the  private sector, including unparalleled job stability, healthy  retirement benefits, and reliable pay-growth expectations. One would  have thought that, as the pandemic wound down, Federal workers would  have returned to their offices just as private-sector workers across  the Nation did. That is not the case.   According to the Office of Personnel Management's most recent report  on telework, 47 percent of Federal workers teleworked routinely or  situationally in fiscal year 2021. That was a 2 percent increase over  fiscal year 2020, the year in which the pandemic struck.   According to a Federal Times report this past October, just one in  three Federal workers had returned to their office full time in 2022.   Just last week, The Wall Street Journal reported that a new study by  Cushman & Wakefield found only 5 percent of the prepandemic workforce  returned to work in federally leased buildings in Washington, D.C., in  October and November.                                time  1415    The Federal Government's abuse of telework has gotten so bad that  Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has called on President Biden to  suspend the telework policies for Federal workers or turn over Federal  buildings in D.C. for conversion to affordable housing.   The current OPM Director has stated that Federal employees are  actually getting transfers to agencies where they can telework more-- not so they can serve our constituents and the American citizenry the  best.   The SHOW UP Act offers a much-needed solution to the problem of  Federal agencies and Federal employees putting their own comfort before  our constituents' needs.   It requires Federal agencies to immediately return to prepandemic  levels of telework. This ensures that from the day of enactment,  priority number one for the Federal workforce will be prompt and  effective service to our constituents, not increasing the perks for an  already privileged Federal bureaucracy.   The SHOW UP Act also requires a governmentwide review of pandemic-era  teleworking policies. This will help Congress see how much expanded  telework either improved or harmed agency-by-agency effectiveness,  costs, and network security across our vast Federal Government.   The bill would prevent the Biden administration from locking in  higher levels of telework until Congress receives detailed plans on how  mission performance would be impacted.   If the agencies' plans show increased telework would substantially  improve agency performance, lower agency costs, ensure agency network  security, and better disperse Federal employees across the Nation, then  increased telework can then be considered as an option, but not until  increased telework has been proven to better serve our constituents and  the Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this vital  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  North Carolina (Ms. Foxx).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Fallon).                                time  1430     Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Donalds).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Wisconsin.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Colorado (Mrs. Boebert).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Arrington).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further Members to debate. I am  prepared to close whenever the gentleman is prepared. I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), the majority leader.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   This legislation asks every Member to answer a simple question: Do  you put the needs of your constituents first, or do you put the  preferences of Federal bureaucrats first?   We know that expanded telework during the COVID-19 pandemic harmed  agency service to our constituents across multiple vital agencies.  Instead of fixing those problems and making sure they never happen  again if increased telework needs to continue in certain cases, the  Biden administration is just blindly doubling down on Federal telework  across the board--not to improve service to our constituents, but to  dangle a shiny perk in front of existing Federal workers and  prospective new Federal hires.   My bill ensures that a new expectation is set for our Federal  Government's workforce: that you need to return to your agencies and  get the job done for the American people.   Federal telework should only be utilized when it has been proven to  improve agency performance, lower agency costs, ensure agency network  security, and better disperse the Federal workforce across the Nation.   In the meantime, it requires Federal agencies to reimplement pre- pandemic policies, which were working just fine.   Under this bill, we will know that, whether we have increased Federal  telework or not, it will only be to ensure that Federal agencies and  their employees provide the best quality of service to our constituents  and our Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this much-needed bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
