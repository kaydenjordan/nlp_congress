 Madam President, I was necessarily absent for vote No.  65 on the motion to invoke cloture on Executive Calendar No. 21,  nomination of Daniel Desmond Domenico, of Colorado, to be United States  District Judge for the District of Colorado. On vote No. 65, had I been  present, I would have voted nay on the motion to invoke cloture on  Executive Calendar No. 21.                            ____________________
