 Mr. Speaker, I thank the California delegation for  giving me this opportunity.   I met Ellen Tauscher in the 1980s when I was the director of the  American Stock Exchange and she was an officer. She was brilliant, and  she had a heart of gold.   We worked together again in the 1990s when she was elected to  Congress. She hadn't changed. She could still focus, razor sharp, on  any issue.   She was a classic citizen legislator. She had had a previous  extraordinary career in finance and then committed herself to public  service. All of us who knew and worked and played with her loved her.  Actually, we had a date this month for dinner at her favorite  Georgetown restaurant.   She will be missed as a kind, warm, and wonderful friend, as a classy  colleague. She will be remembered as a patriot who loved her country  and served it well.
