 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, yesterday, I joined a number of my  Republican and Democratic colleagues  [[Page S5149]]  and voted to begin floor consideration of bipartisan compromise  legislation for our Nation's infrastructure.   Our country would benefit a whole lot from some targeted investment  in the kinds of real, tangible projects that fit a commonsense  definition of actual infrastructure--roads, bridges, ports, waterways,  airports, broadband.   A bipartisan compromise to responsibly finance these kinds of  investments is guaranteed to be big and complex. It is guaranteed to be  the kind of legislation that no Member on either side of the aisle will  think is perfect. But it is an important basic duty of government.   I am glad to see these discussions making progress. I was happy to  vote to begin moving the Senate toward what ought to be a robust,  bipartisan floor process for legislation of this magnitude.   This kind of focused compromise that our colleagues have been hashing  out could not contrast more sharply with the multitrillion-dollar  reckless taxing-and-spending spree the Democrats hope to ram through on  a party-line vote later this year.   As I have said before, the Democrats' spree is reckless on multiple  levels. We are all familiar with the staggering $3.5 trillion bottom  line. We all know it would only amp up the painful inflation that is  already hammering middle-class families, in large part because of the  last partisan deluge of spending Democrats rammed through just a few  months ago.   But just as alarming is the parade of leftwing ideas that comprise  this mess: turning temporary pandemic welfare payments with no work  requirements into a permanent dole, shoving through big chunks of the  Green New Deal, government price-fixing that would leave us with fewer  new medicines and new cures.   And then there is an effort to further inflame the Biden  administration's border crisis with a far-left amnesty. We have now  seen the highest unaccompanied child arrivals on record, the biggest  month for immigrant encounters in 21 years. This month, total CBP  apprehensions for the calendar year are expected to top a million--a  million--for the first time in 15 years, and we still have 5 months to  go.   So one might think my friends across the aisle would try to avoid  repeating the missteps that created the crisis; that they would be  careful to avoid doubling down on the perverse incentives generating so  much suffering down at the southern border.   But, apparently, Washington Democrats intend to do the opposite.  Their reckless taxing-and-spending spree would include an even bigger  green light for this crisis at the worst possible time. Under the Biden  administration's unenforceable catch-and-release policy, just 13  percent of the 50,000 individuals who have been released into the  United States since March have actually reported to assigned ICE  checkups. So in a sense, either intentionally or through incompetence,  the administration is already practicing a policy that amounts to  functional amnesty in many cases. What Democrats want now is to make  that explicit and, believe it or not, permanent.   They would effectively like our southern border to be even more open  than it is now, even during an ongoing public health emergency that has  Federal, State, and local officials contemplating new batches of rules  for American citizens. The message to Americans appears to be: Put your  guard back up, even if you are vaccinated.   But to a jaw-dropping degree, the message to people arriving at the  southern border seems to be: Come on in. Even if you are COVID  positive, come on in.   CBP data are reportedly showing a huge uptick in positive COVID tests  in the Rio Grande Valley sector. That is just one sector, and that is  just among whatever fraction of the individuals are actually being  tested. And among individuals in ICE custody, apparently one in three-- one in three--are declining to receive a vaccine. Yet it seems the  Biden administration doesn't consider a COVID diagnosis any reason to  make an exception to its catch-and-release policy. Alarming reports of  COVID-positive detainees being turned out into Texas communities even  have border-State Democrats sounding the alarm.   I hope President Biden is listening. Maybe Members of his own party  will have better luck conveying what the American people have known for  months: The situation at our southern border is a crisis. It deserves  real attention and real solutions, not a reckless taxing-and-spending  spree with amnesty policies that would make things considerably worse                            ____________________     Madam President, on a completely different matter, for  the second time this week the U.S. Senate family must bid a sad  farewell to a member of its alumni society.   Only six different individuals have served as Senate Parliamentarian  since the position was formally established back in 1935. It is a  unique and remarkable position that seems to require unique and  remarkable people.   Bob Dove served two stints as Parliamentarian from the early 1980s to  the early 2000s. He passed away yesterday at the age of 82 after a long  illness.   I was just a rank-and-file Senator during Bob's stints on the dais,  but everyone in the entire Senate knew all about Bob's brilliance and  his incredible spirit. Bob Dove knew this body's history and its rules  to the tenth decibel place.   He was also a constantly jovial person, as approachable as he was  smart. His love for the Senate was tangible. It was palpable, and it  was not only a love for the institution, itself, as an abstraction, it  was also a love for the human beings who comprised it.   I understand that back in the day, Bob had a go-to one-liner to help  himself and his fellow professionals here on the floor through the  tougher days. Here is what he said: ``You may love the Senate,'' he  would dryly declare, ``but the Senate may not love you back.''   But a little gruff sarcasm couldn't conceal Bob's true affection. In  fact, his enthusiasm for this place was so contagious that it swept up  multiple generations of his family. About a year and a half ago, we  said goodbye to Bob's daughter, Laura Dove, herself a long-serving,  well-loved and widely respected Senate staff leader as she left the  post of Secretary for the Majority.   Even now, two of Bob's grandchildren are spending their summers right  here in the Senate, helping out in different positions.   Either Bob Dove's brood just cannot quit this multigenerational  addiction to public service or perhaps it is the Senate that cannot  quit them.   So our condolences and our prayers go out to Bob's wife Linda, to  Laura and her brother and sister, and to Bob's grandchildren and  extended family.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.
