 Mr. President, suspending the debt ceiling is not  about generating new spending. It is about making sure the government  can pay for our spending. Since 1960, Congress has done this. It has  raised the debt ceiling approximately 80 times. It is not unusual; it  is not uncommon; it is not unacceptable. What is unacceptable is that  our colleagues won't even allow us to do it.  [[Page S6720]]    The 50 of us are united in this, and I say: Where are our Republican  colleagues?   They know the fact: A default will impact everyone. The government  will need to decide between sending out Social Security checks,  ensuring we keep our promises to our vets, and paychecks to active  military. It is disastrous for our economy and small business.   This year, Neil Bradley of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said that  failing to act responsibly and provide an increase in the debt limit  would endanger our economy. It would cause global markets, of course,  to lose confidence in the full faith and credit of the United States.   The stakes are high. This should not be about scoring political  points. Our families, our workers, our seniors deserve better.  Democrats are united to stand by their side.   And we say to our Republican colleagues: Where are you?
