 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the Inland Empire  of southern California, the region my family has called home for  generations.   As we stand here today, people in communities like mine and across  the country are hurting. They are mourning loved ones, they are missing  paychecks, and they are wondering what their government is doing to  make the situation better.   Right now, Democrats in Congress are laser focused on providing the  relief the American people need in this pandemic. We have been for  months. We passed the CARES Act in March, but we didn't stop there. We  passed the Heroes Act in May, and then we passed the updated Heroes  Act.   We have continued to work on behalf of the American people, and our  Republican counterparts have not met us halfway. Senate Republicans'  months of inaction have led to a dire situation across this country,  and it is unconscionable for them to continue to do nothing as we  approach the holidays.   We have lost valuable time, and it is my hope that, using the  bipartisan framework, we can reach an agreement as soon as possible. To  do nothing in the face of this much pain is unacceptable. The people we  represent have entrusted us with an enormous responsibility, and we  cannot let them down.                            ____________________
