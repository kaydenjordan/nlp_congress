 Mr. President, I want to honor a very special  North Dakota woman who is turning 100 years old on Friday. Inez  Mittleider of Bismarck was born on March 27, 1920, in South Dakota and  at a young age moved with her family to southwestern North Dakota.  Living thorough the Dirty Thirties and the Great Depression, she had to  leave home and live with family friends while she completed high  school. She was one of very few women of her generation to earn a  college degree. Inez lived in the communities of Heil and Mott and  taught in one-room schoolhouses for nearly 10 years.   Inez and her husband raised four children and instilled in them the  necessity of hard work and self reliance. Today, Inez is the  grandmother of seven, great-grandmother of nine, and continues to live  on her own in Bismarck. Her many family members plan to gather to  celebrate this centennial milestone with Inez later in the year.   Mr. President, North Dakota is home to more than 200 centenarians,  and we consider them among our most treasured residents. They have  witnessed great moments in North Dakota's history and their pioneer  spirit, dignity, and hard work have brought them through many  challenges and personal achievements.   On behalf of all North Dakotans, I want to wish Inez a happy 100th  birthday, and hope this is the start of a year filled with happiness  and joy.                            ____________________
