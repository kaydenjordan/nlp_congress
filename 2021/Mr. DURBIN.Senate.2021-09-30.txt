 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, yesterday afternoon, the Senate  Parliamentarian ruled that long overdue immigration reform could not be  included in the budget reconciliation process. I respect the  Parliamentarian very much, but I respectfully disagree. The pathway to  citizenship has a substantial and direct budgetary impact, which makes  it appropriate to be included in a reconciliation bill.   The last measure which we put before the Parliamentarian literally  was a date change. That was the sum and substance of the amendment--a  date change that had a budgetary impact in it. We were not creating new  categories of immigration. We were not creating any new laws other than  the date change.   I want to say to all of the Dreamers and immigrants and all of the  mixed-status families who are desperately following the situation: We  are not giving up, and you shouldn't give up either. America needs you,  and I will keep my promise to keep working on this as long as it is my  honor to serve in the Senate.                                  H.R. 5305    Madam President, on another matter, I can remember when ``certainty''  was the Republican refrain on tax cuts and the economy. They used to  say businesses and families need certainty. That is what the  Republicans used to say when they wanted to pass more tax cuts for  wealthy people. American businesses couldn't invest or hire new workers  and American families couldn't plan for their futures without  certainty. We heard that repeatedly on the Republican side of the  aisle.   Now it is a radically different message. Instead of preaching the  gospel of certainty, as they used to, Senator McConnell and today's  Republicans are threatening to deliberately, cynically, recklessly push  America toward an economic cataclysm. We are less than 3 weeks away  from a default on our national debt--that has never happened in  history, a default on our debt--and 14 hours away from a government  shutdown.   Later today, the Senate is expected to vote on a clean continuing  resolution. If it passes, we can keep the Federal Government  functioning until December 3, and we obviously should do that in the  midst of a pandemic and with all of the things that are threatening  America. We expect that the CR will also include emergency funding, as  it should, to assist with the recovery from Hurricane Ida in Louisiana  and the gulf coast, and with the wildfires in the Western States and to  help Afghans, who aided us in the longest war in history, to resettle  in America.   Even the threat of a government shutdown costs taxpayers money. It  damages the economy, and it undermines confidence in America's future.   If reason and responsibility prevail, the continuing resolution will  pass, and the threat of a government shutdown will be off the table for  now, but that CR will do nothing to resolve the far greater threat to  our economy--the looming potential default on the national debt.   The Democratic leader of the Senate, Chuck Schumer of New York, came  to the floor the day before yesterday, I believe it was, and said to  the Republican leader: If you don't want to cast any Republican votes  to establish and recognize the debt ceiling, the Democrats will vote  for it. Step out of the way. Let us take the responsibility for doing  the right thing.   Senator McConnell objected. He wants it to happen, he wants the  threat to be there, but it creates the uncertainty which they used to  decry in their Republican leadership days. This is a manufactured  crisis ginned up by Republicans to score political points.   The harm to the U.S. and global economies would be cataclysmic. Here  in the United States, respected economists warn us that the results  would trigger a painful recession--the opposite of what we need at this  moment in history--the loss of more than 6 million American jobs--how  can that be good for the Nation?--and 9 percent unemployment.   We would likely see a broad selloff in the markets, which would take  a big bite out of Americans' retirement savings. Interest rates could  spike. Not only does that affect American consumers and businesses, but  it affects our government. We will be paying a higher interest rate. So  taxes won't be spent on highways; they will be given to banks and  companies and countries that are buying our debt. For working families,  higher interest rates would mean bigger monthly payments on their  mortgages, car loans, credit cards. For the Federal Government, higher  interest rates would result in larger deficits and even a larger  national debt.   Think about that. Republicans are threatening to default on America's  national debt because, they say, they are worried about deficits and  debt, and defaulting on the national debt will make both worse.   Because we have never been through a default, it is hard to know  exactly which payments the government will have to stop immediately and  which payments might continue for a while. I don't want to sow seeds of  fear across America, or panic, but we have got to be honest and  realistic. If we don't establish and recognize the national debt of  this country, it will be the first time in history.   Some of the payments that are at risk in my State of Illinois and my  nearby State of Kentucky are obvious. More than 1.3 million families in  Illinois and more than 500,000 families in Kentucky could see their  child tax credits delayed. Nearly 600,000 veterans in Illinois and  nearly 300,000 veterans in Kentucky could see their benefits delayed.  That includes disability payments, VA pensions, education benefits,  loan guarantees, and other benefits that veterans have earned with  their service and sacrifice. Seniors would be hurt. Almost 2.8 million  seniors in Illinois and more than a million in Kentucky would see their  Social Security checks threatened.   Defaulting on our national debt could trigger a global financial  crisis. It would squander one of our Nation's most valuable economic  assets as trust by investors that America pays its bills and keeps its  word would be at risk. The U.S. dollar could lose its valuable place as  the world's primary currency. That would be a gift to our competitors  in China.   American families and businesses are still struggling from financial  devastation caused by the coronavirus. The crisis threatening America  today is being manufactured right here in the Senate by politicians who  believe, cynically, that it will help them politically to default on  America's debt. Haven't the institutions of this great Nation suffered  enough?   Ten months ago, an angry man, enraged over losing an election,  summoned a mob to attack this Capitol Building on January 6 and tried  to overturn the Presidential election.   And now that former President's party is refusing to do its part to  avoid a default on our national debt.   Let's be clear about why Congress needs to address the debt limit.  Addressing this debt limit allows Congress to continue to borrow money  to pay for expenses that have already been incurred.   This measure that we are talking about, the acknowledgement of our  debt ceiling, is to pay the debts of the Trump administration. The  national debt of America increased by 36 percent under President Trump  in one 4-year period. We are taking recognition of the fact that that  money was spent and has to be paid for.   Ninety-seven percent of the total Federal debt occurred before Joe  Biden  [[Page S6808]]  became President. This is debt that was built up under Presidents and  congressional majorities in both parties. As I said, $8 billion--nearly  a third of the entire debt--was added under Donald Trump, with the  support of the same Republican Senators who will not acknowledge that  that is now part of our responsibility.   Now Senator McConnell and his Republican colleagues are playing a  verbal shell game, claiming falsely that we need to address the debt  limit to pay for future spending. That is not true, and they know it.   If this Congress had not spent a penny since Joe Biden took office,  we would still have to deal with the debt limit to pay for the Trump  bills he left behind.   Democrats have offered proposals twice this week. On Monday, Senator  Schumer offered a proposal that dealt with the debt limit. It included  a CR to avoid a government shutdown and provided emergency aid which is  needed for the victims of Hurricane Ida, wildfires, and resettlement of  Afghan refugees. The Republicans used the filibuster to stop it.   On Tuesday, Leader Schumer offered a proposal to allow the Senate to  address the debt limit with just a majority vote. Senator McConnell  objected.   Not only are Republicans refusing to help pay the debt incurred under  Presidents of both parties, they are making it as difficult as possible  for Democrats to address the debt limit in a responsible way.   Defaulting on this debt would be the ultimate dine-and-dash. It would  be a grave, self-inflicted wound that would harm innocent Americans for  decades.   Our Republican colleagues used to preach the gospel of economic  certainty. The only thing certain about defaulting on our national debt  is that it would be ruinous to our economy, and it is a responsibility  both parties should want to avoid.   I yield the floor.                              Amendment No. 3833     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the  following letter in the Congressional Record.
