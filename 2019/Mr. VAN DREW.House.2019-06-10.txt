 Madam Speaker, since its start in the 1940s, the  Atlantic County 4-H program has encouraged young people from all  communities and backgrounds to immerse themselves in areas of science,  health, agriculture, and civic engagement.   The Atlantic County 4-H program is one of the longest running  programs in the country and teaches valuable life skills to youth in  grades K-13. Through 4-H, these young people are engaged in a variety  of hands-on projects from livestock to computer science, from gardening  to expressive arts.   These experiences, of course, could not be possible without the help  of volunteers. We are honored to have over 40 volunteers in Hammonton,  among many others, and I want to particularly thank a few members of  the community who have dedicated many years of service and of their  time and expertise to this program.   Thank you to Kathleen Einwechter, who has been volunteering for 25  years.   Thank you to Al Schollenberger, who has been volunteering for 45  years.   And thank you to Dorothy Calimer, who has been giving her time and  care to this program for 50 years.   You and all of our community flourish, and I am excited to celebrate  you today. I am excited about your work, about your volunteerism, and  about the difference that you make.                            ____________________
