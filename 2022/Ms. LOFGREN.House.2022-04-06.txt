 Madam Speaker, no one is above the law.   We have all heard that phrase. It is a bedrock principle, and we know  it is what distinguishes democracies like ours from autocracies such as  Russia.   Sadly, a few of the former President's closest aides and allies seem  to think they are special, that they are above the law, including  senior communications official Daniel Scavino, Jr.   Now, who is he? According to many reports, Mr. Scavino worked with  the former President to use social media to spread lies regarding  nonexistent election fraud and to recruit a violent, angry mob to D.C.   Mr. Scavino also followed violent, extremist social media on behalf  of Mr. Trump. We have reason to believe that doing so provided Mr.  Scavino with explicit advance warnings of the violence that was to  occur on January 6. He may have shared these warnings of violence with  Mr. Trump before the 6th, and we need to ask him about that.   He reportedly attended several meetings with Mr. Trump and others  regarding reversing the legitimate victory of President Biden and was  also with the former President during the Capitol attack when Mr. Trump  failed to immediately try to stop it, despite urgent bipartisan calls  for him to do so.   Madam Speaker, a Federal court recently concluded that Mr. Trump  likely committed a Federal felony and that he and his allies ``launched  a campaign to overturn a democratic election'' that ``spurred violent  attacks on the seat of our Nation's government, led to the deaths of  several law enforcement officers, and deepened public distrust in our  political process.''   The court said that his effort was ``a coup in search of a legal  theory.'' The court found that if President Trump's ``plan had worked,  it would have permanently ended the peaceful transition of power,  undermining American democracy and the Constitution.''   Democrats and Republicans have agreed that the very foundation of our  constitutional republic was threatened. We must prevent that from ever  happening again.   Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell rightly explained that the  public needs to know everything about what caused and occurred on  January 6. To inform both the American people and legislative reform  proposals, the select committee needs to speak with Mr. Scavino. He has  to fulfill his legal and moral obligation to provide testimony and  documents. Otherwise, he should face consequences.   We must vote ``yes'' on this resolution to find him in contempt of  Congress. In the United States of America, no one, including Mr.  Scavino, is above the law.                                time  1730
