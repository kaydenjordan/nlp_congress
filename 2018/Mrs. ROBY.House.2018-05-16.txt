 Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer my strongest support for  H.R. 2, the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018, commonly known as  the farm bill.   I am proud to serve Alabama's Second District, where agriculture is  the largest employer, responsible for more than 93,000 jobs and more  than $11 billion in economic impact.   So, Mr. Chair, I know how critically important it is that Congress  deliver agricultural policy that actually works for the farmers  throughout Alabama, and our country, and makes their important work  easier, not harder.   That is why I am proud the new farm bill addresses many of the  challenges farmers face every day, including streamlining and reducing  burdensome Federal pesticide regulations, creating a program to address  our Nation's feral hog problem, and strengthening the existing crop  insurance program.   In addition to this, the new farm bill makes several needed  improvements to our country's nutrition assistance program by  implementing strict work requirements and closing loopholes that allow  for abuses of the system.   I am proud that the new farm bill maintains vital nutrition for our  most vulnerable Americans when they truly need it, while making a  commitment to helping these individuals improve their circumstances.   I support the legislation.   Mr. Chair, I have always believed that we should incentivize able- bodied Americans to work instead of encourage them to remain dependent  on the government, so I'm proud that the new farm bill reflects our  conservative principles.   I am pleased that this legislation provides a commitment to our  nation's farmers while taking important steps towards reforming our  food stamps program.   I will continue to advocate for policies that give fair treatment to  our Alabama commodities like cotton, peanuts, timber, poultry,  soybeans, and catfish. I'm eager to cast my vote in favor of the new  farm bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.
