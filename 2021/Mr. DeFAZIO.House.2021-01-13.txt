 Mr. Speaker, this was not a one-off. It was a long time  coming. It was a part of a plan to perpetuate Trump in office.   Trump's campaign strategy was: The election, the only way we can we  lose is if it is stolen. It is stolen; it is fake. ``It is stolen,''  repeated by many of his fellow travelers on that side, more than 150  times by Trump over the summer.   Then, they litigated to disqualify voters. That didn't work.   Then, they litigated to throw out ballots. Well, that didn't work.   Then, they attempted to delay the count with State legislatures.  Well, that didn't work.   Last ditch, the President called down to Georgia and said: Can't you  find me more votes?   And then, one last desperate plea: Stop the January 6 certification.  And the President talked about that on September 26. He said: You know,  if it goes to Congress, there is one vote per State, and we have an  advantage.   So, I think this was part of a plan to disrupt the electoral college  of the United States.   Giuliani: ``Trial by combat.''   Trump: ``You will never take back our country with weakness.''
