 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me begin by congratulating the gentlewoman from  Washington State on her election as the chairwoman of the Energy and  Commerce Committee.   I rise in opposition to H.R. 22, the Protecting America's Strategic  Petroleum Reserve from China Act.   First, let's take a moment to remember how we got here. In 2015, when  Republicans last controlled Congress, they lifted the 40-year ban on  crude oil exports at the urging of their Big Oil friends.  This irresponsible policy change allowed companies to export American- owned barrels of oil to our adversaries, including China.    Again, that was a Republican policy pushed by House Republicans 8  years ago. As a result, our crude oil exports to China surged,  averaging a half million barrels every day during the last year of the  Trump administration. China hoarded these barrels to build up its own  petroleum reserves.   Back in 2015, I strongly opposed this Republican bill out of concern  that it would harm our energy security and, ultimately, lead to  increased prices at the pump for hardworking American families. It  turns out I was right.   Now, Republicans seem to be complaining about the very circumstances  that they created, all to reward their Big Oil friends.   Lifting the export ban damaged our economic security. Refineries  across the country, including in my home State of New Jersey, have  closed since the export ban was lifted, in no small part due to oil  companies' desires to seek greater profits abroad rather than send  their oil to refineries here at home.   A GAO analysis in 2020 showed that domestic refineries suffered  because of the export ban being lifted, a suffering that was then  inflicted on the thousands of hardworking Americans whose jobs were  destroyed.   If Republicans were serious about addressing this issue, they would  have brought forward a bill that banned all exports of crude oil to  China. SPR barrels sold to Chinese firms represented only 2 percent of  all the oil we sent to China last year--only 2 percent from the SPR.   If we truly want to address China using American oil to build its  reserves, let's actually take a serious look at that rather than skirt  around the issue because Republicans are scared of Big Oil's wrath.   Why are Republicans only banning SPR sales to China? Representatives  Houlahan and Bacon introduced a bill last Congress that prohibited SPR  sales to Russia, North Korea, Iran, and any country under U.S.  sanctions. That bill had 37 bipartisan cosponsors. Are my Republican  colleagues okay with exporting oil to Putin's Russia in the midst of a  war on Ukraine?   It also speaks volumes, Mr. Speaker, that this is their first energy  priority after regaining the House majority. Over the last 2 years,  Democrats passed the most significant climate law in our Nation's  history. We also passed the bipartisan infrastructure law that will  modernize our energy infrastructure. Republicans' first energy bill  this Congress isn't about investing in the resiliency of our electric  grid or making American energy cleaner and cheaper. Instead, they are  just recycling an old one-page bill that takes a minor step in undoing  the damage that they themselves created.   Republicans are here today denying their own history and muddying the  truth by trying to place the blame on President Biden, but President  Biden successfully used the SPR to lower prices at the pump and provide  relief to American families.   When gas prices increased last year, the Biden administration took  decisive action to bring gas prices back down by releasing oil from the  SPR. The administration released an unprecedented 1 million barrels of  oil a day, providing critical domestic supply to make up for shortages  in the aftermath of the war in Ukraine.   This was a commonsense strategy that worked, and thanks largely to  President Biden's actions, gasoline prices have fallen an average of  $1.90 per gallon nationwide since their peak in June.   One thing that episode underscores is that fossil fuel prices are  volatile. As long as we rely on gasoline and other fossil fuels to meet  America's energy needs, our country's energy security and affordability  remain at the whims of dictators like Putin on the other side of the  world.   While I agree, just like I did back in 2015, that we should not  export U.S. crude oil to China, I want to stress that this bill could  have been improved through bipartisan cooperation, regular order, and  committee consideration. If Republicans hope to actually enact  legislation, this is not a pathway to success.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Castor), who chaired our Select Committee on the Climate  Crisis in the last Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Peters), a member of our committee and a leader on  environmental issues.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Sherman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Houlahan), who has been working on this issue for  some time.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. Casten), who is a leader on energy issues.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).  [[Page H213]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Huffman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Mrs. Fletcher), who is a member of our committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains on both  sides.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   I listened to the majority leader, and I want to stress that history  is not on his side.   The fact of the matter is that the Republicans created this problem  by lifting the ban on the export of crude oil to China and the rest of  the world when they were in the majority. This bill does nothing to  solve the problem.   Only 2 percent of the oil that is exported to China comes from the  SPR. Even if this bill passes, which it won't in the Senate, it will  still allow the other 98 percent of crude oil to go to China.   The consequence of the Republican policy was to destroy jobs at  American refineries, including my home State of New Jersey, because  they allowed the crude oil to be exported, and as a result, a lot of  the refineries closed, and we lost jobs here.   Don't tell me that this is a bill that is going to help our country,  help jobs. It is just the opposite. It is just masking the reality,  which is they want to continue to sell oil to China, to Russia, to  Iran, and to all our adversaries.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time because they have more time on their side.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time until we are prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.   It certainly is no surprise that the oil industry would support this  bill because this bill does absolutely nothing to prevent them from  selling to China and to Russia and all our adversaries.   Only 2 percent of the oil that is sold to China comes from the SPR,  so they will continue to be able to sell to whoever they please.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time until we  close.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.   The gentleman talks about how China has built up its reserves, its  petroleum reserves. It is because you, when you were in the majority,  stopped the ban on export, and they used that opportunity to build up  their reserves.   This has nothing to do with the SPR. Mr. Speaker, 98 percent of the  oil that is exported to China is not from the SPR.   So they used the opportunity since 2015 when you lifted the ban to  build up their petroleum reserves on your watch.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself  the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I find myself compelled to point out that listening to  Republican arguments today, you would think that they have been sacred  stewards of the SPR, and that couldn't be further from the truth.   In fact, when Republicans had the majority in both the House and the  Senate from 2015 to 2019, they passed six bills, none of which had  anything to do with energy, that raided the SPR for a total of 260  million barrels of crude.   Now the Republicans stand here criticizing President Biden's usage of  the SPR, and it is laughable. President Biden's usage of the SPR has  helped lower gas prices by nearly $1.80 per gallon since their peak.   While the Republicans want to pretend they are tough on China, it is  really the opposite that is true. Last year, the Biden administration  was forced to sell 20 million barrels from the SPR under one of those  laws that I mentioned earlier that passed a Republican-controlled  Congress.   The Republicans didn't include any restrictions, no restrictions or  stipulations on that sale, and as a result, the administration was  forced to sell to the highest bidders, including a firm owned by the  People's Republic of China.   Again, I am going to stress in closing, the Republicans caused China  to have a huge petroleum reserve by lifting the ban on crude oil in  2015 when they were in the majority.   Prior to 2015 when the Republicans lifted the ban on exports of crude  oil, we had that ban in place for 40 years--40 years--and then in 2015,  they came in, and they lifted the ban, so they caused this problem.   During the Trump administration, the amount of crude oil that was  sold to China was unbelievable. As a result, the petroleum reserve, you  know, increased significantly in China. They took advantage of  the situation.    Now, if you really wanted to do something today, first of all, you  would say that the SPR should not only be banned by selling oil from  the SPR to China, but you should say that you can't sell it to Russia.  You can't sell it to Iran. You can't sell it to North Korea.   You can't sell it to our adversaries, which is exactly what the  gentlewoman from Pennsylvania, Ms. Houlahan's bill, does on a  bipartisan basis.   But even beyond that, you could simply say no crude oil should be  sold at all, exported at all, or certainly not exported to our  adversaries, and that is not what is happening here.   So this is a problem that was created by the Republicans, and they  pretend that they are doing something about it today, but, in fact,  they are not.   The reason is because they are with the Big Oil. They are with the  special interests that want to sell this crude oil, continue to sell it  overseas, and they don't care that it goes to our adversaries. That is  the bottom line.   This bill is not going to accomplish anything, and so I would urge my  colleagues to vote ``no'' on the legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 331,  nays 97, not voting 6, as follows:                               [Roll No. 31]                                 YEAS--331       Aderholt      Alford      Allen      Allred      Amodei      Armstrong      Arrington      Auchincloss      Babin      Bacon      Baird      Balderson      Banks      Barr      Bean (FL)      Bentz      Bera      Bergman      Bice      Biggs      Bilirakis      Bishop (GA)      Bishop (NC)      Blunt Rochester      Boebert      Bost      Boyle (PA)      Brecheen      Brownley      Buck      Bucshon      Budzinski      Burchett      Burgess      Burlison      Calvert      Cammack      Caraveo      Carbajal      Carey      Carl      Carson      Carter (GA)      Carter (TX)      Cartwright      Case      Castor (FL)      Castro (TX)      Chavez-DeRemer      Ciscomani      Cleaver      Cline      Cloud      Clyde      Cohen      Cole      Collins      Comer      Connolly      Costa      Courtney      Craig      Crane      Crawford      Crenshaw      Crow      Cuellar      Curtis      D'Esposito      Davids (KS)      Davidson      Davis (NC)      De La Cruz      Dean (PA)      DeLauro      Deluzio      DesJarlais      Diaz-Balart      Doggett      Donalds      Duarte      Duncan      Dunn (FL)      Edwards      Ellzey      Emmer      Eshoo      Estes      Ezell      Fallon      Feenstra      Ferguson      Finstad      Fischbach      Fitzgerald      Fitzpatrick      Fleischmann      Fletcher      Flood      Foster      Foxx      Franklin, C.
