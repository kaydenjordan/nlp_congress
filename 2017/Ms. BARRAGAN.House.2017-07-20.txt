 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 2825.   Mr. Speaker, first I want to thank my colleagues on the Homeland  Security Committee for adopting my amendment to provide $45 million to  reimburse local law enforcement at airports. There has been an increase  in the tax at airports, including at my home airport of LAX, and this  funding is vital to keeping our airports secure and our economy moving.   Both sides compromised to move this bill forward, and the programs in  it are critical to the security of our ports, our borders, and our  homeland. Going forward, we can do more to add more funding at the  ports.   I represent America's port, the Port of Los Angeles. Our ports are  the Nation's largest border crossings, so we must invest in funding  security at the ports.   The port security grants I proposed in my committee are crucial to  the cyber and physical safety programs at the Ports of Los Angeles and  Long Beach, and without increased funding, they have been forced to  stop several innovative and important projects. I will continue to  fight for increased port security funding. I am determined to fill the  staffing and funding gaps in maritime security and give our ports what  they need to be safe and efficient.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this reauthorization,  but we have more work to do.   Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Donovan), chairman of the Subcommittee on Emergency  Preparedness, Response, and Communications of the Homeland Security  Committee.
