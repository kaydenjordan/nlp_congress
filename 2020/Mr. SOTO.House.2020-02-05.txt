 Madam Speaker, today, I rise because it is National Gun  Violence Survivors Week, a time when we focus on sharing and amplifying  the stories of gun violence survivors who live with the impacts of gun  violence every day.   I recall the morning of June 12, 2016, when my wife and I were  awakened at 6 in the morning by a barrage of texts because the  unthinkable happened to our happy little town of Orlando, Florida. Gun  violence on a massive scale had reared its ugly head at a place where  people just wanted to have a good time, at the Pulse nightclub.   We lost 49 Americans that day, 49 of my fellow Orlandoans who were  just there to enjoy friendship and camaraderie. Their lives were taken  way too early from us. But we also have to focus on the 53 who were  wounded, the survivors of the Pulse nightclub tragedy. One of them is a  coworker of mine, Ramses Tinoco.   Ramses is a paralegal who was good spirited, hard-working, and always  excited about the job. Suddenly, for several weeks, he wasn't able to  come back to work, or at least in a regular fashion. I remember talking  to him about what it was like to be there. It was hard for him to talk  about it, and I don't blame him because no one should have to see those  types of horrors.   Another good friend of mine, Ricardo Negron-Almodovar, a lawyer in  Puerto Rico who came to central Florida for a new start, and within  less than a year of living in Orlando, he faced this vicious tragedy.  But he has been fighting back. He is now on the Pulse national memorial  advisory committee. We have a bipartisan bill going through the House  that would make it a national memorial to remember those 49 we lost and  those 53 wounded survivors.   But I also want to talk about the folks who take care of the  survivors.   Terry DeCarlo, who is pictured here on the far right, was retiring  the Monday after the Pulse nightclub shooting from the LGBT+ Center in  Orlando. Terry couldn't retire when his community needed him most, so  he stayed on for a year, bringing in supplies, helping with mental  health, helping the families coming from around the country to help  their loved ones who were still surviving.   During that time, all Terry thought about was others. It was only a  few months after he retired a year-plus later that he found out that he  had advanced stages of cancer that was teeming through his jaw. One can  only wonder whether, if he wasn't so busy, he might have gotten  treatment or had noticed beforehand. But that wasn't Terry.   Terry cared about others. Terry lived to serve, and we just lost him  last month. It is a sad tragedy, but Terry's legacy will be remembered.   We also have to honor with action, with real solutions. The shooter  in this instance had a SIG Sauer MCX semiautomatic rifle, a weapon of  war made for battlefields, not for a suburban nightclub, one that could  do unspeakable carnage even before police could get on the scene.   There are things that are even more common ground than assault  weapons bans. Our House passed a bipartisan universal background checks  bill to make sure that, simply, those who aren't supposed to have guns  don't get them. With giant loopholes for gun shows and private sales,  this just doesn't make sense. It is time to pass it.   Also, the Charleston loophole, where we saw someone put a false  address, and when the background check didn't come back, he  automatically got his guns and shot up a church in Charleston.   It is time for action.  [[Page H771]]                                ____________________
