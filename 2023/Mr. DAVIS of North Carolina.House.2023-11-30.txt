 Madam Speaker, I am glad to join the  residents back home in honoring the service of Milton ``Russ'' Bullock.   Milton Bullock, born in Princeville, North Carolina, is widely known  for his tenor voice as a singer in the legendary group The Platters,  with Billboard hits like ``(You've Got) The Magic Touch'' and ``Only  You.''   While he has captivated many worldwide, it is his impact in his  hometown that I wish to applaud.   After touring with The Platters, Milton Bullock returned to eastern  North Carolina, where he ran for office and has been a dedicated  community leader. As a commissioner on the Princeville Town Council, he  has served as a role model for youth, helped with disaster assistance,  and preserved the rich history of Princeville, which is the first  African-American settlement in the Nation.   Milton Bullock has been on many stages. However, we are glad he  didn't forget home.   Milton, ``Only You.''                            ____________________
