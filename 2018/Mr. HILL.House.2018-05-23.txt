 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the hardships that  many foster youth have had to endure and highlight the persistence and  determination that they embody as they develop and transition to  adulthood.   In Arkansas, we have over 5,000 children currently in the State's  foster care system. As a member of the Foster Care Caucus here in the  House, I am proud to cosponsor our resolution and have had the pleasure  for the last 3 years to sponsor a former foster youth for Shadow Day  here on the Hill.   This year I am honored to host Stefan Specht, a former foster youth  from my district. Stefan is currently enrolled with Job Corps to obtain  a certification in office administration and plans on working towards a  degree in business.   Stefan is also a part of Immerse Arkansas, a vital program dedicated  to helping foster youth with the difficult transition to adulthood.  This program was a critical part of the changing point in Stefan's life  and giving him a place to belong.   Many foster youth are not provided with programs like Immerse or a  community to help support them in finding a career and home after they  exit the foster care system. I am proud to be in this caucus and so  proud to support our Shadow Day here on Capitol Hill.                            ____________________
