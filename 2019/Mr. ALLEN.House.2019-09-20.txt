 Madam Speaker, every day that Speaker Pelosi delays a vote  on the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, American workers and  their families are hurt. Right now, farmers, ranchers, and businesses  in Georgia and across the country face unnecessary uncertainty.   This trade deal is vital to our economy, and passing USMCA would be a  huge win for the American people. Canada and Mexico both serve as top  markets for a number of our U.S. agricultural products.   In Georgia, 22,558 jobs depend on manufacturing exports to Canada and  Mexico.   Passing this trade agreement would also strengthen our already  vibrant economy. The USMCA can add another 176,000 new jobs and add  $68.2 billion to GDP growth.   Let's ensure free and fair trade while granting our farmers,  ranchers, and manufacturers the protections they deserve.   I urge my Democratic colleagues to end these partisan politics and  pass USMCA or, at the very least, put the bill on the House floor for a  vote.                            ____________________
