 Mr. Speaker, I know I am new here, but I came here to  work--to work across the aisle and to actually get things done. But  here we are on the eve of our country's default, and my Republican  colleagues aren't even here to work with.   This isn't difficult. The United States Government contracted for and  received goods and services. Now it must pay for them. We must pay our  bills.   Default would be catastrophic for the people in Louisville, Kentucky.  New car loans would go up by $800. Mortgages for new homes would  increase by $38,000. There are 317,000 families, seniors, and veterans  who are at risk of losing their benefits, not to mention the long-term  damage to our currency and reputation around the world.   The alternative proposed by extreme Republicans is that we slash  benefits to  [[Page H2617]]  our veterans and to needy kids instead of closing tax loopholes for  billionaires and megacorporations. This is fiscally irresponsible, and  it is morally wrong.   Do better. Sign the discharge petition and get this done to save our  economy.                            ____________________
