 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor an  American icon and celebrated Arkansan, John Harold Johnson.   Born in Arkansas City, Arkansas, in 1918, Mr. Johnson persevered  through poverty and graduated high school with honors before attending  the University of Chicago and Northwestern University.   In 1942, he founded the Johnson Publishing Company, which published  Ebony and Jet, two of the defining magazines of the late 20th century.  Mr. Johnson's Ebony coverage of the Little Rock Nine in 1957 projected  the crisis into the public eye, making him a critical figure in the  civil rights movement.   A member of the Forbes 400, Mr. Johnson was a terrific entrepreneur  and executive. In 1996, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom  from President Bill Clinton for his work toward achieving equality.   This Black History Month, I am proud to honor Mr. Johnson's enduring  legacy and indelible impact on the State of Arkansas.                            ____________________
