 Madam Speaker, I rise today at a time of historical  concern: Last week, on this very House floor, an attack on democracy,  that symbol. But it was an attack from within on this very floor.   Let's be clear. Cause and effect: rally at the White House, march  down Pennsylvania Avenue--a parade in reverse--and an attack on this  Chamber.   A police officer was killed, and what I hear is, ``Time to heal.'' He  is not even buried yet.   It is clear and present danger. No one is above the law--not the  President, if he has 4 years or 4 days. We must do the right thing for  all Americans because he must be held accountable.
