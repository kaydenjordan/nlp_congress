 Mr. Speaker, Americans across the country are justifiably  frustrated by the higher prices they are experiencing at the pump, in  the grocery store, and across the board.   Right now, working families in every district across this country are  crying out for relief. They are tired of political games, and they are  tired of partisan attacks. Our constituents don't want Congress in a  food fight. They want compromise, and they want solutions.   My friends, today, we have a bipartisan, commonsense solution at our  fingertips.   The Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act will lift up our constituents by  lowering prices at the grocery store aisle and at the pump and creating  a situation where we are seen as acting together.   My provision, the Year-Round Fuel Choice Act, will allow for the  year-round sale of homegrown biofuels, which can sell for as much as 40  cents less per gallon than traditional gasoline. Why would we deny that  low-cost alternative to working families who are so desperate for  savings?   My Strengthening the Agriculture and Food Supply Chain Act will help  lower prices at the grocery store by getting products from ships to  shelves faster and shoring up our food supply chain for future  generations. My friends, why would we deny these critical savings to  our constituents who are simply trying to put food on the table?   The American people want action. They are calling for us to use every  tool at our disposal to fight inflation and lower costs. We must  respond to their call.   I appreciate the support of this package from my Democratic  colleagues and many of my Republican colleagues, and I encourage all of  you to vote ``yes.''
