 Mr. President, as a member of the Senate Committee  on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, it is my privilege to recognize  a woman-owned small business that is dedicated to its customers,  employees, and community. In honor of the U.S. Small Business  Administration's National Small Business Week, it is my pleasure to  name Brunow Contracting of Council Bluffs, IA, the Senate Small  Business of the Day.   Brunow Contracting represents the story of a construction company  with an unlikely founder. Tamara Brunow was a pre-law student at the  College of Saint Mary who found herself working in construction. She  began her career with an internship at the U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers, Omaha District, in military contracting. It was in this role  that she saw a future in construction and government contracts.   After her time at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, she proceeded to  work for two other construction organizations, Oakview Construction and  Lueder Construction. During her tenure with these firms, she realized  that while she loved her jobs, she knew she wanted to be her own boss.  This prompted her to launch Brunow Contracting in 2008. Shortly after  her launch, Brunow Contracting acquired its first contract of $1.3  million dollars to build a Presbyterian church.   Brunow Contracting specializes in government contracting and is  certified by the Small Business Administration as an 8(a) and HUBZone  business. Brunow Contracting has completed numerous contracts, ranging  in value from $800 to nearly $5 million, and a client list which  includes the City of Omaha, the U.S. Forest Service, the Department of  Veterans Affairs, Southwest Iowa Planning Council, and the U.S. Coast  Guard. These projects have included everything from churches, to water  treatment plants, to data facilities for Facebook.  [[Page S2769]]    With dedication and determination, Ms. Brunow, successfully started a  construction company as a single mother of three children in the middle  of a recession. Now, she is the owner of one of the only woman-owned  construction businesses in America, a recipient of the Midland Business  Journal's 40 under 40, and a leader within her community. Today, Ms.  Brunow has expanded her business reach to include serving as the head  of H2W Apparel, a women's active wear company. Additionally, Ms. Brunow  remains an active mentor for women entrepreneurs and advocate for  female entrepreneurship.   Ms. Brunow embodies what it means to be an entrepreneur and small  business owner. Despite those telling her that it is not the right  industry or not the right time, Brunow Contracting quickly became a  multimillion-dollar business with an A+ rating from the Better Business  Bureau. Ms. Brunow showed that, while it certainly is not easy, it is  possible to simultaneously build a business, be a great mother,  volunteer as a mentor, and remain committed to your community. It is my  distinct pleasure to honor Ms. Brunow and the entire team at Brunow  Contracting as the Senate Small Business of the Day. You make Iowa  proud, and I look forward to watching your continued growth and  success.                            ____________________
