 Mr. Speaker, we are here today because of the abject failure  of the administration to do its fundamental duty to protect the United  States.   We have a wide open border, empowering cartels, empowering China to  the detriment of American citizens and to the migrants who seek to come  here, supposedly in the name of compassion. However, that is in the  false name of compassion.   Dead migrants, lying along the Rio Grande and in ranches in south  Texas. The extent to which migrants suffer in the Texas heat--53 dying  in a tractor-trailer last summer in San Antonio; thousands being sold  into the sex trafficking trade, being used as crass political pawns by  a party devoid of anything substantive to take this country forward.   Republicans are standing up strongly to make sure that this country  will stand for the rule of law that sets our country apart around the  globe and attracts so many to want to come here.   Border Patrol right now apprehended over 10,000 migrants on Monday  and 11,000 on Tuesday, the highest single-day totals ever recorded.  There were 26,000 got-aways and 660,000 migrants waiting in Mexico. The  President of Guatemala has confirmed 80,000 Venezuelan migrants are  traveling to the U.S. ahead of title 42's expiration; 15,000 Venezuelan  migrants crossed into Brownsville; Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz said  he estimates 60,000 to 65,000 migrants are in northern Mexico.   I got a text from local law enforcement yesterday saying: We are  almost at broken arrow. Every sector is near 150 percent capacity. DHS  is calling for border agents from other northern and coastal sectors to  help the southern border. The first 550 in a group of 1,500  servicemembers from the Army and Marines were set to arrive. A shootout  between the Mexican Army and human smugglers erupted at the Pharr- Reynosa International Bridge. Schools in El Paso are adding more  security. El Paso ran out of shelter. El Paso declared an emergency.  Brownsville declared an emergency. Laredo declared an emergency. San  Antonio is preparing; their migrant shelters are expressing concerns  about being overwhelmed. Even our Nation's Capital is being  overwhelmed. Now, the New York City mayor--a sanctuary city-- criticizing bussing, is bussing migrants outside of New York City out  to the suburbs because my Democratic colleagues and the Democratic  administration and Democratic leaders in so-called sanctuary cities  don't give a whit about migrants. It is about political power, and they  are costing lives. They are endangering Americans. They are causing  children to die from fentanyl poisoning, and they know it. That is what  is so pathetic and sad.   Republicans offer legislation today that would force this  administration to do the job it refuses to do, by ending the magnet, by  stopping the releases, by forcing us to do the job we are supposed to  do to protect unaccompanied children from being atop train cars, being  subjected to the abuses of cartels, holding families together while we  adjudicate claims of asylum, and, yes, providing for a path for asylum  while making sure we don't create a magnet for the abuse of migrants in  the false name of compassion.   Republicans are leading. We are doing the job that the President  refuses to do. The American people know it; they see it; and my  Democratic colleagues are going to suffer the consequences for this  abject failure.                                time  1245
