 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the bipartisan  H.R. 3441, the Save Local Business Act, and the 1.7 million jobs it  would save on enactment.   This common-sense legislation, which I cosponsored, restores the  proper relationship which served small business owners for decades-- providing stability for employers and employees.   By enacting this legislation, small business owners in Northern  Virginia can again exercise control over the operations of their  business rather than dealing with additional legal complexity layered  on by the National Labor Relations Board.   With all members' support for this legislation to help Main Street,  Congress can correct the misdirected regulatory policies of the past  which were overly harmful for business operators, restrictive on  entrepreneurs, and resulted in increased cost's for consumers.   There are over 2,000 locally owned franchise businesses in my  district. After hearing the concerns of many of them at Abrakadoodle  headquarters in Sterling this past year, I am proud to stand up for  these job creators and support this legislation today.   I will continue to advocate for policies which promote local  ownership and control--and permit my constituents to strive for the  American dream.   I urge my colleagues to do the same--support the rule and vote in  favor of the underlying bill, H.R. 3441.   I commend the distinguished gentleman from Alabama, Mr. Byrne, and  the Committee on Education and the Workforce for their work on this  great bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Russell). All time for debate has  expired.   Pursuant to House Resolution 607, the previous question is ordered on  the bill, as amended.   The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.   The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was  read the third time.                                time  1745                              Motion to Recommit
