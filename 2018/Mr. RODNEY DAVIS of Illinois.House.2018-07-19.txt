 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the  life of my friend, John McGovern. He was a beloved friend, family man,  and a staple in Illinois politics. He passed away unexpectedly on July  14.   For decades, John worked in numerous State, congressional, and U.S.  Senate offices and campaigns in our home State of Illinois. He was more  than just a brilliant spokesperson and a political strategist, but also  a mentor and a friend to everyone he worked with or worked for. He was  even the best man at my good friend former Senator Mark Kirk's wedding.   He always remained a loyal and genuine person, which is something you  don't always find in politics. No matter the situation, even with  policy and ideological differences, he stayed true to his impeccable  ethics and to his civility.   John was also involved in his community. He served on the board of  the Boys and Girls Club of Chicago, the Elawa Farm Foundation, and on  the auxiliary board of the Art Institute of Chicago.   Words cannot describe how much we will miss his counsel, his wit, and  his friendship. I offer my sincerest condolences to his wife,  Wentworth; his two young sons; and to all of us and all who knew John  McGovern.                            ____________________
