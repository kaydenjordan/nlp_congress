 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  recess from 2:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. today for a briefing.    Mr. President, in a few minutes, I want to speak about  President Trump's nomination of Eugene Scalia to be the Secretary of  Labor, but first I want to introduce two speeches that I made in  Tennessee into the Record. I notice the room nearly cleared when I  observed I was about to make some speeches, but at least there are some  people watching.   The first speech was on August 26 of this year in Clinton, TN. It had  to do with the Clinton 12. These were 12 students, some as young as 14  years of age, who walked down a hill and enrolled in Clinton High  School in 1956--63 years ago--and became the first students to  integrate a public school in the South.   Many of us remember what happened the next year in Arkansas, when  Governor Faubus stood in the door, and President Eisenhower had to send  in the troops to integrate Little Rock Central High School. I remember  those days very well. I was in high school myself then.   It is hard to imagine the courage it must have taken for those  children to walk down that hill and integrate that school. Most of them  were there in Clinton, TN, when they were honored in the month of  August.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my remarks on the Clinton  12 Commemorative Walk we took that day be printed in the Record  following my remarks about Mr. Scalia.                            Tennessee Valley Fair    Secondly, the Tennessee Valley Fair. It is a big event in Knoxville,  TN, that was held on September 6. It was attended by almost everybody  who has anything to do with politics in Knox County, which means the  room was full with 500 or 600 people.   It was an opportunity for me to make a suggestion to the people of  Knoxville about what to celebrate. Many of us had been watching Ken  Burns' ``Country Music'' special on PBS. He reminds us that Tennessee  has a lot to celebrate in terms of country music. His first two hours  were about Bristol, TN, which is the birthplace of country music. It is  where Ralph Peer of New York City went to Bristol, in 1927, put an ad  in the paper, saying: ``Hillbillies, come down out of the mountains  with your music,'' and here came the Carter family, Jimmy Rogers, and  several others.   One of the people on Mr. Burns' show this week was Charlie McCoy, the  harmonica player, a great musician. It reminded me of a time when I was  Governor and recruiting the General Motors' Saturn plant to Tennessee.  We had the executives coming from Detroit. We talked about what to  serve them for dinner. We served them country ham. We talked about whom  to have play a piece of music after dinner, and I invited Charlie McCoy  to play his harmonica.   A Nashville woman came up to me and said: Governor, I am so  embarrassed.   I said: Why is that?   She said: You had all those fine people from Detroit, and then you  had that harmonica player. She said: What will they think of us? Why  didn't you offer them Chopin?   I said: Madam, why should we offer them average Chopin when we have  the best harmonica player in the world?   The better people of Nashville had resisted for a long time calling  Nashville Music City, but of course Music City is a wonderful  signature, a great personality, and it is one reason Nashville is such  a celebrated city today.   In the same way, Knoxville has violated the Biblical injunction about  don't keep your light under a bushel because it rarely talks much about  Oak Ridge. So the speech I made would suggest that the sign at the  Knoxville airport, which says, ``Welcome to Knoxville: Gateway to the  Great Smoky Mountains,'' ought to say instead, ``Welcome to Knoxville:  Gateway to the Great Smoky Mountains and the Oak Ridge Corridor.''   There are nearly 3,000 scientists, engineers, and technicians who  work at  [[Page S5682]]  the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the largest science and energy  laboratory in America, and at the University of Tennessee and at the  Tennessee Valley Authority. That part of the personality of the  Knoxville area needs to be celebrated.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my remarks on  the Clinton 12, that my speech at the Tennessee Valley Fair on  September 6 be printed in the Record.                         Nomination of Eugene Scalia    Mr. President, in my remaining time, I would like to say a few words  about Eugene Scalia and the President's nomination of him to be  Secretary of Labor for the United States.   The Senate will vote, probably tomorrow, on whether to confirm Mr.  Scalia. I certainly hope the Senate does, and I believe the Senate  will.   We have known for two months that President Trump intended for Mr.  Scalia to be the Secretary. He announced that intention on July 18. We  have had all of his papers since August 27. Those are the government  ethics papers and the committee papers that are necessary. They all  came a month ago. He gave us a copy of all of his writings. He came to  a hearing the other day. The Presiding Officer was there. He testified  for three hours. We had two rounds of questions. Senators could ask  anything they wanted. He offered to visit, over the last month, with  every member of our committee and did with all but two. So we know  plenty about Mr. Scalia. He answered another 418 questions that  committee members asked him after his hearing.   I think two months is long enough to consider him and consider all  that information.   I remember when President Obama's Secretary of Education stepped down  in the last year of the President's term. I encouraged the President to  nominate John King, whom the President wanted to nominate, but he was  afraid he couldn't be confirmed because we, the Republican majority,  disagreed with him. I disagreed with him. I said: Mr. President, it is  important for you to have a confirmed member of your Cabinet and to  have that person considered and confirmed promptly. It is important to  the Senate to have a Cabinet member who goes through the process of  questions and advice and consent. That is our most important function  in many ways.   We confirmed John King in a month.   We have had two months to consider Mr. Scalia, and that should be  enough. He has a broad background in labor and employment law. He is a  partner in a major Washington, DC, law firm, so he knows all the  issues. He spent a year as Solicitor of Labor in the George W. Bush  administration. He left the firm to be Special Assistant to the  Attorney General of the United States in 1992.   Academically, he is very well prepared. He went to the University of  Virginia. He was editor in chief of the University of Chicago Law  Review. He has been a guest lecturer at the University of Chicago Law  School and an adjunct professor at the David A. Clarke School of Law at  the University of the District of Columbia. He is very well qualified.   It is important for the Department to have a well-qualified, steady  leader. I like the demeanor that Mr. Scalia showed in his hearing. The  Democratic members of the committee were there, and they were very  vigorous in their questioning. I also like the fact that they were  courteous to him. They didn't take the attitude that sometimes happens  in U.S. Senate--that you are innocent until nominated. They took the  attitude that he was a well-qualified person with whom they disagreed,  so they asked him questions. He answered them, and he did a good job.   I like the fact that the Trump Administration has taken steps to  create a more stable environment by having a more sensible joint  employer standard that doesn't make it more difficult for American  families to own and operate franchises. There are more than seven  hundred thousand American franchise establishments. That is the way you  get into the middle class in America. We need a steady hand there to  make sure that happens properly.   I like the fact that the administration has a more reasonable  overtime rule. The overtime threshold needed to be changed, but the  last administration raised it too high too fast. It caused church camps  to have to lay off people and close in the summer. It had all sorts of  unintended consequences and bipartisan opposition. The administration  announced yesterday a more reasonable step.   Next, association health plans. Among the people in America who have  the hardest time paying for insurance are those who make $50,000 a year  and don't get a government subsidy. Association health plans help  people who work for small businesses to be able to get the same kind of  insurance that people who work for IBM or big businesses get--insurance  that covers preexisting conditions and offers the same sort of consumer  protections.   It has been estimated by Avalere that the association health plan  rule that the Department of Labor put out would help three to four  million Americans be able to afford health insurance and save their  premium costs by several thousand dollars a year. Mr. Scalia can work  on that.   Mr. President, I received 32 letters in support of Mr. Scalia's  nomination from small business owners, employers, industry groups, and  his colleagues. I will mention a couple.   Former Obama administration official Cass Sunstein wrote:         His decency is part of what makes him someone who tends to       go case-by-case, and to end up where the facts and the law       take him. . . . He does not have an ideological       straightjacket. He takes issues on their merits.    Thomas Susman, who was Senator Ted Kennedy's counsel, wrote:         Gene is precisely the kind of person that our country needs       in the Cabinet: experienced, ethical, professional, open-      minded, fair, and brilliant.    There are a number of other letters from former Department of Labor  career attorneys, Chicago Law Review editorial board members, Fraternal  Order of Police members, and others.   Suffice it to say that the country is fortunate the President has  nominated Eugene Scalia to be the U.S. Secretary of Labor. He has  conducted himself admirably in the two-month process of going through  the Senate confirmation. We have a chance to bring that to a conclusion  tomorrow. My hope is that the Senate will confirm him and that he will  be in office by the end of the week.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Commemorating the Clinton 12 Walk         Thank you Mayor Frank. To Lt. Governor McNally, Congressman       Fleischmann, Representative Bob Clement, Judy Gooch, students       and teachers, and especially, to members of the Clinton 12       and their families and friends.        It is hard standing here to imagine the courage that it       took the Clinton 12, some of them as young as 14 years of       age, to take a walk that we just took this morning and become       the first students to integrate a public high school in the       south.        In that year, 63 years ago, I was a rising junior at       Maryville High School, about an hour away.        I remember reading in the Knoxville newspapers about John       Kasper, and the demonstrations, and how the men and women we       honor here today couldn't be intimidated.        I remember the uncommon courage of then-governor Frank       Clement, whose son Bob is here, who sent in state troopers       and national guardsmen in support of the Clinton 12.        Today it seems like it would be an easy decision, but it       was not an easy decision for the governor.        I remember that the very next year in 1957, it was a       different story in Arkansas.        The Governor of Arkansas stood in the door and stopped       students from coming into Little Rock Central High School,       and President Eisenhower mobilized the National Guard to       support the students.        It's unpleasant to remember some of the things from then.        It's unpleasant to remember the Boys' and Girls' State       program that we high schoolers would attend, was then       segregated by race.        That the Alcoa student, who later became the first African       American basketball coach at the University of Tennessee,       when he was a teenager and wanted to go to the University of       Tennessee football game, had to sit in a section of the       stadium that was reserved for blacks.        It's unpleasant to remember that there never had been an       African American athlete who played in the Southeastern       Conference, or there hadn't been a black Supreme Court       Justice in Tennessee, or a black chancellor, or a local       judge.        It's unpleasant to remember that African American students       couldn't sit at the front of the bus, couldn't sit at a lunch       counter, and when traveling across our state and some other       states in the South, had to sleep in the car because no motel       would admit them because of their race.  [[Page S5683]]         So it is good to celebrate that things are very different       today, and it's important to remember the courage of the       Clinton 12 and to celebrate that progress.        But it's also important to remember, as we celebrate the       Clinton 12, that things could be even better.        We still have a ways to go.        We have a United States Senator from South Carolina, whose       name is Tim Scott.        He is an African American Senator elected from that state.        He told me that he was arrested seven times within the last       few years in his hometown in Charleston, South Carolina,       basically for being a black man in the wrong place.        And at the time, he was the Vice Mayor of Charleston.        When I first came to the Senate several years ago, your       city manager, Steve Jones, came to see me to tell me       Clinton's vision for preserving the story of the Clinton 12.        It's been a great pleasure to work with him and the city       and so many of you to try to help him do that.        Our former senator, Bill Frist, worked with us to help us       secure some of the first funding for Green McAdoo Cultural       Center.        And a new law we passed in 2009 directed the Secretary of       the Interior to take the first step to making it part of our       National Park System.        The late reverend Benjamin Hooks, a Tennessean who was       President of the NAACP, once told me this: ``Remember, our       country is a work in progress.        In my life, I have seen us come a long way, but we have a       long way to go.''        That is why the story of the Clinton 12 is so important to       remember and celebrate today. Thank you.                           Tennessee Valley Fair         You know, it says in Lamar Alexander's Little Plaid Book       that if you want a standing ovation, seat a few friends in       the front row.        Thanks to those of you right there.        Thanks to Tim Burchett and to Kelly and Isabel.        I want you to know that Tim is not only good at the Vol       Market, he's good in the United States Congress, and I       appreciate the chance to serve with him in his good work       there.        To Speaker Cameron Sexton, congratulations to Cameron. I've       watched his career, he's off to a terrific start.        Mayor Jacobs, Mayor Rogero, Congressman Jimmy Duncan--my       good friend for many years, and he still is--and Wanda Moody,       with whom I worked for a long time.        Distinguished ladies and gentlemen: Coming up here, I was       thinking that our favorite son, Howard Baker, used to remind       us that it was wise to try to be an eloquent listener, but       that gets harder to do the older you get.        For example, you may remember Bobby Bare who sang Detroit       City.        He's in his eighties now.        He was on the Grand Ole Opry stage the other night.        Somebody asked him, ``Bobby, how long you've been wearing       your hearing aids?''        He said, ``Well, it's like this. A few years ago, my wife       said to me, `Bobby, I'm proud of you.' And I said back to       her, `I'm tired of you too.' ''        He said, ``I've been wearing them ever since.''        A few years ago, when I was buying a car in Nashville, the       salesman pulled out his billfold, and he pulled out a picture       of his two-year-old and he said, ``What do you think of       her?''        And I said what a politician always says. I said, ``That is       a beautiful baby.''        And he looked up at me and said, ``She won second best baby       at the Wilson County Fair.''        I've always remembered that because that's what we do at       fairs. We celebrate the best among us.        We celebrate the tastiest tomato, and the biggest pumpkin,       and the prettiest girl and the strongest man, the craziest       quilt, the biggest tractor and the best baby.        And for a century, the Tennessee Valley Fair has been doing       that.        Bob Booker wrote this morning about some of the history       even before then, and I was thinking so much happened in       1919.        I know over in one county, a Maryville high school was       started that year.        Proffitt's Department Store was started that year.        The Kiwanis Club started that year.        The West Plant was being built that year and this fair       started that year.        And I think it was because the war ended in 1918 and       everybody came home and had a burst of enthusiasm about our       country.        They wanted to celebrate what was good about it.        And so here came the fair.        So this fair has been celebrating all the things I just       talked about.        And also, had you come to the Tennessee Valley Fair over       the last century, you could see pigs jumping through hoops,       you could see dancing horses, you could see African American       cultural exhibits, you could see the wildest roller coaster       ride, and you could see the fastest new car.        That's why people came to the fair.        But in the depression, Professor Harcourt Morgan, who later       was the U.T. president and the TVA Board Chairman, suggested       this. He said, ``We ought to use the fair to try to think       differently what we have to celebrate in the Knoxville       area.''        So in that spirit, let me take about five or 10 minutes and       suggest to you what I think we ought to be celebrating in the       Knoxville area.        We have plenty to celebrate.        I mean, telling Eddie earlier, you'd come down to the       airport and there's a sign that says, ``Welcome to Knoxville,       Gateway to the Great Smoky Mountains.'' We've got the biggest       mountains in the East, the most visited park. That's       something to celebrate.        Ken Burns is going to have on television this year his       series on country music.        He thinks it may be more popular than his Civil War series.        Where was the birthplace of country music? Right here in       East Tennessee.        The Tennessee Valley Authority has become the largest       public utility in the United States.        The University of Tennessee has become a major research       institution and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory has grown       from a Manhattan Project to build a bomb to win a war, to       becoming the nation's largest science and energy laboratory,       the home of the world's fastest computer, and the home of the       best new work on 3-D printing for manufacturing.        So we've got a lot to celebrate.        Let's add up those last three. Let's add up TVA, U.T., and       Oak Ridge for just a minute.        When I do that, here's one thing I get: about 3,000       scientists and engineers.        You know that's as large a concentration of brainpower in       the Knoxville area as exists in North Carolina's research       triangle, Route 128 of Massachusetts, or it even rivals the       Silicon Valley--which we know a lot about--in California.        The trouble is when we come to Oak Ridge, the rest of us in       this area are guilty of violating the parable that Jesus       talked about in Matthew, which was don't hide your light       under a bushel.        We just don't talk about it much.        It's not so unusual. It just doesn't happen to us.        About every 10 years at night in Nashville, some of the so-      called ``better'' people will come up and say, ``We're       getting a bad reputation. We'll get known for all this       hillbilly music in Nashville. Can't we remind people we have       a symphony?''        I remember one night when I was governor, we invited the       General Motors executives from Detroit to have dinner at the       mansion.        We were recruiting the Saturn plant like everybody else       was.        So Honey and I decided we would serve a country ham, and I       invited Charlie McCoy to play the harmonica after dinner.        A Nashville lady came up to me afterwards and said,       ``Governor, I'm so embarrassed about what I see. About that       harmonica player, what will those fine people from Detroit       think of us?'' And I said, ``Madam, why should I offer them       average Chopin when we got the best harmonica player in the       world?''        Nashville is pretty happy about being Music City and off       they go.        Then I go to Memphis and they're worrying about Nashville.       They said, ``Nashville's got this, Nashville's got that.''        I say, ``Well, wait a minute. Okay, let's have a jobs       conference.''        So we had a jobs conference and what'd they do? Well, they       said, ``We've got Beale Street, we'll clean it up, we'll       build an agricenter. Nashville doesn't want to do that, that       fits us. We'll get the ducks back walking in the Peabody       Hotel.''        And there went Memphis.        Then here come the people from Chattanooga, ``You gave       Memphis money, we want to build a $2 million aquarium.''        I said, ``Why would you build such a stingy aquarium? If       you're going to do it, build the biggest aquarium from       Baltimore to Miami so people will come to see it.''        And that is what they did. And in the meantime they noticed       they had the beautiful Tennessee River Gorge and a great       downtown. And look where Chattanooga is today.        So let's think about Knoxville, just a minute, and all       those cities.        The idea of hiding our light under a bushel doesn't just       belong to the cities.        It's all over the state.        Some of you will remember Tennessee homecoming '86 when I       asked everybody to find something to celebrate in your       community--invite everybody who lived there to come do it,       and then have a celebration.        And in the Forest Brook neighborhood in Knoxville, they       invited everybody to come home on the 4th of July and they       had a celebration.        And in Hickman County, Minnie Pearl and the people who       lived there made a quilt with all the names of the little       communities in Hickman County so the children would know, for       example, where Bona Aqua came from.        And in Nashville, they invited all the writers who grew up       in Tennessee to come home and they did. And the Festival of       Books still is going on in Nashville.        So I think it's important to stop worrying about what       you're not and start celebrating what you've got, which is       why I have a suggestion to make in the spirit of Professor       Harcourt Morgan, who said, ``We ought to use the fair to take       a little different look about what we have to sell them.''        I suggest that we change the sign at the Knoxville airport       and we say ``Welcome to Knoxville, Gateway to the Great Smoky       Mountains and the Oak Ridge Corridor.''        Now our new governor, Bill Lee, who is an engineer,       understands why we need to do that.  [[Page S5684]]         He told a group from Nashville, ``What Tennessee needs is a       magnet to attract jobs and capital.''        Then he came up to Oak Ridge the next day and said, ``We've       got a magnet right here.''        The first time I met Glenn Jacobs, he talked to me about       the Oak Ridge Corridor before I could talk to him about it.        He's the mayor of Knox County, but he saw the       interconnection.        So I'm sure Mayor Rogero must see those connections every       day.        Tim Burchett is pretty good at the Vol Market, but the       first visit he had with me in Washington was to come talk to       me about the 8,000 Oak Ridgers who live in Knox County and       what he could do to support Oak Ridge and Randy Boyd and       Chancellor Plowman of University of Tennessee.        You know, U.T. now manages the Oak Ridge National       Laboratory, and they started a new hundred million dollar Oak       Ridge Institute at the University of Tennessee to recognize       the importance of that connection.        Last week, I talked to Sam Beall, who, many of you know.        Just like this fair, Sam Beall is 100 years old.        When he came to Knoxville in the 1930s, there was basically       no Oak Ridge.        The Great Smoky Mountains National Park and TVA had just       been created.        And there were no doctoral programs at the University of       Tennessee and no one in their wildest dream could imagine a       personal computer.        Today, Oak Ridge has the largest science and energy       laboratory in America, TVA is the largest public utility,       U.T. is a major research university, and the fastest       computers in the world are about 15 miles away at Oak Ridge.        So things have changed.        When Sam Beall came here in the 1930s, which was about the       time Professor Harcourt Morgan said, ``Let's think about a       little different way to celebrate the Knoxville area.''        When Sam came in the 1930s, Oak Ridge was a secret city.        While a lot of people from around here work there, there       didn't seem to be much relationship between Oak Ridge and       Maryville, or Oak Ridge and Madisonville, or Oak Ridge and       Sevierville, or even Oak Ridge and Knoxville.        So, my suggestion is that we take Professor Harcourt       Morgan's advice in the 1930s and use it this year.        That, along with the prize chickens, the best babies, the       birthplace of country music, and most visited national park.        Let's celebrate the fact that the Knoxville area is the       home of one of the largest concentrations of brain power       anywhere in the United States, rivaling the Research       Triangle, Route 128 and even the Silicon Valley.        And it's also home to one of the best-known brand names in       the world, a brand name that stands for science, energy, and       excellence.        So my suggestion in the spirit of the fair and with the       suggestion of Harcourt Morgan, is let's change the sign at       the Knoxville airport from ``Welcome to Knoxville, Gateway to       the Great Smoky Mountains'' to ``Welcome to Knoxville,       Gateway to the Great Smoky Mountains and the Oak Ridge       Corridor.''        If we want to take the professor's advice and celebrate       what's special about where we live today, that would be the       best way to do it.        Thank you.    Mr. President, I yield the floor.
