 Madam Speaker, this past Wednesday, I met with a group  of high school students from my district who started a local March for  Our Lives chapter to talk about the gun epidemic in our country. Then,  2 days later, we had another mass shooting in Virginia Beach.   According to the Mass Shooting Tracker website, there have been over  181 mass shootings in the United States this year, with over 200  victims losing their lives.   I am proud that we finally passed commonsense gun legislation in this  House that expanded background checks, which is something over 90  percent of the American people wanted, but we need to do more.   The shooting in Virginia Beach used both a silencer and a high- capacity magazine. We need legislation now to outlaw both of those  items as well as automatic rifles. We need to allow the Centers for  Disease Control to study the gun epidemic in our country so we can find  a solution.   But it is not just mass shootings that we need to address. Over two- thirds of all gun deaths in the United States are a result of suicides,  and the number is rising. Over 20 veterans a day are committing  suicide. We must also study firearm suicide and how it relates to  mental health and how we can limit firearm access to those who are  suffering.   We have a problem in our country, and it is not just going to go  away. Now is the time for action. Too many lives are at stake.                            ____________________
