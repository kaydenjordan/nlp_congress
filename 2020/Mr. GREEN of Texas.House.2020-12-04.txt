 Mr. Speaker, and still I rise.   I rise today on behalf of my constituents, Marc and Debra Tice, the  parents of Austin Tice.   Marc and Debra have asked that I extend their sincerest gratitude to  the House of Representatives, all of its leadership and membership, for  the passage of H. Res. 17, a resolution that, in effect, supports the  President's desire to bring their son home.   Hence, Mr. Speaker, pursuant to their request, I thank Speaker  Pelosi, because I had a personal conversation with Speaker Pelosi about  this resolution, and I believe that that led to its coming to the  floor.   I thank Majority Leader Hoyer. He, in effect, orchestrated the  bringing of this resolution to the floor.   I thank Congressman Hill for his support of the resolution at the  committee level and for his efforts to bring his constituent, Dr.  Kamalmaz, home.   I thank the outgoing chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr.  Eliot Engel, for his efforts to bring the resolution out of committee.   I also thank the ranking member, the Texan, Mr. McCaul, who is a  person who has worked with me on many endeavors. He made this  bipartisan early on, and I thank him for what he has done to help us  get it through the committee.   I thank Senator Cornyn, Senator Murray, the 41 cosponsors of H. Res.  17, the 52 Senators and 152 Representatives who signed on to a letter  to the President.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from Debra Tice to  President Trump.                                          Friday, 13 November 2020.        Dear President Trump, Thank you, from the entire Tice       family, for your steadfast commitment and determination to       bring our beloved Austin safely home.        Yesterday there was a news story from the region that       Austin Tice had been released and was on a plane headed home.       Our phones were going crazy, our email was exploding,       Twitter, Facebook, Instagram--every kind of social media was       buzzing with an outpouring of high hopes and great joy. Many,       many news outlets reached out eagerly hoping to verify this       great news.        We know you can make this joyful news a reality. We know       the Syrians are ready to work with you.        Please, please bring Austin home for the holidays.            Respectfully,      Debra Tice.                                   ____         Debra--Working so hard on this. Looking for the answer. We       want Austin back. I will never stop--                                                 Donald J. Trump.       Mr. Speaker, while they have asked me to extend  their gratitude, I personally would like to thank the Tice family for  their unwavering commitment to have Austin returned home and allow him  to be with his family and his friends.   They also wished that I would thank President Trump on their behalf.  I have a letter that is the best evidence of why they would have  President Trump be thanked for what he has done.   The letter reads: ``Friday, 13 November 2020.   ``Dear President Trump,   ``Thank you, from the entire Tice family, for your steadfast  commitment and determination to bring our beloved Austin safely home.   ``Yesterday there was a news story from the region that Austin Tice  had been released and was on a plane headed home. Our phones were going  crazy, our email was exploding, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram--every  kind of social media was buzzing with an outpouring of high hopes and  great joy. Many, many news outlets reached out eagerly hoping to verify  this great good news.   ``We know you can make this joyful news a reality. We know the  Syrians are ready to work with you.   ``Please, please bring Austin home for the holidays.''   It is signed, ``Respectfully, Debra Tice,'' Austin's mother.   The President is known to respond to letters of this kind by simply  writing on a copy of the letter a message to be returned to the sender.   I shall read the President's statement:   ``Debra--Working so hard on this--Looking for the answer. We want  Austin back. I will never stop.''   Mr. President, I salute you for your desire and your commitment to  bring Austin home. And, Mr. President, I pray that it will be done  before Christmas. It would be a wonderful thing, Mr. President, for  this family that you now know and you have communicated with, for this  family that has suffered for some 8 years without their son.   You would do well and serve them well, Mr. President, if you would  honor the commitment that you have indicated on this letter. It would  bring joy unlike any these parents have ever experienced if you would  do so.   So, Mr. President, I salute you. I salute you for your desire and  commitment to bring Austin home. And I suspect that it has a lot to do  with the fact that he is an American citizen, but I also suspect, Mr.  President, that it has a lot to do with what you know about Austin.   Austin is an American hero, a veteran captain of the Marine Corps.  Austin loved his country. He was willing to fight for it and, if  necessary, sacrifice his life for it.   Austin played by the rules. In college, at age 16, he wanted to be a  lawyer. But also, Austin was one of those rare, unique persons who not  only wants to help, but who is willing to go to great lengths, great  extremes to be of service.   He was a freelance journalist, as you know, Mr. President, and as  such, he was willing to go into harm's way to places that most of us  would never go into to be of service, to help people. So Austin decided  that he would take his talents and his desires to Syria.   He went to Syria, and he crossed over the Syrian border in May of  2012. In August of 2012, he was detained at a checkpoint someplace near  Damascus, and he has been missing ever since.   There have been what we call in the intelligence agencies, I believe,  signs and proof of life. We know that he is alive, and we know that 8  years of this experience is taking a toll on Austin.   Austin deserves our greatest efforts to bring him home, because  Austin is an American hero. His parents are in need of his touch, of  his presence. They need to hug their son.   So the appeal has been made, and, Mr. President, you have said that  you believe that you will do everything that you can. I am  paraphrasing. You said you will never stop and that you are looking for  the answer.   I believe the answer is within your power, and I believe the Tice  family will be eternally grateful, as will most Americans, if you will  bring their son home and do so before Christmas.   On behalf of the Tice family, Mr. President, I salute you for your  desire and your commitment to bring him home.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
