 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the recent  100th birthday of longtime Bucks County, Pennsylvania, resident, Lidia  Tubiello.   A resident of Nockamixon, Lidia has consistently been a role model,  showing all of us that hard work and serving others is the calling that  we all have.   A bona fide Rosie the Riveter, Lidia answered the call during World  War II and began work as a welder in western Pennsylvania, where she  helped assemble transport vessels. The ships that Lidia worked on  played a critical role in the invasion of Normandy.   Lidia's husband, Frank, was drafted to the United States Army. Once  the war was over, Lidia and Frank set up their permanent residence in  Bucks County, Pennsylvania. The couple welcomed seven loving children:  Frank, Ralph, Sam, Paul, Laurie, Lisette, and Loretta.   As their children grew and they had their own families, the large  Italian-American family came together for traditional Italian meals  during frequent Sunday dinners.   Mr. Speaker, we are all extremely fortunate to have Lidia in our  community. Her hard work and service are something that we should  honor.                            ____________________
