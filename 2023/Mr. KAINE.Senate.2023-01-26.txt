 Mr. President, January 27, 2023, marks the 200th  anniversary of diplomatic relations between the United States of  America and Argentina. In 1823, President James Monroe named Caesar  Rodney of Delaware as Minister Plenipotentiary to the United Provinces  of the Rio de la Plata.   The longstanding friendship between our two countries is underpinned  by the strong cultural and familial ties which unite our peoples. The  relationship is further enriched by the many unique contributions of  Argentinians to the United States. Both countries are democracies,  working continuously to strengthen our institutions and political  inclusion.   Argentina provides crucial contributions to hemispheric security and  stability, including counterterrorism, defense, and law enforcement  cooperation. It is a valued partner for the United States in tackling  the climate crisis and global health challenges and serves as an  example for the region and the world in supporting expanded economic  prosperity and equality, including for women and disadvantaged  populations.   Argentina is further admired for its leadership in promoting human  rights and the dignity of all people, including of LGBTQI+ persons.  Both the United States and Argentina are dedicated to maintaining a  strong middle class and the importance of independent unions and labor  rights. We are together increasing mutual understanding and friendship  between our peoples through educational exchanges including our  binational Fulbright Commission.   Argentina remains a trusted and desirable destination for world-class  tourism and for trade opportunities with the United States and is  recognized for being a leader in sports through the example set by its  FIFA World Cup champions. Argentina's three World Cup victories have  inspired generations of athletes.   Argentina's cultural, economic, and political contributions to the  region and to the world are invaluable. We must continue to build  towards an ever stronger relationship between Argentina and the United  States.                            ____________________     Mr. President, in 1823, President James Monroe named Heman  Allen of Vermont as the United States' Minister Plenipotentiary and  Envoy Extraordinary to Chile. January 27, 2023, therefore marks the  200th anniversary of official relations between the United States and  Chile. Today, Chile is a regional leader and trusted partner in  promoting democracy, human rights, economic stability, environmental  protection, and advancing equitable and sustainable development.   Chile and the United States cooperate at the highest levels to  promote peace, security, and democracy in the Americas and throughout  the world and have a long history of strong cooperation on science and  technology.   2023 also marks the 20th anniversary of the signing of the U.S.-Chile  Free Trade Agreement that continues to bring increased prosperity to  the American and Chilean peoples. In 1955, Chile and the United States  established the region's first and oldest bilateral Fulbright  Commission to exchange knowledge and expertise.  [[Page S118]]    The bedrock of the U.S.-Chile bilateral relationship is the deep  mutual respect and friendship between the American and Chilean people.  As we enter the third century of our partnership we must continue to  hope for ever stronger ties among our governments and peoples, through  which we together will build a more prosperous, sustainable, and  equitable future.                            ____________________
