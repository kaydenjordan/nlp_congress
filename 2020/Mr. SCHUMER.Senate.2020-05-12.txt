 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, no challenge in our lifetime resembles  the depth of our current challenge. We have faced diseases, recessions,  and natural disasters, but at no time in my lifetime has a public  health crisis on this scale been paired with such an extensive economic  disaster.   Finally--finally--we are beginning to see signs that the spread of  this evil disease has abated in parts of the country--not over but at  least the curve is going down. My home State of New York is just  beginning to turn the corner, but, unfortunately, there are many parts  of the country that have not yet reached their peak.   The unemployment rolls are as long as they have been since the Great  Depression. Working Americans are struggling to pay rent and put food  on the table, and many have no idea when the next paycheck may arrive.   It breaks your heart to see people waiting for hours in their cars to  line up at food banks. When they are interviewed by the press, they are  people who never went to a food bank before. That is how deep and  troubling this crisis is.   So we in Congress have an obligation to do the Nation's business  during this time of crisis, to be focusing on this crisis, to help the  millions of American workers and businesses pleading--pleading--for  assistance.   The Constitution instructs us to provide for the common welfare, but  at this critical juncture in our Nation's history, the Republican  leadership, led by Leader McConnell, is ducking their responsibility,  plain and simple. Leader McConnell has yet to schedule any legislative  business for the floor of the Senate this month having to do with  COVID.   It has taken sustained pressure from Senate Democrats to force our  Republican colleagues to conduct even the routine business of holding  hearings on the coronavirus. We have had a few hearings now, but not  many. Where is the SBA Administrator to talk about the problems in PPP?  Where is Secretary Scalia to talk about the problems in unemployment  insurance? Where are the OSHA executives to talk about how we protect  workers from this pandemic, particularly when they are required to go  to work? They are not around.   Even the hearings we are having are slow. They are sort of eked out  like  [[Page S2359]]  toothpaste from a tube. The word is we are hearing from Mnuchin and  Powell on the 19th. That is close to 2 months after we passed COVID 3.  That is not oversight. That is not Congress's job--at any time. It is  made even worse because we are in a crisis.   Then, last night, amazingly, the Republican leader explained that  Republicans have ``not yet felt the urgency of acting immediately.''  Let me repeat that. With millions of Americans sick and tens of  thousands dying, with depression levels of unemployment, the Republican  leader, Senator McConnell, said that Republicans have ``not yet felt  the urgency of acting immediately.''   We live in a divided nation, but one thing that pretty much everyone  agrees on is that there is a great deal of urgency right now.   Leader McConnell, there is nothing more urgent to a family that is  struggling to feed their children and keep a roof over their heads.  Leader McConnell, there is nothing more urgent to a small business  owner who is inches away from closing the doors of his life's work. The  Republican leadership needs to wake up--wake up--to the dire economic  reality tens of millions of Americans are facing.   We must pass big, bold legislation to confront the crisis before us.  That is just what the House of Representatives is working on right now.  We don't believe that our two parties will agree on everything we must  do, but at the very least--at the very least--we should agree there is  an urgency to provide relief to our citizens who are suffering and  struggling.   President Hoover lacked the urgency to get the Federal Government  involved at the outset of the Great Depression. Every history book  teaches us that his error prolonged and likely deepened the suffering  of American workers. When Republican leader looks at unemployment  numbers and say that we don't need to act immediately, that government  has done enough already, they are the latter-day Herbert Hoovers, and I  fear it could lead to similar results, a deeper and longer recession,  and--God forbid, but it is not out of the question--a second Great  Depression because of the inaction and incompetence of the President,  being followed obediently, wrongly by the Republican Senators.   The lack of urgency in the Republican Party extends down Pennsylvania  Avenue to the Oval Office. From almost the very beginning of this  crisis, President Trump has downplayed its severity and tried to wish  it out of existence.   The President said coronavirus might disappear ``miraculously''--his  word. He said it was a hoax. He said the warm weather might take care  of it. He pitched quack medicines and speculated that a vaccine could  be ready in 2 months. Two months ago, the President said that ``anybody  who wants a test can get a test,'' which is not even close to being  true.   The President's words are reckless--constant belittling of the  crisis, ignoring the crisis, burying the truth, and burying his head in  the sand--and it has prolonged and made the crisis worse, and the  American people know it.   That is why he lashes out--the President does--at reporters who ask  him fair questions. That is why. He knows he is to blame for a good  part of the depth and prolongation of this crisis. He knows that. Yet  he can't bring himself to face the truth. He can't bring himself to  tell the American people the truth. Pitching quack medicines, telling  people it is going to go away, saying yesterday ``that we have met the  moment and we have prevailed.'' What planet is he on?   More than 30 million are unemployed, and ``we have prevailed''? There  are 1.3 million infected and 80,000 American fatalities, and those  numbers are still growing. And ``we have prevailed''?   The President's comments show a stunning disregard for the truth, and  it hurts every American. I don't care what your politics is. No one  should tolerate a President who ignores the truth, says whatever pops  into his head, whether it is true or false or dangerous, and then moves  on his merry way to speak the next untruth and talk about the next  quack cure.   The President's comments show a stunning disregard for the truth. It  may have been in the Rose Garden and not on the deck of a battleship,  but President Trump saying ``We have prevailed'' is akin to declaring  ``mission accomplished'' long before the battles are over and the war  is won.   Later on, the President, as usual, tries to correct what he said--or  his advisers do. He said he only meant testing, that we have prevailed  on testing. But that is false too. Even the corrections are false. The  United States is testing about 300,000 people a day. Most experts  believe the number is inadequate to stop this outbreak and ensure that  when we reopen, we do so safely. We have prevailed on testing? Not  remotely.   Here is what is so ironic about the President hiding his head in the  sand and not tackling the testing issue in a real way. He is desperate  that we get back to work, but the only way to get back to work is when  we have enough tests--not just for those who are very ill but for  anyone who wants it. You know, the White House--they all test. Anyone  who walks in the White House is tested. Why isn't that good enough for  all the American people?   Why is it that even in States that have opened up, like Georgia, the  stores are still empty? Because people are worried, justifiably. The  way to remove that worry or at least greatly reduce it is to make sure  everyone can be tested.   When New Rochelle became the first quarantined city, I called the  mayor and said: What do you need to get rid of this quarantine? He said  he needed enough testing so that he could test every person in New  Rochelle, and those who tested positive, he would say they have to  quarantine and stay home, and those who didn't could go to work and  shop in the stores and get our community going.   Most of the countries--I think just about every one of the countries  that has dealt successfully with the coronavirus has had far more  testing at the right times and the right places than we have.   Maybe Dr. Fauci can set things straight this morning. Dr. Fauci and a  few other administration officials are testifying before the HELP  Committee remotely. It will be one of the first times that Fauci and  the others have appeared publicly without the President lurking over  their shoulders, modifying their answers, or directly contradicting  their advice.   Dr. Fauci, please don't pull any punches, particularly when you are  asked questions. We know the White House may have to approve the  statement you make, and they will mute it. It was muted this morning  and very technical. But you don't have to do that when the questions  are asked. Don't pull punches. Tell the American people the truth. Dr.  Fauci, you have an obligation to tell the American people the truth  because only that will save lives and reduce the economic length of  this crisis. And, Dr. Fauci, maybe if you tell the truth in this  opportunity--a hearing without the President looking over your  shoulder--maybe your testimony, Dr. Fauci--I hope your testimony, Dr.  Fauci, reaches not only the American people but a President who is  ready to throw caution to the wind in order to reopen the country.  Please, Dr. Fauci, don't pull punches.                            ____________________     One final matter today. Today, the Supreme Court will  hear oral arguments in a case that will determine whether the President  can block access to his tax returns and other financial documents.   You may not think this is related to COVID, but in a certain sense,  it is. In a sense, the case about the President's tax returns has  something in common with the President's response to coronavirus:  President Trump wants to hide the truth. He wants to hide the truth  about coronavirus and the depth of the problem and how we deal with it.  He wants to hide the truth and not release his tax returns.   For 40 years, every President has disclosed his personal financial  information to avoid even the perception of impropriety or self- dealing, but this President has used every avenue to deny such  transparency. What is President Trump hiding in his taxes? The  President is not an ordinary citizen anymore; he is President of the  United States. The American people have a  [[Page S2360]]  right to see how he has dealt with his taxes. President Trump has an  obligation to show them. Why has President Trump fought so hard to deny  the American people this information?   If this Court wants to prove, at least in one step, that they are not  highly political and don't always side with President Trump, I hope  they will step up to the plate and rule that the President does not  have the unilateral power to shield his tax returns from the American  people. On this issue, like so many others, the American people deserve  the truth--not what the President wants us to believe but the truth.   I yield the floor   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
