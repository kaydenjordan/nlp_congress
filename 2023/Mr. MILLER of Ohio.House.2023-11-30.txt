 Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize Vietnam war  veteran Jim Hoessle. Since 2016, Jim has served on the board of the  Medina County Veterans Service Commission.   Jim has spent 10 years as a member of the Honor Guard team for both  VFW Post 5137 and American Legion Post 202.   He also serves as a mentor in the Medina County Valor Court where he  assists veterans who have run into difficulties with the law.   Jim even serves the youth in Medina County where he works closely  with the juvenile detention center, selecting opportunities for teens  to provide community service.   For the last 8 years, Jim has spent each summer at Buckeye Boys  State, mentoring high school juniors in local, county, and State  government.   Jim's love and service to country has never wavered. His life and  work for the people of my district, our district, the State of Ohio,  and our country make a better America.   Madam Speaker, let us thank Jim Hoessle for his service.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I will keep this very brief.   I, myself, have been a victim of George Santos, as well as other  Members of Congress, in terms of defrauding through public donations.   I received an ethics complaint from the FEC for which I had to spend  tens of thousands to defend myself.   You, sir, are a crook.   I know I should direct my comments to the Chair.
