 Mr. President, the conference report that we are  considering today is good news for our country. Along with providing  funding for our veterans and supporting critical energy and  infrastructure projects, it also includes $4.8 billion for the agencies  in the legislative branch.   The legislative branch portion of the conference report allocates  funding in an appropriate manner. It promotes government transparency,  as well as increasing security here at the Capitol Complex. This is  very important.   In support of good government, this agreement includes a provision  known as e-file, requiring U.S. Senate candidates to file campaign  finance reports electronically, directly with the Federal Election  Commission, as every other Federal candidate must do. Not  [[Page S6118]]  only does this provision increase transparency, it will reduce  bureaucratic inefficiency and will save about $1 million in taxpayer  dollars.   This agreement also provides $589.7 million for the Government  Accountability Office to hire additional staff to bolster oversight of  government programs and spending. Having spent most of my career in the  private sector, accountability is a good thing. There is not enough of  it here in Washington, DC. In fact, according to a report issued by the  GAO, the GAO returns $128 for every dollar invested in its budget. That  is a good example of accountability and getting results for the  American taxpayer. In fact, the resulting benefit of this oversight by  GAO was approximately $74 billion in documented savings for the  taxpayers in 2017. That is where you get the $128 return for every  dollar invested in the agency.   The Capitol Police is fully funded at the requested level of $456.3  million, allowing for the continued protection of visitors coming to  the Capitol campus every year, as well as the Members and their staff.   These are just a few highlights of the bill, which allocates  resources in a responsible way to maintain existing services, as well  as providing critical investments across the U.S. Capitol campus.   Lastly, and importantly, I want to thank Senator Chris Murphy, my  ranking member, for working with me in a bipartisan manner throughout  this process. This is my first year as chairman of the Legislative  Branch Subcommittee. I would also like to thank Chairman Shelby and  Vice Chairman Leahy for their leadership and efforts to return to  regular order on a Senate appropriations bill. This is quite  remarkable, but it shouldn't be. The bar has been set so low in  Washington, DC, that Congress can't get their appropriations bills or  spending bills passed before the end of the current fiscal year going  into next year. Well, guess what. The fiscal year ends on September 30,  and here we are on September 12, moving forward now on appropriations.  That is a good thing for our country.   I urge my colleagues to support this conference report as we continue  to move these bills forward to fund the government on time and in the  right way.   I see my distinguished colleague, Senator Murphy from Connecticut, is  here as well, and it has truly been an honor to serve with Senator  Murphy to move this forward on behalf of the American people.   Thank you, Mr. President.    Mr. President, I have a request for one committee to meet  during today's session of the Senate. It has the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.   Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committee is authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:               Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs    The Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs is authorized to  meet during the session of the Senate on Wednesday, September 12, 2018,  at 2:30 p.m., to conduct a hearing entitled, ``Countering Russia:  Assessing New Tools.''                            ____________________
