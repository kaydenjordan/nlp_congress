 Mr. President, I call up my motion to instruct conferees,  which is at the desk.    Mr. President, I didn't stop the reading because it is  pretty self-explanatory what this is.   There was language in S. 1260 when it left here and went over to the  House, under division C, that would have strengthened the ability of  the United States to counter Chinese influence abroad. Specifically,  the influence we are talking about here in one particular case  especially is what is going on in colleges and universities around the  country.   What this does is put some very clear windows into what the Chinese  Communist Party is doing on college campuses, particularly as it  relates to grants and money that they are putting into the colleges and  universities. We are asking and directing the negotiators to see that  there is such language in the final bill that comes out.    Mr. President, I will accept a voice vote.                                Vote on Motion
