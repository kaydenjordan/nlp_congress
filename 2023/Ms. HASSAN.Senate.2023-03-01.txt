 Madam President, I am honored to recognize Dan  Rath of Spofford as February's Granite Stater of the Month. For the  past 22 years, Dan has led a team--the Frozen Sections--in Special  Olympics New Hampshire's Penguin Plunge at Hampton Beach.   Special Olympics New Hampshire works to foster inclusion for people  of all ages with intellectual disabilities by enabling them to  participate in sports. The yearly Penguin Plunge, where participants  raise money and plunge in frigid Hampton Beach waters in early  February, serves as a way to fundraise for Special Olympics New  Hampshire's various programs. When Dan's wife showed him an ad to  participate in the Penguin Plunge in 2001, he knew he had to sign up.  Not only had Dan been a special education teacher for 4 years earlier  in his career, but he also loved being in any type of body of water.   After fundraising and plunging the first winter on his own, Dan began  recruiting friends and people who he met through his job at Cheshire  Medical Center. The recovery room nurses came up with a saying--``If  you ain't plunging, you're pledging''--since if Dan couldn't convince  someone to sign up for the Penguin Plunge with him, he usually could  persuade them to at least donate instead.   At 70 years old, Dan continues to lead an impressive group each year  in taking the Penguin Plunge. This year, the 17 members of the Frozen  Sections raised over $31,000 for Special Olympics NH. The highest  fundraiser of the group was Becky May, who has been a Special Olympics  athlete herself since the age of 5 and who raised more than $13,000 by  driving across the State and knocking on doors to raise money.   The other members of this year's Frozen Sections were: Cindy Bunszel,  Patrick Moynihan, Aaron St. Peter, Trevor Hunt, Trent Hunt, Stacy  Taylor, Kelly Erunski, Downey Page, Sean Craig, Taylor Woodward, Steve  Hart, Cherie Rowe, Michelle Leavitt, Priscilla Jones, and Larry  Welkowitz.   I commend Dan, the Frozen Sections, and all Penguin Plunge  participants in our State for submerging themselves in the frigid  winter waters of Hampton Beach year after year in order to raise money  for Special Olympics New Hampshire. Their hard work helps Granite State  children and adults with intellectual disabilities to experience the  joy and empowerment that comes with participating in a sport. Their  commitment to making an impact in their communities is inspiring and a  hallmark of the Granite State spirit, and I thank them for making New  Hampshire a more inclusive place.                            ____________________
