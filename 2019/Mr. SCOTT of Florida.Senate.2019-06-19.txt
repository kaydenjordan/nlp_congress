 Mr. President, Judge Allen Winsor has honorably  served the State of Florida for several years, and I proudly support  his confirmation as a district judge for the Northern District of  Florida today. He has demonstrated a keen legal acumen and adherence to  the rule of law, both in his prior capacity as the solicitor general in  the Office of the Florida Attorney General and in his present role as  an appellate judge on Florida's First District Court of Appeal. His  service on the appellate bench in Florida has consistently reflected  his respect for the separation of powers and devotion to the proper  function of the judiciary in our democratic system. As Governor of  Florida, I had the distinct honor to appoint him to the First District  Court of Appeal in 2016, and I am proud to support his confirmation to  the Federal bench, where he will continue to serve our State and Nation  well.
