 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, the coronavirus pandemic has resulted in an  unprecedented public health and economic crisis. While frontline  providers are fighting to keep us all safe, the deliberate slowdown of  our economy has caused significant disruption for employers and  employees throughout the country.   In Pennsylvania, the Payroll Protection Program has, in a period of  12 days, processed over 70,000 loans, totaling $15.7 billion, to help  small businesses make payroll and save jobs. I thank our community  banks and small businesses and the SBA for everything that was done.   The severity of this crisis, however, necessitates additional funding  for this program. For the past 2 weeks, Republicans in Congress have  advocated for additional appropriations while Democrat leadership has  permitted such delays to continue.   It has been extremely disruptive for businesses that it took this  long for the PPP to be increased. Businesses need some certainty. They  do not have the luxury of waiting for partisan political games. Let's  not let this happen again, particularly during the course of this  crisis.   Our country must now focus our efforts on planning to get back to  work while maintaining a high level of safety standards. With new  funding in place, we can continue to fight the virus, stay safe, and  get our economy roaring again.
