 Mr. Speaker, last week the arts and education  communities lost a giant when Dr. Roger Mandle, the former president of  the Rhode Island School of Design for more than a decade, passed away  in Dartmouth, Massachusetts, at the age of 79.   I was fortunate to work closely with President Mandle during my time  as mayor of Providence. He was a passionate advocate for the humanities  and a visionary leader who ensured that Rhode Island remained home to  the leading arts and design school in the world.   Most of all, he was an extraordinary human being and talented leader  who sought to leave our world in better shape than he found it.   He recognized the influential post he held as a civic leader in the  city of Providence, he understood fully the importance that great  universities and colleges have to the success of cities, and he worked  to ensure that RISD was an asset for Rhode Island's capital city.   He will be deeply missed by all who knew him.   My thoughts and prayers are with Roger's wife, the renowned abstract  artist Gayle Wells Mandle, and their entire family today.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, wars are costly, and the war on marijuana  is no exception. This war has derailed lives. It has led to lost jobs  and housing. It has torn families apart. The cost of the war on  marijuana has disproportionately fallen on the backs of Blacks and  Latino people.   As White entrepreneurs across the country support their families by  running businesses selling marijuana, many Black and Latino people are  spending time behind bars and criminalized for doing the same.   In Rhode Island, a Black person was 3.3 times more likely to be  arrested for possessing marijuana than a White person in 2018, even  though Black and White people use marijuana at similar rates.   Immigrants have been deported simply for using marijuana in States  that permit its use and despite never being convicted of a crime.   Targeting low-level marijuana-related offenders with harsh penalties  has done little to make our communities safer. The MORE Act ends the  criminalization of marijuana. It protects the 36 States, including  Rhode Island, that have led the way on marijuana policy and legalized  it for medicinal purposes.   People convicted of marijuana-related charges are often denied access  to social programs or even the ability to take out student loans to  further their education and careers. The MORE Act helps fix that.   This legislation redirects resources away from prosecution of  marijuana and toward community investments and public health solutions.  It establishes an opportunity trust fund that provides resources for  those who have marijuana-related convictions, including job training  and substance abuse treatment. It moves us closer toward racial equity  by allowing expungement of nonviolent marijuana convictions.   The MORE Act provides restorative justice by providing SBA loans to  assist small businesses, especially small businesses controlled by  socially and economically disadvantaged people.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Nadler for his leadership and for  introducing the MORE Act. I am proud to be a cosponsor, and I urge my  colleagues to vote in support of this historic legislation.
