 Mr. Speaker, it is so exciting to be up here and to be  able to have this discussion.   I want to thank the minority leader, my colleague and good friend,  Mr. Hakeem Jeffries, for allowing me this time to direct everyone's  attention to the importance of this month.   I know that it is Women's History Month, and we have been hearing so  much about this. But what an honor it is for me to stand in front of  you today because it is also Virgin Islands History Month.   I stand on the shoulders of strong Virgin Islanders who came before  me, a people who are known for their courage, leadership, sacrifice,  and, most importantly, their resilience.   The Virgin Islands are known for so much more than just white sandy  beaches and as a popular vacation destination. I tell people all the  time, there are more than just the beaches. There is a reason why seven  nations have fought, fought, and done what was necessary to attempt to  own these beautiful islands.    We are made of culture-rich lands and a diverse history. Though not  always pretty, there is great beauty in  [[Page H1270]]  our past that shaped our present and directs us toward our future.   Like most Caribbean countries, the Virgin Islands history begins with  the story of precolonial inhabitants of the island and, of course, of  slavery, and even beyond that to a rich history of people, of families,  of communities working and striving every day.   Many people are unaware that the Virgin Islands is the only place  that is part of the United States where Columbus actually set foot.  Many other places he just looked out and said, I am going to name it  this or that or the other. But the Virgin Islands and, in particular,  the island of St. Croix is the place where he actually had resistance  from the inhabitants who lived there, and we know that from his own  logbooks, from people on the boat who fought, who recognized that the  Caribs that were there were putting up a resistance to these men coming  in 1492.   In 1733, on the island of St. John, we have recorded the first major  slave insurrection in the western hemisphere. The individuals and  people there were so incensed at being enslaved that they organized  themselves, actually overthrew those who had enslaved them, and held  the island for a year before the Danes could organize with the English,  the Spaniards, with others to fight back and take back the land.   I am so grateful that in this last Congress, this body, in a  bipartisan way, were willing to support a recognition of that. This  year, there will be a plaque put up at Ram Head on the island of St.  John, the site of where the organizers brought themselves together and  made the determination that they would rather commit suicide than go  back to slavery. Ram Head is the location where they engaged in  collective suicide by jumping off of the cliff rather than going back  to slavery.   In 1848, the Virgin Islands, on the island of St. Croix, is also the  place where individuals organized, worked together, and overthrew,  completely, slavery well before the Emancipation Proclamation was made  here in the United States. It is one of only two places, the Virgin  Islands and the island and the people of Haiti, who were able to obtain  their freedom through violent and organized overthrow.   We are blessed as Virgin Islanders to celebrate Virgin Islands  history, as well as the same month as women's history, because Virgin  Islands history is not complete, of course, without women.   To begin, I must first acknowledge the record number of women, as  well as the record number of people of color currently serving in this  Congress. This record represents a 59 percent increase from the 96  women who served in the 112th Congress. Women in this body have come a  long way. I am thrilled to continue to break glass ceilings as well, as  we impact history.   For decades, women of all backgrounds have worked to break barriers  in communities, workplaces, schools, universities. We often forget to  give recognition to the lesser-known women. The great Shirley Chisholm,  who was the first Black woman to serve in this body, famously said:  ``If they don't give you a seat at the table, bring a folding chair.''   I say let's take it a step further. Forget the seat, give women the  whole table and watch what happens.   As a Black woman, I think about my own mother and all mothers who  every day, even when it wasn't common to work, they sacrificed,  occupied space where they were underrated, underappreciated, and  marginalized.   Without that history and those individuals, we would not be who we  are today, which is why I am proud and I am honored to represent my  home, my ancestral home, of the Virgin Islands.   During this Virgin Islands History Month and Women's History Month, I  proudly recognize the indomitable spirit of women like Mary Thomas, one  of the organizers of Fireburn; Anna Heegaard, who was the woman who  spoke to the Danish Governor at the time and convinced and talked with  him about emancipation; Bertha Boschulte, one of our educators; Arona  Petersen; Senator Ruby Rouss, who was one of the first aide-de-camps of  General Eisenhower during the war, a Virgin Islander; Edith Bornn,  Lorraine Berry, one of the great legislators on our island, who were  early trailblazers who championed women's freedom, equality, and power  for Virgin Islanders.   While the faces of power are growing and there is still work to be  done, it is refreshing to look back to gain inspiration and  encouragement from Virgin Islanders who have gone before us as these  women faced deliberate, unconscious bias, and yet they prevailed.   We should note the importance of representation for women in  leadership, politics, law enforcement, across every sphere is evident.  In politics alone, evidence shows that more women in public  decisionmaking and public policy produce policies that benefit women,  children, families, in general.   Women are more inclined to work across the aisle with colleagues, to  work in a bipartisan fashion, to negotiate. As a lawyer, I know that  the best contracts, the best negotiations are when everybody has to  feel a little bit of pain for it to be the best. Women are willing to  do that.   We know that loans given to women's businesses exponentially support  families and entire communities than loans given to men. We need women.   Let us all continue the great work, all of us. That includes men who  are brothers, sons, fathers. We need you all to break the bias and  advance the cause of women's rights in our communities, our government,  and our world.   Throughout the month of March, let us continue to celebrate heritage  history as we look to our future. Happy Women and Virgin Islands  History Month.   I want to rise and highlight a few influential women that have helped  shape Virgin Islands history during Virgin Islands History Month. Now,  of course, so often in the Virgin Islands, we talk about the men and  the men have done amazing things.   The Virgin Islands has produced great actors and artists like Camille  Pissarro, one of the founders of French impressionism; actors like  Kelsey Grammer and Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs. We have tremendous athletes  in our past like Horace Clarke, Elrod Hendricks, and, of course, my own  cousin, Elmo Plaskett, all having served in professional baseball;  Peter Holmberg, a native St. Thomian has done amazing things in  sailing, as well as the Jackson family, father and sons are tremendous  boxers.                                time  1200    Everyone knows us for having had Tim Duncan, one of the greatest, the  GOAT, NBA players in history, and musicians like Alton Adams, the first  naval bandmaster; Dion Parson, who has worked at Jazz at Lincoln Center  and has one of the most amazing jazz ensembles; and Jon Lucien, another  great artist.   These are all tremendous. The men are great, but let us first talk  about a few of the women in Virgin Islands history.   The first one I can think of is Eulalie Rivera. Ms. Rivera was born  on August 2, 1907, in Frederiksted, St. Croix, to Carl Rohlsen and  Henrietta Williams. During her lifetime, Ms. Rivera played a tremendous  role in the Virgin Islands.   In her autobiography ``Growing Up in St. Croix,'' Ms. Rivera gives an  account of her life that portrays the attitudes and culture of the  Virgin Islands at that time, from witnessing the transfer of the Virgin  Islands from the Danish West Indies to the Virgin Islands of the United  States, a change in ownership and culture, to rumors of being the first  woman to ride a bicycle on St. Croix.   Eulalie's mother passed away during childbirth, so she was raised in  homes for children, where she was instilled with a love of learning.  Ms. Rivera dedicated more than 30 years to the education system in the  Virgin Islands and taught at the Christiansted kindergarten, the  Diamond School, La Grande Princess School, and the Claude O. Markoe  School.   She was instrumental in helping the Caribbean culture and Virgin  Islands culture by helping to create such activities as the St. Croix  Christmas Festival. She served as the president of the Women's League  of St. Croix, supervisor of the Lutheran Church Sunday school, founder  of the Independent Citizens' Movement political party, charter member  of the St. Croix Business and Professional Women's Club, and as a  member of the Frederiksted Democratic Club, the Frederiksted Hospital  Auxiliary, the Virgin Islands League of  [[Page H1271]]  Women Voters, the Committee on Aging, and the Friends of Denmark. She  was busy. She loved her home.   In 1974, the Grove Place Elementary School was renamed after her. She  was a beloved ancestor and elder.   I also recognize Eileen Petersen. Eileen Ramona Petersen was born on  St. Croix and holds the distinct privilege of being the first woman to  serve as a judge in the United States Virgin Islands. She is also one  of the few women jurists throughout the Caribbean region.   I can recall Judge Petersen telling me about the fact that, after she  was nominated and confirmed in the Virgin Islands as a judge, the men  thought that they would get her, and she did not have an office. She  didn't have internal chambers in which to work.   Every day at lunchtime, she would take all the files from her  courtroom and go sit in her car to work on the cases before then going  back to court and making decisions because there was no place else for  her to work.   That did not stop her from doing her job, executing justice and doing  what was right. Judge Petersen was the first-appointed judge of the  municipal court, now the Virgin Islands Territorial Court, by then- Governor Melvin Evans in 1971.   She became a practicing lawyer in 1967 in Washington, D.C., and she  returned home to the Virgin Islands to give that education, that mind,  so much that she had learned, back to her people. She became an  assistant attorney general under Attorney General Francisco Corneiro.  After 20 years of service on the bench, she resigned and is now in her  retirement.   I would be remiss if I didn't mention another judge who is still with  us, the Honorable Denise M. Francois.   Denise Francois was born on St. Thomas, obtained her bachelor of arts  from Amherst College, and continued at the University of San Diego  School of Law, where she received her juris doctorate. She was admitted  to the State Bar of California, the Virgin Islands Bar, and the U.S.  Court of Appeals.   She was a partner in a law firm on St. Thomas, where she worked for  the people. In 2013, she was appointed judge of the Superior Court of  the Virgin Islands. She has chaired the Advisory Committee on Rules and  aided in drafting the Virgin Islands Rules of Civil Procedure and the  Virgin Islands Rules of Evidence. She is still blazing a trail as a  great jurist and legal mind.   I love libraries, and I love books. Of course, I would have to speak  about a librarian and archivist, Ms. Enid Maria Baa, for whom the  library in Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas, is named. She pioneered  librarianship within the Virgin Islands and the Caribbean and  internationally.   She developed her love of library work when she was young. As a newly  graduated student of the first high school in St. Thomas, she helped  establish the first high school library.   Her interests and professional ambition led to several advanced  degrees, including Hampton Institute and Columbia University.   During and after her studies at Columbia, she held professional  positions at the university, at the United Nations Library, and at the  New York Public Library in their reference division. After coming back  home, she was appointed director of libraries and museums under  Governor Archibald Alexander in 1954. Second to head the Caribbean  Organization's library in Puerto Rico, she has been an editor and  archivist.   Enid Maria Baa has done so much work to make sure that our history,  the words of people and books, are available to all.   Many people forget about the smallest island--well, Water Island is  the smallest--St. John, where there is so much work to be done and  where people have worked so hard together. There was a woman who was  born in June 1908, Myrah Keating Smith. She passed away and is with the  elders since 1994. She was a pioneering nurse and midwife. She was the  only provider of healthcare on the island of St. John for almost two  decades.   She was taught as a small child in homes, organizations of people on  the island of St. John bringing children together in parlors and  kitchens to learn. Her parents taught her themselves. At 14, they sent  her on a boat to New York City and then by train to be taught at  Tuskegee Institute.    After working for some years, she came home in 1931. By foot, boat,  or by horseback when there were no roads or trails, she provided  healthcare to the people of St. John.   Our history is rich. There is so much that we all can learn from  people who were so resilient and who were so willing to give of  themselves, to go out to learn and educate themselves and come back to  give to the history and the future of the people of the Virgin Islands.   I am so grateful to be a part of that history and to be a Virgin  Islander whose roots go back seven generations. It is my joy to come  home on the weekends during district work periods and run into, most  times, people who are my cousins, my family, and, more importantly, my  friends.   In this month, during March, it is even more important for us to  reach back to that history. This July will be our 175th year of  emancipation from slavery.   It is important that all Virgin Islanders understand the importance  of working together. When we tell the story to our children about our  emancipation, one of the most amazing things is that, as the slaves  were organizing, they really kept it to themselves what they had  planned and the day that they designated, July 3, to march to the fort  and demand their freedom from the Danish military.   As they reached the fort, the Danish soldiers began looking around  and decided to put the cannons toward the crowd. They went to get the  gunpowder to put in the cannons and realized that the gunpowder was all  gone from the fort. The slaves, over a series of months, had  surreptitiously and quietly removed all the gunpowder and replaced the  barrels with molasses.   That takes people organizing and understanding that you can have no  snitches to get something like that done and know that what was most  important was them working together.   On that day, as they reached the fort in Frederiksted, the conch  shell blew to give notice to the other slaves through the rest of the  island. Everyone, from Christiansted at the other end of the island,  out east, began marching all at once to try to demand their freedom.   When the governor realized that these slaves had organized in the  manner that they had, he declared that all enslaved were now free in  the Danish West Indies from henceforth on. The people of St. Croix not  only liberated themselves but liberated their brothers, their sisters,  and those who were on the other islands under Danish rule in St.  Thomas, St. John, the Little Cays, all of the places throughout.   It is that resilience, that fortitude, which I am so grateful to have  within my blood and to be a part of my history. That is now American  history. That is a part of all of our history that we can all  celebrate. That is an example for all of us.   That is not something to be shunned or to be ashamed of or for people  to feel embarrassed about or sad. Many people would say that that could  be banned in other locations. That is my history. That is a history  that is now part of American history.   I am hopeful that we can all take that in, that we can all see  examples for our own lives, whether we are Caribbean, Black, Hispanic,  Latina, White, Caucasian, or whatever. It is a history for us all. I am  so grateful for that history as we continue to live it each and every  day.   To end, I also recognize outstanding Virgin Islanders who are doing  amazing things today in the arts. We have Virgin Islanders who have  been awarded some of the highest honors in these last months: Theron  Thomas, Masai Harris, Cori Alexander, and Kyle Francis. Each received  recognition at the 75th Annual Grammy Awards for their excellent work  in the music industry.   Masai Harris, a native of St. Croix, was an integral part of the team  that worked on reggae artist Kabaka Pyramid's second album, which  garnered a Grammy for album of the year.   Theron Thomas from St. Thomas, a world-renowned producer and  songwriter, received recognition for his songwriting on Lizzo's record  of the year.   Both Cori Alexander and Kyle Francis, natives of St. Thomas, worked  on the album ``Kingdom,'' which won best gospel performance.  [[Page H1272]]    I would be remiss if I didn't lift up our sister, native Virgin  Islander Janelle James from St. Thomas, who won the 54th NAACP Image  Award for best supporting actress for her role in ``Abbott  Elementary.''   These are Virgin Islanders doing amazing things.   We might be a small place, but we think big. We live our lives big.  We do not restrict ourselves just to the waters surrounding where we  live.   In the words of the popular Rock City song that has as its authors  individuals that I mentioned who received Grammy Awards: ``The world is  ours, Scarface, even though we come from a small place. No matter where  I'm at, I'm VI all day.''   Let's continue to be VI strong and VI proud. Happy Virgin Islands  History Month.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
