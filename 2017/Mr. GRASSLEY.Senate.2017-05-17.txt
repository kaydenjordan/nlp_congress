 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is  considering Rachel Brand to be Associate Attorney General. Ms. Brand is  a native Iowan, and I am proud to be supporting her nomination here  today. She has had a distinguished legal career. In fact, she was  appointed to Senate-confirmed positions by both President Bush and  President Obama, and both times, she was confirmed by a voice vote in  the Senate.   But it looks like this nomination somehow has become controversial. I  don't understand. Ms. Brand has a broad range of legal experience that  happens to be a broad range in both the government and the private  sector.   With her previous positions in the White House, the Office of Legal  Counsel, and the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, she has  experience that touches almost every part of the Federal Government. As  the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Policy, she was  a member of the senior management team of the Department of Justice,  working with components and law enforcement agencies throughout the  entire Justice Department. Similarly, at the Privacy and Civil  Liberties Oversight Board, Ms. Brand worked with diverse agencies to  ensure that privacy and civil liberties are taken into account while  carrying out the important mission of protecting the Nation from  terrorism.   During Ms. Brand's tenure in the private sector, she gained extensive  litigation management experience that will serve her very well as she  oversees the Department's civil litigation components.   She has seemingly become a little more controversial. Many of my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle have said they aren't  supporting her nomination because of the work she did with the U.S.  Chamber of Commerce. Those views are utterly ridiculous. So I will take  a minute to address these concerns.   First, when she worked at the Chamber, all of her advocacy was done  to represent the views of her client, the U.S. Chamber. Everybody  expects that if you hire a lawyer, they are going to represent your  views. We all know that we can't assume an attorney personally believes  in what they are advocating for on behalf of their client, just ask  criminal defense attorneys.   Furthermore, she was not involved in any policy or lobbying apparatus  of the Chamber. Her role there was to bring lawsuits challenging rules  that the U.S. Chamber believed were unlawful. At the same time, besides  just arguing those lawsuits, she had to file a lot of amicus briefs  providing the courts with the views of the business community.   During her time at the Chamber, she challenged a handful of the  thousands of regulations promulgated by Federal agencies. The arguments  Ms. Brand made in those lawsuits or amicus briefs were generally that  the agency had acted beyond the scope of the authority Congress had  granted that particular agency or had failed to follow the reasoned  decisionmaking processes required by the Administrative Procedure Act  of 1946. In many of those cases, the courts agreed with the Chamber  that the government had acted unlawfully.   To summarize her work during that time at the Chamber, Ms. Brand  argued that government agencies went beyond the authority Congress had  given  [[Page S2984]]  them. She also argued that these agencies weren't acting under the  scope of the congressional authority granted to the agency, and she  argued that congressional authority had to be respected. It seems to me  that it is up to Congress to give these agencies more authority if we  think they need it. But it is not a good reason to vote against Ms.  Brand's nomination because she argued a very commonsense and  constitutional position that Federal agencies need to follow the laws  of Congress.   Finally, some Senators have maintained that they are concerned about  her views on the Voting Rights Act. She responded very well to that.  During her hearing, Ms. Brand told the committee that she shares  concerns for anyone who would violate the Voting Rights Act and would  suppress votes in the process of violating that act, and she believes  ``enforcement of that statute to be a core enforcement function of the  civil rights division.'' I don't know about my fellow colleagues, but I  take her at her word that she strongly believes in voting rights.   It is more than a little puzzling, then, that when Republicans  opposed a woman for a government position, we heard from the other  side. The Democrats would always bring up gender politics. But when  they oppose a woman for a position, that is somehow OK. I don't see how  they can expect to have it both ways.   I believe Ms. Brand will be a superb Associate Attorney General--the  first female in this role, I might add--and that she will serve the  office with very great distinction. I urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting her nomination.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 or 6 minutes to speak on  another subject as in morning business.    Mr. President, I come to the floor to share real  stories of real hardships from hard-working families in my home State  of Iowa. Seven years ago, Americans were promised that the Affordable  Care Act would make health insurance cheaper and healthcare more  accessible. Well, I won't pretend to break any news here; the facts  speak very much for themselves. ObamaCare is not living up to its  promises. When passing the law, the other side made promises that they  knew wouldn't be kept.   The irony here is that, at the end of the day, the so-called  Affordable Care Act is anything but affordable. Let's look at the word  ``affordable'' in the Webster dictionary. It says ``having a cost that  is not too high.'' I have heard from many Iowans who tell me in no  uncertain terms that they cannot afford to buy health insurance because  ObamaCare is unaffordable. Ever since ObamaCare was enacted, I have  received letters and calls and emails from Iowans who are frustrated  about the soaring costs of their health plans.   Here is a prime example. One farmer's insurance premium went through  the roof. It jumped 43 percent in 2017 from 2016. If somebody can  explain how that is more affordable, I have an oceanfront property in  my home county of Butler County, IA, to sell you.   Now, we have a chart here about another Iowan. This constituent from  Garner, IA, wrote about her financial hardships. She said:         We are going to be paying over $1,300 a month on premiums,       plus a $6,000 deductible. We don't have that much longer       before we qualify for Medicare, but my concern is that until       then, we will have to use so much of our hard-earned savings       just to pay for healthcare. My fear is that those of us in       the middle class will struggle with paying so much that it       will wipe out our retirement savings accounts.    Another constituent nearby Garner, in Buffalo, IA, wrote to me  saying:         I am forced to pay $230 a month for a healthcare plan that       covers nothing until I reach $11,000 in deductible. So on top       of paying 100 percent of my medical bills anyway, now I have       to pay for insurance I can't use.    So the question is, How did we get to this point? Seven years ago, I  stood right here on the Senate floor and predicted what would happen to  the cost of insurance if ObamaCare passed. Let's take a walk down  memory lane for a moment. Here is what I said October 2009:         And while some of the supporters of these partisan bills       may not want to tell their constituents, we all know that as       national spending on healthcare increases, American families       will bear the burden in the form of higher premiums. So, let       me be very clear. As a result of the current pending       healthcare proposals, most Americans will pay higher premiums       for health insurance.    Now, I am not Nostradamus. I don't have a magic crystal ball, but it  was easy to read the writing on the wall. I knew that layers of new  taxes and, more importantly, burdensome new mandates in ObamaCare would  lead us to where we find ourselves today: a broken healthcare system  that is not better off than it was 7 years ago. For millions of  Americans, it is much worse.   So where do we go from here? After 7 years of rapidly rising  premiums, soaring deductibles, and climbing copays, Republicans are  committed to fixing the damage caused by the Affordable Care Act.  Instead of joining us in an effort to fix what is broken, the other  side is doing their best to scare the living daylights out of  Americans.   From the way they tell it, the House bill is ``deadly.'' What is  truly fatal is the death spiral the ObamaCare marketplace is in. Not  only is it unaffordable for too many people, it is simply  unsustainable. ObamaCare is unable to fulfill its promises to the  American people. Here is what every lawmaker in Congress ought to agree  on: Insurance is not worth having if patients cannot afford to use it.   The facts are very clear. A one-size-fits-all, government-run plan is  driving insurers out of the exchanges, driving up premiums, driving  away customers, and driving up the tab to the tax-paying public. I  spoke 2 days ago about the impact of Obamacare in Iowa. Next year it is  possible that 94 of our 99 counties will not have insurance plans on  the Obamacare exchange.   So even if you benefit from the subsidy of ObamaCare, you are not  going to have an insurance company to go to. All of this because  ObamaCare has overregulated, overtaxed, and oversold its promises to  the American people. ObamaCare has not healed what ails the U.S.  healthcare system. It is time to move forward.   I urge my colleagues to drop the partisan charade and join us for the  good of the American people. I will continue coming to the floor to  share how ObamaCare is not working for Iowans, but in the meantime, the  Senate will continue working to rescue our healthcare system that is  sinking under this broken law.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
