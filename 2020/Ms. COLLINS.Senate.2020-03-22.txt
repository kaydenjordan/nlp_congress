 Madam President, the United States is facing a crisis  unlike any other in our recent history. This is no time for  partisanship or for political differences to prevent us from coming  together and working in the best interests of the American people.   The coronavirus pandemic has arrived on our shores, and it is growing  exponentially, sickening our people and devastating our economy. As of  today, more than 26,700 Americans have tested positive for the virus,  and 340 people have died, while 176 have recovered. In my home State of  Maine, there are now 89 cases in 8 different counties.   Hospitals, doctors, and nurses are struggling to triage the influx of  patients. Nursing homes are locking down their facilities in an attempt  to safeguard their vulnerable residents.   Students and teachers have had to transition abruptly to online  learning as schools have closed across the Nation. Parents have been  left with no childcare. Workers have been laid off or fear that they  may soon lose their jobs as the outbreak worsens.   To help mitigate the spread of this dangerous virus and protect those  who are at highest risk, Americans have stepped forward to take the  proper precautions and to follow the guidelines that are issued by the  Centers for Disease Control.   Although measures such as limiting large social gatherings and  reducing nonessential travel are important to help contain the  coronavirus and reduce contagion, they are also taking a tremendous  toll on our economy. There are 30 million small businesses in the  United States. They employ nearly 60 million Americans, about half of  our Nation's workforce. According to a recent survey, 96 percent of  small business owners say they have already been affected by the  coronavirus--not in the sense that they have become ill with it, but  their customer base has simply dried up--and 51 percent say they will  only be able to keep open for up to 3 months if the economic  consequences continue. The potential loss of more than half of our  Nation's small businesses, and the impact on the millions of people  they employ is simply unacceptable.   In my State the number of claims for unemployment filed in a span of  just 3 days this month was nearly double those filed in all of March 1  year ago. Maine is on track to surpass the highest weekly total of  unemployment claims since the great recession of 2008. The situation is  dire, and it is only going to get worse unless we act and we act now.   We must come together as Republicans and Democrats in this Chamber  and in the House to provide relief to the American people to ensure  that workers continue to receive paychecks or other forms of  assistance. Of course, we continue to build on the two bills that we  have already passed to protect the health and safety of the American  people.   Looking beyond the statistics that I just recited, the real world  effect of this economic devastation is evident everywhere. I just got  off the phone from talking to a couple in Lewiston, ME, Jimmy and Linda  Simones. They run a third-generation family diner. It is well known and  a favorite place to stop by for lunch. They tried to convert to a  takeout business, but it just didn't work. So for the first time ever  in this diner's history, the Simones family is forced to close their  doors and to lay off their workers--workers who have been with them for  years, workers who include not only themselves but their son George.   Every day I have heard from small business owners who are anxious  about the future of their businesses and how they can continue to pay  their employees who are often their family members, their friends, and  their neighbors. The last thing they want to do is to lay off their  employees and shut their doors, but they fear they may have no other  choice. They simply do not have the cash flow, the revenue coming in  the door, to allow them to remain open.   The tourism sector, which is so critical to jobs in Maine, has been  particularly hard hit. A small hotel in Brunswick, ME, received 84  cancellations within 24 hours of the local college suspending its in- person classes. A well-known Irish pub in Bangor, ME, had to close for  St. Patrick's Day, probably its biggest day of the year, and has been  forced to lay off 60 people. A charter bus company based in Lewiston  lost $400,000 in 3 days because two major tours canceled. If tourism is  further reduced, this bus company predicts losses of more than $1  million.   Countless other businesses in my State--such as restaurants, the  lobster and fishing industries, gyms, B&Bs, gift shops, retailers, and  hair salons--have also been hard hit. The hospitality industry, in  particular, is at risk of being devastated, as conferences and vacation  trips continue to be canceled.   A hair stylist in Biddeford, a good friend of mine, was forced to  shutter her shop, and, at the same time, she lost her part-time job  bartending when the bar that employed her was also required to close.  When these small businesses suffer, it has a cascading effect on their  employees, from housekeepers to wait staff, to bartenders, to  fishermen, to drivers, to retail clerks. These are just some of the  countless examples of the economic damage that is occurring in every  community because of the virus and through absolutely no fault of the  small businesses or their workers. But for the coronavirus and the  steps that State and local governments have taken, as well as the  Federal Government, these businesses would be thriving. In Maine, they  would be beginning to start staffing up for the summer months for the  height of the tourism season.   It is essential that Congress act immediately without partisan  bickering, without delay--act immediately to protect the paychecks and  to provide other relief to supplement the earlier bills that we have  passed.   I am pleased to report that help is on the horizon for small  businesses and their workers that would allow them to weather the  current storm. As a member of the Small Business Task Force, I have  been working very closely night and day with a group of my colleagues-- Senator Rubio, Senator Cardin, and Senator Shaheen. Our staffs have  worked literally through the night on legislation to provide relief to  small businesses and their employees.   The Keeping Workers Paid and Employed Act that I authored with  Senator Rubio, the chairman of the Small Business and Entrepreneurship  Committee, provides a plan to do just that. Through our negotiations  with Senator Shaheen and Senator Cardin, who have been wonderful  partners--wonderful partners--we have produced, jointly, a $350 billion  plan that would help mitigate this crisis.   Our group has worked night and day in a bipartisan fashion. We have  kept in mind the common goal of protecting those employees who have  been laid off or who are at risk of being laid off because of the  cashflow problems of their employers, problems that these small  businesses did not create but, rather, are a result of the COVID-19  pandemic.   Our joint vision is to help small businesses and their employees make  it through to the other side of this crisis by providing cashflow  assistance quickly to employers who agree to keep their workers on the  payroll. This would allow employers to stay in business and keep paying  their employees.   More than 100 Maine small businesses and the Maine Chamber of  Commerce  [[Page S1898]]  have endorsed this bill. Additionally, nationwide, a group of more than  two dozen business organizations that represent thousands of companies  across the country have expressed their strong support for this  proposal, and I would ask unanimous consent that both of those letters  be included in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.   Let me explain how our plan would work. Under our approach, small  businesses would be eligible for a 100-percent federally guaranteed  emergency loan to cover their payroll for 8 weeks, as well as certain  fixed expenses--normal customary expenses like rent or mortgage  payments and utilities. These loans would ultimately be eligible to be  forgiven, provided that the employers kept the workers on their  payrolls. That is the key provision. This financial assistance is  targeted, and it could not be used to give raises to highly compensated  employees or to increase returns to shareholders, not that most of  these small businesses even have shareholders.   Our goal is to keep these workers employed, to keep paychecks going  to them, to keep payments for their health insurance intact, and to  keep contributions that an employer may be making to their 401(k) plan  intact. We know that keeping people employed and ready to get back to  work, not severing that connection between employers and their  employees, will cost far less than it would to try to rescue the  economy after we have had massive layoffs and business closures. That  is what our bill would prevent.   The Secretary of the Treasury has estimated that if we do nothing and  if we do not pass this bill in connection with a broader package aimed  at preventing economic devastation, we could see unemployment rise as  high as 20 percent. Keep in mind, we are coming through a period where  we have had record-low unemployment. It could rise as high as 20  percent.   If that happens, the impact on the Federal Government would be  substantial, far more than the $350 billion that we are using for this  small business assistance program to keep their employees paid, not to  mention the extraordinary harm that this kind of economic catastrophe  would cause to millions of families.   Congress has already passed two emergency relief packages. They will  promote the health and safety of Americans, but it is going to take  time for us to get the coronavirus under control. It is going to take  time for the social distancing to work. It is going to take time for  new treatments to be developed, much less a vaccine, despite the  extraordinary efforts of scientists and physicians and other experts  across this country who are all pulling together.   Our Keeping Workers Paid and Employed Act has been included in a  third package that I hope Congress will soon--very soon--consider to  respond to COVID-19. It is imperative that we not delay. Every day that  we delay, another business like the Samones' business, their diner in  Lewiston, ME, is forced to close their doors and to lay off their  employees.   We are truly standing at the edge of a dangerous precipice. Bold,  bipartisan action is required to respond to this public health crisis  and move us back from economic disaster and small businesses closing  their doors--in some cases forever--devastating and decimating our  downtowns and millions of Americans losing their jobs. I implore my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to put aside partisan differences  and come together and join our bipartisan group in delivering this  urgently needed aid for the American people by passing this important  economic relief for the employees of small businesses throughout our  Nation   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                              Hospitality Maine,                                     Augusta, Maine, March 16, 2020.        Dear Honorable Senator Collins: We are hospitality business       owners and supporting suppliers, both for-profit and       nonprofit, in Maine and we are writing with urgency regarding       the COVID19 outbreak and its economic impact on our       businesses. We ask that you look to support small business       owners, especially those in the tourism industry, during this       immediate challenge.        The spread of the virus, and the subsequent directives for       social distance and quarantine, is causing widespread event       cancellations, hitting the travel and tourism industry hard.       Since the virus outbreak began to escalate in the United       States, our businesses have lost thousands of room nights and       advanced room reservations and thousands of restaurant       reservations and many more walk-in customers in just a few       short weeks. These cancellations are immediate and will not       return. Our businesses simply cannot sell yesterday's hotel       rooms or restaurant meals today or tomorrow.        It is crucial that any lifeline provided to small       businesses address this immediate and severe reduction in       demand. With the precipitous drop in reservations, hotels and       restaurants around the state of Maine are under immediate       financial pressure. We know that COVID19 is a virus and that       it will pass. What is not known is how long that will take       and what the extent of the damage to Maine's tourism industry       will be. In what should have been a celebration year to share       Maine's Bicentennial with the world, this Spring will bring a       devastating drop in sales, already down tremendously in just       a few short weeks. Assistance must be immediate and must be       workable. Assistance must address a temporary crisis and not       be allowed to cause permanent damage to Maine's important       small businesses with overreaching and complicated       requirements as some have proposed.        Maine's tourism industry is critical--Our industry       contributes at least $6.2 billion in tourism expenditures,       brings 37 million visitors to the state per year, sustains       110,000 jobs and contributes $610 million in taxes. This is       accomplished through the hard work of small business owners       and their remarkable hospitality teams each year.        The Collins proposal would provide emergency cash-flow to       employers so long as they agree to pay their workers whether       they shut-down and lay-off their workers or remain open. We       appreciate your understanding that our businesses should not       be forced to permanently close because of an unforeseen,       world-wide pandemic we have played no role in causing. You       are also right to focus on protecting the jobs of our       workers--we cannot run our businesses without them. Finally,       we deeply appreciate your understanding that our businesses       cannot take on substantial, permanent debt when revenues are       plunging. Your proposal to forgive cash-flow assistance we       use to stay in business, preserve jobs, and pay our employees       would allow us to reopen, fully-staffed and ready to serve       the public the moment this crisis passes.        Please act now to support Maine's small businesses and       tourism during the immediate crisis with a responsible       solution that does not further burden and shutter the       welcoming restaurants, hotels and inns of our great state.        Thank you for your dedication to and of support Maine.                                   ____                                                     March 19, 2020.      Senator Marco Rubio,      284 Russell Senate Office Building,      Washington, DC.      Senator Susan Collins,      413 Dirksen Building,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senators: We, the undersigned business leaders applaud       your efforts to support small businesses during this crisis.       In particular, we support two key aspects of your efforts.        First, an emergency loan program to support small       businesses during this crisis, with loans made available       through private banks, supported with a federal guarantee.       Using the private banking system to provide these loans is       critical, as small business needs the liquidity immediately.        Second, including in the emergency loan program a clause       that forgives a portion of the loan equal to an appropriate       percentage of payroll (with an appropriate salary cap) for       any business that keeps their employees on salary despite       having to shut down.        Small business employers are job creators. Small business       employers want to keep their employees on salary during this       crisis. A small business emergency loan program that includes       forgiveness for an appropriate percentage of payroll for any       small business that keeps their employees on salary will       allow small businesses to keep America employed.        This is not a bailout. Small businesses are closed and the       employees are not working because of a government order.        This is not as costly as may appear. Individuals who are       laid off will receive unemployment insurance. This effort       would simply shift the payment from the unemployment system       to an employment system. Our economy is better off paying       someone to remain employed, rather than having them       unemployed.        This has long term benefits. The dislocation costs       associated with widespread unemployment are severe. Once a       person separates from their job, rehiring is less likely.       And, maintaining employees on salary saves on future training       costs.        This is superior to an outright small business grant, as       the money would be provided in order to foster employment.        We thank you for your leadership, and hope both Republicans       and Democrats can come together to support The Keeping       Workers Paid and Employed Act.
