 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 5931) to require a review of the effects of FHA mortgage  insurance policies, practices, and products on small-dollar mortgage  lending, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5931         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Improving FHA Support for       Small Dollar Mortgages Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2. REVIEW OF FHA SMALL-DOLLAR MORTGAGE PRACTICES.         (a) Congressional Findings.--The Congress finds that--        (1) affordable homeownership opportunities are being       hindered due to the lack of financing available for home       purchases under $70,000;        (2) according to the Urban Institute, small-dollar mortgage       loan applications in 2017 were denied by lenders at double       the rate of denial for large mortgage loans, and this       difference in denial rates cannot be fully explained by       differences in the applicants' credit profiles;        (3) according to data compiled by Attom Data solutions,       small-dollar mortgage originations have decreased 38 percent       since 2009,  [[Page H1427]]       while there has been a 65 percent increase in origination of       mortgages for more than $150,000;        (4) the FHA's mission is to serve creditworthy borrowers       who are underserved and, according to the Urban Institute,       the FHA serves 24 percent of the overall market, but only 19       percent of the small-dollar mortgage market; and        (5) the causes behind these variations are not fully       understood, but merit study that could assist in furthering       the Department of Housing and Urban Development's mission,       including meeting the housing needs of borrowers the program       is designed to serve and reducing barriers to homeownership,       while protecting the solvency of the Mutual Mortgage       Insurance Fund.        (b) Review.--The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development       shall conduct a review of its FHA single-family mortgage       insurance policies, practices, and products to identify any       barriers or impediments to supporting, facilitating, and       making available mortgage insurance for mortgages having an       original principal obligation of $70,000 or less. Not later       than the expiration of the 12-month period beginning on the       date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit       a report to the Congress describing the findings of such       review and the actions that the Secretary will take, without       adversely affecting the solvency of the Mutual Mortgage       Insurance Fund, to remove such barriers and impediments to       providing mortgage insurance for such mortgages.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks on this legislation and insert extraneous material  thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, when it comes to promoting access to homeownership, much  of the focus tends to be on how high housing prices are pricing  borrowers out of many communities.   But the landscape of homeownership opportunities is varied, and for  many communities, the lack of access to traditional mortgage financing  for small dollar mortgages continues to be a challenge. Specifically, I  am talking about mortgages that are $70,000 or less.   For many rural communities and communities that are struggling to  overcome the impacts of the foreclosure crisis, there are lower value  homes that would otherwise be ideal homeownership opportunities for  first-time home buyers and working-class families, but the lack of  available traditional financing acts as a barrier to those  opportunities.   Data from the Urban Institute shows that these small dollar mortgages  are denied by lenders at double the rate compared to larger loans, and  this trend cannot be explained away by differences in the  creditworthiness of applicants. In actuality, lenders don't make as  much money originating these smaller mortgage loans, resulting in a  reluctance to make them.   The Federal Housing Administration was designed to support  underserved markets and would be instrumental in supporting more small  dollar mortgage lending, but the data shows that the FHA is actually  disproportionately failing to serve this market.   H.R. 5931 would require the FHA to identify barriers to better  serving the small dollar mortgage market and to come up with a plan to  reduce those barriers, a public service long overdue for rural America.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Clay), the chairman of the Housing,  Community Development and Insurance Subcommittee and the sponsor of  this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleagues, Mr. Clay and Mr.  Stivers, for their partnership on this important bill, and my  colleague, Mr. Hill, for his work with me today as we seek to improve  access to affordable homeownership.  [[Page H1428]]    This bill is an important step to better understand the barriers to  obtaining traditional mortgage financing for small dollar mortgages and  begin to reduce those barriers.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 5003) to amend the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act to  provide enhanced protection against debt collector harassment of  members of the Armed Forces, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5003         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Fair Debt Collection       Practices for Servicemembers Act''.       SEC. 2. ENHANCED PROTECTION AGAINST DEBT COLLECTOR HARASSMENT                     OF SERVICEMEMBERS.         (a) Communication in Connection With Debt Collection.--      Section 805 of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (15       U.S.C. 1692c) is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(e) Communications Concerning Servicemember Debts.--        ``(1) Definition.--In this subsection, the term `covered       member' means--        ``(A) a covered member or a dependent as defined in section       987(i) of title 10, United States Code; and        ``(B)(i) an individual who was separated, discharged, or       released from duty described in such section 987(i)(1), but       only during the 365-day period beginning on the date of       separation, discharge, or release; or        ``(ii) a person, with respect to an individual described in       clause (i), described in subparagraph (A), (D), (E), or (I)       of section 1072(2) of title 10, United States Code.        ``(2) Prohibitions.--A debt collector may not, in       connection with the collection of any debt of a covered       member--        ``(A) threaten to have the covered member reduced in rank;        ``(B) threaten to have the covered member's security       clearance revoked; or        ``(C) threaten to have the covered member prosecuted under       chapter 47 of title 10, United States Code (the Uniform Code       of Military Justice).''.        (b) Unfair Practices.--Section 808 of the Fair Debt       Collection Practices Act (15 U.S.C. 1692f) is amended by       adding at the end the following:        ``(9) The representation to any covered member (as defined       under section 805(e)(1)) that failure to cooperate with a       debt collector will result in--        ``(A) a reduction in rank of the covered member;        ``(B) a revocation of the covered member's security       clearance; or        ``(C) prosecution under chapter 47 of title 10, United       States Code (the Uniform Code of Military Justice).''.       SEC. 3. GAO STUDY.         The Comptroller General of the United States shall conduct       a study and submit a report to Congress on the impact of this       Act on--        (1) the timely delivery of information to a covered member       (as defined in section 805(e) of the Fair Debt Collection       Practices Act, as added by this Act);        (2) military readiness; and        (3) national security, including the extent to which       covered members with security clearances would be impacted by       uncollected debt.       SEC. 4. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material  thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Representative Dean for her  leadership on H.R. 5003 and the relief that it will provide to our  servicemembers.   At a full Financial Services Committee hearing in September of last  year, we heard testimony about the harmful impact of predatory debt  collection practices, including negative impacts on the servicemembers  protecting our country.   We know this impact is significant, given that two out of every five  servicemember complaints submitted to the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau are about predatory debt collection practices.   Some of the complaints include inappropriate threats of punishment  under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, threats to the rank and  security clearance of the servicemember, and even reports of debt  collectors inappropriately contacting the commanding officer of the  debt holder.   It is a disgrace that people serving in the military are being  threatened and intimidated when they are serving our country. The  impact of these abusive collection practices is severe, as  servicemembers have reported increased stress and hardship as a result  of predatory debt collectors.   These unfair and unnecessary practices against people putting their  lives on the line for this country must end, which is why the National  Military Family Association; Veterans Education Success; and Retired  Army Colonel Paul Kantwill, the former CFPB Assistant Director for  Servicemember Affairs, all support the bill.   Democrats and Republicans agree that Congress should put a halt to  these abusive practices, and this bill does just that.   Mr. Speaker, thanks to the work of my colleagues, Representative  Dean, Chairwoman Waters, Ranking Member McHenry, and colleagues on both  sides of the aisle from the Financial Services and the House Armed  Services Committees, we were able to collaborate on the issues and pass  this bill out of our committee with unanimous support in November of  last year.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Dean), the sponsor of this  important legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I thank Representative Dean, Chairwoman Waters, and my colleagues on  both sides of the aisle for their good work and collaboration on this  issue.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 5932) to ensure greater transparency about the terms and  conditions of financing provided by China to member states of the  international financial institutions, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5932         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Ensuring Chinese Debt       Transparency Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2. ENSURING CHINESE DEBT TRANSPARENCY.         (a) United States Policy at the International Financial       Institutions.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct       the United States Executive Director at each international       financial institution (as defined in section 1701(c)(2) of       the International Financial Institutions Act) that it is the       policy of the United States to use the voice and vote of the       United States at the respective institution to seek to secure       greater transparency with respect to the terms and conditions       of financing provided by the government of the People's       Republic of China to any member state of the respective       institution that is a recipient of financing from the       institution, consistent with the rules and principles of the       Paris Club.        (b) Report Required.--The Chairman of the National Advisory       Council on International Monetary and Financial Policies       shall include in the annual report required by section 1701       of the International Financial Institutions Act--        (1) a description of progress made toward advancing the       policy described in subsection (a) of this section; and        (2) a discussion of financing provided by entities owned or       controlled by the government of the People's Republic of       China to the member states of international financial       institutions that receive financing from the international       financial institutions, including any efforts or       recommendations by the Chairman to seek greater transparency       with respect to the former financing.        (c) Sunset.--Subsections (a) and (b) of this section shall       have no force or effect after the earlier of--        (1) the date that is 7 years after the date of the       enactment of this Act; or        (2) 30 days after the date that the Secretary reports to       the Committee on Financial Services of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the       Senate that the People's Republic of China is in substantial       compliance with the rules and principles of the Paris Club.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material  thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I very much support H.R. 5932, the Ensuring Chinese Debt  Transparency Act of 2020, which seeks to reinforce U.S. policy at the  World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the regional  development banks to press for disclosure of the amount and terms of  China's bilateral lending operations abroad.   According to the International Monetary Fund, opaque loans from  China's many lending institutions, especially those associated with  China's Belt and Road Initiative are not only putting many emerging  market and developing countries at risk of debt distress, but also  complicate the IMF's ability to  [[Page H1430]]  monitor domestic, regional, and global financial risks associated with  this debt.   While the ability to accurately identify the amount and terms of  Chinese lending in developing countries is essential to better debt  risk management, surveillance work, and asset risk pricing, it is  important to understand that greater transparency itself is only a  starting point.   In order to help low-income, emerging market, and fragile and  conflict-affected states meet development goals while maintaining debt  sustainability, the United States should be increasing its commitments  to the multilateral development banks to offer these countries better  options than China does, to provide additional financing on  concessional terms of which China does very little.   Let me add that one argument for China's ongoing borrowing from the  World Bank is that it allows a broader public global good to be  imported into the Chinese system, things like international  environmental and societal standards, high standards of transparency  and open procurement processes, strong governance programs, and respect  for the importance of global economic cooperation.   However, there is very little evidence that World Bank lending to  China has had any such effect on Chinese behavior with respect to its  own development financing abroad, and this is a serious problem.   H.R. 5932 helps us to address this problem. Mr. Speaker, I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close. I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   The fact that China continues to borrow from the World Bank affords  us an opportunity to expect much more from China in return, including  an insistence on transparency in China's bilateral financing  operations, greater adherence by China to anticorruption and export  credit international standards, and finding coordinated and sustainable  solutions to countries experiencing balance of payment difficulties.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, which underscores  that far greater transparency is the first essential step China must  take if it is to be a responsible member of the global financial  community.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 4351) to require certain grantees under title I of the  Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 to submit a plan to track  discriminatory land use policies, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:  [[Page H1431]]                                      H.R. 4351         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Yes In My Backyard Act''.       SEC. 2. PURPOSE.         The purpose of this Act is to discourage the use of       discriminatory land use policies and remove barriers to       making housing more affordable in order to further the       original intent of the Community Development Block Grant       program.       SEC. 3. LAND USE PLAN.         (a) In General.--Section 104 of the Housing and Community       Development Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5304) is amended by adding       at the end the following:        ``(n) Plan To Track Discriminatory Land Use Policies.--        ``(1) In general.--Prior to receipt in any fiscal year of a       grant from the Secretary under subsection (b), (d)(1), or       (d)(2)(B) of section 106, each recipient shall have prepared       and submitted, not less frequently than once during the       preceding 5-year period, in accordance with this subsection       and in such standardized form as the Secretary shall, by       regulation, prescribe, with respect to each land use policy       described in paragraph (2) that is applicable to the       jurisdiction served by the recipient, a description of--        ``(A) whether the recipient has already adopted the policy       in the jurisdiction served by the recipient;        ``(B) the plan of the recipient to implement the policy in       that jurisdiction; or        ``(C) the ways in which adopting the policy will benefit       the jurisdiction.        ``(2) Land use policies.--The policies described in this       paragraph are as follows:        ``(A) Enacting high-density single-family and multifamily       zoning.        ``(B) Expanding by-right multifamily zoned areas.        ``(C) Allowing duplexes, triplexes, or fourplexes in areas       zoned primarily for single-family residential homes.        ``(D) Allowing manufactured homes in areas zoned primarily       for single-family residential homes.        ``(E) Allowing multifamily development in retail, office,       and light manufacturing zones.        ``(F) Allowing single-room occupancy development wherever       multifamily housing is allowed.        ``(G) Reducing minimum lot size.        ``(H) Ensuring historic preservation requirements and other       land use policies or requirements are coordinated to       encourage creation of housing in historic buildings and       historic districts.        ``(I) Increasing the allowable floor area ratio in       multifamily housing areas.        ``(J) Creating transit-oriented development zones.        ``(K) Streamlining or shortening permitting processes and       timelines, including through one-stop and parallel-process       permitting.        ``(L) Eliminating or reducing off-street parking       requirements.        ``(M) Ensuring impact and utility investment fees       accurately reflect required infrastructure needs and related       impacts on housing affordability are otherwise mitigated.        ``(N) Allowing prefabricated construction.        ``(O) Reducing or eliminating minimum unit square footage       requirements.        ``(P) Allowing the conversion of office units to       apartments.        ``(Q) Allowing the subdivision of single-family homes into       duplexes.        ``(R) Allowing accessory dwelling units, including detached       accessory dwelling units, on all lots with single-family       homes.        ``(S) Establishing density bonuses.        ``(T) Eliminating or relaxing residential property height       limitations.        ``(U) Using property tax abatements to enable higher       density and mixed-income communities.        ``(V) Donating vacant land for affordable housing       development.        ``(3) Effect of submission.--A submission under this       subsection shall not be binding with respect to the use or       distribution of amounts received under section 106.        ``(4) Acceptance or nonacceptance of plan.--The acceptance       or nonacceptance of any plan submitted under this subsection       in which the information required under this subsection is       provided is not an endorsement or approval of the plan,       policies, or methodologies, or lack thereof.''.        (b) Effective Date.--The requirements under subsection (n)       of section 104 of the Housing and Community Development Act       of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5304), as added by subsection (a), shall--        (1) take effect on the date that is 1 year after the date       of enactment of this Act; and        (2) apply to recipients of a grant under subsection (b),       (d)(1), or (d)(2)(B) of section 106 of the Housing and       Community Development Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5306) before,       on, and after such date.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material  thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 4351, the Yes In My Backyard Act.  This bill would encourage localities to responsibly reduce barriers to  housing development by requiring Community Development Block Grant,  CDBG, recipients to track and report on the implementation of certain  land use policies that promote housing development.   The United States is in the midst of an affordable housing crisis.  According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, the U.S. has a  shortage of 7 million rental homes that are affordable and available to  extremely low-income renters.   The research organization Up for Growth estimates that, from 2000 to  2015, the country underproduced housing by 7.3 million units. This  underproduction is, in many ways, driven by land use policies that  create artificial barriers to much-needed housing.   This bill will also help shine a light on potentially discriminatory  land use policies that unnecessarily prevent affordable housing  development in certain neighborhoods.   It is clear, based on the broad base of industry and advocate support  for this bill, as well as the bipartisan support, that there is  substantial agreement on the need to facilitate more affordable housing  production across the country as well as the need to responsibly reduce  barriers to affordable housing production.   H.R. 4351, the Yes In My Backyard Act, represents a step in the right  direction as we seek to address the affordable housing challenges that  our country faces.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Heck for introducing this timely  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume  to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Heck), the sponsor of this  important legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I, too, would like to thank Mr. Heck  and Mr. Hollingsworth for their leadership on this important bipartisan  bill, as well as Mr. Hill for managing this on the floor with me.   This bill is a constructive next step to help reduce the barriers to  producing affordable housing, and that is something that every American  can get behind.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
