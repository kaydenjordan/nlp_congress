 Madam Speaker, it is my great privilege to rise today in  strong support of S. 4359, the bill to rename the VA's regional office  in Atlanta after our late Senator, Johnny Isakson. I was proud to co- lead the companion bill in the House with my colleague from Georgia,  Congressman Bishop.   Senator Isakson was a great friend and a dedicated public servant to  not just me but all Georgians. Over a 45-year career in public service,  Senator Isakson forged his legacy as a champion for America's veterans,  concluding with serving as chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee  in the United States Senate.   After graduating from the University of Georgia, Senator Isakson went  on to serve in both chambers of the Georgia State legislature.   In 1983, he rose to become Republican leader of the Georgia House of  Representatives, and in 1999, he succeeded Newt Gingrich as the U.S.  Representative for Georgia's Sixth Congressional District, then serving  as Senator of Georgia from 2005 to 2019.   Throughout his life, Senator Isakson distinguished himself as a man  of character with unmatched dedication to the people of Georgia.   I am proud to co-lead this legislation to dedicate the VA's regional  office in Atlanta as a living monument to his tireless work in  advancing the policies that benefit our Nation's veterans.                            ____________________
