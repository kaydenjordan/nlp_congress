 Madam Speaker, I rise today to offer my deep  gratitude and appreciation to someone who has played an inspirational  and indispensable role in Congress for more than 4 decades, my great  friend, my guide, Judy Schneider.   After a legendary career as a Specialist on Congress at the  Congressional Research Service--really, the specialist, ultimate  specialist, on Congress--Judy is retiring; and I want to let her know  how much she will be missed.   I was fortunate to meet Judy even before I was sworn into the  Congress. And as soon as I met her, I realized that I need Judy  Schneider to be my mentor, and I was fortunate that she agreed to do  that.   Judy has won many well-deserved accolades; but I think that her  greatest reward is knowing that she has mentored and trained and  inspired so many that have gone on to use her lessons about how  Congress works, how it really works, how it should work, and then how  it really works. That has been the lesson that has improved people's  lives and the Members of Congress' lives and well-being.   So, Judy, I thank you. I love you, and I wish you everything good.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I am really so proud and grateful to  join you, Congressman Garcia. We are both from Illinois, and we see  some of the same examples of the fear that is plaguing our communities  wherever there are immigrants.   And I want to tell you, I take this issue very personally. Neither of  my parents were born in the United States of America, but they came  here as small children with their parents, who made a really good life.   My grandfather had a horse and wagon and actually sold vegetables in  Humboldt Park, part of your district right now, carrying heavy bags of  potatoes up and down the stairs.   Four children, and they all went to college. They made a good life,  and now his granddaughter is in the United States Congress.   Well, I will tell you, my grandparents, my parents did not live with  the fear that this President has brought to millions and millions of  people and, of course, people in our district.   I want to just tell you that exactly 1 week ago today, I flew home,  landed at O'Hare Airport in Chicago, and heard that something was  happening over at the international terminal, that there was now a  crowd of people and there were children ages, I think it was 16, 10,  and 9, minors, who were being held at the airport. These were citizen  children.   Why were they being held there? They came from Mexico. They had been  there on vacation. They came with an adult relative of theirs who had a  valid passport, but for some reason Customs and Border Protection sent  that adult back to Mexico--we are investigating exactly why--and now  said only the mother could pick up these minor children.   Well, I get that, except that their brother, who is a DACA recipient  older than them, an adult, came to pick them up, and they were not  released. A lawyer was there with a signed affidavit witnessed by  members of the consulate, the Mexican consulate. They would not release  the children to her.    By now, there was a crowd of people holding signs ``Release the  children.'' They had arrived at about 3 in the morning. They were given  two cots during the night, meaning one of those girls had to sleep on  the floor.   This is what is happening at the border, of course--mistreating  children.   So, finally, there was an agreement that was made: Okay, Mom will  come. Guess what? Mom is undocumented. She was afraid to come, but she  came, surrounded by the Mexican consulate, by the lawyer, by me, to  make sure that she was able to take her children home.   We heard that members of Customs and Border Protection said--and we  are investigating this, too--that, if these were normal circumstances,  that mother would have been detained.   Understand, they would have detained the mother of citizen children  who just wanted to travel to Mexico, come home, and go be with their  parents.   What is going on in the United States of America? We fear that  children like that are being used to lure undocumented parents to the  airport. That is what we fear. And this is just one example of one  family, of one problem that had to be resolved.   I am telling you, I am so heartbroken. I am going to the border on  Wednesday, and I want to go see again for myself what is going on down  there.   But we have to say, no, this cannot happen. We are the country of the  Statue of Liberty, the Statue of Liberty that welcomed my father and  his family to this country, not the family of walls and fear and  mistreatment and children dying in custody.   No, Mr. President, this is not the America that we all deserve.   And thank you, Congressman, for leading this discussion.
