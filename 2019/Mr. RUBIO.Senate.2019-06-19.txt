 Mr. President, today I am pleased to recognize  Philip Jones, the Jackson County Teacher of the Year from Marianna High  School in Marianna, FL.   To Philip, his job is to improve a student's reading and writing  skills. He believes this is best achieved through an openness to  dynamic academic and social changes. Philip designed his English class  curriculum with structured plans, which builds trust in his students  after the first 9 weeks of the school year and allows them to  communicate with him during class and through written assignments  clearly and without negative distractions.   Philip has taught 10th grade English at Marianna High School for 6  years and serves as the chairperson for the English Department. He has  also received the Florida Department of Education's High Impact  recognition 3 years in a row. Philip earned his bachelor's degree in  political science from the University of Florida in 2000 and his  master's degree in environmental law from Vermont Law School in 2004.   I extend my best wishes to Philip for his dedication to his English  students and look forward to hearing of his continued success in the  coming years.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I honor Tracy Kerby, the  Lafayette County Teacher of the Year from Lafayette High School in  Mayo, FL.   An eighth grade language arts teacher since 2006, Tracy's colleagues  note that she is always looking for opportunities to grow as an  educator. Tracy is a great leader for her students to follow because of  her high moral character and her desire to set her students up for  success later in life.   Tracy loves being a teacher in the Lafayette District Schools because  she has the ability to watch her students learn and grow. She enjoys  watching her students succeed in class, athletics, at local fairs, or  with volunteer events at their church.   I express my best wishes and gratitude to Tracy and look forward to  hearing of her continued success in the coming years.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I recognize Charles  Mearsheimer, the Collier County Teacher of the Year from Oakridge  Middle School in Naples, FL.   Charles has taught U.S. history at Oakridge Middle School for the  past 16 years and has worked in education for 24 years.   Charles believes in his students' ability to achieve success and in  the invaluable power of teaching to ignite the passion for learning  that will follow them as they grow throughout their educational  journey. He also serves as an unofficial mentor for new staff members,  passing along his own passion for teaching. Both his colleagues and  students feel the contagious effect of his enthusiasm and has led to  Charles being one of the most requested teachers at his school.   I extend my sincere thanks and gratitude to Charles for his  dedication to his students and look forward to hearing of his continued  success in the years ahead.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I recognize Jeannine Meis, the  Leon County Teacher of the Year from Leon High School in Tallahassee,  FL.   A teacher in the Leon County School district for 16 years, Jannine is  an educator who is consistently modifying her curriculum to create  lesson plans that help her to connect with her students while creating  an atmosphere that is encouraging. Before Jeannine started her tenure  at Leon High School, she taught elementary school at the Apalachee  Tapestry Magnet School of the Arts and middle school students at Cobb  Middle School, where she had the privilege of teaching some of her  students again.   I express my sincere thanks and appreciation to Jeannine for her work  and look forward to learning of her continued success in her future  endeavors.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am pleased to honor Leigh  Norris, the Hamilton County Teacher of the Year from Hamilton County  Elementary School in Jasper, FL.   Peggy Sue Hasty, principal at Hamilton County Elementary School,  described Leigh as a fine example of a dedicated teacher who works hard  to ensure her students achieve academic success.   A sixth grade math teacher who has worked in the district for 21  years, Leigh considers teaching the profession she was born to do. She  loves to inspire a passion for learning math, and shares the excitement  with her students when they make gains or solve challenging problems on  their own.   I offer my best wishes to Leigh for her work and look forward to  hearing of her continued success in the coming years.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I honor Judith Paris, the  Wakulla County Teacher of the Year from Shadeville Elementary School in  Shadeville, FL.   Judy's teaching philosophy guides her students to thrive in  environments where they are encouraged to explain their thinking and  also understand how their classmates think. She works to create a  classroom that facilitates a love of learning and where students build  self-confidence.   In her classes, groups of students often begin the school year at 40- 50 percent proficiency in math and consistently improve their math  scores to 90 percent or higher by the end of the school year. She  credits their success to the instructional practices that she teaches  to make students solve problems on their own and by working together.   Judy is a fifth grade math teach and is also her school's math team  leader and chair of the mathematics committee and coteaches faculty  workshops on accelerated math. Judy earned her bachelor's degree in  technical writing with a minor in mathematics from Louisiana State  University and earned a post baccalaureate degree in mathematics  education.

She was voted by her supplemental educational  services colleagues as the September 2018 Teacher of the Month.   I extend my best wishes and gratitude to Judy for her dedication to  helping her students succeed in mathematics. I look forward to learning  of her continued success in the years to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I recognize Kayla Patton, the  DeSoto County Teacher of the Year from West Elementary School in  Arcadia City, FL.   Kayla says that the most challenging part of teaching is finding  creative ways to motivate the uninterested students. However, this can  lead to the most rewarding part of her job: watching a student realize  they are able to do the work. Kayla implements a unique technique in  her fourth grade writing class. She asks her students to translate what  they see into words and then compose the visual objects into an essay.   Maintaining perseverance, self-criticism, innovation, and orderliness  in work are Kayla's keys to success. She says that channeling her  student's energy is what takes them from average to great.   I extend my sincere thanks and gratitude to Kayla for her dedication  to her students and look forward to hearing of her continued good work  in the coming years.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I honor Derita Pinkard, the  Madison County Teacher of the Year from Madison County Central School  in Madison, FL.   One of Derita's greatest joys as a teacher is the knowledge that she  is helping to shape the next generation that will lead the Madison  community, our State, Nation, and the world. By educating the youth,  she hopes their decisions and dreams will positively affect communities  in the future.   A seventh grade math teacher and math instructional coach, Derita has  been a teacher for 32 years, and she does not plan to slow down. Derita  is a patient educator, who likes to break down math problems for her  students when they have trouble understanding the steps or formulas.  She believes this approach is best suited to help them learn not only  in her classroom, but also in their future classes.   Derita graduated from North Florida Junior College, earning an  associate of arts degree before attending Valdosta State University,  where she earned her bachelor's degree.   I offer my best wishes and gratitude to Derita for her dedication to  teaching her students and look forward to hearing of her continued good  work in the coming years.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as chairman of the U.S. Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I have the  opportunity to highlight a unique small business every week. Small  businesses serve local communities and contribute to our Nation's  economy. This week, it is my honor to recognize Two Peas Cafe of  LaBelle, FL, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.   Two Peas Cafe was founded by childhood friends, Deborah Buchard  Klemmer and Vicki Reynolds. Growing up together, Deborah and Vicki  spent a number of years working at Deborah's grandmother Ella's  restaurant. During that time, they saw firsthand the positive impact  that the restaurant had on the community as well as its local and  national fame, which included a feature on the Travel channel. After  Ella's restaurant closed in March 2011, Deborah and Vicki were  determined to carry on her legacy. In August 2013, the duo opened Two  Peas Cafe, in honor of Ella's long-time description of them, with the  goal of providing the next generation with the same quality service and  community atmosphere they had grown up with.   Today, Two Peas Cafe not only continues to serve customers throughout  southwest Florida, but also carries on the tradition of Ella's famous  homemade pies and original southern-style recipes. With a reputation  for good food and a friendly atmosphere, Two Peas Cafe is often packed  with eager customers. Deborah and Vicki do not take sole credit for the  success of the restaurant, however. They attribute their success to  community support. When these two friends decided to open up their own  cafe, their family, friends, and neighbors rallied behind them to get  the restaurant up and running. By pooling their unique skills and  resources, the LaBelle community not only contributed to the  establishment of Two Peas Cafe, but also its success.   Considering their cafe a community establishment, Deborah and Vicki  remain committed to fundraising, supporting, and participating in  LaBelle area events. One example of this community commitment is Two  Peas' annual support of Relay for Life and the American Cancer Society.  Not only do Deborah and Vicki organize a yearly team to raise money and  participate in the event, but for the past 3 years Vicki has been one  of the program coordinators. In this role, Vicki has been able to  motivate friends, family, and Two Peas staff to join together for a  great cause. At LaBelle's Relay for Life this past March, the Two Peas  Cafe team raised more than $20,000 and placed second in the event.  Clearly, small businesses like Two Peas Cafe are just as much a force  of community service as they are of economic growth.   Deborah and Vicki exemplify the dedication to service that we all as  Americans share. As successful entrepreneurs, they recognized that they  were uniquely positioned to bring their community together for a great  cause. I am honored to recognize Deborah, Vicki, and the entire team at  Two Peas Cafe as the Senate Small Business of the Week. Companies like  Two Peas Cafe make me proud to represent Florida, and I look forward to  watching their continued growth and success.                            ____________________
