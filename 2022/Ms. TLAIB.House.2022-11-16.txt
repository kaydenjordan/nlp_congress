 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Tyrone  Winfrey, a beloved resident of Michigan's 13th Congressional District.  He was a tireless advocate for our students, a fighter for higher  education opportunities, and so much more.   Tyrone Winfrey served as the Executive Director of Community Affairs  for Detroit Public Schools Community District and was the former school  board president. He worked tirelessly to advocate for our youth, and to  ensure that every single student had access and an opportunity to  quality education and a pathway for college and higher education  opportunities.   Tyrone served our communities at Detroit public schools for almost 35  years, and during his time, he inspired, supported, and uplifted so  many of our students and families.   He lost his 5-year battle with cancer, and I am proud to stand here  in honor of his life and his love for our community and our youth. My  thoughts and prayers are with his family, the Detroit Public Schools  Community District, and all who were impacted by Tyrone Winfrey.                  Recognizing the Islamic Center of America     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Islamic Center  of America for their outstanding service on behalf of our communities  of Wayne County and Southeastern Michigan as they celebrate their 60th  anniversary.   They were founded in 1962, and there, the Islamic Center of America's  roots can be traced back to 1949 when our religious leader, scholar,  Imam Chirri, who could not speak or understand English, came to America  at the request of a small group of residents.   A committed group of community members came together and worked to  establish the Islamic Center as Michigan's first mosque and invited  Imam Chirri to lead this family in faith.   Since its humbling beginnings, the Islamic Center of America has  grown to accommodate its growing family in faith and offers numerous  community programs, including education and senior services. They are a  pillar of cross-cultural understanding in one of our area's most  vibrant and diverse communities.   Please join me in recognizing the Islamic Center of America as they  celebrate 60 years of faith and service.                           In Memory of Joey Smith     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my sadness about the  death of Joey Smith, a 12-year-old resident of Dearborn Heights, whose  young life was tragically cut short when he was struck by a car.   A seventh-grade student at O.W. Best Middle School, Joey was always  surrounded by friends and classmates who will dearly miss him. He will  be remembered for his bright smile.   I offer my deepest condolences and sympathy to Joey's family and his  friends as they mourn his loss.   As a mother myself, my heart especially goes out to Joey's mother,  Katie. I pray that she finds the strength and peace during this very  difficult time of unimaginable grief. Our community is deeply saddened  by this tragedy.   Please join me in honoring the memory of Joey Smith.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of the life of Tyrone  Winfrey, a beloved resident of Michigan's 13th District, a tireless  advocate for students, and a fighter for higher education opportunities  and so much more.
