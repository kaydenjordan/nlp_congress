 Mr. Speaker, former first lady of South  Carolina, Iris Campbell, wife of the late Governor Carroll Campbell,  passed away last week. South Carolinians are grateful for her  dedication to our citizens.   Born in Greenville, Iris Campbell was married to the love of her  life, Carroll Campbell, for 46 years. Together, they built successful  small businesses and then served the people they loved for three  decades, being instrumental in the development of the two-party system,  with Carroll Campbell being the first Republican elected to Congress  from Greenville-Spartanburg in over 100 years.   As South Carolina's first lady from 1987 to 1995, Iris Campbell  devoted herself to service organizations, including the American Cancer  Society, the March of Dimes, and Carolina Children's Home. She served  on the board of trustees for Richland Memorial Children's Hospital.   When Governor Campbell was diagnosed with Alzheimer's, Iris Campbell  devoted herself to caring for him and to raising money for Alzheimer's  research and the Carroll Campbell Place for Alzheimer's Care of  Lexington Medical Center in Lexington.   Roxanne and I join all South Carolinians in thanking the Campbell  family, especially sons Carroll, Jr.--Tumpy--and Mike for sharing Iris  with us. She has made South Carolina better, and we will miss her.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
