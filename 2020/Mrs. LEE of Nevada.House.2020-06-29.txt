 Madam Speaker, on behalf of the people of  Nevada's Third Congressional District, I rise today to stand up for my  constituents' access to healthcare and lifesaving treatments and  support the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement Act.   A constituent of mine, Mark, wrote to me recently. He is retired and  on Medicare, and he is also a diabetic who requires insulin to survive.  He told me that the cost of his insulin is going up 400 percent, with  no warning or explanation. It is life or death for him, because he  needs the insulin but can't afford it.   This moment should give us all pause. Millions are out of work;  thousands are sick and dying from a global pandemic; yet lifesaving  medications are still out of reach for Americans who need them.   It is unbelievable that this administration continues its campaign to  take away people's healthcare. Seniors like Mark deserve better,  Nevadans deserve better, and Americans deserve better.   Medication costs, rising premiums, and junk insurance plans are  forcing people to choose between lifesaving treatment and paying their  bills. No one in this great country should have to make that choice.   I urge my colleagues to vote for the Patient Protection and  Affordable Care Enhancement Act, and give every American access to  affordable health care.
