 Mr. President, I am pleased to have the opportunity to  give some thoughts today on what is going on in the United States and  around the globe.   Here in these early months of this new Congress, there clearly is  broad bipartisan agreement on the importance of the Indo-Pacific region  for our country's future. We are strengthening our military posture in  that region, and last Congress, we passed legislation to strengthen our  strategic industries.   What is being ignored, however, is a third component essential to our  success in the region: expanding trade. At a State and Foreign Ops  hearing in March, I noted the importance of our economic relationships  around the world and asked Secretary of State Blinken about our  approach to trade agreements, particularly America's absence from the  Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership--the CPTPP.   He told me the original pact in 2015 had real benefits, economically  and strategically, but since then the world has moved on. I agree with  him, our allies and our partners have moved on. They have moved on  without us.   A year ago this month, President Biden made his first trip to Asia  and unveiled the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, the administration's  initiative to reengage the region on standards involving digital trade,  supply chains, climate change, and corruption.   This is a small start, but it falls far short of what is needed today  to advance American prosperity and security--also, the well-being of  our Asian partners. In particular, the President's proposal fails to  include greater U.S. market access.   The United States is belatedly offering a tepid leadership to a  region that remains committed to open trade.   We can and must correct this or fall further behind in the most  economically dynamic region in the world. I call on President Biden to  enter into--and Congress to ratify--the CPTPP. It would be difficult to  overstate how important the Indo-Pacific is to American prosperity. The  region comprises 40 percent of the global economic output, and that is  expected to grow to 50 percent by the end of the decade.   The largest economy in the region belongs to China, which is the  largest trading partner for the region's countries. This provides  Beijing with leverage to bully our allies and partners into making  concessions in exchange for access to the Chinese market. It allows  Beijing, not the United States, the same opportunity to have that  relationship, so necessary.   China, for example, used coercion to retaliate against Australia  after our allies in Canberra called for an investigation into the  origins of COVID-19. Beijing regularly forces American businesses to  refrain from criticism of China or conform to communist policies.   China's leaders can coerce and intimidate because they have economic  strength. It is clear China will exert that tremendous leverage over  other nations to achieve its global ambitions. Its attempts to bully  countries into its sphere of influence are on full display through the  Belt and Road Initiative, which has left trails of debt traps and human  rights abuses. Unfortunately, the United States is ceding our economic  leadership that we established and maintained for the last 80 years.   Having quit the Trans-Pacific Partnership under bipartisan,  Republican and Democrat, criticism for that departure, the countries we  worked with--treaty allies and partners--moved ahead. They moved ahead  without us and in 2018 brought into force a successor agreement, the  CPTPP. These countries represent more than 13 percent of global GDP,  and in the last few weeks, Great Britain has gained membership.   So important is the CPTPP to the Pacific economies that China has  applied for membership. They did so last September. It would be a grave  mistake for us to assume that in America's absence China would be  denied membership indefinitely.   China wants in, despite already being the largest member of the  Regional Comprehensive Economic Agreement, which also includes our  treaty allies, Japan and South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. This  trade bloc accounts for nearly one-third of global GDP.   These two agreements, comprised of nations with diverse ideologies,  underscore the importance of the economics of the Indo-Pacific region.  In Asia especially, economics and security are one and the same, and  for Washington to ignore that is a miscalculation.   Our allies and partners in this region are noticing. They notice our  absence. Australia's Foreign Minister said at the end of last year:         America's decision not to proceed with the CPTPP is still       being felt in the region. . . . We have reached a stage in       the evolution of our alliances where they will increasingly       require a fully developed economic dimension, as well.    In other words, we can't have the same relationship with countries  that we don't deal with in trade in economic relationships.   At the end of 2022, Singapore's Defense Minister had this to say:         The U.S. increasing their military presence in Asia as a       stabilizing force is virtuous, it is good and we will support       that.    But then he made this key point:         We think that the U.S. should do more to engage as it did       previously, to build an economic framework, which as a tide       can lift all boats.    Despite our own National Security Strategy which declares that ``we  need to win the competition for the 21st century'' and that we will  ``shape the rules  [[Page S1587]]  of the road for . . . trade and economics,'' the document makes clear  President Biden believes ``we have to move beyond traditional Free  Trade Agreements.''   But given the words of our Pacific friends, it is equally clear they  have not moved beyond such agreements. In fact, they are doubling down  on them without us. The President and his administration are either  oblivious to this fact or indifferent.   Given the stakes, whichever one it is, it is a serious mistake.  Dating back to the 1980s, the National Security Strategy is a  congressionally mandated report issued by the President to convey the  administration's national security goals and how to achieve them. In  recent decades, one document is published each Presidential term rather  than yearly.   The 2022 document, President Biden stresses upholding the ``rules- based international order'' but then refuses to engage in shaping one  of the significant pillars of that order: trade.   The National Security Strategy invokes four principles, two of which  are openness and inclusiveness. And as one scholar observed, the  President's approach to trade is neither open nor inclusive.   This hurts our goals in this region, and it hurts Americans at home,  our very national security. Our engagement really is about our own  well-being. Our own well-being is often dependent upon the well-being  of our friends and allies or those we want to be our friends or allies.   Economic partnerships can promote U.S. national security interests by  protecting critical access to technology, minerals, and food supplies.  We know what happens when we are so dependent upon one particular  country for meeting our country's needs in strategic items. It is a  mistake for us to have all eggs in a basket. Robust trade agreements  safeguard the intellectual property and manufacturing capabilities that  underpin our American military dominance.    Southeast Asia presents a situation in which our agricultural  producers can score significant market access wins, while U.S. soft  power can bolster our influence with these critical partners with these  countries that are or can be our friends.   America's economy is the foundation of our power. Without the  creation of wealth, we cannot afford to sustain the world's greatest  military, which in turn defends the peace that enables the flow of  goods. As a column in the Wall Street Journal just within the last week  argued, ``The U.S. must embrace the politics of growth. Our world must  be, and must be seen to be, the surest, fastest path to raising living  standards all over the world. That's what we did after World War II. We  must find a way to do it again today.''   What that is saying is we can't allow China to be seen as the path to  economic well-being for people and nations around the world and  specifically in the South Pacific.   Southeast Asia presents a situation in which our agriculture  producers can score significant market access wins while we are making  a difference in our own capabilities to influence the world.   America's economy is the foundation of our power, and we must utilize  it. In competing with China in the coming decades, it is essential that  the United States provide a positive vision for the region that  attracts countries to what America offers beyond security support.  Leadership is more than making clear what we are against. We must offer  a compelling case of what we are for and how it will benefit those we  wish to lead, those we wish to be partners with.   Little in geopolitics is a win-win, but trade is a rare area that  advances our interests and those of our partners. According to the  Chicago Council on Global Affairs, the American people understand this.  Three in four Americans think that trade is good for the U.S. economy,  but Congress and the President are making a mistake ignoring the old  idea of open trade.   To best compete with China in Asia and to help Americans at home,  joining the CPTPP and providing greater market access is an obvious  place to begin. Jobs, economic opportunity for us, and most  importantly, the well-being of our Nation, our national security,  depend upon trade and that relationship it creates.   (Ms. CORTEZ MASTO assumed the Chair.)    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  scheduled vote occur immediately.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
