 Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, the amendment offered makes important changes  to our bill, H.R. 2396, which is a straightforward, commonsense measure  that seeks to streamline the privacy information consumers get from  financial institutions and makes the information available much more  frequently via electronic delivery.   We have been working on what I consider to be a simple but necessary  fix to a 20-year-old law throughout this year, and I believe the  amendment we have presented for your consideration will undoubtedly  benefit consumers. We have worked with our colleagues on the Financial  Services Committee to modify and strengthen the underlying bill, and I  appreciate everyone's efforts.   Mr. Speaker, I would also like to thank the committee's ranking  member, Ms. Waters, for her and her staff's efforts to improve our  bill. I consider this amendment to be an effort to improve the  underlying legislation. While Ms. Waters still has some outstanding  concerns, I do appreciate her working with us.   The amendment clarifies the process by which consumers can opt out of  having their information shared with unaffiliated third parties. It  limits the application of the alternative delivery mechanism to vehicle  financial companies--that is simply what the amendment does--rather  than all financial institutions, as defined under the Gramm-Leach- Bliley Act and other technical and conforming changes.   Mr. Speaker, we believe these changes make our bill stronger and we  urge the adoption of the amendment.  [[Page H9914]]    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, just in closing, let me offer some  clarification.   In the fall of 2014, the CFPB finalized a rule allowing financial  institutions to post their annual privacy notices online instead of  delivering them individually if they met a series of conditions,  including not sharing the customer's nonpublic information with  unaffiliated third parties.   In December of 2015, Congress went further by enacting an outright  exemption from the mailing requirement for financial institutions that,  one, do not share nonpublic personal information about a consumer with  unaffiliated third parties; and, two, have not changed its disclosure  policy and practices since the most recent disclosure was sent to  consumers.                                time  1030    Institutions that provide financing for vehicle purchases or leases  do not meet the criteria set forth by Congress and are, therefore,  required to continue issuing paper privacy notices to consumers.   Mr. Speaker, this amendment helps to improve this bill. It modernizes  this requirement. I just urge the body to adopt the amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
