 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman DeFazio for yielding. I  also thank his staff for working very hard to put this bill together  that will add $1.5 billion to the $1 trillion that will be added for  our highways and the infrastructure that we need. Thank you so much.   I am pleased to offer this bipartisan amendment in order to designate  the I-27 Ports-to-Plains Corridor as a future interstate that starts in  Laredo, the largest inland port in the country.   I thank Jodey Arrington, Brian Babin, Lizzie Fletcher, and Ben Lujan  for all the work that they have done to get to this point.   This designation will make Texas and New Mexico eligible for  increased Federal funding to complete the I-27 highway expansion  project, creating economic growth, jobs, and trade opportunities across  those two states.   The I-27 expansion would immediately grow the Texas GDP by $17.2  billion and create 178,000 construction jobs. It would also add 17,710  long-term employment opportunities in the new I-27 corridor. It would  also make Laredo the only port of entry that will have I-35, I-69, and  I-27 as corridors, also.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues in the House to pass this  bipartisan amendment that will help improve trade in south Texas,  Texas, and across New Mexico.
