 Mr. Chairman, I rise today with disappointment. What was  once a bipartisan bill is now a vehicle for policies that hinder our  readiness and our defense capabilities.   For almost 60 years, the NDAA has been a bipartisan endeavor. The  NDAA fulfills the number one role of Congress: to provide for our  common defense. But House Democratic leadership has turned this into  yet another partisan bill.   Let me be clear. I support a pay raise for our troops. I support  providing all warfighters with the best resources available and a  National Defense Authorization Act that empowers America and our  allies. But, unfortunately, this bill, in its current form, poses a  significant threat to our ability to carry out the national defense  strategy now and in the years ahead.   As President Reagan often said of our national defense strategy,  ``Peace through strength.'' This bill does not--I repeat, does not-- show strength. We can and must do better.
