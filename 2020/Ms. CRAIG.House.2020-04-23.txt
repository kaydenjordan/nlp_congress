 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support today for America  and Minnesota's small businesses.   Whether it is a florist in Apple Valley, the Cannon River Winery, or  a food shelf in Eagan, I have heard the urgent need for funding  assistance to survive the impacts of COVID-19. But we must do more.   I am grateful that we are going to add additional support to small  businesses and nonprofits by funding the Paycheck Protection Program  and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program today to keep small  businesses and the American Dream alive.
