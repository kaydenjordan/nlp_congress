 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize two  impressive student athletes from Bucks County, Pennsylvania, who are  making their school and our entire community very proud.   Justin Massielo and Emelie Curtis, students at Pennsbury High School  in Fairless Hills, Pennsylvania, both recently hit impressive  milestones in their respective sports.   Justin, a senior, recently recorded his 100th hit as a 4-year starter  for the Falcons' varsity baseball team, and Emelie, a junior, just  notched her 100th career goal as a 3-year starter for the Falcons'  varsity girls lacrosse team.   What makes their achievements even more special, Madam Speaker, is  that Justin and Emelie also are cousins.   On behalf of our entire community, I would like to congratulate  Justin and Emelie on their notable athletic achievements. We wish them,  and their families continued success.                     Recognizing Lieutenant Terry Hughes     Madam Speaker, this week is National Police Week,  and I rise today to recognize a dedicated law enforcement professional  from Bucks County, Pennsylvania, who recently retired after a very  distinguished career in public service.   Lieutenant Terry Hughes of the Bristol Township Police Department  retired after over 30 years in local law enforcement.   A resident of Bristol Township throughout his entire life, Lieutenant  [[Page H3850]]  Hughes previously worked at the police departments in Hulmeville,  Newtown Township, Northampton, and Middletown before joining his  hometown's police force in 1990.   Throughout his entire tenure in Bristol Township, Terry became a  senior member of the department, leading detectives, running special  investigations, and he was a driving force in public outreach.   Madam Speaker, I had the opportunity to personally work with  Lieutenant Hughes on the Department of Justice's Weed and Seed program.   We thank our friend, Terry, for his years of public service and for  protecting our community. Terry has law enforcement in his blood, and I  have no doubt whatsoever that his service in protecting our community  will carry on.    St. Michael's Evangelical Lutheran Church Celebrates 150th Anniversary     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a faith  community in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, that recently celebrated a  very special milestone.   St. Michael's Evangelical Lutheran Church in Sellersville  commemorates its 150th anniversary this year.   First commissioned in 1869, St. Michael's was to be a union church  between Reformed and Lutheran Christians. Nearly 2,000 people attended  one of St. Michael's consecration ceremonies.   The church is rich with tradition and history. Early sermons were  spoken in German, and in 1904, the church became the first building in  Sellersville to have electricity.   Today, the St. Michael's community is as active as ever,  participating in community meals, working on community gardens, and  providing food for Pennridge FISH and Keystone Opportunity Center, and  offering numerous educational programs.   Madam Speaker, we congratulate the St. Michael's faith community on  their 150th anniversary of such an amazing and special place.   I would also like to thank Pastor Julie Bergdahl for her pastoral  care and leadership.                            ____________________
