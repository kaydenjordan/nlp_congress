 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, the House will meet at 12 p.m. for morning- hour debate, and 2 p.m. for legislative business, with votes postponed  until 6:30 p.m. On Wednesday and Thursday of next week, the House will  meet at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate, and 12 p.m. for legislative  business. On Friday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative  business, and last votes are expected no later than 3 p.m.   We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. The  complete list of suspension bills will be announced by the close of  business tomorrow.   The House, Mr. Speaker, will consider a clean continuing resolution  to fund the government past September 30. While the House did its work,  and sent 10 appropriation bills to the Senate, funding 96 percent of  the government--the first time that is been done in over three  decades--I am disappointed that the Senate failed to pass a single  appropriation bill. Not one.   Not only that, they haven't filed any until just the other day when  we got back from the summer break.   I am disappointed that the Senate failed to introduce a single  appropriation bill for the first time in more than three decades. So  that while we were very successful, the Senate failed to move forward.   Therefore, as we wait for them to complete their work so that we can  begin conference negotiations, a continuing resolution will be  necessary to prevent another government shutdown like the one we  experienced earlier this year.   In addition, the House will consider H.R. 1423, Forced Arbitration  Injustice Repeal Act, called the FAIR Act, and the legislation would  eliminate forced arbitration in employment, consumer, and civil rights  cases so that Americans, as they have under the Constitution, would  have the right to seek redress of grievances through the courts.  [[Page H7691]]    This would restore access to justice for millions of Americans who  are currently locked out of the court system and are forced to settle  their disputes against companies in a private system of arbitration.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I understand the gentleman said a lot of things about reaching  bipartisan agreements and all of this sort of stuff, and the Senate  needed 60 votes. They didn't introduce a bill. Not a single  appropriation bill was introduced.                                time  1215    They had the same 60-vote requirement last year, and they passed a  lot of bills last year. The reason they didn't pass bills is that the  President of the United States wouldn't come to the table and agree on  caps. They could have done the same thing we did.   We are an independent branch of government. We are the Article I  branch of government. We appropriate money. We spend money. But the  Senate has not done its work.   If you brought the bills to the floor and couldn't get 60 votes, we  get it. But I will tell my friend that there is great frustration. For  the first time since my friend has been a Member of the Congress, we  passed 96 percent of the funding for government by June 30, otherwise  known as 3 full months before the end of the fiscal year, giving the  Senate a lot of time.   But, no, we had to wait and wait and wait until the President sent  down Secretary Mnuchin, and we finally made an agreement on 302(a)s, in  other words, the caps, what we were going to spend.   With all due respect to all this talk about bipartisanship and that  we need to work together, that is, of course, true. It was not true in  the Congresses when my friend's party was in the majority. The  Republicans passed partisan bills, and they went over to the Senate.  The Senate didn't take them, and we went back and forth.   There has been no back and forth. We did our work, and although the  Republicans disagreed with the numbers publicly, privately, very  frankly, a lot of my friend's Members told me the numbers were pretty  good numbers, and they liked them, including defense. We passed a  Defense bill with a substantial increase for our troops, readiness,  operations, and training.   I say that to Mr. Whip not to criticize my friend but to simply say  that of all this verbiage about being nice to get together and do  something, the regular order is we pass bills, the Senate passes bills,  and then we have a conference. Unfortunately, we have gotten away from  that, which I think is very bad for the House, the Senate, and the  American people.   We cannot go to conference if the Senate doesn't even pass a bill,  doesn't even introduce a bill, waiting on the President of the United  States to say, ``Simon says.''   We can't get a bill supported by 90 percent of the American people,  comprehensive background checks, which 90 percent, a majority of my  friend's party, a majority of my party, and a majority of independents  thinks makes common sense. We passed it in February, and we can't even  have it on the floor in the United States Senate.   Not only are they not doing appropriations bills, but they are not  doing any other bills either. They spend all their time on judges.   We are a little frustrated on this side because we have done our  work. Ninety-six percent of government is funded, and, yes, there could  have been differences of opinion. They should have passed bills and  said, no, we don't agree.   Mr. Speaker, the problem they would have had, I tell my friend, is  that they didn't want to have bipartisan bills because, yes, it would  have required them to get 60 votes, and they didn't want to make the  compromises necessary to get 60 votes.   We are here, just a little more than 15 days before the end of the  fiscal year, and the Senate has not passed a single bill while we have  funded 96 percent of government. This CR is necessary. Nobody wants to  shut down government, I hope. Hopefully, the CR will not have anything  that either party will disagree with, and we will extend some things  that need to be extended because we haven't acted upon them in a timely  fashion. But I am hopeful that the CR will get to the Senate, that we  will pass the CR, that there will be no drama, and then, as the  gentleman suggests, and I agree with him, that we will sit down in a  bipartisan way and try to reach agreement on each 1 of the 12  appropriations bills and either put them separately or in a minibus or  omnibus and pass them to fund the government and not have what we had  last year and into the first part of 2017, a shutdown of the Government  of the United States. That was not good for the people of our country,  not good for our government employees, and not good for the Congress of  the United States to be unable to do its work, resulting in a shutdown  of government.   I appreciate the gentleman's sentiment about doing things in a  bipartisan way, but you can't do things in a bipartisan way if they  don't come to the floor. If the leader over there doesn't have 60  votes, then he needs to reach a compromise because we need to get our  business done. We passed all of our bills. Some were not partisan, I  think, in many ways, but there was a determination not to vote for them  because we hadn't reached a caps number. I think that was unfortunate  because I think, as someone who served on the committee for 23 years,  Mr. Speaker, we passed our bills in many, many instances--most  instances--in a bipartisan fashion.   I didn't want the comment to go not responded to, in terms of the  Senate's refusal and unwillingness to act and do its business. And here  we are, not a single bill--not one--has been passed through the  committee.  [[Page H7692]]    The gentleman's party has the majority on the committee. At least my  friend could report them out of committee and then work on getting 60  votes.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, the defense bill passed this House with  almost every Republican voting against it. It was a bill that provided  $733 billion, a figure that the Joint Chiefs of Staff suggested  publicly. It was a figure that I know personally was a figure that was  deemed acceptable by the leadership of the authorizing committee and  the appropriating committee on the Republican side. The rhetoric was  totally partisan.   We have now made a deal, and we are now going to save defense because  we did $5 billion more. The figure last year, of course, was somewhere  around $700 billion, a little over.   I will tell my friend that we believe on our side of the aisle that  the opposition to the defense bill was totally partisan, no attempt at  bipartisanship. Yes, the Republicans had some success in getting  bipartisan bills through. Why? Because we were prepared to vote in a  bipartisan way.   That is the difference. We were prepared to vote in a bipartisan way.  We were prepared to accept my friend's party was the majority.   Mr. Speaker, we understand when you are in the minority you work to  get the best objective you think is possible. We did that, and the  gentleman, Mr. Speaker, says that they got bipartisan bills done  because Democrats voted for them, including me. But I know the number  was an acceptable number, and it was a number suggested by the Joint  Chiefs of Staff. Yet we heard rhetoric after rhetoric of how this was  letting down the Defense Department.   What did they do? They made a deal, not $733 billion, $738 billion.  My goodness, what an extraordinary difference. They voted against  funding the men and women in uniform, funding operations, and funding  overseas contingencies.   I hope that we get off this. If you want to talk bipartisan, act  bipartisan, Mr. Speaker. Talk is cheap. It was clear that Democrats, in  fact, when the Republicans were in the majority, did vote on a number  of occasions, not every occasion, for bipartisanship. But you can't  have bipartisanship if you don't introduce a bill.   Mr. Speaker, the Republicans have the majority in the United States  Senate on the committee. They don't need 60 votes in the committee.  They don't need 60 percent. They don't need two-thirds. All they need  is a simple majority to pass a bill out of committee, as the gentleman  pointed out when he said we did fund some pieces of government before.  Why? Because we got bipartisan agreement.                                time  1230    And I have never seen, as I say, in three decades, the Senate fail to  even introduce an appropriation bill prior to the end of July.   I hope the Senate will move with some degree of alacrity. I hope that  we will get to agreement on these 12 bills. I hope that we will fund  the government and not have a shutdown, as we had the last time. The  first time it has ever happened in a new Congress where the government  was shutdown--all over the wall--which a number of Republicans have  said is not a useful thing to do.   I won't name them. I am sure the minority whip, the Republican whip,  [[Page H7693]]  knows a lot of them. They served in this body. Some are chairman of  committees over there now.   So I am hopeful that we will move together on the appropriations  process and do our business, do it on time, as we have done here in the  House so that the American people can be well-served.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.  Scalise) for yielding.   We can discuss all sorts of bills, but we discussed the  appropriations process. And the gentleman expressed how they were able  to pass 70 percent of funding of the government because they had the  Defense bill and the Labor-Health, which are the two biggest bills,  passed and signed by the President.   Why were they able to do that, Mr. Speaker, when it requires 60 votes  in the Senate? They didn't have 60 votes in the Senate because  Democrats acted in a bipartisan way to affect that end.   This year, we have had no opportunity to do that. We have had no  opportunity to conference on our bills. Republicans lead the Senate,  passed your bills, and if you can't get 60 votes, yes, you would have  to compromise in the Senate.    You didn't compromise when you were in charge, frankly, on an awful  lot of things that had closed rules, more than any other Congress, so  we didn't have an opportunity to even amend.   But that aside, when you claim that you passed those bills you did,  and the only reason you could do it is because the Democrats acted in a  bipartisan fashion because you did not have the votes to pass them on  your own, you needed Democratic votes. Democrats gave you those votes  because we knew that in order to get things done you had to move in a  bipartisan fashion.   That is the only way you were able to do it. We have not been given  the opportunity in the United States Senate because there are no bills  yet to consider, except for the last 3 days the bills came forward.   But for the first 9 months of the year, no bills came forward, Mr.  Speaker, not one.    Mr. Speaker, the chairman of the committee spoke about  their process. Their process has been a fact-finding process. That is  our responsibility as a Congress. That is his responsibility and the  committee's responsibility as a committee.   The majority party claims that they have an agenda for the people,  and the people believe we ought to exercise our responsibility. That is  what the committee is doing. I do not want to anticipate what the  committee's findings will ultimately be nor what the committee's  actions will finally be. We will wait to see. But it is exercising its  responsibility as a coequal branch of government as provided in the  Constitution.   I am not going to get into an argument, Mr. Speaker, about the  premises in the Mueller report, other than to say I disagree with the  characterization made by the Republican whip. That will be for another  day to argue that.   The committee is doing its duty and it will continue to do so. And if  it decides that that requires further action, my presumption is it will  pursue that as well.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I didn't want to get into this debate, and I don't want to prolong  it, but I do not want the premises articulated by the whip, Mr.  Speaker, to stand unobjected to.   In my view, Mr. Speaker, the Mueller report is replete with instances  of cooperation by members of the Trump team with the Russians, page  after page after page. As a matter of fact, one of them was Page, of  collusion.   Now, ``collusion'' is not a legal term. ``Conspiracy'' is the legal  term. Mr. Mueller said we didn't look at collusion because it was not a  legal premise.   In fact, Mr. Mueller made it very clear that the reason they didn't  find criminal wrongdoing was because they believed, under Justice  Department rules, a President cannot be indicted during the course of  his term. They did not absolve him.   Whether it was obstruction of justice, using a foreign government  that is, essentially, not our ally, not our friend, or meeting with  Putin secretly and not allowing the American people or the Congress to  know what was said, my friend's premise that there is no smoke, no  fire, is wrong.   Very frankly, as someone who has served here a long time and who has  seen some of the most irresponsible attacks on the President during the  Obama administration--hearings, over and over and over again. A tragedy  in Benghazi--seven hearings, seven hearings, all concluded nothing  there, so they had an eighth hearing.   The gentleman talks about Judiciary. Eight hearings on Benghazi, four  lives lost tragically, with an attempt over and over and over again to  be made a political issue. The eighth found nothing there either.   When I see this wringing of hands, Mr. Speaker, I am not impressed. I  have been here for a long time. I have seen irresponsible action, and  the American people have seen it.   The Judiciary Committee is doing what it pledged to do when they all  raised their hands to defend and support the Constitution of the United  States of America.   The President would like us to think everything is fake news. The  gentleman hasn't used ``fake news'' but ``the witch hunt.''   ``Poor me. I am the victim of all these people,'' when, daily, the  President says things that are demonstrably not true.   Mr. Speaker, the Judiciary Committee will continue to pursue its  duties, as it needs to do.    Eight hearings, all Republican-led.    And all found nothing there.    All found nothing there, Mr. Speaker.    Eight hearings found nothing there.    All led by Republicans.    Eight times you looked into it.    Mr. Speaker, we have said all along that we want to get to  yes on the USMCA. Frankly, we think it is an improvement over NAFTA,  which needs improving.   As the gentleman may know, the Speaker and I were here when we voted  on NAFTA. We both voted for it.   There were some promises made and side agreements that the rights of  workers and the environment would be protected. Unfortunately, that did  not turn out to be true, so that, in adopting a change to NAFTA, we  want to make sure that the promises made in the agreement are promises  that can be enforced.   As the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has often said, the commitments in a  trade pact aren't worth the paper they are written on if they can't be  enforced.   Mr. Speaker, that has been the posture of the Speaker, myself, and of  so many others, that enforcement is critical. Unfortunately, the NAFTA  enforcement mechanisms have been a failure.   In 25 years, as I am sure the whip knows, the U.S. has taken only one  successful enforcement action under the NAFTA dispute resolution  procedure, and none in the past 20 years. Not a single enforcement has  prevailed. We have been completely unable to enforce its labor  provisions, not one successful enforcement action.   We want to get to yes. And, yes, I want to say that Ambassador  Lighthizer is somebody who we respect and think is operating in good  faith. We think he is a positive interlocutor. He is somebody who we  can work with and have been working with.    On the other hand, we sent a letter 6 weeks ago, and as the gentleman  pointed out, we got an answer yesterday. So, it is taking some time for  our task force to get answers to questions and to determine how we can  move forward to ensure that the matters included in the agreement  become reality, not simply words on paper.   That is important for workers. It is important for our environment.  Very frankly, it is also important in terms of trying to contain drug  prices, here and around the world.   The gentleman talked about prescription drugs. That is one of the  items that is still in dispute. We want to get to yes. We think this is  an improvement on what exists.   Therefore, I am hopeful that we will be able to get to an agreement.  We believe it will require that the agreement be opened and that  enforcement be included so that, as the chamber said, it can really be  enforced.   If that happens, I am hopeful that we can pass that agreement, with  the agreement of our friends in labor, with our friends at the Chamber  of Commerce, and in a bipartisan way on this floor. Let's hope that  happens.   But we have made it very, very clear that, if it is just words on  paper and not enforceable, it is not a good agreement for America or  America's workers.   But I hope that we can move forward and achieve an agreement on this  issue so that we can pass it.                                time  1300     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow, and further,  when the House adjourns on that day, it adjourn to meet on Tuesday,  September 17, 2019, when it shall convene at noon for morning-hour  debate and 2 p.m. for legislative business.
