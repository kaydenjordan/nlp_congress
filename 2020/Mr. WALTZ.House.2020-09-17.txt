 Madam Speaker, as a combat veteran, I think a lot about my  past experiences in battle and personally have dealt with my own  struggles, from PTS to survivor's guilt.   But this year, we are in a collective battle, and the front lines  look very different. We are fighting against an invisible enemy,  against COVID-19, and we are forced to distance ourselves and to change  our entire way of life. This isolation is causing anxiety, depression,  and sometimes takes us to even darker places, even with suicidal  thoughts.   September is Suicide Prevention Awareness Month, and I am teaming  with a veterans group, Mission Roll Call, to raise awareness about  suicide prevention, especially the 22 veterans per day we are currently  losing.   In combat, we are constantly checking on our brothers and sisters to  our left and our right, and we have to do the same back here at home.  So I say to all veterans out there: Reach out. Ask your buddy how they  are doing. Share a memory. Let them know that you are thinking about  them and you have their back.   Together, we are stronger. Together, we can win this fight.                            ____________________
