 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Climate change is accelerating and poses a growing threat to our  economy and to our world. We must address climate change with the  urgency that it demands, and that means we must all take action.   That is why I am proud to have introduced two bipartisan pieces of  legislation included in this package: the Smart Energy and Water  Efficiency Act, which I authored with Representative Kinzinger, which  aims to create an innovative water and energy resource management pilot  program with the Department of Energy.   The Advanced Nuclear Fuel Availability Act, which I co-led with  Representative Flores, informed the language in this package ensuring  that adequate supplies of domestically produced high-assay low-enriched  uranium are available in the United States, something that is essential  for some of the advanced nuclear reactor designs that are currently  being developed.   The Clean Economy Jobs and Innovation Act represents the type of  strong, concrete steps that we must take to prevent the catastrophic  impacts of climate change. I urge all of my colleagues to support this  legislation.
