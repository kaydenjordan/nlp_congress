 I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy) and  the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Manchin) are necessarily absent.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I thought that the Republicans wanted to  cut taxes, but when it comes to American families' health insurance,  they want to raise taxes. Now, why?   Well, there is one simple explanation: Barack Obama. You see, it was  Barack  [[Page S3675]]  Obama who came up with the ACA--the Affordable Care Act--where millions  of Americans have access to health insurance--affordable health  insurance--35 million, 1 out of 10 Americans.   But in the efforts of the Republicans to end the Affordable Care Act,  they are basically trying everything. There was a time when there was  this historic, tension-filled moment on the floor when three Republican  Senators saved the Affordable Care Act. Senators Murkowski, Collins,  and John McCain--and I will still remember that image as long as I am  alive--walked on the floor and saved the Affordable Care Act.   But ever since then, the Republicans have been trying to do away with  it every way they can think of. There are millions of Americans who  have better health insurance because of the Affordable Care Act. They  cannot be denied coverage because of a preexisting condition. They  don't have annual or lifetime limits on coverage. They have free  preventive healthcare, and young adults can stay on their parents'  plans until they have reached the age of 26--all positive things,  wildly popular. Still the Republicans resist the idea that this is  going to be the law of the land, if they have anything to say about it.   There is no disputing that ACA is one of the greatest public policy  accomplishments of a lifetime. But as I mentioned, this lifesaving  policy is once again under threat from the Republicans. Why?   Last year, Congress passed and President Biden signed into law the  American Rescue Plan, which, among other things, made ACA health plans  more widely available and more affordable for millions of Americans.   That package increased the size of ACA's tax credit, which eliminated  or reduced out-of-pocket premiums for millions of people.   It also expanded eligibility, so that more lower- and middle-income  Americans are now eligible for tax credits.   As a result of these improvements, a record 14-and-a-half million  people signed up for the ACA plans during the 2022 open enrollment  period. And I understand nearly one-third of these enrollees found a  plan that costs $10 per month or less.   Millions of enrollees selected a plan that didn't cost anything. In  the midst of this once-in-a-century pandemic, the American Rescue Plan  provided families across the Nation with peace of mind that they have  continued access to health insurance.   Here is the problem: If Congress doesn't do something--and soon-- these enhancements lowering the cost of premiums for American families  will end. That causes millions of people to lose their health insurance  or to have to pay more.   If you are in a time of inflation, where the cost of living is going  up, wouldn't you want to be on the train that says ``lower health  insurance premiums''? The Democrats are. The Republicans are not.   Millions of people will either lose their insurance or pay more if we  don't do something. Not one single Republican Senator will join in our  efforts, but those families in every State are going to be benefited by  this.   Let's not forget how hard Republican Senators have fought to come  down on the side of insurance companies and take away health insurance  for Americans. It has been their top priority for decades.   So it falls on Democrats, once again, to fix this problem. And fix it  we must. It is my understanding that all 50 Democratic Senators are on  board with providing a multiyear extension of these ACA tax credits. I  know that House Democrats are with us.   Let us get it done soon by August when insurers start notifying  customers of their 2023 premiums. People nationwide have a lot on their  plates these days, from rising costs to fears of gun violence to  increasing COVID cases to new restrictions on women's rights.   Let us not add to the burden of tax-paying families by hiking their  health insurance premiums next year. The Democrats want to fix it. We  invite the Republicans, who give many speeches on the cost of living  for families, to join us.   I yield the floor.
