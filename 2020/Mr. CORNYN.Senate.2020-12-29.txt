 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, we didn't expect to be in session this  week, but we are. And, of course, as we all know, the theme for this  entire year has been ``COVID-19 writ large.''   More than 330,000 Americans have died from the novel coronavirus.  Tens of millions have lost their jobs, and every community across the  country has felt the devastating blow dealt by this pandemic, but, as  we know, the threats that existed long before this virus still are with  us. Even though most of the world hit pause to battle COVID-19, our  adversaries did not, and our brave servicemembers didn't pack their  bags and not show up for work when everybody else shut down.                            ____________________     Mr. President, over the last several months, as the  Senate has worked to support our country through this pandemic, we have  kept an eagle eye on the other threats on the horizon, and we passed  the National Defense Authorization Act to ensure that we are prepared  for whatever comes at us.   For our forces to continue fighting and defeating our adversaries in  every corner of the world, they need funding. They need stability. They  need to be able to plan, and they need the unwavering support of the  U.S. Congress and all 330 million Americans.   The 2021 NDAA provides that support from Congress. It will prepare  our military and servicemembers to address the threats that exist  today, while preparing for those that we will inevitably face tomorrow.   Earlier this month, this legislation passed the House by a vote of  335 to 78 and the Senate by a vote of 84 to 13. Those are rare vote  margins in Congress these days, and that alone is a testament to the  importance of this legislation and its bipartisan support.   We know the President has the constitutional authority to veto any  bill for virtually any reason, and he has exercised that power with  this legislation. The reasons the President has given I don't think are  frivolous at all, but they just shouldn't be tagged to this particular  piece of legislation. His concerns about section 230 under the  Communication Decency Act and the power of these social media platforms  that censure speech is troubling indeed. This is something we really  haven't confronted before. We know that under the First Amendment, the  government can't censure speech, but with smalltown newspapers and  media outlets and other alternatives fading away, more and more the  American people rely on Facebook and Google and other internet  platforms to get their information, and they have, I believe, become de  facto public forums. So I agree that we do need to address section 230  of the Communications Decency Act, as the President has pointed out.  [[Page S7961]]    The President also has a point about the Commission to rename  military bases that are part of the Defense Authorization Act.  Unfortunately, the amendment that was adopted in the Armed Services  Committee undermines the role of Congress, once the Commission makes  its report, to do as Congress believes should be done. But the truth  is, as we have learned from our friends across the pond in the UK, no  Parliament can bind a future Parliament, and indeed no Congress can  bind a future Congress. That is true. So if these are things the  President believes we should address and that Members of Congress and  the new administration believe we should address, we will address them,  and we have an opportunity to do that, but we should not try to do that  on this bill and risk the loss of this important piece of legislation  now in its 60th year of adoption.   The Defense Department is hands down the largest employer in the  United States, with nearly 2.9 million employees, including both  servicemembers and civilians. These men and women can be found in more  than 160 countries around the world and on all seven continents.  Supporting them is a Herculean task, and the NDAA is a significant way  in which we do that.   The Defense authorization bill also includes a 3-percent pay raise  for our troops and additional support for their families, such as  career support for military spouses and quality childcare on military  bases. Given the fact that we have an All-Volunteer military, it is  important we not only support our servicemembers who wear the uniform  but the families who support them as well. I have heard it said, you  can recruit a member of the U.S. military, but if you want to retain  them, you have to take care of their family, and I believe that is  absolutely true.   This bill also ensures previous reforms to improve the quality of  military housing and healthcare are implemented appropriately. Those  who serve in our military have made tremendous sacrifices in order to  safeguard our freedoms and our way of life. I regard our support for  them and for our national defense the No. 1 priority of the Federal  Government. Everything else pales in significance. So we should do  everything in our power to ensure that they and their families are  appropriately taken care of.   Beyond pay and benefits, that means giving the military members the  training, the facilities, and the equipment they need not only to  succeed on the job but to return home safely.   The NDAA authorizes military construction projects across the  country, including $183 million in Texas, which will bring serious  updates and improvements to our military bases. At Joint Base San  Antonio, this funding will provide for a range of new facilities,  including a barracks, a flight simulation system, and an F-16 Mission  Training Center.   At Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth, it will support an F-35 operations  and maintenance facility, vehicle maintenance shop, and an aircraft  maintenance hangar. It will also support fuel facilities at Fort Hood  and provide additional funding for the Pantex Plant in Amarillo, which  maintains a large portion of our nuclear stockpile. Maintained and  modernized facilities are a critical component to military readiness,  and this legislation makes tremendous investments in our facilities  around the world. It will authorize 93 new F-35 Joint Strike Fighters  that will be built by Texans in Fort Worth. As we work to counter  increasingly sophisticated adversaries around the world, this  investment in our military readiness could not be more important.    In addition to supporting our members in uniform and ensuring they  are ready for action when called upon, the NDAA helps our military take  stock of the evolving threat landscape and ensures that our country is  taking active steps to counter threats on the horizon.   In recent years, China and Russia have risen to the top of the  threats to our country and to world order, with China now assuming the  No. 1 role. We remember the Cold War after World War II, where we  sought to contain and counter Soviet expansionism, and, actually, the  mutual deterrents that we have established during that time has worked.  But China is a unique challenge, and none of the old rules apply to  China.   They are increasingly belligerent and well resourced and continue to  demonstrate a lack of respect not only for the United States and our  closest allies but for basic human rights.   The Chinese Government continues its disturbing and unacceptable  genocide against the Uighur people. The so-called political reeducation  camps are nothing more than concentration camps where Uighurs are  tortured. Recent reporting has found that the treatment in these camps  often includes forced abortions, birth control, and sterilization. And  China continues to chip away at the freedoms and autonomy of Hong Kong,  notwithstanding its promises to the contrary, using a so-called  national security law to extinguish opposition to the Chinese Communist  Party and to deny the people of Hong Kong the freedoms that they were  promised.   As I mentioned, though, China doesn't stand alone as a threat to the  world. Russia has become increasingly aggressive around the world in  its effort to wreak chaos and sow discord. Since their attempts to  interfere with the 2016 election, we have witnessed aggression after  aggression from Russia, not just here in the cyber space but around the  world.   From Russia-backed mercenaries fighting in the Middle East to its  attempt to steal the coronavirus vaccine research and, in the last few  weeks, a massive cyber attack on U.S. Government agencies, Russia  continues to undermine the United States and our allies and shows no  signs of stopping.   It has become increasingly clear, if it wasn't already, that China  and Russia adhere to no rules and no principles but their own. As the  national defense strategy outlined, the threats posed by these two  countries are increasingly dangerous, and countering these growing  threats requires a clear and concentrated effort from Congress. That is  exactly why passing the NDAA--the National Defense Authorization Act-- is so important.   This legislation prioritizes strategic competition with China and  Russia and takes a strong approach to counter the threats posed by  adversaries around the world. It will build on the progress we have  made in recent years to strengthen our military after the draconian  cuts during the Obama-Biden administration and achieve peace through  strength.   Over the last several decades, the NDAA has provided an annual  opportunity for us to take stock of the evolving threat landscape and  ensure that our national defense is prepared to meet the challenges not  only of today but of tomorrow, and this year's Defense Authorization  Act is no exception.   It takes a strong approach to counter the threats posed by our  adversaries around the world. It invests in modernized national defense  that is critical to maintaining peace through strength, and it provides  support for our servicemembers and their families. Above all, it sends  a message to the world that our country is and will remain the global  military leader.   I have supported this legislation on the Senate floor many times, and  I will do so once again when the opportunity to vote to override the  veto presents itself.   One of Congress's most critical responsibilities is to provide for  the common defense, and the NDAA--the National Defense Authorization  Act--is how we will deliver.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
