 Madam President, I just want to say how much I appreciate  the resolution of the Senator from Indiana. It reminds me of  discussions I know all of us have had about the teaching of American  history and civics in our schools and, frankly, a collective concern  that our children are being raised and educated without learning both  about our founding principles and how unique we are as a nation. I  think, as modest a step as this may seem, it is an important one, and I  congratulate our friend from Indiana for taking it.
