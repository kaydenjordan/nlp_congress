 Madam President, before I turn to the main portion of my  remarks, I would be remiss if I failed to recognize two staffers who  were instrumental in helping us pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act earlier  this month--James Williams, my senior policy adviser, and Nick Clason,  a talented young staffer. Both worked long hours to help make tax  reform a reality. I wanted to take just a brief moment to recognize  them for the late nights they spent helping me to hash out the details  of this bill. They are some of the hardest working members of my staff,  and I hope they know how much I appreciate them.
