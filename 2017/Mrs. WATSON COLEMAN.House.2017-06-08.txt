 Madam Speaker, in the wake of the financial  crisis, 7.8 million American consumers lost their homes through  foreclosure. The failure to have a responsible regulatory environment  also resulted in taxpayers paying $7 trillion to bail out financial  institutions through loans and, according to some reports, an  additional $22 trillion through the Federal Government's purchase of  assets.   My home State of New Jersey was severely impacted by this crisis and  still feeling the effects. So this is personal.   The Financial CHOICE Act is the wrong choice for Americans. This bill  guts many of the commonsense protections that are outlined in Dodd- Frank and severely restricts the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  from doing its job.   The ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act gives Wall Street a hand while ignoring the  needs of hardworking Americans. It will allow predatory lending  practices to go unchecked and profiteers on Wall Street to skirt  consequences.   Wall Street reform and other Democratic policies have given our  country the strongest consumer protections in history.   I will continue to stand up for hardworking Americans and reject the  ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act before Republicans pave the way back to the dark  days of the financial crisis.                            ____________________
