 Madam President, I strongly believe a woman's healthcare  decisions should be between her, her doctor, and her family, which is  why I voted to advance today's bill. If it advanced, I would have  offered an amendment to remove editorial language that has no  legislative effect and needlessly disparages everyday Americans based  on their deeply and sincerely held beliefs. On issues so important and  personal to many Americans, both parties should seek respectful  understanding instead of ascribing motives or insulting those who hold  different beliefs.                            ____________________
