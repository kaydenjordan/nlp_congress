 Mr. Speaker, America doesn't have a gun violence  problem, we have a human violence problem. But those across the aisle  don't want to talk about that because then you have to talk about the  culture of death that we have created in this country. Killing 63  million unborn children. Denying the sanctity of life. That is the  conversation that they don't want to have.   Mr. Speaker, as a former police officer, I have encountered many  dangerous people with guns, and we stopped them before they hurt  themselves or others. We identified them. We identified the threats  that they were making. Then we were able to intervene and stop those  individuals before they became a shooter.   That is what we should be focused on in the wake of these recent  tragedies. Give law enforcement the tools and resources to stop those  who have shown a propensity to become violent. That is what we should  be focusing on, not defunding the police, not demoralizing the police,  not delegitimizing the police. We should be focused on assisting the  police and identifying these individuals who want to commit crime.                                time  1615
