 Mr. Speaker, for the past 8 years, President Barack  Obama has used his pen and phone to create a fourth branch of  government that overreaches through executive orders and Federal rules  and regulations. But today is a new day--a day when this Congress  begins to dismantle this fourth branch of government and drain the  swamp in Washington.   Through the entirety of this President's administration, Republicans  have fought against out-of-control growth of Federal bureaucracy and  rules and regulations that have suffocated the American economy. The  last time I checked, the President's job was to enforce existing laws  and work with the elected Members of Congress whose responsibility it  is to pass laws as the people's representatives. Instead, I believe he  has undermined not only our Constitution but also the American people  through this executive power grab.   It is time to get rid of the Washington-knows-best, top-down, one- size-fits-all rules like the EPA's waters of the U.S., the Clean Power  Plan, the Department of Labor's overtime rule and restrictions on your  retirement savings. These regulations have consequences, and what these  bureaucrats do have, consequences. In 2015 alone, the Federal  Government leveled 3,400 regulations on Americans. Those regulations  cost us $1.9 trillion in lost productivity and growth--a cost of  $15,000 per American household.   Now, for the first time during my tenure serving the Second  Congressional District of Missouri, Congress has a unique opportunity.  This week we will pass a bill that I have had the pleasure of  cosponsoring and voted for twice before--the REINS Act, and I expect it  to become law. The REINS Act puts power back in the hands of the people  as Congress--the people's House--can implement an up-or-down vote on  any new major rule before they can take effect. Congress should decide  what rules are necessary for our constituents--not unelected  bureaucrats.   We will also pass this week the Midnight Rules Relief Act which will  allow Congress to stop the Obama administration's last minute  regulations from taking effect as they turn out the lights and head out  the door.   The American people spoke loud and clear: They want results. They are  tired of working harder for less money and tired of wondering how they  will make ends meet at the end of every month. They have had enough and  are tired of the constant chipping away of their freedoms.   Taken together, these two bills clearly demonstrate that this  Republican Congress is unified and will work with President-elect Trump  to help alleviate the day-to-day burdens felt by Americans across the  country. By passing these bills, we are demonstrating that we are  listening to our constituents and we are telling them that their  elected representatives are in charge, not Washington bureaucrats.                            ____________________
