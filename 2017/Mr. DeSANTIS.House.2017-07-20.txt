 Mr. Speaker, Republicans have promised for years to  repeal and replace ObamaCare, and this effort has seemed to have  stalled in the Senate.   The best way to restart the ObamaCare repeal process is simple. Make  Congress live under it.   The President can make this happen. ObamaCare included a provision  dropping the congressional health plans for Members of Congress and  diverting Members to the ObamaCare exchanges where they would have to  pay their own premiums. Yet an Obama administration regulation gutted  this provision and provided lucrative taxpayer subsidies for Members  thereby creating an illegal exemption for Congress under ObamaCare.   Mr. President, cancel this regulatory exception. Make Members live  under ObamaCare as written. If you make them live under ObamaCare, my  guess is that they will vote to quickly repeal ObamaCare.                            ____________________
