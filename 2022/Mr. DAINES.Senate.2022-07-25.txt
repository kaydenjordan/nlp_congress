 Mr. President, today I have the distinct honor of  recognizing Tom Kuntz of Carbon County for his unwavering dedication to  the Red Lodge community and his 30 years of public service to the  people of Montana through his selfless firefighting career.   As a graduate from both the National Fire Academy Executive Fire  Officers Program and Ithaca College, Tom brought his skills and passion  to the Treasure State when he first moved to Montana in 1992 and began  what would become a distinguished career in firefighting. He now serves  as the chief of the Red Lodge Fire Department and has been an active  leader in responding to the fires and natural disasters that have  impacted the community over the years.   Notably, Tom served as a key player in responding to the 24,000-acre  Robertson Draw Fire that blazed through Carbon County in June of 2021.  Roughly 1 year after the community faced the devastating wildfire, they  were hit with historic flooding, which has wreaked havoc throughout the  county. Referred to as ``the 500-year flood,'' the high waters have  caused catastrophic damage to people's homes, properties, businesses,  and public infrastructure. Tom acted swiftly, working on the frontlines  to help mitigate the wreckage and help members of the Red Lodge  community.   Tom and his wife Eliza also serve the community through their various  restaurant and hospitality businesses which have become staples in  downtown Red Lodge and attract both locals and visitors from near and  far. They also raised their two daughters to be involved in public  service, and they regularly help out at the family businesses.   It is my honor to recognize Tom Kuntz for his dedication to keeping  the people of Red Lodge safe through a seemingly relentless series of  natural disasters and for his many years of public service to the great  State of Montana. Tom, thank you for all you do help our communities  prosper and stay safe. You make Montana proud.                            ____________________
