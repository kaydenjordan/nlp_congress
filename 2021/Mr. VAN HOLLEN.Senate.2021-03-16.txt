 Mr. President, we urgently need a qualified and  effective leader ready to protect our natural resources, conserve  public lands, and collaborate with our Tribal nations. President  Biden's nominee to lead the Department of the Interior is just the  person for the job, Congresswoman Debra Haaland. She will quickly  restore confidence in the Department and reaffirm its mission to manage  and conserve our public land and do its part to confront climate  change.   Congresswoman Haaland would be the first Native American Cabinet  Secretary, and she is no stranger to breaking barriers. Haaland was one  of the first two Native women elected to Congress in 2018. Prior to her  congressional tenure, Haaland was the first Chairwoman elected to the  Laguna Development Corporation Board of Directors and the first Native  woman elected to lead a State party, as chairwoman of the New Mexico  Democratic Party. She brought her progressive values of sustainability  and environmental protection to each of her positions, and I believe  she will do the same for the Department of the Interior.   During her tenure as vice chair of the House Committee on Natural  Resources, Haaland led legislative efforts, like the ANTIQUITIES Act  and the 30x30 Resolution, to protect and conserve our national  monuments, public lands, and oceans. Additionally, the Congresswoman  has prioritized environmental justice and Tribal inclusion throughout  her career. She introduced  [[Page S1566]]  the Environmental Justice in Recreational Permitting Act to increase  access to public lands for all communities and fight environmental  injustice. Given the Department's history of failing to engage with  indigenous communities while enacting harmful public lands policies,  Haaland will bring a new era of equity and inclusion to the Department  of the Interior.   Last Congress, I worked to enact the Chesapeake WILD Act, which  authorizes up to $15 million annually for a new grant program managed  by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to do fish and wildlife habitat  restoration in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. I look forward to working  with Haaland to see that this program is fully funded and well  implemented.   The Department of the Interior manages over 500 million acres of  public land, and Haaland's record shows she is prepared to take on this  role. For these reasons, I support Debra Haaland's nomination for  Secretary of the Interior.                            ____________________
