 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, it has been 56 days since the Trump administration  asked for emergency funding to address the humanitarian crisis at our  southern border, 56 days.   The New York Times had two editorials--not one, but two. Mexico is  now sending 15,000 troops to the southern border. But Democrats, Madam  Speaker, have rejected a bill to provide the aid that is needed not  once, not twice, not even 10 times, but 18 times.   Madam Speaker, I was shocked when I actually heard from the other  side of the aisle that someone said there is a crisis. I guess after 56  days, they read some of those editorials. Now, after weeks of doing  nothing and denying that a crisis exists, they are offering legislation  that is misguided and is purely political.   They are, once again, taking what should be a bipartisan issue and  inserting partisan poison pills. I would say I would be shocked, but  this isn't the only issue they have done that on this year.   Madam Speaker, they took a bill that had a 100 percent vote from  Republicans and Democrats dealing with prescription drugs, and before  it got through the Speaker's Office, Madam Speaker, it became  political, a poison pill.   They took a bill that was in Ways and Means that got every Republican  and every Democrat to vote for it, but, again, before it came to the  floor, another poison pill.   I guess we might have to get used to this, but the American public  should not.   Madam Speaker, that isn't how it is being used on the other side of  this building. In the Senate, they actually took up this issue. They  passed it out of committee 30-1.   I know my colleagues might be shocked because I said that went  through committee. I know my colleagues might be shocked because I said  it was bipartisan. I know my colleagues might be shocked because they  actually let the Senators read the bill.   Madam Speaker, when we were on this floor being sworn in, there were  a lot of promises made, and a lot of promises have been broken.   There was a rule change, 72 hours. It actually marked the number of  hours.                                time  2015    Last night, I watched the Rules Committee. They were going to come  before the Rules Committee with a bill that we did not see in  committee.   But do you know what? They couldn't get the votes. So we had to say  no to the Rules Committee.   They will come back at 10. So I eagerly waited at 10. No, we could  not come back.   It is going to be at 11. I eagerly waited for 11. It did not happen.   But, luckily, politically, they got in the back of the room and they  were able to buy off some more, Madam Speaker, in a political nature  and rush something to the floor.   I wondered if they were going to keep that rule that they championed  so hard about 72 hours. Well, I don't know, maybe 5 equals 72. I am not  sure what math they keep nowadays.   But let's talk about how they make this problem even worse, because I  am not sure anybody has read the bill. I am not sure even if those on  the other side know what is in it.   Now, here is how it is worse. Departments of Homeland Security and  Health and Human Services cannot share information about the sponsors  of children.   Think about that for one moment. They are making sure two departments  cannot share information within their own government.   Now, this is necessary to ensure that children are not placed with  human traffickers or with predators. Maybe if they had a little time  and maybe if they didn't care about politics, they would have allowed a  little sharing of information for the children.   Organizations like Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the  Department of Justice are underfunded. Requests for pay and overtime  costs for Border Patrol agents are denied. Think about that.   In the last month, 144,000 people were apprehended coming across the  border illegally. These are unbelievable numbers that we have not seen  in decades.   So what do the Democrats rush? Deny overtime and deny the ability for  those who are serving us the ability to work.   Immigration judges do not get the resources they needed for  additional staff or courtroom space or equipment. America is a country  that believes in the rule of law, but I guess on this floor it is not  the case. The majority wants to deny it.   Now, I wonder that maybe, Madam Speaker, on the other side they say:  Well, it is just a rush to judgment; it is such a big bill, I didn't  get to read it.   But do you know what? Earlier today, everyone in this Chamber had the  ability to vote for more funding for judges just to deal with this  crisis, because I have heard, Madam Speaker, on the other side of the  aisle, they actually now use the word ``crisis.''   It only took 56 days, but, lo and behold, when they had that moment  not to be confused, not to have a big bill but only that subject, every  single Democrat on the other side of the aisle, except seven, said  ``no.'' So the majority made sure they put in this political bill as  well.   Deny overtime during a crisis, because you said it was a crisis, but  make sure nobody can work. You have a crisis, but make sure, Madam  Speaker, that we can't have the judges down there, because somehow, I  guess, maybe you don't believe in the rule of law; and additional  funding to investigate human traffickers who you know are smuggling  these children across the border is not included.   Maybe, Madam Speaker, that is why you want to rush this bill to the  floor. Maybe that is why you don't want to give people an opportunity  to read it.   How will you answer that? How will you answer that additional funding  to investigate human traffickers who are smuggling children you do not  want to include, Madam Speaker?   Did you read the editorials? Is it wrong to prevent the  administration from improving the welfare of unaccompanied children, as  this bill will do?   Democrats are far more interested in appearing to help children than  in actually helping them. The pace and volume at which children have  crossed our border over the last year have completely overwhelmed our  existing resources.   Madam Speaker, you are making sure that nobody could work overtime  during this. In the first half of 2019, more than 56,000 unaccompanied  children were apprehended by Customs and Border Protection. That is a  74 percent increase from last year and higher than the yearly totals  for the last 5.   Luckily, someone finally realized that is a crisis--but make sure  there is no money to deal with it. Health and Human Services shelters  are full and out of money. They cannot care for the children if  Congress does not pass solutions.   Now, HHS Secretary Alex Azar sent us a very clear message. Madam  Speaker, this is what he said: ``I can't put a  [[Page H5155]]  kid in a bed that does not exist and I cannot make a bed that Congress  doesn't fund.   Madam Speaker, to think that you would knowingly pass something that  causes this problem.   Madam Speaker, Democrats are proud that their bill, unlike the  Senate, does not help our overstretched law enforcement officers. That  is shameful to take pride in making sure they do not get the help.   Border Patrol agents now spend half of their time processing claims  and caring for families in custody, including making trips to hospitals  and clinics. They are going beyond the call of duty every day and  deserve our support, whether you like them or not. If the children who  come across our southern border are to be properly cared for, Madam  Speaker, Democrats' distrust of our national law enforcement officers  must stop.   Madam Speaker, it has been 56 days, but all Democrats threw together  is a sham bill more than 3 hours ago. It does not adequately fund what  needed to be funded and would only make the crisis worse. Democrats are  holding another vote late in the night on legislation that has no  chance of becoming law.   Madam Speaker, we are better than this.   Madam Speaker, it is not very far if you walk out these doors; you  look down that hall; you will see the other Chamber.   Do you know what happened in the other Chamber? They worked a bill  through committee. They worked a bipartisan bill through committee.  They didn't run it to the floor in 3 hours. They didn't tell the Rules  Committee to be ready and wait and wait and wait and then quickly  after, they cut a deal, on one side. They took something that is  critical, something that is serious, and they acted that way.   History will write about what happens on this floor. Madam Speaker,  you may get emotional; you may be proud of your actions; but the  question will be: Will history be kind to you? The question will be:  When you voted that day, when you were sworn in, did you really mean 72  hours?   Madam Speaker, when you stand on the floor and you speak of a crisis  and you speak of caring for children, why would you not fund to make  sure people are not trafficking them?   Madam Speaker, when you spoke about there was a crisis on the border,  why would you not fund the men and women who work for our government?  Why would you try to deny them overtime?   Madam Speaker, I know the Fourth of July is soon, and I know Members  want to get out of here, but America is more than a country. America is  an idea, an idea of self-governance, an idea that the rule of law  matters.   This is not one of our finest moments. This is not one that I am  proud of. What is so shameful, Madam Speaker, is, just a few yards  away, they are showing us an example.   Are you rushing because you are afraid the Senate is going to send us  something that is bipartisan? Are you rushing because you are afraid  the Senate will actually make law?   Madam Speaker, there are a lot of things we could play political  games with, but I never thought children would be the one you wanted to  use. We are better than this.   There is a moment in time where you should stand up to your own  leadership. There is a moment in time that you should stand up for this  country. There is a moment in time, Madam Speaker, and this is it.   Madam Speaker, you don't have to follow and be rushed. You can say:  No, I watched what the Senate has done. I watched people with my own  philosophical belief who belong to my own party work together with the  other side and actually come with a bill that could become law. It is  not perfect. It is not what I would agree with 100 percent. But do you  know what? I understand our government is designed to find compromise.   I don't know what compromise is in this. I don't know who ever worked  with another side. I don't even know who rushed it to the Rules  Committee just to do some manager's amendment because you bought off a  few people.   This is not our finest moment by far, but, Madam Speaker, there is a  moment in time when individuals can stand up, and I am hoping that the  moment is tonight, that we actually stand for what this country  believes and what we will celebrate on the Fourth of July.    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I  appreciate that.   I have spoken to the leader on the Senate side, and they will bring  it up tomorrow. They had passed this bill in committee 30-1.   I ask the gentlewoman: What would be the problem--and I know we have  only had 3 hours with this bill. Why would we not take up the Senate  bill when it is bipartisan and the President would sign it?
