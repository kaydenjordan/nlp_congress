 Mr. Speaker, consistent with the statement that was just  made about Brian Fitzpatrick, I will be missing tomorrow's votes. If I  were here, I would vote ``no.'' There is too much good that is being  done with the PFAS, and I would vote ``no.''   But I will be attending the funeral of a former Member of Congress, a  great patriot, a friend, just a wonderful person, Michael Fitzpatrick,  and it was an honor to serve with him in this body.   Obviously, we have had a lot of discussion about Iran, Soleimani, his  death, the death of so many that he caused, and his role in being head  of the IRGC, so I thought it would be helpful if we learned a little  more for those who haven't.   It helps, I found, profoundly, if people know what they are talking  about, and it seems there has been a whole lot of talking and not a lot  of knowledge about what is going on with Iran.   Many of us remember, and I sure remember because I was in the Army at  Fort Benning at the time, when our Embassy in Tehran was attacked  initially, it was said by the Iranian leaders that the students  attacked the Embassy; and after days of President Carter doing nothing  but begging for them to let our people go, they realized that we were  not going to do anything, and so they began to say: We have the  hostages.   I always thought at the time, paying close attention to the news back  in those days, that by saying the students did this that the Iranian  leaders were giving themselves a back door if we had had a President  who had put his foot down and said: Either you get them released, or we  are going to come get them released ourselves; and if they are harmed,  Iran will pay heavily.   I felt that was probably where they would say: Hey, we got them from  the students. Here they are.   But that was the first clue after Vietnam that we were still a paper  tiger. That is the way we were portrayed around the world. That is what  we in the Army heard back in those days: Gee, all you have to do is  drag out confrontation like Vietnam and they will turn tail and run.   That appeared to be consistent with us doing nothing about our  Embassy, which, under international law, is American soil. It is  American property. It is American housing. It was attacked, and we  didn't do anything about it for a lengthy time, which sent the message  to the new leader in Iran, the Ayatollah Kohmeini, that we really were  paper tigers. We were toothless. There was no power, no courage, and it  encouraged them.                                time  2130    In fact, there was one effort at a rescue but, unfortunately, the  military's hands were tied by people at the top.   I was told by a friend in the Army back at the time that the White  House was the one that had them cut back the number of helicopters that  would go into the desert across, around 500 miles or so of desert, with  turbine engines in the helicopters. And they knew, as my friend,  General Boykin has confirmed, they had to get six to the landing area.  Otherwise, it was an abort. And when it was clear only 5 were going to  make it, that the mission was aborted.   The helicopter pilot may have gotten vertigo. The helicopter tilted.  The blade went through a C-130 that was there to equip them for the  trip in to rescue our hostages, and Americans were killed and left  there in the desert at the staging area.   If there had been an adequate number of helicopters allowed to go in,  they would have had sufficient number of six or more to make it. But  the number going in was cut back, I was told, by the White House. They  didn't want it to look like an invasion.   I am proud we have got a President that is not worried about it. I  mean, I have asked him about this before, and he is more concerned  about protecting our American treasure, our American military members;  and he wants to commit whatever our military needs to get the job done.  That is a far cry from where we were in the late 1970s.   In fact, I do recall President Carter, he had turned his back on the  Shah. It didn't sound like the Shah was a great person, a great  humanitarian at all, but at least Iran and the area were not at war  with us at that time.   But when President Carter turned his back on the Shah, it opened the  door for him to be overthrown. Apparently, people in the Carter White  House did not give adequate thought to what happens when the Shah is  gone, because what happened was the Ayatollah Khomeini.   And President Carter, as I recall, welcomed the Ayatollah Khomeini  back in charge of Iran--he had not been in charge before--but welcomed  him back to Iran, and proclaimed he was a man of peace. It could not  have been a more ignorant welcome to the man that would start Iran on  the course to be the greatest source of terrorism in the world.   So thank you very much to the Carter administration. Great job. You  brought in, allowed in people who have continued to kill Americans at a  rate greater than anybody else.   They have helped Afghanistan. That was a shock when we found that  out. They have helped Sunnis, they have helped Shia. And normally, that  doesn't happen, but they are so dedicated to destroying the Great  Satan, America, in their view, and destroying the Little Satan, Israel,  that we have to take them seriously. Too many Americans have been  killed as a result of ignorance or optimism unjustified.   But this is a study done from the Jerusalem Center for Public  Affairs, a very good study done, and it gives us a lot of information  about Iran. It points out that Iranian military action, often working  through proxies, uses terrorist tactics; has led to the death of well  over 1,000 American soldiers in Iraq and  [[Page H144]]  Afghanistan over the last decade and a half.   They point out that the explosively formed penetrators--a lot of  people are familiar with the IEDs, but these are EFPs, explosively  formed penetrators, a shaped charge designed to penetrate armor--that  these are often camouflaged as rocks and were identical to those  employed by Hezbollah against Israeli forces.   In 2006, the British Telegraph revealed that three Iranian factories  were mass producing the roadside EFP bombs used to kill soldiers in  Iraq.   In 2007, American troops discovered over 100 Austrian-made Steyr HS  .50, 50-caliber sniper rifles, in Iraq. They can pierce all in-service  body armor from up to a mile and penetrate U.S. armored Humvee troop  carriers.   I fired a 50-caliber sniper rifle at Quantico. It is amazing how  powerful they are.   But, unfortunately, they were found in Iraq, and they had apparently  come from an Austrian manufacturer, but they were bought by Iran, and  supplied by Iran, apparently, to Iraq to help kill American soldiers.   Iran also paid Taliban fighters $1,000 for each U.S. soldier they  killed in Afghanistan. In fact, the Sunni Times reported that a Taliban  operative received $18,000 from an Iranian firm in Kabul as reward for  an attack in 2010 that killed several Afghan government troops and  destroyed an American armored vehicle.   Iranian President Rouhani's so-called moderation, was displayed when  he appointed Brigadier General Hossein Dehghan to be minister of  defense. He had played a key role in the October 1983 suicide bomb  attacks in Beirut, in which 241 U.S. Marines and 58 French paratroopers  were killed.   And of course, Dehghan, apparently was replaced previously, in 1998  with a guy named Soleimani, who is with us perhaps in spirit only now,  thanks to our current President and the ability of our United States  military.   Anti-Americanism helped fuel the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran, a  violent anti-American doctrine that challenges any role for America in  the Middle East, it has been, and remains the central focus of Iranian  foreign policy.   Since the revolution, Iran has waged and continues to wage war  against the United States and its allies. Unfortunately, though, Iran  has been at war with the United States for 40 years now, since 1979,  for sure--well, really, since the Ayatollah took over and President  Carter welcomed him as a man of peace. He has not been a man of peace.  He has been at war with the United States.   The report points out the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, IRGC-- people hear that term quite a bit, but that was founded by Ayatollah  Khomeini shortly after the overthrow of the Shah at the onset of the  Islamic Revolution in 1978-79.   Iran's RGC has morphed from its initial, mainly ideological,  composition into a particularly powerful organ of Iran's political  system, the upper echelons of which tend to be drawn from the ranks of  the IRGC. They are developing an increasing lethal system such as  advanced naval mines, coastal defense, anti-ship cruise and ballistic  missiles and attack craft.    The IRGC boasts a paramilitary unit comprised of 10 to 20,000  individuals known as the Quds Force. That was what Soleimani commanded  and was using strategically, killing Americans, as many as he could.   The strategic objective of the IRGC-QF is to subvert Iran's enemies  and export the Iranian Revolution, a goal it attains largely by  facilitating the delivery of weapons to pro-Iranian factions in  Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, Persian Gulf States, Gaza, the West Bank,  Afghanistan, and central Asia.   In 2007, the Treasury Department designated IRGC-QF as a terrorism- supporting entity.   The report is quite extensive. It goes on to point out many of the  efforts, successful efforts to kill Americans, talking about the Khobar  Towers in 1996 and many other attacks.   But it points out that in 1998, Major General Qasem Soleimani has led  the IRGC-QF, in which time he has created branches focused on  intelligence, finance, politics, sabotage and special operations. With  a direct independent channel to Khomeini, Soleimani has successfully  sought the assassination of political rivals, armed terrorist proxies,  and directed a network of insurgent groups in Iraq that killed over  1,000 Americans. And that is just in Iraq. But we know more regarding  what they have done in Afghanistan, in Lebanon, in Syria.   Mr. Speaker, I see I am joined by my friend, who has served his  country honorably and well and made his way up to the rank of general.  He knows a great deal about war in Iraq and Afghanistan.   I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).    In fact, it took me too long to get around to reading  Winston Churchill's books on World War II, but he points out that when  Hitler first moved into the Sudetenland, they were so disorganized that  it was a disaster, that if there had been any resistance put up at all  instead of Chamberlain waving a piece of paper that this means peace in  our time and we are going to let him go in and move in and take over  this land, that if there had been any resistance at all because of all  the material breakdowns, mechanical failures--Hitler was furious.   He said any resistance would have caused the defeat of the Germans  moving in, and then the Germans would have been humiliated. They would  have, in all likelihood, gotten rid of Hitler because he got too  ambitious and exposed them to defeat. He would have been gone, and the  world would have been spared the tens of millions of people who died as  a result of trying to placate the man.   Just supporting what my friend the Congressman is pointing out, it  doesn't usually work well, and it hasn't worked well. I know there are  people who say all we were doing was giving Iran their money back when  we gave them all that money. Money is fungible. We say maybe that  specific money enabled them to continue supporting Hezbollah and  terrorists who would attack and kill Americans.    Mr. Speaker, I have an article here from January 2017,  and the title from The Guardian is ``America dropped 26,171 bombs in  2016. What a bloody end to Obama's reign.''   I remember specifically because I had been to Libya, but as our  Defense Secretary Bob Gates said in a live interview, Libya is not in  our vital interest. We didn't have a real dog in that fight is what I  am saying.   In fact, Qadhafi did have blood on his hands. He wasn't a good guy.  But since the U.S. went into Iraq, he opened his doors and said: You  tell me what weapons I can keep. I won't pursue nukes anymore.   He had not been a problem for us from that time forward, yet  President Obama, without any authority from here, decides basically to  go to war with Libya and with Qadhafi and dropping bombs on them. Why?  Because he said NATO needs us to do this.    I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.    There was no strategy in Libya other than to take out  Qadhafi. Just like President Carter turning his back on the Shah and  welcoming Ayatollah Khomeini in, when President Obama took out Qadhafi  and, yes, he bombed him into oblivion.   We have seen reports that Qadhafi was begging, look, we will just go  into exile, and he sent word to the President, if you will just let me  leave in peace, I won't ever come back to Libya. Let's leave the  country not destroyed, stop the bombing, and I will just leave, but  never heard back from Washington.   The problem is that President Obama created a failed state in Libya,  and it has been the source of destabilizing all of North Africa. I  don't know if there is any Member of Congress who has been allowed to  have 2\1/2\ hours with the head of intelligence in Egypt as I have, but  Egypt is paying heavily for President Obama's wrongheadedness in taking  out Qadhafi and completely destabilizing North Africa.     Actually, President Obama had our forces, NATO forces,  but they were American. They bombed his convoy as he was leaving Libya.  That allowed the locals--    Then he was assassinated there.    In criminal terms, he was certainly an accessory. He  could not have been killed without President Obama's help.    Yes, it was, but only on one side of the aisle, and that  was this side because we were okay with President Obama defending  Americans and American interests. But as Bob Gates said, that did not  include Libya. Now, he walked that back some, but it was clear it was  not in our vital interests.   What really got me, though, is I am hearing so many people who were  here back then. They didn't offer one peep about the illegality of what  President Obama was doing. Many of us did, but they didn't say a word.  And that was outside our interests.   Killing Soleimani, that was protecting American lives. Going after  Qadhafi didn't protect any American lives, and in fact, it has caused  total disruption.    I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.    No.    No.    Right.    Back to Libya momentarily, what President Obama did cost  American lives, including at Benghazi. If he doesn't decide  unilaterally whether NATO wanted it or not, he decided for America  without any consent from Congress to go to war with Libya to take out  their leader. It destabilized the country. It put American lives at  risk that were not at that time, and it actually cost American lives.   I have an article here, and I have seen on Facebook some comments,  but an ``Iranian American activist outraged by `propaganda machine'  glorifying Soleimani.''   There are so many Iranians who are speaking up now going: What is  wrong with you people? This guy was a terrorist. He was killing  Iranians. He was killing Americans. He was just merciless.    I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.    It really is, and it is just a shame that at a time when  we ought to come together because, unlike Libya, we do have an interest  in protecting American lives. We do have an interest in stopping people  who want to destroy America. We ought to be united on this.   This is not a time to come in and try to condemn and belittle the  President who did a good thing in taking out a terrorist.   One other thing, I don't remember anybody on the other side of the  aisle here that made a peep when the President of the United States,  President Obama, gave the order to kill al-Awlaki and his 16-year-old  son. So al-Awlaki, he was an American citizen. Why, because his parents  came over on a visa, a student visa, had him, took him back, and taught  him to hate America, but he got an American passport. He is an American  citizen.   He had worked with some in the Obama administration, apparently  worked with some in the Bush administration. But he was really an enemy  of America.   President Obama gave the order not to take out a terrorist like  Soleimani, who was in the process of stirring up terrorism and killing  Americans, but this was an American citizen, and he gave the order to  take him out with a drone strike, take out his 16-year-old son.  Regardless of what al-Awlaki had done, his son was not a criminal, but  President Obama just ordered him taken out and not one word from the  other side of the aisle.   I would have thought we could have come together on that: Wait,  before we take out American citizens, should we give them a trial or  should we just let a President decide?    Now, I was okay with somebody that they had the evidence and that was  in the process of being at war with us, but for heaven's sake, the  people didn't raise not one peep about that.    I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.    Well, the media helped them out. This is just an  incredible time, and it is a time when free people ought to be able to  come together and unite together in the cause of freedom.   As Natan Sharansky pointed out, people didn't think he and his wife  would be getting back together after he was released from prison in  Russia because she was more religious and he wasn't, and he said that  is ridiculous. I got along with the guy for 12 years in my cell, and  the only thing we had in common was a desire for freedom. That ought to  bring us together here.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 10 p.m.), the House  adjourned  [[Page H147]]  until tomorrow, Friday, January 10, 2020, at 9 a.m.                            ____________________
