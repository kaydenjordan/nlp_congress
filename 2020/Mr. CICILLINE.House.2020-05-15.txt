 Mr. Speaker, there has been a lot of discussion this  morning about the HEROES Act as a political agenda. It is an agenda for  the people of this country, providing economic relief to families who  are suffering with direct cash payments, providing resources to protect  our heroes on the front lines who are risking their lives to protect  us, providing desperately needed money to cities and States to  [[Page H2232]]  protect against tax increases at the State and local level to make up  for revenue losses, expanding testing and treatment to defeat this  pandemic, supporting hospitals at the center of this crisis, and rental  and mortgage assistance for those struggling with these payments.   So the question is: This the agenda for the people. The real question  is why is it not your agenda?   This is about responding in a comprehensive way to the hurt and  devastation this pandemic is causing. You ought to join us in this  effort. The American people need action now, and they need your support  on this legislation.   Vote ``yes'' on the HEROES Act.
