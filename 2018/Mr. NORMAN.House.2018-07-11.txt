 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of one of my  hometown's finest. The founder and owner of Rock Hill, South Carolina's  iconic PW's Ice Cream, Mr. Philip W. Holmes, Jr. has passed away at the  age of 82.   For 25 years, PW's has served our community proudly. Following his  service in the Marine Corps and his experience in the hospitality  industry, Mr. Holmes took the risk every business owner does and opened  PW's in 1993. It was named after his two sons, Philip III and Wayne. He  believed that ice cream was one of the greatest ways to bring families  together.   After his passing, both of his sons continue his legacy at PW's. You  can now find the phrase, ``Dad got his wings'' on the store's sign.   Philip Holmes, Jr. will be remembered by our community for giving  every scoop with a smile. He was a great South Carolinian, and he was a  great American.                            ____________________
