Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                time  1215                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, we are here to debate the rule providing for  consideration of H.R. 2494, the Protect Our Law enforcement with  Immigration Control and Enforcement Act of 2023, or the POLICE Act;  H.R. 3091, the Federal Law Enforcement Officer Service Weapon Purchase  Act; and H. Con. Res. 40, expressing support for local law enforcement  officers and condemning efforts to defund or dismantle local law  enforcement agencies.   It provides for structured rules for all three bills and makes in  order Democratic as well as Republican amendments.   Given all that our police officers do for our communities each and  every day, I am honored to stand here in defense of this legislation to  support them.   According to the FBI, assaults on law enforcement officers increased  by 11.2 percent from 2020 to 2021. Many of these violent crimes have  been committed by illegal aliens. As this administration continues to  let the crisis at the border spiral out of control, these types of  assaults will continue to increase.   There are things we can do to deter criminal assaults and protect our  officers. The POLICE Act would amend the Immigration and Nationality  Act to clearly state that the assault of a law enforcement officer is a  deportable offense. If those who have been given the privilege of  coming here cannot respect our laws or those who enforce them,  [[Page H2361]]  they should not enjoy the benefit of remaining in our country.   The second bill under consideration today, H.R. 3091, would allow law  enforcement officers to buy retired and surplus military service  weapons at fair market value, so long as the officer is in good  standing with their employed agency. Under current law, Federal law  enforcement agencies are required to destroy retired and unneeded  firearms. The Fraternal Order of Police estimates that this wastes up  to $8 million a year. This bill is a commonsense solution to save  taxpayer dollars and support law enforcement officers.   Finally, H. Con. Res. 40 expresses Congress' support for local law  enforcement officers and condemns efforts to defund or dismantle local  law enforcement agencies.   Unfortunately, because there are people out there, even some serving  in Congress, who want to defund the police and want to continue the  anti-law enforcement rhetoric, this bill is necessary.   In a time when police officers are regularly attacked for their  profession, 2021 being the deadliest year in two decades for law  enforcement officers, according to the FBI, it can never be stated  enough that the U.S. Congress supports this country's police officers.   The brave men and women across this Nation who risk their lives every  day need to know that we condemn any efforts to defund them, and we  support them. They need to know that we stand with them and are here to  do everything in our power to protect them in the way they protect and  serve our communities. That is why I encourage my colleagues to stand  with me and support these pieces of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues not to make  excuses about this legislation, not to say that it doesn't have this,  it has this, or you changed this because they are playing word games.   The public is watching, and law enforcement officers are watching.  Today, with your ``yes'' vote on this legislation, you can show your  support for law enforcement.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Reschenthaler).    Mr. Speaker, I have to mention again, we have  legislation in front of us that will honor our law enforcement  officers. When we go off on tangents and talk about what words are  there and what words are not there, the simple fact is, a ``yes'' vote  on this legislation will show our support for law enforcement.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs.  Houchin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I have a much easier way for the other side to deal with  the debt ceiling. Instead of the procedural antics we are going  through, maybe what they should do is encourage the President and the  Senate leaders to get to the table and negotiate.   The House Republicans did their job. We passed a debt ceiling bill  with spending cuts and an increase off of this floor. We have done our  job. I think the real message here is National Police Week. That is  what we are talking about. We are talking about the support and respect  for our law enforcement officers.   I just want to maybe bring it back to what we are really talking  about. I, unfortunately, have had the unfortunate honor to have three  officers lost in the line of duty in my area, and so I would remember  those names: Officer Brian Klinefelter, Officer Tommy Decker, and  Officer Josh Owen. Officer Owen was just a few weeks ago.   Present in the Capitol yesterday was Officer Arik Matson, who was  shot 3 years ago in the line of duty and survived. Let's talk about  that. Let's talk about the officers that we are honoring.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Langworthy).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Norman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Roy).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Rutherford).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I am honored to be here today to support this rule and this  legislation to make sure we honor our law enforcement and that we are  moving forward.   This is a completely different agenda from the legislation that my  Democratic colleagues were advancing at this time in the 117th Congress  last year. By this time 2 years ago, Democrats had already passed  legislation that would have removed qualified immunity for police  officers acting in good faith, voted to restrict policing methods that  keep officers safe, and supported investigations into departments that  insinuated that police officers are racists and white supremacists.   Today, House Republicans are changing the narrative and standing up  for law and order and for those who enforce it. If my Democratic  colleagues don't think this matters, then they clearly are still not  listening to what the law enforcement community needs.   Today, they have the opportunity to show their support for law  enforcement.   The defund the police movement has been disastrous in the areas that  have tried it, emboldening criminals. Cities like Minneapolis and San  Francisco have seen dramatic increases in crime, and residents and  businesses alike are fleeing in droves.   Crime is skyrocketing throughout the country, and the lack of respect  for law enforcement in this country also means fewer people are willing  to enter the profession. This needs to change, and we in Congress can  pass legislation like the bills today that support our police officers  and show them their sacrifices and services are appreciated.   It is time for leaders to stand up for law enforcement and stop the  anti-police rhetoric. I ask my colleagues on the other side to join  with us in supporting and honoring law enforcement by voting for this  rule today and supporting the legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I support the underlying legislation, and I urge all  Members to do so.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.
