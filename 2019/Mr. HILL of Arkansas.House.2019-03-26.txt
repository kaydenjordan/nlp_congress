 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Kansas for  yielding. I appreciate him organizing an opportunity to come to the  House floor and talk about this important issue.   As the father of two children, I have been committed to policies for  a safe and enduring future for all kids and understand that we have to  ensure the protection of kids no matter what their walk in life,  particularly those with developmental disabilities.   Mr. Speaker, over 200,000 in the United States live with Down  syndrome, and one in 792 babies is born with this genetic disorder.  While there have been great advances in medical research and public  policy to enhance the lives of those affected by Down syndrome, there  is still much work to be done.   Individuals with disabilities face many challenges, and I understand  the need to ensure access to vital services and medical equipment to  support independent and active lives. This is critical to help  effectively live with Down syndrome. Getting our kids the proper  development path at a young age helps them ensure they will be  healthier adults with a bright future.   For over 20 years, I have watched with such pleasure young people  begin to build that proper developmental path at Access Academy in  Little Rock or Easter Seals Academy at Riverdale.   As a former member of the board of directors of Arkansas Children's  Hospital, I saw firsthand how important it was that parents are given  the tools they need to keep their children healthy. This is  particularly important for families who have a child with a disability.   Back in 1990, President George H. W. Bush signed the ADA into law,  the Americans with Disabilities Act. I was proud to have been working  on President Bush's staff at that time. It was an amazing piece of  legislative work that brought this Congress together and that has  benefited thousands and millions of Americans and families since.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to build upon that  legislation so that all Americans can reach their full potential, no  matter what challenges they face. I will continue to support efforts  that provide services to individuals and families who are impacted by  Down syndrome.   Regardless of political ideology, I think we can all agree that every  single child deserves protection. When I think about the kids over the  past two decades whom I have watched grow up, who had incredibly  nurturing parents who got them on that developmental path in the right  way, who sacrificed so that they had that opportunity to talk about  what my colleague did, the pursuit of happiness, and I see them smiling  at workplaces when I visit in Conway, North Little Rock, and Little  Rock, that they have a job, that they are out working, that they have  that self-sufficiency and excitement of the work they do, it gives me  such a warm feeling to see their success with all the hard work they  have put into that pursuit of happiness.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I have to say, and I don't think it should be  left unsaid today, that a right to abortion should not extend to  children with traits deemed undesirable or inconvenient. Would we throw  away a life so casually if a child had the wrong color eyes or off- texture hair? Of course not.   If a child does not fit the physical or developmental ideals of their  parents, they should be treated with the same degree of medical  attention, love, and care as any other child. As a proud Catholic and  proud pro-life Member of Congress, I believe we need to value life.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Kansas for hosting this important  event today to talk about Down syndrome, the love we have for our  American citizens who live with Down syndrome, and the affection we  have and support we have for their families.                                time  1545
