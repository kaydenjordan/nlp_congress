 Madam President, to date, America has lost nearly 150,000  people who have died with diseases related to coronavirus. We are  quickly approaching 5 million cases of infections in the United States  of America.   Consider this for a moment. The United States has 5 percent of the  world's population. Yet we have almost 25 percent of all the COVID  infections in the world. How did we reach this point that we have such  a rampant rate of infection in what is considered one of the most  developed nations on Earth?   Part of the problem is the President, who peddles worthless medical  advice, and part of the problem is that the Republican Senate has been  unwilling to face the economic hardships which have been created by  this pandemic on our economy.   It was 10\1/2\ weeks ago that the House of Representatives, under  Democratic control of Speaker Pelosi, passed the Heroes Act. That was  10\1/2\ weeks ago. They knew this day was coming--when the unemployment  benefits that we put in the original legislation would expire, as they  will this week, and the help for those who are renting to meet their  obligations would expire, as it did last week. So 10\1/2\ weeks ago,  Speaker Pelosi put on the table her proposal to deal with America after  these things occurred.   Today, on the floor of the Senate, Senator McConnell, the Republican  leader, called her efforts ``a looney ideological fantasy''--``a looney  ideological fantasy.'' The obvious question to Senator McConnell, who  is the leader of the majority here in the U.S. Senate, is, Where have  you been for the last 10\1/2\ weeks? Where is the Republican  alternative, the Republican substitute? Why have we not seen that come  forward and a real negotiation take place between the House and the  Senate?   For the longest time, Senator McConnell told us that he just did not  feel ``a sense of urgency'' to take up this matter. He did not feel a  sense of urgency. Well, history was made in the Senate Chamber this  last Monday, because Senator McConnell came to the floor and used the  word ``urgent.'' Finally, urgency is stirring in his loins, and he  announced this week a Republican alternative--but not quite. What he  announced was a series of bills to be introduced by the Republican  side--a series of bills. We are just days away from the situation where  these issues are expiring, such as unemployment assistance, and yet, in  this circumstance, we are dealing with the problem where we do not have  alternatives from the Republican side. Well, we have some. One was  addressed this morning, when it came to unemployment assistance.   Understand what happened last March 26 when we passed the CARES Act.  This bill passed 96 to nothing in the Senate Chamber--unanimous,  bipartisan. But when we sat down to establish the amount of money to be  [[Page S4558]]  given to unemployed workers in America, we ran into a problem--one we  didn't anticipate. The Secretary of Labor in the Trump administration,  Secretary Scalia, came to us and sat down at the table and said: You  have a lot of interesting formulas when it comes to unemployment  compensation, but just remember the reality. The reality is that 50  different States have 50 different computer systems, some of which are  very modern and up to speed and others which are ancient and not up to  speed. When you start coming up with complex Federal formulas for  sending money to unemployed workers in these States, you are going to  run into 50 different reactions. And that is exactly what we faced.   So the alternative was simple. We either gave a flat-dollar amount in  the unemployment benefit supplement or we just wondered what the States  might do with any other formula. So the decision was made--with the  White House, with the Republicans--for the $600 a week Federal  supplement to unemployment. There was argument on the floor that some  workers may come out ahead if that happens. Well, undoubtedly that  might be the case, because the Federal supplement was in addition to  whatever a person qualified for in State unemployment, and each State  has a different formula for State unemployment assistance, and each  worker has a different work experience and salary experience. But we  went forward, believing we needed to do something dramatic and  significant for the economy and the first place to start was with  unemployed workers. Economists will state that when you are facing a  recession, when there is a lack of consumer demand, the first dollar  you want to hand out as a government is to an unemployed worker. You  know they are going to spend it. They have to spend it to pay the rent  or the mortgage, to pay the utility bills, to put food on the table,  clothes on the kids, and to pay for health insurance. So we put money  into the economy, and it worked. We managed to slow the decline of the  economy, even though we see more unemployment still coming around. It  would have been much worse if we hadn't made this commitment and  invested in unemployment benefits.   So now, with the expiration of this Federal unemployment benefit  program on July 31, just a few days away, the question is, What will we  replace it with?   Democrats proposed in the Heroes Act in the House that we extend the  current program to the end of this year. That is certainly a direct way  to deal with this and one that would provide continuing assistance to  these families.   The Republicans have come up with a much different approach. What  they suggested is that we take the $600-a-week Federal supplement and  reduce it to $200 a week, and then by October 1, we require the States  to implement a program that would give the unemployed workers 70  percent of their last wage. They obviously ignored what Secretary  Scalia told us just a few months ago, and that is that the States would  run into a terrible challenge trying to meet this new Republican  standard of 70 percent of your last paycheck. We were told we couldn't  do that back in March.   Has the landscape changed so much when it comes to State computer  systems? I doubt it. I doubt it very much. In Illinois we have a good  system, but it has been dramatically overwhelmed by the Federal  supplemental payment and the new pandemic unemployment insurance and  other provisions that we passed in Washington. So to think that we  could move to a new formula in Illinois while meeting our current  obligations is very difficult in our State, which is more modern than  some.   Having said that, though, Republicans have argued that if by October  1 you can't provide 70 percent by formula to the unemployed workers, I  suppose they will go back to the $200 a week.   So what is behind this? What is at the heart of this? Well, there are  several things that I think need to be noted on the floor. Here is the  assumption. Listen to this. You have heard it over and over, and we  heard it again this morning--the assumption that has been made by the  Republicans in their approach to unemployment insurance.   They assume that if people are receiving $600 a week in a Federal  supplement to unemployment, that they are going to refuse to go back to  work, even when offered a job. They are making more money to stay home  than they did on the job; at least, that is what has been repeated over  and over again.   This morning, I would like to put in the Record an article from the  Yale News. This Yale study, which was just released this week, says:  The Yale study finds expanded jobless benefits did not reduce  employment. This is exactly the opposite of what we have heard over and  over again from the Republican side.   This report from Yale economists said as follows:         [It found] that workers receiving larger increases in       unemployment benefits experienced very similar gains in       employment by early May relative to workers with less-      generous benefit increases. People with more generously       expanded benefits also resumed working at a similar or       slightly quicker rate than others did, according to the       report.        The data do not show a relationship between benefit       generosity and employment paths after the CARES Act, which       could be due to the collapse of labor demand during the       COVID-19 crisis.    Put in simple terms, there aren't that many jobs out there looking  for workers, and as it turns out, some unemployed workers have gone  back to work, even though they might make slightly less than they did  under unemployment. Why? The reason is obvious. Unemployment is a  temporary benefit. Unemployment may not be as good and generous as what  a person has in the workplace when you count the benefits that come  with some jobs. Ultimately, many workers who are unemployed today want  to get back to work.   We should not assume, as some politicians do, that if a person is  unemployed, they must be lazy. With 30 million unemployed Americans,  that is hardly the case, and certainly when it comes to whether or not  people have the incentive to go back to work, I believe most Americans  do want to work. The notion that we have to change the whole system for  fear that some might not is definitely unfair.   Let me just say this, as we move forward with this. I see a colleague  on the floor seeking recognition in a few minutes. As we move forward  with this attempt to deal with the economy, we have to face the  reality, and the reality is, as made clear by the Chairman of the  Federal Reserve, that if we take our foot off the accelerator right  now, we are going to plunge it over the cliff in a deeper economic mess  than we are in today.   They are trying, by every means in monetary policy and the interest  rates, to enliven this economy and create an environment where it may  reopen soon. I hope that happens. But if we take the Republican  approach, a little bit of this and a little bit of that, it is not  going to work. We are going to find ourselves with a recession that is  even worse.   And for those deficit hawks, how badly do you think our deficit will  look if we face an even deeper recession? It is going to get worse and  dramatically so. Shouldn't our first obligation be to the workers  across America who have lost their jobs so they can keep their families  together? This notion of cutting the Federal benefit from $600 a week  to $200 a week, I can guarantee you, will mean much more traffic and  activity at the food pantries around America as these unemployed  families try to keep things together.   Then there is a proposal from the Republican side for a three-martini  lunch Federal tax break. A three-martini lunch--is that the way out of  our economic morass? And at the same time they are encouraging the  three-martini lunch Federal tax break, they will not give any  additional assistance to those who are receiving SNAP benefits--those  low-income Americans who are needing some help just to feed their  families. It seems that things are upside down.   The last point I will make is this. Senator McConnell has said  repeatedly for months: Nothing is going to happen in the Senate-- nothing--to help anybody in America, unless he gets his wish to give  immunity to American corporations from coronavirus lawsuits.   Finally, we get to see his proposal. It was released this week. I  want to tell you, it is the most dramatic tort reform proposal I have  seen since I have served in the U.S. Senate. It basically takes away  the rights of workers, as  [[Page S4559]]  well as those who are customers of businesses, from recovering under a  coronavirus lawsuit. It lowers the standard of care that is required of  businesses to a level which basically will not protect Americans who  face this pandemic across the country. At the same time, it is  providing assistance and relief, it is, unfortunately, creating an  environment where some businesses--some, unfortunately--will not be as  careful as they should be in the way they conduct their businesses with  customers and their employees. We know that we face a challenge here  with this pandemic, but giving this kind of corporate break when it  comes to immunity and liability only will make things more dangerous  for customers and employees across the United States of America.   Let me say a word about what has been said on the floor over and over  again by Senator Cornyn and Senator McConnell--the so-called tsunami of  lawsuits, the epidemic of frivolous lawsuits, the trial lawyers on  parade to the courthouse because of this pandemic. Well, we have  checked every lawsuit filed in the United States this year that  mentions the word ``coronavirus'' or ``COVID-19.'' Do you know how many  COVID medical malpractice cases have been filed so far this calendar  year with this so-called tsunami of lawsuits? Six. Six. And how many  consumer personal injury cases have been filed this year mentioning  ``COVID-19'' or ``coronavirus,'' this epidemic, this flood of lawsuits?  There are 15 across the entire United States of America. It is an  imaginary problem that they are creating at this point. We can deal  with it, and 28 States have already by changing their State laws, but  giving immunity to corporations from coronavirus lawsuits will not make  us safer, will not make the workplace safer for workers, or the  business safer for customers.   If we are going to restore consumer confidence, everybody has to pull  together. We ought to have standards established by the CDC based on  public health and not politics. And businesses--conscientious  businesses, I am sure, will follow those standards because they do  care. Currently, we don't have these standards, and this effort will  make it even less likely that we will.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Yale News article  dated July 27, 2020 be printed in the Record   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     [From the YaleNews, July 27, 2020]    Yale Study Finds Expanded Jobless Benefits Did Not Reduce Employment                             (By Mike Cummings)         A new report by Yale economists finds no evidence that the       enhanced jobless benefits Congress authorized in March in       response to the COVID-19 pandemic reduced employment.        The report (PDF) (https://tobin.yale.edu/sites/default/ files/files/C-19% 20Articles/CARES-UI identification       vF(1).pdf) addresses concerns that the more generous       unemployment benefits, which provide $600 per week above       state unemployment insurance payments, would disincentivize       work.        The researchers assessed this claim using weekly data from       Homebase (https://joinhomebase.com/), a company that provides       scheduling and timesheet software to small businesses       throughout the United States. The findings suggest that, in       the aggregate, the expanded benefits neither encouraged       layoffs during the pandemic's onset nor deterred people from       returning to work once businesses began reopening.        The enhanced unemployment benefits were initiated under the       CARES Act, a $2.2 trillion economic stimulus package enacted       on March 27 that attempted to ease the pandemic's severe       economic consequences. The expanded benefits, which are set       to expire July 31, provide a $600 weekly payment in addition       to any state unemployment insurance. The supplemental payment       was designed to cover 100% of the average U.S. wage when       combined with existing unemployment benefits. The generosity       of an individual's unemployment benefits depends on several       factors, including their earnings history and their state's       schedule of benefits.        The report found that workers receiving larger increases in       unemployment benefits experienced very similar gains in       employment by early May relative to workers with less-      generous benefit increases. People with more generously       expanded benefits also resumed working at a similar or       slightly quicker rate than others did, according to the       report.        ``The data do not show a relationship between benefit       generosity and employment paths after the CARES Act, which       could be due to the collapse of labor demand during the       COVID-19 crisis,'' said Joseph Altonji (https:// economics.yale.edu/people/faculty/joseph-altonji), the Thomas       DeWitt Cuyler Professor of Economics in the Faculty of Arts       and Sciences, and a co-author of the report.        Critics argued that the expanded benefits, which exceeded       many people's normal weekly wages, would incentivize       businesses to lay off workers to cut costs and disincentivize       recipients from returning to work. If the enhanced benefits       had these effects, the researchers said, the data should show       a significant drop in employment in the week after the CARES       Act took effect; it should also show subsequent decreases in       relative employment as workers with more generous       unemployment benefits put off returning to work. The data did       not yield results that support these predictions.        The researchers found no evidence that recipients of more       generous benefits were less likely to return to work. They       also found that workers who received larger increases in       their unemployment benefits relative to their wages did not       experience greater declines in employment after the CARES Act       was enacted.        The Homebase data primarily covers small businesses that       require time clocks for day-to-day operations. The majority       are restaurants, bars, or retail operations. The workers       represented in the dataset are hourly employees who earn       relatively low wages. While the data does not represent the       entire U.S. labor market, it captures a segment of it that       has been disproportionately affected by the pandemic, the       researchers noted.        The analysis controlled for the severity of the COVID-19       pandemic and for the various restrictions that states imposed       on businesses during the public health crisis. The       researchers tested their results against employment outcomes       in the federal government's Current Population Survey, a more       representative sample of the labor market than the Homebase       data, and obtained similar findings. But they stress that       their results pertain to the current pandemic period of slack       labor demand and do not speak directly to the effects of       unemployment benefits on employment during normal times.
