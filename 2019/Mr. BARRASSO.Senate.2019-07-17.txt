 Mr. President, I come to the floor today to once again  give the facts about the Democrats' one-size-fits-all healthcare  proposal, the legislation that many Democrats are referring to as  Medicare for All.   My focus today is what is going to happen to American patients if the  government takes full control of our Nation's healthcare system. I  speak as a doctor who practiced medicine for 24 years in Casper, WY. It  is so interesting, as a doctor, to take a look at what is being  proposed because I know the specifics of the impacts on the lives of  patients, patients I have taken care of as part of my training and part  of my practice in Wyoming, and as a doctor, I have personally studied  what is happening to healthcare in other countries around the world.   You have no doubt heard about the worsening crisis of care in  England. There are doctor shortages, and, of course, there is rationing  of care. British rationing has actually become the focus of a recent  article in the magazine, The Economist. The article is entitled, ``The  front line of England's NHS is being reinvented.'' It says, ``A  shortage of family doctors leaves little choice but to try something  new.''   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this article printed  in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:  [[Page S4881]]                                 [From The Economist]            The Front Line of England's NHS Is Being Reinvented   A shortage of family doctors leaves little choice but to try something                                    new         The National Health Service is free, so it is also       rationed. Family doctors, known as general practitioners       (GPs), act as the first port of call for patients; friendly       gatekeepers to the rest of the service who refer people to       specialists only if needed. But in some parts of the country,       including St Austell on the Cornish coast, access to the       rationers is itself now rationed. ``You can't book an       appointment to see me here,'' explains Stewart Smith, a 39-      year-old GP, one of a team in charge of an innovative new       medical centre. ``You go on a list and then we triage you.''        It is an approach that will soon be familiar to more       patients. Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, has       said that being a GP is arguably the most important job in       the country. There is, however, a severe shortage of them.       According to the Nuffield Trust, a think-tank, there are 58       GPs per 100,000 people, down from 66 in 2009--the first       sustained fall since the 1960s. Only half of patients say       they almost always see their preferred doctor, down from 65%       six years ago. The average consultation lasts just nine       minutes, among the quickest in the rich world.        Although the NHS hopes to train and recruit new family       doctors, the gap won't be plugged any time soon. A new five-      year contract to fund GP practices will eventually include       K891m ($1.1bn) a year for 20,000 extra clinical staff, such       as pharmacists and physiotherapists, with the first cash for       such roles arriving on July 1st. To access the money,       practices will have to form networks which, it is hoped, will       help them take advantage of economies of scale and do more to       prevent illnesses rather than merely treating them.        When the four practices serving St Austell merged in 2015,       it was an opportunity to reconsider how they did things. The       GPs kept a diary, noting precisely what they got up to during       the day. It turned out that lots could be done by others:       administrators could take care of some communication with       hospitals, physios could see people with bad backs and       psychiatric nurses those with anxiety. So now they do. Only       patients with the most complicated or urgent problems make it       to a doctor. As a result, each GP is responsible for 3,800       locals, compared with an average of 2,000 in the rest of       Cornwall.        Although few practices have made changes on the scale of St       Austell Healthcare, across England the number of clinical       staff other than GPs has grown by more than a third since       2015. The logic behind the introduction of these new roles is       compelling, says Ben Gershlick of the Health Foundation,       another think-tank. The NHS estimates that 30% of GPs' time       is spent on musculoskeletal problems, for instance, which       could often be handled by a physiotherapist. Another estimate       suggests 11% of their day is taken up by paperwork. Doctors       complain that they are overworked, and growing numbers retire       early. They are also expensive: the starting salary for a GP       is K57,655, whereas a physio costs around half as much.        NHS leaders hope the new workers will help practices play a       more active role in their community, linking up with services       provided by local authorities and charities. Each network       will be responsible for a population of 30,000-50,000. The       plan is that they will use data analysis to intervene early       to prevent illness, and that practices will often share the       new staff with others in their network.        Those that are further down the road sing the benefits of       the new approach. Caroline Taylor of the Beechwood Medical       Centre in Halifax says that new roles quickly show their       worth. Her practice took in a ``work wellness adviser''       employed by the council. The adviser's goal was to help ten       people over the age of so with poor mental health back to       work in a year--a task which she completed in just six weeks.       In St Austell two pharmacists last year helped to cut more       than K140,000 from prescribing costs. Far fewer staff now       report that they are burnt out.        Working in a team will nevertheless require a big shift in       mindset for many doctors, particularly those in surgeries       that have never before employed anyone else aside from the       odd nurse. One worry is that practices will end up doing what       they must to get the extra funding, but little more. There       are also more practical problems. Seven in ten GPs say their       practices are too cramped to provide new services, and it is       not clear where some of the extra staff will be hired from.        Perhaps the biggest problem is that patients have grown       used to having a doctor on demand. Although those who no       longer have to queue for an appointment may be happy, others       might feel fobbed off if diverted to another clinician. A       study published last year by Charlotte Paddison of the       Nuffield Trust, and colleagues, in the British Medical       Journal found that patients had less trust in the care       provided by a nurse if they initially expected to see a       doctor. Patients who have a close relationship with their GP       tend to be more satisfied and enjoy better health outcomes       than others.        But other evidence suggests that, for some conditions,       nurses provide care that is as good as or better than that       provided by GPs. The aim, says Nav Chana of the National       Association of Primary Care, which helped develop the new       approach, is therefore to use small teams of doctors and       other clinical staff to replicate the sort of relationship       with patients that used to be more common. Just parachuting       in ``a lot of people who look like doctors'' will not raise       standards, he warns.        The shortage of GPs leaves the NHS with little choice but       to try something new. ``A lot of the world has either copied       or is trying to copy English primary care,'' in particular       its openness to all and the continuity of care that it       provides, says Dr. Chana. Keeping these strengths, while       changing how primary care works, is the task NHS officials       are now facing up to. Even if they succeed, it will take time       for the public to adjust. Having explained the benefits of       the new way of doing things, one GP pauses, before adding:       ``I should say, though, patients don't love it.''     Mr. President, the story opens with a simple  observation, and this is the first sentence: ``The national health  service is free, so it is also rationed.''   That is what we are seeing, and that is what people are living with  every day in Britain. Under the guise of healthcare being free, they  live in a world where healthcare is rationed.   So how bad can that be? What would this mean with this one-size-fits- all Medicare for All, which the Democrats are proposing?   The Economist writes that in Britain today ``[o]nly patients with the  most complicated or urgent problems make it to a doctor.'' Actually,  today you need a doctor's referral to see a specialist in England. But  now, in some parts of the country, a British bureaucrat must preapprove  your visit to the family doctor, who will then make the referral to the  specialist. I can't imagine people in our country tolerating that. So,  ironically, ``access to the rationers is itself now rationed.''  According to the article, ``Only half of [British] patients say they  almost always get to see their preferred doctor.'' So only half get to  see the doctor they choose.    Remember that old line--``If you like your healthcare, you can keep  it. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.'' In Britain,  only half get to see their doctor--if they get to see them, if they get  to go through the rationer, who is a bureaucrat.   What happens after you wade through all of this, wade through the  morass of the bureaucrat and the family doctor to get to the  specialist? What does the article say about when you actually get to  see a doctor? The average consultation time, it says, is only 9  minutes. It is 9 minutes on average. As a doctor, I can state that 9  minutes is one of the shortest consults I have ever heard of. I cannot  imagine 9 minutes--after waiting all of this time to see the doctor, 9  minutes and then you are done, and they are on to the next patient, who  has also been waiting and waiting and waiting to see the doctor.   What does this tell us about what would happen in the United States  to patients trying to see doctors if we followed this one-size-fits- all, government-run healthcare program that Senator Sanders and so many  of the Democrats are supporting? If we adopt a government-run, one- size-fits-all healthcare system, which is what they are proposing, I  would tell Americans to expect to pay more to wait longer for worse  care. That is what we would see. To borrow the line from The Economist,  bureaucrats will, as they say, reinvent what healthcare means for you.   You may have seen the stories about the thousands of elderly patients  right now going blind in Britain--going blind. Why are they going  blind? Well, because the British health service is rationing eye  surgery. The president of the Royal College of Ophthalmologists has  said that the rationing is part of the government's cost-cutting in  England, and people are going blind as a result. Thousands of elderly  patients are desperately in need of eye surgery, but the bureaucrats  who must approve it are denying the treatment. The number of denials  has doubled in the last 2 years.   According to the Royal College of Surgeons, a quarter of a million  British patients have been waiting more than 6 months for planned  medical treatment. That is happening in England today. The waiting  times are getting longer.   Now let's look at Canada. According to the New York Times, Senator  Bernie Sanders likes the Canadian healthcare system because he says it  is ``free.'' Of course, Senator Sanders  [[Page S4882]]  knows it is anything but free. After all, the healthcare proposal that  Senator Sanders is proposing has a $32 trillion price tag. The Senator  admits the plan hikes taxes on middle-class families. He said it in the  debate the other night. The truth is, even doubling our taxes couldn't  cover this huge cost. Yet a majority of Democrats in the House of  Representatives--a majority--have cosponsored what Senator Sanders is  proposing. A majority of the Democratic Senators running for President  today have cosponsored Senator Sanders' one-size-fits-all proposal.  Apparently Senator Sanders approves of the Canadian long wait times  because he says wait times are not a problem. Well, maybe he should  check with the Canadians to see if wait times are a problem, because  patients in Canada typically wait 3 months for treatments and for  certain treatments, much, much longer. In some ways, the Canadian  healthcare system has been called trick-or-treat medicine because if  you haven't gotten your care by the end of October, by Halloween, you  will have to wait until next year because they will have run out of the  money allotted for that procedure or that healthcare in that country in  that year.   As a doctor practicing in Wyoming, I have actually operated on people  from Canada who came to the United States for care. It is free up in  Canada, but they couldn't afford to wait for the free care they were  going to get in Canada, so they came to the United States to pay for  the care here.   Still, that is what the Democrats are proposing--a one-size-fits-all  approach. So people will pay more through their taxes to wait longer  for care that will be worse care. Even the Congressional Budget Office  people who looked at this in terms of funding, looked at what it would  cost to do a Senator Sanders' style approach, said it would be  expensive, complicated, and the delays would be not just in treatment  but also in technology.   Many Democratic candidates for President have also endorsed-- amazingly so--free healthcare for illegal immigrants. You saw the  question being asked on the debate stage. Every one of the Democrats  running for President was standing there and was asked: Which one of  you would have in your healthcare plan free health insurance, free  healthcare, for people in this country illegally? And every hand on the  stage went up.   When you take a look at what the proposal actually is--this Medicare  for All, this one-size-fits-all approach--it actually takes health  insurance away from 100 million people who get it through work and  gives it to illegal immigrants. So 180 million American citizens will  lose their on-the-job insurance while illegal immigrants will get it  for free. That is the Democrats' Medicare for All proposal.   The Congressional Research Service recently reported that the Sanders  bill ends Medicare as well as on-the-job health insurance, and what we  will be doing is entering into one expensive, new, government-run  system.   Still, the Democratic Senators who are running for President and the  118 Democratic Members of the House support the Sanders' legislation.  They have cosponsored it, saying: Let the Washington, DC, bureaucrats  call the shots--unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats calling the shots  as they ration your care. They will micromanage your care, and they  will delay your care, delay your treatment--treatment that you urgently  need. That is the difference. People will lose the freedom to see their  own doctor. We have seen what has happened in England. Patients will  wait months for treatment. Keep in mind--care delayed is often care  denied, and if they finally get to see a physician, the amount of time  in consultation will be incredibly short. That is why what is being  proposed by the Democrats in this one-size-fits-all approach--a British  plan, a Canadian plan--is completely unacceptable to American citizens.   You don't need Democrats' phony promises of free care; what you need  is to have the freedom to get the care you want and need from a doctor  whom you choose at lower cost. That is why Republicans are going to  continue to work on real reforms that improve patient care, that  increase transparency, that lower the cost of care, and that lower the  cost of what people pay out of their own pockets, without adding these  incredibly longer wait times and the loss of the ability to make  choices on your own. Why should we pay more to wait longer for worse  care, which is what we are seeing with a one-size-fits-all approach?  Let's make sure patients can get the care they need from the doctor  they choose at lower costs.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today in celebration of Phil and  Jody Schmidt, the Boys and Girls Club of Central Wyoming's 2019  honorees.   Since 1978, the Boys and Girls Club of Central Wyoming has committed  itself to making a positive difference in the lives of children. Their  mission is to inspire all youth, especially those who need them most.  The goal is to help these children to reach their full potential as  productive, responsible, and caring citizens. Their activities provide  the children in our community a sense of dedication, purpose, and  belonging.   The Boys and Girls Club will host its annual awards and recognition  breakfast on August 28, 2019. This event celebrates the outstanding  efforts by individuals who have made remarkable and significant  contributions to the Boys and Girls Club mission and to the City of  Casper.   Phil and Jody Schmidt will be honored at this year's breakfast. Their  lifelong commitment toward bettering the lives of youth in the Casper  community is remarkable. Their dedication to Wyoming's young people  embodies the Boys and Girls Club of Central Wyoming's charge to better  the lives of children in Casper.   Phil is a devoted family man, successful businessman, and selfless  community member. After graduating from high school, Phil attended  Black Hills State University, earning a bachelor's degree in business  administration with an emphasis in accounting. Phil and Jody moved to  Casper in 1982, immersing themselves in the community. Phil began his  career as a CPA. In 1988, he became the president and owner of Greiner  Motor Companies. Under his guidance, Greiner Motors grew from one  dealership to three, employing almost 300 people. Phil received the  Ford Motor Company's ``Salute to Dealers'' award in 2009. The award  commends dealers ``exhibiting unparalleled dedication to their  communities.'' Phil was one of six recipients, selected from almost  6,000 dealers.   Remarkably, Phil's hard work and contributions to the Casper  community extend far beyond his business successes. Phil and the  employees of Greiner Motor Companies led a cleanup effort of Casper  Skate Park in 2004. Phil recognized a clean, safe park would give  Casper youth an area where they could safely socialize and develop  athletic skills. Greiner Motor Companies also helped to host the  ``Fill-A-Ford'' food drive, parking Ford pickups at various bank  branches to collect canned good and donations for food banks. They  raised $26,000 and collected enough canned goods to fill up three  pickup trucks.   Phil also devotes much of his time and energy serving on the boards  of many outstanding organizations. Any group lucky enough to have Phil  on its board is destined for success. The Boys and Girls Club of  Central Wyoming, Casper Family YMCA, Wyoming Medical Center, Wyoming  Auto Dealers, the Natrona County Library Foundation, and the Wyoming  Transportation Commission have all benefited from his servant  leadership. Phil credits Jody for his great success. Her support and  strength during times of both hardship and good fortune allowed Phil to  thrive with his ventures.   Jody is a dedicated mother and caring wife. Raised in Fruitdale, SD,  alongside five siblings, Jody learned the values of hard work and  community involvement from her parents. They ran the family's  beekeeping business, McIntire Honey. Her father, Russell, served on the  board of directors for their local hospital, delivered Meals on Wheels  to his neighbors in need, and served as a member and Grand Knight in  their local council of the Knights of Columbus. Her mother, Betty,  served in the local community club and was honored for her work as a  hospital auxiliary volunteer. Their values of kindness and generosity  were instilled in Jody, who then brought them to the Casper community.   Jody also supports their neighbors and community with volunteer work  and service efforts. She serves on the boards of the National Alliance  on Mental Issues and Interfaith of Natrona County. She volunteers at  Holy Cross Center with the food bank ministry and helps St. Anthony  Tri-Parish School in countless areas, including coordinating charity  runs and auction galas. Like my wife Bobbi, Jody is a strong, resilient  breast cancer survivor. She is a pillar of courage and perseverance.   Phil and Jody have been married 37 years and were blessed with six  children: Allyson, Madelyn, Reid, Evan, James, and Nathan. The family  persevered through tremendous pain; their sons Evan and Reid passed  away at the ages of 11 and 29, respectively. In the wake of this  tremendous personal challenge, Phil and Jody chose to continue their  commitment to others. They looked past their pain, turning tough times  into a means to assist and help care for those in need. They believe  their difficult experiences give them the ability to come alongside  others who face similar challenges. This mindset of perseverance  demonstrates just how deserving they are of this award.   There is no doubt the work and endless hours given by Phil and Jody  will continue to shape and improve countless lives for years to come.  Together, the couple represent Wyoming's characteristic strength,  resilience and determination. Their generosity is exceptional. In the  midst of enormous challenges the pair find the courage to not only push  on, but to help others do the same.   It is with great honor that I recognize these exceptional members of  our Wyoming community. My wife, Bobbi, joins me in extending our  congratulations to Phil and Jody Schmidt for this special  acknowledgement.                            ____________________
