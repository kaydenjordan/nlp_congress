 Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   On behalf of the Senator from New Mexico, Martin Heinrich, and  myself, I have a question to send to the desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question from Senator Merkley and other  Senators is for counsel to the President:         Please clarify your previous answer about the Bolton       manuscript. When, exactly, did the first person on the       President's defense team first learn of the allegations in       the manuscript? Secondly, Mr. Bolton's lawyer publicly       disputes that any information in the manuscript could       reasonably be considered classified. Was the determination to       block its publication on the basis that it contains       classified information made solely by career officials, or       were political appointees in the White House Counsel's       office, or elsewhere in the White House, involved?    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, to address your  question specifically, the allegation that came out in the New York  Times article about a conversation that is allegedly reported in the  manuscript between the President and Ambassador Bolton and officials,  lawyers in the White House Counsel's Office learned about that  allegation for the first time on Sunday afternoon when the White House  was contacted by the New York Times.   In terms of the classification review, it is conducted at the NSC.  The White House Counsel's Office is not involved in classification  review, determining what is classified or not classified.   I can't state the specifics. My understanding is that it is conducted  by career officials at the NSC, but it is handled by the NSC. I am not  in a position to give you full information on that. My understanding  is, it is being done by career officials. But it is not being done by  lawyers in the White House Counsel's Office.   I hope that answers your question, Senator.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from Alaska.
