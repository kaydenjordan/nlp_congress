 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize four police  officers from Middletown Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania. Officers  Ryan Morrison, Christopher Viscardi, Glenn McPherson, and Robert  Compton were recognized for their service during three separate cases  this year.   On April 5, Officers McPherson and Viscardi were in Doylestown,  Pennsylvania, to attend a court hearing. As they sat in their vehicle,  they noticed a man threatening to jump from the top of the Bucks County  Justice Center parking garage. Both officers quickly jumped into  action, and Officer McPherson calmed the man down while Officer  Viscardi contacted local law enforcement for assistance.   On June 16, Officer Compton was able to track down and detain the  suspect following two gas station robberies by the same suspect.   On July 2, Officer Morrison noticed a car tailgating him and flashing  high beams, which initiated a traffic stop. During that stop, Officer  Morrison found the driver was intoxicated and the passenger had several  warrants and was in possession of a firearm and narcotics.   Mr. Speaker, because of the actions of these brave officers and their  colleagues, Pennsylvania's First District is a safer place. We thank  these heroes for their service.                                time  1030                    In Recognition of Mason Chandler Allen     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Mason  Chandler Allen. A fellow native of Levittown, Pennsylvania, Mason was  an intelligent and thoughtful 11-year-old boy when he was diagnosed  with osteosarcoma, the most common form of bone cancer, in late 2015.   Through months of exhaustive chemotherapy, physical therapy, and  several surgeries, Mason was never without a smile or his amazing sense  of humor. He even got to hang out with his football idol, Philadelphia  Eagles' star Darren Sproles, at an Eagles practice, and later, on the  sideline of an Eagles game.   A year after homeschooling, Mason came back to school with the aid of  crutches, and was excited to join clubs, launch the school's newspaper,  and was soon able to leave the crutches behind. Following a holiday  season surrounded by his family, the cancer returned in January of  2017. And on March 11, Mason lost his battle with cancer.   Soon after, Mason's family and friends founded the Mason Chandler  Allen Memorial Foundation to increase awareness and funding to fight  pediatric cancer. On September 28, the foundation held its third annual  Steps Towards the Cure Walk in my hometown of Levittown. This walk  benefits pediatric cancer research funding and supports quality of life  projects for children and teens who are fighting cancer.   Mr. Speaker, as long as organizations like this exist, we can  continue the fight to end childhood cancer forever.                            ____________________
