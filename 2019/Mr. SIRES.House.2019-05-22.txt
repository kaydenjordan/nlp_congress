 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about the Martin Luther  King, Jr. program in Colombia and to recognize the tremendous  leadership of my friend and colleague from New York, Congressman  Greg  Meeks.   The Martin Luther King, Jr. program is a modest project funded by the  United States Agency for International Development. It provides  scholarships to outstanding Afro-Colombian and indigenous students to  learn English as a second language and receive leadership training. The  program began in 2006 and has supported over 370 students.   While leading a bipartisan delegation to Colombia in April,  Congressman Meeks and I, along with five of our colleagues, had the  opportunity to meet with young people participating in the program and  hear firsthand the impacts this program has had on their community.   The students told us how their experience with the MLK program went  far beyond just learning English. They have developed important  leadership skills, which they have used to launch successful community  improvement projects and to become role models in their neighborhoods.   They told us how the program fosters an environment in which the  students learn from one another about how to make a positive difference  in the lives of others.   I want to recognize my good friend and colleague, Congressman Meeks,  who led the effort to establish this program back in 2006. While in  Colombia last month, Mr. Meeks spoke passionately to the students about  how they are the future of Colombia. Thanks in no small part to Mr.  Meeks' efforts, that future now looks very bright.   Congressman Meeks' leadership has been essential, not only to the  success of this program, but to supporting Colombia's democratic  progress over the last two decades and strengthening the U.S.-Colombia  partnership. His tireless dedication to the underserved communities has  been critical, and I am proud to serve alongside him.

He has worked to ensure that the voices of Afro-Colombians and other  historically marginalized populations are heard. He has helped inspire  a new and more diverse generation of leadership.   I look forward to seeing the continued impact of this tremendous  effort. I am hopeful that these Martin Luther King, Jr., scholars will  become leaders not only in their communities but of their country.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Meeks for his hard work, his  passion, and his dedication to educating, inspiring, and supporting  leaders of tomorrow.                            ____________________
