 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Walters for bringing  this most important issue to the attention of the American public.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today as well to address the issue of Mr. Michael  Phuong Nguyen, an American citizen and a resident of Orange County, who  is currently being detained by the Vietnamese government.   As Representative Royce just said, we seem to be enjoying a stronger,  closer relationship with Vietnam on trade and security. Then we have  this contradiction, a contradiction that an American citizen is being  detained.   On July 7, Michael Phuong Nguyen was touring Vietnam, visiting  relatives, and he was arrested. It has been almost 2 months. The charge  is penal code 109, which is activity against the People's government,  yet there are no facts that have been presented, no evidence. He is  being held. He has been arrested with no evidence being presented.                                time  2045    His wife and his family, they are also personal friends of mine. I  know this family. They are strong members of our community. That is why  I don't understand how Michael could have been arrested in Vietnam.   I ask the Government of Vietnam to please release Michael. Please  release him back to his family and to his country, the United States of  America.
