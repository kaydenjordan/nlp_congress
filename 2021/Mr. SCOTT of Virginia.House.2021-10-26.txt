 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution  716, I call up the bill (H.R. 2119) to amend the Family Violence  Prevention and Services Act to make improvements, and ask for its  immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and insert extraneous materials on H.R. 2119.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge support for the bipartisan Family  Violence Prevention and Services Improvement Act of 2021 introduced by  the gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. McBath), the gentleman from Alaska  (Mr. Young), the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore), and the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko).   Before I continue, I want to encourage anyone struggling with  intimate partner violence to reach out to the National Domestic  Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-SAFE or the StrongHearts Native Helpline  at 1-844-7NATIVE.   Madam Speaker, it is difficult to overstate the need to address  intimate partner violence in this country. Roughly 1 in 4 women and  nearly 1 in 10 men reported experiencing some sort of intimate partner  violence.   These incidents often cause severe physical injuries that portend  even graver consequences, including the tragic loss of life.   For survivors of violence, emotional trauma and intimate partner  violence often last long after the physical injuries have healed,  triggering lifelong struggles with disease and mental health  challenges.   For decades, the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act has been  a central pillar in our response to domestic violence, authorizing  services like shelters and 24-hour domestic violence hotlines.   Regrettably, these programs have been technically expired since the  end of 2015. Although funding has continued, updates to the law have  been long overdue. For example, we know that the COVID-19 pandemic has  increased the risk of intimate partner violence and restricted access  to critical services for survivors.   H.R. 2119 strengthens our fight in this public health crisis by  updating the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act in two  important ways.   First, it prioritizes equity by expanding funding to reach  communities that have disproportionately high rates of intimate partner  violence but limited access to services.   Second, it invests more in prevention so we can avert the physical  danger and emotional trauma that survivors experience before it occurs.   These updates represent the next steps we must take not only to  support the survivors who need it most, but also to prevent intimate  partner violence from harming our communities.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. McBath), the lead sponsor of the  legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute  to the gentlewoman from Georgia.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici), the chair of the Subcommittee  on Civil Rights and Human Services.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Manning), who is a distinguished  member of the Committee on Education and Labor.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Mrvan) who is a distinguished member of the  Committee on Education and Labor.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Wild),  [[Page H5900]]  who is a distinguished member of the Committee on Education and Labor.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Adams), who is the chair of the  Subcommittee on Workforce Protections.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Newman).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Dean).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Green).    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a  Statement of Administration Policy in support of the legislation.                     Statement of Administration Policy    H.R. 2119--Family Violence Prevention and Services Improvement Act of                 2021--Rep. McBath, D-GA, and 83 cosponsors         The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R.       2119, the Family Violence Prevention and Services Improvement       Act of 2021. Congress first enacted the Family Violence       Prevention and Services Act (FVPSA) in 1984 to provide       resources to address domestic violence as a public health       issue and to support life-saving services and prevention       programs throughout the nation. FVPSA, last reauthorized in       2010, allocates funding to states and territories that       reaches over 1,500 domestic violence shelters and services       programs, as well as funding for over 240 tribes and tribal       organizations, to address and prevent domestic violence and       dating violence. FVPSA also provides funding for a network of       state and territorial domestic violence coalitions, the       National Domestic Violence Hotline, and national technical       assistance providers that provide training and capacity       building to ensure that vital services and support are       available to individuals experiencing domestic violence and       their children. Additionally, FVPSA funds the DELTA program,       which provides funds to design, implement, and evaluate       innovative domestic violence and dating violence prevention       models.        As a result of FVPSA funding, each year approximately 1.3       million survivors receive critical services such as emergency       shelter, crisis counseling, safety planning, assistance in       seeking an order of protection, and assistance recovering       from financial abuse and addressing housing insecurity.       Nonetheless, research demonstrates that the need for services       continues to outpace availability and many survivors are       unable to access critical services and support. Furthermore,       the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated economic insecurity,       increased isolation, and compounded barriers faced by victims       and survivors in seeking safety and stability, particularly       for those from historically marginalized communities.        H.R. 2119 is a bipartisan bill that will authorize       increased funding to strengthen existing services while       expanding access to tribes and tribal coalitions, culturally-      specific programs, and other underserved communities. It will       also expand investments in domestic violence prevention by       increasing support for existing evidence-based, community       projects and by funding new initiatives to reach more       communities nationwide. The Administration urges swift       passage of this legislation.     Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a  letter from the family violence prevention working group, a coalition  of national organizations working on domestic violence issues.                                                September 20, 2021.      Rep. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington,           DC.      Rep. Steny Hoyer,      Majority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Rep. Bobby Scott,      Chairman, House Committee on Education & Labor, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Rep. Kevin McCarthy,      Republican Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer, Chairman Scott,       and Republican Leader McCarthy: The undersigned organizations       thank the Committee for passage of the Amendment in the       Nature of a Substitute (ANS) to the bipartisan Family       Violence Prevention and Services Improvements Act (FVPSA),       H.R. 2119, to re-authorize core support and enhance       comprehensive responses to domestic violence, family       violence, and dating violence. We write today to express our       profound support for the bill and write to urge all Members       vote yes on final passage. FVPSA provides critical support       for shelters, coalitions, training and technical assistance       centers, children's services, emergency response hotlines,       and prevention initiatives. This bill also expands grant       programs and makes many needed improvements to ensure more       survivors of domestic violence, family violence and dating       violence have access to support and safety.        FVPSA provides core funding to support more than 1,500       local, public, private, nonprofit and faith-based       organizations and programs and over 250 tribes and tribal       organizations in responding to the urgent needs of over 1.3       million domestic violence victims and their children. As you       know, there is still an urgent need to increase survivors'       access to these vital programs as well as to address current       unmet needs. Estimates show that due to a lack of capacity,       nearly 200,000 requests for shelter can go unmet in a year.       As demonstrated in the annual survey of the National Network       to End Domestic Violence, in just one day in 2020, programs       across the country were unable to meet 11,407 requests from       survivors (requests for emergency shelter, housing,       transportation, childcare, counseling, legal representation,       and other supportive services).        The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected       survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, and family       violence. Survivors are at risk in a time of heightened       economic, health, familial, and emotional trauma. Direct       service providers are also grappling with the unprecedented       challenge of housing survivors and providing life-saving       services while following distance and separation protocols.       The improvements made in this bill will greatly help meet the       needs of survivors in the current crisis and beyond.        The important improvements in H.R. 2119 reflect the       priorities of the domestic violence field and the diverse       needs of survivors, including:        Increasing the funding authorization level to address very       low per-program funding levels and provide access to FVPSA       funds for more programs not currently funded.        Updating provisions and definitions to ensure access to       services for all survivors, better alignment with related       statutes, and reflect evolving best practices amongst service       providers to provide uniform guidance to the domestic       violence field.        Strengthening the capacity of Indian Tribes to exercise       their sovereign authority to respond more fully to domestic       violence in their communities, and authorizing funding for       tribal coalitions and the currently funded Alaska Native       Women's Resource Center.        Bolstering support for all survivors through a grant       program that increases the capacity of culturally specific       community-based organizations to expand access to safety for       survivors of color, as well as provisions that promote best       practices.        Providing a more robust investment in prevention by       bringing evidence-informed prevention initiatives to more       tribes, states, and local communities across the country.        Continuing and expanding support for national technical       assistance (TA) centers and their work to develop effective       policy, practice, research, and cross-system collaborations.        Updating provisions to include additional access and       resources for survivors with disabilities and Deaf survivors,       including a new TA center on enhancing accessible services       for those survivors.        Updating provisions for the National Domestic Violence       Hotline and hotline services for underrepresented       populations, including American Indians, Alaskan Natives and       Deaf survivors.        Creating an underserved grant program to increase access to       safety for populations that face additional barriers.        We must continue to ensure that when survivors take the       courageous step to reach out for support, individuals,       organizations and institutions are prepared to address the       risks faced by survivors and their children and improve       efforts to create pathways to enhanced safety and well-being.        As you lead the efforts to pass the bill out of the House,       we thank you again for your leadership on behalf of       survivors, their families, and their communities around the       country, and hope the bill moves swiftly through a vote by       the full House of Representatives on final passage.            Sincerely,        Alaska Native Women's Resource Center (AKNWRC); Alliance of       Tribal Coalitions to End Violence (ATCEV); Asian Pacific       Institute on Gender-Based Violence (API-GBV); Battered       Women's Justice Project (BWJP); Casa de Esperanza: National       Latin@ Network for Healthy Families and Communities; Futures       Without Violence; Lovelace Consulting, Inc.; National Center       on Domestic Violence, Trauma & Mental Health (NCDVTMH);       National Clearinghouse for the Defense of Battered Women;       National Coalition Against Domestic Violence (NCADV);       National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (NCAVP);       National Congress of American Indians (NCAI); National       Domestic Violence Hotline (The Hotline); National Indigenous       Women's Resource Center (NIWRC); National LGBTQ Institute on       IPV; National Network to End Domestic Violence (NNEDV);       StrongHearts Native Helpline; The National Resource Center on       Domestic Violence (NRCDV); Ujima: National Center on Violence       Against Women in the Black Community; YWCA USA.     Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), chair of the Subcommittee on  Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security.    I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1  minute.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close. I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Madam Speaker, I have to respond to a comment about the budget. I  would point out and remind everyone that since the 1960s, every  Democratic President has ended an administration with a better deficit  situation than they inherited, without exception. And every Republican  administration has ended their administration with a worse deficit  situation than they inherited, without exception. The last President  was well on his way to fulfilling that trend before the pandemic.   The Build Back Better and the transportation plans are in the process  of being paid for so they will not be adding to the deficit.   Madam Speaker, each person in this Chamber should agree that we must  do more to address intimate partner violence in this country. The  critical services for survivors under the Family Violence Prevention  and Services Act  [[Page H5903]]  have now expired, have been expired for more than 5 years, and are in  urgent need of updates.   During the pandemic, many survivors have been isolated with their  abusers, while the gaps in our response to domestic violence have been  exacerbated. This is not the time for Congress to stand by while our  communities continue to endure the far-reaching and lifelong impacts of  this public health crisis. Now is the time for Congress to take action.   As we face new challenges during the pandemic, we must ensure that  survivors in our most vulnerable communities have access to the support  services they need. We must prioritize effective prevention strategies  that stop intimate partner violence from occurring in the first place.   Madam Speaker, each of us has the responsibility to do our part to  fight against domestic violence. The bill before us is an opportunity  to come together and reaffirm our commitment to supporting survivors  and preventing all Americans from suffering the devastating  consequences of intimate partner violence.   I want to thank all the bipartisan sponsors for their leadership and  for their work to pass this urgent legislation. I urge my colleagues to  support the Family Violence Prevention and Services Improvement Act of  2021, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to section 3 of House  Resolution 716, I rise to offer amendments en bloc No. 1.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, there are six amendments in this en bloc.   Mr. Kahele has offered an amendment which establishes the Native  Hawaiian Resource Center on domestic violence.   Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has offered an amendment to amend the definition of  a child to include any child under 18, including emancipated minors.   Mr. Cohen has offered an amendment to clarify grant eligibility for  legal aid organizations.   Ms. Newman has offered an amendment to clarify that domestic violence  coalitions may partner with mental health and substance abuse disorder  providers.   Ms. Jackson Lee has offered an amendment requiring the GAO study  required in the underlying bill to include information on outreach to  racial and ethnic minorities.   Ms. Bush has offered an amendment to clarify that domestic violence  coalitions can provide training to housing service providers.   These amendments make meaningful improvements to the bill. I urge a  ``yes'' vote on the amendments en bloc No. 1, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen), the chair of the Subcommittee on  the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), the chair of the Subcommittee  on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute  to the gentlewoman from Texas.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30  seconds to the gentlewoman from Texas.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, again, these amendments included in the amendments en  bloc make meaningful improvements to the bill. I urge a ``yes'' vote on  en bloc No. 1, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to section 3 of House  Resolution 716, I rise to offer amendments en bloc No. 2.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, there are two amendments in this en bloc. First, as it  has been explained, the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx) has  offered an amendment to reinstate the State match requirement, and the  gentlewoman from Louisiana (Ms. Letlow) has offered a substitute  amendment, leaving out the majority of the programming improvements in  H.R. 2119 and adding a problematic provision regarding abortion.   These amendments undermine the bipartisan, bicameral progress  included in H.R. 2119 and neglect to make any changes or enhancements  to FVPSA programs.   These amendments en bloc fail to meet the moment. There are a number  of things they do:   They halt the creation of a new resource center on disability and  domestic violence needed to counter the disproportionate rates of  intimate partner violence among people with disabilities.   They prevent Tribal governments from getting the resources they need  to combat domestic violence, which occurs at alarming rates in Tribal  communities.   They strike grants that support survivors from racial and ethnic  minority groups. Communities of color face disproportionate rates of  domestic violence and sexual assault and often experience barriers to  accessing services.  [[Page H5908]]    They remove the addition of new prevention grants to ensure  prevention funding goes to every State, Tribe, and territory, despite  the fact that currently only 10 States receive funding to do any  prevention work, and this amendment maintains that status quo.   These amendments would also reinstate State matching fund  requirements. Particularly during the ongoing pandemic and economic  crisis, this would create significant operational challenges for  service providers. For example, nonprofit organizations do not have the  benefit of guaranteed funding and may struggle to meet match  requirements. Ultimately, this means fewer services available for  survivors.   The amendments en bloc also include a partisan attack on abortion,  undermining a comprehensive reauthorization that can meaningfully  improve the lives of survivors of intimate partner violence.   These amendments inject needless political controversy into this  debate, undermining the hard work we have done to develop a  comprehensive reauthorization. Instead of acknowledging the  complexities of medical decisions for both women and their providers,  abortion opponents use these bills and amendments like these as a  distraction.   These amendments threaten the progress we have made on the bill, and  therefore I urge a ``no'' vote on amendments en bloc No. 2.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance my time.    Madam Speaker, I believe I have the right to  close. I am prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time to close.   Madam Speaker, again, the amendments included in this en bloc weaken  the bill. I urge a ``no'' vote on en bloc No. 2. I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Michigan for his hard work on the Education and Labor Committee and for  his strong support for working men and women in Michigan and across the  country.   I rise today in honor of Richard Trumka, the late AFL-CIO president  and one of the Nation's fiercest and most effective champions for  workers and their families.   As a former coal miner and leader of the storied United Mine Workers  of America, Richard Trumka deeply understood the power of the labor  movement and the importance of defending workers' rights to organize.  His commitment to improving the lives of workers and their families  never waned and has inspired countless people from all walks of life.   To honor Mr. Trumka's legacy, I remain committed to championing  legislation that supports hardworking Americans and strengthening their  rights in the workplace. To that end, the House has twice passed the  Protecting the Right to Organize Act.   Our Nation's labor unions are critical to rebuilding the middle class  in America, but decades of antiunion attacks have eroded workers' basic  rights to organize and negotiate for better wages, benefits, and  working conditions.   Among other things, this legislation would ensure effective sanctions  for those who violate the law by retaliating against those who exercise  their legal rights; and require workers whose rights have been violated  to be temporarily reinstated while their cases are pending. The bill  would lift restrictions on workers' First Amendment rights to engage in  boycotts and strikes; and ensure workers can win a first contract, if  they vote to support a union.   It is a fitting tribute that the PRO Act will be named after him. The  next most important step to honor his legacy is for the Senate to pass  this historic legislation. I look forward to the day when the Richard  L. Trumka Protecting the Right to Organize Act is signed into law.   But we also have an opportunity to strengthen and protect our  workforce through the Build Back Better plan. Notably, the Committee on  Education and Labor's section of the plan will increase enforcement of  labor law and civil rights violations and set meaningful civil monetary  penalties for violations of wage and hour, worker safety, and labor  laws.   The plan also includes a major investment in proven workforce  development programs to ensure that Americans can access the training  they need to find a rewarding career and earn fair wages.   These historic provisions advance Mr. Trumka's vision: to ensure that  all workers have a good job and the power to determine their wages and  working conditions.   Even up to his final days, Mr. Trumka was fulfilling that mission,  rallying workers across the country and demonstrating the spirit and  solidarity that defined his tenure as president of the AFL-CIO.   I hope my colleagues in the House and the Senate will join me in  honoring Mr. Trumka's legacy by passing both the Richard L. Trumka PRO  Act and the Build Back Better Act. I thank the gentleman from Michigan  for his hard work and dedication.
