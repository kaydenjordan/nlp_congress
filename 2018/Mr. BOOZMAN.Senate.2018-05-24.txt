 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and  honor Dennis and Barbara Rainey. The Raineys are residents of Little  Rock in my home State of Arkansas. They are cofounders of FamilyLife, a  Christian ministry committed to helping marriages and families.   Dennis and Barbara have been married since 1972. They have six  children and a growing number of grandchildren. Their ministry, which  is focused on strengthening marriage and the family, has grown into a  nationally recognized brand that includes marriage conferences and  cruises, books, devotionals, and public speaking engagements.  FamilyLife reaches an estimated 60,000 people each year with its  ``Weekend To Remember'' events for couples.   Dennis can be heard daily as host of the nationally syndicated radio  program ``FamilyLife Today'' on more than 1,100 radio stations/outlets  in nearly all 50 States. Together, they have authored or coauthored  more than 35 books, and Barbara recently launched a new home decor line  and teaching resource to help families and especially women express  their faith in their homes. FamilyLife has grown into a dynamic  ministry that has reached more than 109 countries across the world.   Dennis and Barbara truly live out their faith every day in their  roles as teachers, speakers, parents, grandparents, mentors, friends,  and neighbors. They have been pivotal members of the faith community in  Little Rock, as well as throughout our State and the country.   My wife, Cathy, and I have been blessed by and treasured the  friendship and mentorship of Dennis and Barbara since the start of  their ministry.   We are very proud of the important, affirming work that they have  been doing for decades. Taking this opportunity to celebrate Dennis and  Barbara and their legacy shows just how much of an impact they have had  on their community and beyond over many years.   We are grateful for them and wish them well in the years ahead. May  God bless the Raineys and the work they have left to do in service of  His Kingdom. Our marriages and families are certainly better for  it.                            ____________________
