 Congressman, thank you for that introduction, and thank  you for your service to the Congress and the great people of Maryland.   I think it is really important tonight to focus on a few key things  about what is happening in Congress. One is that 20 million people  stand to lose their healthcare coverage. Many have never had it, and  the Republican majority is set to snatch it from their hands. That  is really sad.    One of the people who come to mind is actually a young woman who  works on my staff. Her name is Abby, and she is a young woman who has  her whole life to look forward to, but as a young person, when she was  born, she had a disease called toxoplasmosis. She doesn't mind me  talking about it because what Abby would tell you if she were here is  that it was tough growing up.   She had a lot of medical attention growing up. She was a good  student, and she really braved all of the medical care she needed with  tremendous courage, and her family was there with her the whole time.  But she had numerous surgeries growing up, and she also came close to  death's door on more than one occasion.   One thing that she says--and says to anybody who is willing to  listen--is that the Affordable Care Act helped save her life. Why?  Because Abby has a preexisting condition, a pretty serious illness. And  she had insurance companies that have lifetime limits and annual limits  on coverage and care.   Without the Affordable Care Act and with the provisions that preceded  the Affordable Care Act in the insurance industry, she simply was  uninsurable, therefore, not in a position to get the care she needed.  By some miracle, she made it to adulthood with the status quo before  the Affordable Care Act, but the Affordable Care Act made the  difference between her being with us and not.   I was talking to a physician who operates an institution in my  district called the Hennepin County Medical Center, HCMC, who said:  Look, if you were to stack up all of the diseases in our country that  end in fatality, you would have to put up there car accidents, you  would have to put up there heart disease, you would have to put up  there pulmonary illnesses and cancers, of course. But, he said, if you  stacked those illnesses up on a list, the most fatal in a given year,  he said, the third one would be uninsured, people dying because they  don't have insurance.   And our Republican majority is here to tell us they are okay with  that. It is hard for me to believe, but it is true.   Right in front of us, we know that this repeal will relieve wealthy  individuals of paying taxes. If they are able to repeal the Affordable  Care Act, people with a lot of money are going to have more of it, and  people who needed health care will have less of it.   People who need help dealing with the doughnut hole and need to be  filled in with the moneys that come from the Affordable Care Act won't  have that anymore. Now they will go back to the status quo of Medicare  part D, which is where they get help up to a certain amount, then there  is no help, then they have got to spend up to start getting help again.  The Affordable Care Act filled in the doughnut hole, and seniors who  can barely afford their prescription drugs now will have even more  trouble.   Seniors who need Daraprim, which was a medication that cost about 13  bucks until this guy Shkreli bought the patent for it and jacked it up  to about 700 bucks, people who need even things like insulin, people  who need all kinds of medications now are going to be staring at that  doughnut hole all over again.   I mean, we can get up here and talk about the toll, the human  tragedy, the pain and suffering that people are looking at, but none of  it seems to penetrate the minds of our colleagues. They seem to be deaf  to the pleas of people like Abby and so many other people like that.   I was here when my colleagues on the other side brought forth I think  as many as 60 attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. We would come  forth and we would say: People are getting lifesaving treatments that  they never could afford before; people are getting treatments that are  literally keeping their families intact, keeping their lives intact;  people are getting coverage they never had; people have something more  than the emergency room to turn to. Our colleagues would just say:  Well, we are just going to get rid of it anyway.   In fact, I remember, Mr. Speaker, when the Republicans shut down the  government for 16 days because we refused to cooperate with their  effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Ted Cruz occupied time and  demanded that we repeal it. We said we would not turn people like Abby  and others back to the tender mercies of the insurance industry. They  said: Well, we will shut down the entire government unless you do it.  We said no, and, well, here we are.   It is true that we never thought we were going to lose this election.  We never thought we would be this deep in the minority, but we now have  gotten in a position where the Democrats  [[Page H2008]]  don't hold the Presidency. We have a President who ran on the promise  of repealing the Affordable Care Act, and we have two Houses of  Congress that are committed to doing it.   The last line of defense really is the American people, Mr. Speaker.  The last line of defense is the American people standing on the most  fundamental of rights, the First Amendment, which guarantees them the  right to redress grievances, guarantees them the right to petition  their government, guarantees them the right to freedom of assembly,  guarantees them the right to freedom of faith, guarantees them the  right to receive information from a free press.   We are relying on that amendment, Mr. Speaker, to stop these  Republican efforts to snatch healthcare access out of the way, out of  the hands of Americans. We are relying on Americans to stand up and  say: We will not tolerate this--going to community meetings, going out  on the street, using their rights as Americans to express their right  to have health care. This is what the moment calls for.   Governors, even some Republican Governors, are saying: Wait a minute.  This Medicaid expansion, you know, we used it. It is not so bad. It is  helping us.   Their pleas are being ignored as well. We are at a critical moment:  Will the American people continue to make the same advances that people  all over the developed world have made with regard to health care?   You know, Europeans look at us and think there is something wrong  with us. Even our northern neighbors look at us and say: Wait a minute.  Health care is not a right down there?    No. You get it if you can pay; and if you can't pay and answer  somebody's bottom line, you are just out.   We pay the most for health care in the whole wide world, Mr. Speaker.  We pay the most--the most--and yet we don't have the best outcomes. We  don't have the best indicators of health. Yet our colleagues on the  other side of the aisle want to return us to a day when the number one  reason that people would declare bankruptcy was medical debt. That is  the world we are looking at, and it is really, really something.   Now, many people have said--you know, Democrats say to me all the  time, and I am sure they say it to Mr. Raskin of Maryland: Hey, look,  you know, there are things we would change in the Affordable Care Act.   We are not saying that it fell down from tablets in the sky. Of  course, there are reasonable amendments that might be made. But I am  here to say to you, Mr. Speaker, that the Republican caucus has never  said: We will talk about how we are going to make reasonable amendments  to make it better. They have only said to repeal, repeal, repeal.   They have also said replace, but everyone knows you cannot repeal and  replace the Affordable Care Act because, if you repeal it, you are  repealing all of the taxes that go along with paying for it. And if you  repeal the taxes, you are going to tell me that a Republican caucus is  going to levy a tax? They think tax is a four-letter word if somebody  with a lot of money has to pay it.                                time  2000    Now, they are okay with fees and pushing down regressive taxes. They  do that every day and all the time. If somebody with real means has to  pony up, even though they are already wealthy, you could never see a  Republican do that. It is just not something they are going to do.   The ACA has provided coverage to more than 20 million people. That is  20 million more people who have better patient care, access to doctors  and medicines, and are no longer turned away because of preexisting  conditions.   The Republican proposal puts the brakes on the progress we have made.  People will lose access to insurance coverage. The Republicans gut the  preventative health fund, which literally funds programs to invest in  keeping people healthy.   Who do Republicans help?   Insurance and pharmaceutical corporations. They get huge tax breaks  at the expense of the help and the future of the American people.   The Republican bill doesn't stop there. It is an outright attack on  Medicaid. Seniors out there should know that the Republicans are  attacking Medicaid. They are attacking Medicaid.   Medicaid is one of our most effective antipoverty programs and  provides lifesaving care to millions of elderly, children, pregnant  women, and people with disabilities. Republicans want to dismantle the  program as we know it and kick people off and leave States to pay for  the bill.   This bill takes away health care from women and shifts costs to the  older, sicker people. It compromises the Medicare trust fund. It  destroys Medicaid and gives tax breaks to corporations and  millionaires. It is wrong, and the American people need to oppose it.  And I oppose what they are trying to do.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Raskin) for being so clear on the issues in front of the American  people. It is so important that we have these Special Order hours so  that we can really help the American people understand what is at  stake; and what is at stake literally is the health and security of our  Nation.    When we talk about security, usually people think about law  enforcement and military. There is also the security that families can  expect, the security of your health. In this situation, the Nation's  security of health and family security is absolutely on the chopping  block.   Let me give you an example of what I mean. In the district I  represent in Minnesota--which I am so proud to represent the people of  the Fifth Congressional District of Minnesota--we used to have an  uninsured rate which we thought was low. It was 10.9 percent. If you  remember, in the pre-Affordable Care Act days, 10.9 percent was pretty  low. Well, now it is 6.6 percent. That means literally thousands of  Minnesotans can now go and get regular doctor care rather than just  show up at the ER.   Part of the way that we used the Affordable Care Act in Minnesota in  the Fifth Congressional District is that the folks at HCMC set up  something called Hennepin Health. What Hennepin Health does is it says:  We are going to take some of these Medicaid dollars and we are going to  help people who are chronic users of the ER system. We are going to  work with other agencies and other providers in the community to help  house them stably and then do regular medical surveillance with them.   Do you know what has happened with this program?   The costs at the ER have dropped through the floor. The money has  been  [[Page H2010]]  saved because of the Affordable Care Act. Not only is it about the  money--because if you talk to our Republican friends, all they want to  talk about is money--something even more important has happened.                                time  2015    When you talk to the people who would go to the ER all the time, they  are saying: I have somewhere to live. I have somebody who helps me stay  on my medication. I am beginning to rebuild relationships with my  family again. Schizophrenia can be very devastating to your mental  health; and I was all out of control when I was off my meds, and I used  to end up in the ER within an inch of my life. But now, because of the  Affordable Care Act, I can get the care that I need, I can be stably  housed, I can be productive in my community, I can be a participating  family member again.   It has improved their lives.   I don't understand what the Republicans don't understand. It is a  good thing to have people to have an option other than the ER.   I heard one of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle say,  well, in America, if you show up at a hospital, there is a Federal law  that says they have got to take you.   It is true that if you show up at an ER, somebody is going to have to  let you in there. They may move you from one hospital to another, but,  eventually, the law does say you will end up with somebody seeing you.   Guess what the medical professionals say about it? It doesn't work.  It is the most expensive care. It is usually left to people who have  allowed an illness to fester and to go on and to advance, which makes  it more difficult to treat, more expensive to treat. It is the wrong  way to run a healthcare system.   Yet, people have a straight face and say things like, well, you know,  you can go to the doctor if you need to. It is called the ER.   This is absolutely not the right thing. And so here we are again,  right at this hour where, really, things look kind of grave, and we  need the American people to stand up and object. I tell you, we need  people to say that they insist upon a humane society where a person  suffering from schizophrenia, who is so afflicted by their illness that  the only thing they can do is make it through the day and then, if they  get sick, maybe somebody will take them to the ER.   We should have a society where that person can get the care they  need, can get housing that they need, can be cared for, and can be a  participating member in our society with just a little bit more help.   I think that is what makes us Democrats. That is the difference  between us and them. We care about people. We believe people are  inherently valuable and all have dignity, and we don't believe that you  are only as worthy as what is in your pocket or your bank account. We  reject that idea out of hand and believe that people must be--if you  are too poor to work, too sick to work, too old to work, we believe our  society should care for you; and I don't make any apologies to anybody  for believing that.   I believe the government should do everything it can to make sure  there are enough good-paying jobs for everybody. Lord knows we have got  enough work to do around here, potholes here and there, school kids  need help. We have got plenty of work to do. That is not the problem.   We have also got plenty of wealth. We have got plenty of wealth in  our society. And I believe that if you live in this greatest of all  countries in the world--and I believe that, I am so proud to be an  American--and you are allowed to make a profit, which I believe in  that, I am a former businessperson myself--I don't think it is asking  you too much to put a little bit in the pot so some people who can't  afford it can go to the doctor.   I don't think it is asking you too much to put a little bit in a pot  so a kid can go to school, or so that a senior can get medication, or  so that we can have clean water. I don't think it is too much.   But some people think it is too much to say that, even though I have  been blessed by being an American and being able to pursue my economic  dream, I don't want to give them anything. This is all for me.   I just don't--we are just not on the same page with that. We think  that it is all right to make sure that we fund the basic necessities  that people need to have a thriving, humane society, and that includes  health care.   So tonight, I just want to say to people that it reminds me of a  question that a lady asked Benjamin Franklin when Benjamin Franklin  walked out of the Constitutional Congress in Philadelphia, way back so  many years ago. The lady said to Benjamin Franklin: What do we have,  Mr. Franklin? He said: A democracy if we can keep it.   Part of being a democratic society in this country right now means  that we should have health care for people because this society can  afford it. Part of what it means to have a civilized democracy in this  moment means that people can rise up and lift their voices up to defend  their right to have decent health care for all in this society; and we  urge people to do that because it is the right thing to do, and this is  the right time to do it.   So I want to just yield back to my friend from Maryland. I will be  taking my leave at this point, but I want to thank the gentleman for  holding down this very important Special Order because the Affordable  Care Act is worth fighting for.   As you said, Mr. Raskin, the Affordable Care Act is not perfect. What  piece of legislation ever was?   We have amended the 1964 Civil Rights Act. We have amended the 1965  Voting Rights Act. We amend laws all the time because, as society  changes and times change, the needs come up. But to just repeal and  then not come anywhere close to replacing, it is wrong, and we must  oppose it.
