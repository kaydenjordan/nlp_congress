 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to say that I was  proud to vote for H.J. Res. 37 and to stand in opposition to continued  U.S. engagement in hostilities in Yemen as yet undeclared by Congress.  However, this is just the first step in addressing just how far astray  we have gone when it comes to Yemen and in our foreign policy more  broadly.   Let's be clear: the crisis unfolding in Yemen right now is a  consequence and the responsibility of actions by both Republican and  Democratic administrations. We took a low level conflict, and we put it  on steroids. We took a regional issue, and we turned it into the  biggest humanitarian crisis in the world.   For what?   We started supporting the anti-Houthi coalition because we didn't  want Iran to expand its influence, and here we are, the Houthis are  closer than ever to Tehran, and they are launching Iranian-made  missiles at Riyadh.   I thought we were done doing dumb stuff.   On top of all of this, the President compounded this humanitarian  crisis by implementing a travel ban which left the families of American  citizens stranded in a war zone that we ourselves helped create.   Now, I represent one of the largest Yemeni-American communities in  the United States. I have hundreds of families in my district, Staten  Island and south Brooklyn, who worry about their husbands, their wives,  their children, and their parents, who only want to be reunited with  them in the United States.   Now, many families have told me that they can apply for a waiver  which somehow makes this constitutional. But not a single person from  the Secretary of State on down can tell me how my constituents can  actually get the waivers that their family members so desperately need.  We still don't know.   Nobody cares about national security more than I do, but this isn't  it. We are the most powerful country in the world, and we have trapped  my constituents' loved ones in a war zone with no answers for how they  can get out of there.   How does this make us more safe?   It is time we have a clear-eyed look at how we conduct our foreign  policy and, more importantly, how we decide to use military force in  the first place. This resolution is just one step in the right  direction.  [[Page H2001]]                                ____________________
