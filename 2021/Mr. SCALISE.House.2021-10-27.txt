 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an American hero.  Jared Keyworth from Mandeville, Louisiana, served as a senior inspector  with the United States Marshals Service and tragically lost his life in  the line of duty earlier this month.   Senior Inspector Keyworth began his service with the Marshals Service  in 2010 and took on assignments in Denver, Miami, and New Orleans. Most  recently, he was selected to serve in the marshals' technical  operations group in Baton Rouge.   Prior to Jared's service with the marshals, he served in the United  States Army's Old Guard. During President Reagan's funeral, Jared  escorted the riderless horse, the symbol of a fallen leader who will  never ride again.   On September 28 of 2021, Jared was critically wounded while in  pursuit of a violent felony offender. He passed away on October 1.   Jared will forever be in our hearts and minds, and we are eternally  grateful for his service to our great country.                            ____________________
