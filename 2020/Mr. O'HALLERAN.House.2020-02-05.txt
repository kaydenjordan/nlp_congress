 Madam Speaker, I rise today in defense of the  American healthcare system.   Last week, the administration proposed a new demonstration program  that would allow States to apply for block grants. These would permit  States to slash funding for their Medicaid programs, reduce protections  for beneficiaries, and restrict eligibility standards. A recent study  by George Washington University found that these changes would also  result in community health centers treating 5 million fewer patients  over the next 4 years.   This is unacceptable. Federal law already gives Medicaid flexibility  to change from State to State. These proposed block grants are nothing  more than cuts to funding for the program.   Today, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for a resolution  condemning these proposed changes as what they are: attacks on our  healthcare system and those with preexisting conditions.                            ____________________
