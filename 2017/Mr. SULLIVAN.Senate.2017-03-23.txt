 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, as my colleagues know, I have been  coming to the floor week after week to recognize an Alaskan who has  made a difference in his or her community. As I have said repeatedly--I  am a little biased, of course--I have the honor of living in the most  beautiful State in the country, but it is our people who truly make it  special. They are resilient, kind, and giving. And it is the next  generation that is going to continue to make my State the best place in  the world to live.   This week I would like to introduce my colleagues to 18-year-old  Ivory Gerhardt Cyrus, this week's Alaskan of the Week. Ivory lives in  Kiana, a beautiful, close-knit Inupiat village of less than 400 people  on the banks of the Kobuk River in Northwest Alaska. Like many villages  in Alaska, there are no roads in and out. People travel to Kotzebue,  which is the closest hub city--it is not very much of a city but a big  village--about 40 miles away by plane or snow machine, boat, or  sometimes dog team. That is where Ivory was raised--in Kiana--and  where, against many odds, she has strived.   Ivory was born with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, which made  getting through school a challenge. She was at times misunderstood, at  times bullied, and many didn't know how to deal with her properly.   About 120 kids each year are diagnosed with fetal alcohol spectrum  disorder in Alaska. When she was in middle school, Ivory began  committing herself to helping them by speaking out about her own  experiences and by advocating the way students with behavioral issues  are treated in school. She was an advocate for them.   Now she is an honor roll high school senior, graduating this spring,  and along the way, she has become a State of Alaska trainer for fetal  alcohol spectrum disorder. She gave a presentation at an international  conference recently on disability and diversity, and she was named one  of five recipients of the 27th annual Women of Achievement and Youth  Awards in Alaska.   This is what I find most impressive about Ivory: She is passing a  message of hope and service on to her peers. She started a group,  encouraging the members of the group to do one positive thing each day.  The name of the group is appropriately entitled ``One Positive Thing,''  or ``OPT.'' That message has spread throughout her community, and now  villages in Kiana are remembering to do one positive thing each day for  themselves, their families, and their community. Last year, she held  her first OPT conference in Kiana for youth all across the region. This  year, that conference--the next OPT conference, One Positive Thing-- will be held on April 7 and 8.   Ivory is an exceptional young woman. She is going to go on to do  exceptional things. Next fall, she plans on attending the University of  Alaska Anchorage where she plans to continue to do one positive thing  each day and will bring that positive attitude to the students at UAA.  She is going to continue to encourage others to do that as well.   I congratulate her for all of her accomplishments, for being our  Alaskan of the Week, and congratulations to her parents, Jean and Tom,  for the wonderful job they have done in raising this exceptional young  lady.   Ivory gives us all hope for the future.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 96, submitted earlier  today.    Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 97, submitted earlier today.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 3 p.m., Monday,  March 27; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; further, that following leader  remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session and resume  consideration of Executive Calendar No. 1, the Montenegro treaty;  further, that the filing deadline for first-degree amendments under  rule XXII for the cloture motion filed during today's session of the  Senate be at 3:30 p.m. on Monday, March 27; and finally, that  notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII, the cloture vote occur at  5:30 p.m.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 5:54 p.m., adjourned until  Monday, March 27, 2017, at 3 p.m.                            ____________________
