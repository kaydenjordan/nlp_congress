 Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my pure outrage  at this extremist, right-wing majority of the Supreme Court stripping  one of the most important rights in this country away from people: the  right to have an abortion. This decision endangers marginalized  communities and strips the bodily autonomy away from millions of  Americans, including my own 17-year-old daughter. We must not rest  until we restore people's freedom to control their own bodies and their  own decisions.   I want to emphasize that abortion is still legal in Michigan. The  very day that Roe was overturned in the Dobbs decision, our biggest  health system, Beaumont-Spectrum, announced that they would end  abortion services, counter to current Michigan law.   I worked privately and publicly to reverse that, and, happily, they  did so the same weekend.   We will fight to restore abortion rights, to maintain them in all the  States where they still exist. This is a fight for all of us, and it is  up to us to protect everyone's rights.                            ____________________
