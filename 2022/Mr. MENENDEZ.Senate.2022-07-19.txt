Major Defense Equipment (MDE): None.        Non-MDE: Included are AN/ARC-210 radios; classified       software, Computer Program Identification Numbers (CPINs),       and software integration support; Electronic Warfare (EW)       database support; test support and equipment; aircraft and       munitions support and support equipment; flight simulator       support; additional hardware and software delivery and       support; spare and repair parts, consumables and accessories;       maintenance and maintenance support; mission planning system       sustainment; facilities, utilities, and information       technology support at U.S. Air Force bases; classified and       unclassified publications and technical documentation; and       U.S. Government and contractor engineering, technical and       logistics support services, studies and surveys; and other       related elements of logistical and program support.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION                         Belgium--F-16 Sustainment         The Government of Belgium has requested to buy additional       F-16 sustainment support that will be added to a previously       implemented case. The original FMS case, valued at $98.4       million, included F-16 sustainment, consisting of AN/ARC-210       radios; classified software, Computer Program Identification       Numbers (CPINs), and software integration support; Electronic       Warfare (EW) database support; test support and equipment;       aircraft and munitions support and support equipment; flight       simulator support; additional hardware and software delivery       and support; spare and repair parts, consumables and       accessories; maintenance and maintenance support; mission       planning system sustainment; facilities, utilities, and       information technology support at U.S. Air Force bases;       classified and unclassified publications and technical       documentation; and U.S. Government and contractor       engineering, technical and logistics support services,       studies and surveys; and other related elements of logistical       and program support. This notification will include more of       the same items and services. The estimated total cost is $127       million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security objectives of the United States by       improving the security of a NATO ally which is an important       force for political stability and economic progress in       Europe.        The proposed sale will improve Belgium's capability to meet       current and future threats by maintaining its F-16 fleet in       combat-ready status and providing rotational forces to NATO's       Eastern flank. Belgium will have no difficulty absorbing       these articles and services into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be Lockheed Martin, Bethesda,       MD. There are no known offset agreements proposed in       connection with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of any additional U.S. Government or contractor       representatives to Belgium.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 22-39       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The AN/ARC-210 is a voice communications radio system       equipped with HAVE QUICK II, which employs cryptographic       technology. Other waveforms may be included as needed.        2. The Electronic Warfare Integrated Reprogramming Database       (EWIRDB) is used by USG engineers in the reprogramming and       creation of shareable Mission Data Files for the AN/ALQ-131       electronic countermeasures pod on the F-16 aircraft.        3. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        4. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        5. A determination has been made that Belgium can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        6. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the Government of Belgium.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION              United Arab Emirates--C-17 Aircraft Sustainment         The Government of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has       requested to buy follow-on sustainment and support of C-17       fleet to include aircraft hardware and software modifications       and support; Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) software;       classified software support for Electronic Warfare (EW) self-      protection; aircraft and engine support equipment,       components, consumables, spare parts and repair/return;       publications and technical documentation; heavy maintenance       support; participation in the C-17 Virtual Fleet for Total       System Sustainment (TSS) contractor logistics support and       Material Improvement Program (MIP); other U.S. Government and       contractor engineering, technical, and logistical support       services; and other related elements of program support. The       total estimated cost is $980.4 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security of the United States by helping to improve       the security of an important regional partner. The UAE has  [[Page S3367]]       been, and continues to be, a vital U.S. partner for political       stability and economic progress in the Middle East.        The proposed renewal of C-17 aircraft support will provide       the Government of the UAE with a credible defense capability,       provide strategic and humanitarian airlift, and ensure       interoperability with U.S. forces. The UAE already operates       the C-17 and will have no difficulty absorbing the additional       sustainment into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The prime contractor will be The Boeing Company, Chicago,       IL. The purchaser typically requests offsets. Any offset       agreement will be defined in negotiations between the       purchaser and the contractor.        Implementation of this proposed sale may require the       assignment of up to twelve (12) U.S. Government or contractor       representatives to the UAE. Implementation of this proposed       sale will require periodic Program Management Reviews in the       United States or in the UAE.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            ____________________     Mr. President, for the Committee on Foreign       Relations I report favorably the following nomination list       which was printed in the RECORD on the date indicated, and       ask unanimous consent, to save the expense of reprinting on       the Executive Calendar that this nomination lie at the       Secretary's desk for the information of Senators.
