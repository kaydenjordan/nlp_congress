 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for  yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, today's rule provides for consideration of three  unrelated measure, each of which have little chance of passing the  Senate or becoming law. The one is a nonbinding messaging resolution,  another one a partisan labor bill, and the third provides billions of  dollars in Federal aid for disaster recovery from recent earthquakes in  Puerto Rico, but actually can be distributed to meet unmet needs in  other States.   Let's talk first about the resolution expressing disapproval for the  Trump administration's Healthy Adult Opportunity demonstration project  that was just announced on January 30.   A letter provided by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  to State Medicaid directors detailed an option for States to apply for  increased flexibility under the section 1115 for Medicaid waivers.   The Healthy Adult Opportunity demonstration provides States with a  choice as to how they would like to receive their funding for adults  under the age of 65 who are covered by a Medicaid expansion population.   This does not include children. This does not include pregnant women.  It does not include individuals with disabilities, or the elderly.   This only applies to healthy adults who are not covered as part of  the traditional Affordable Care Act population, and if, and only if,  the States decide to pursue the Healthy Adult Opportunity.   H. Res. 862 is a political statement made to diminish the efforts of  the Trump administration. It is unreasonable and unrealistic for  Democrats to declare this demonstration an attack on Medicaid after  only a few days since the release of the plan.   Do we have a full understanding of the opportunity grants? So I  strongly suggest Members on both sides of the aisle speak with their  Governors and their counterparts in State legislatures to ask about  this option.   My office did indeed speak with our Texas Governor this week. The  State is still unpacking everything that the Centers for Medicare and  Medicaid Services may provide, and this may not be an option Texas will  take, but it is up to them. They are currently running internal  analyses to come to a conclusion, a process that does take some time.   Recognizing this, there is little chance that the Senate will agree  to this messaging resolution. A far better approach would have been for  us to have, perhaps, a hearing and a markup in our committee of  jurisdiction.   Unfortunately, not everyone agreed with that.   H.R. 2474, the PRO Act, has a similarly low chance of being  considered by the Senate. The bill is nothing more than a requirement  that workers become members of labor unions. Republicans support the  right of employees to form a labor union, but it should be a choice for  every individual worker.   There is a card-check system included in this bill. Employees will no  longer enjoy the privacy of a secret ballot election. Organizers will  be able to collect authorization cards covering 50 percent of the  bargaining unit and form a union without holding a secret election.   In effect, employees are not protected from potential political  intimidation and not protected from coercive behavior by organizers in  an effort to obtain the required number of cards.   That is not free and voluntary choice.   Against a recent National Labor Relations Board decision, the bill  reinstates what are called micro unions, allowing bargaining units  smaller than a workplace if there is a community of interest.   The joint employer standard is expanded, creating liability for  franchise owners, franchise owners who may have no direct relationship  with the franchisee employee. This is not only unreasonable, it is  impractical, and certainly will weaken or damage the franchise model of  business.   In addition, the bill preempts State right-to-work laws. My State is  a right-to-work State. Does the Federal Government know Texas citizens  better than the State of Texas? This disregards the rights of 27 States  by overturning their right-to-work laws.   Even more concerning, employers will be required to provide union  organizers with an employee's personal information without the  employee's consent.   In the Energy and Commerce Committee we are in the middle of  negotiating both sides: What are the parameters, or what should be the  parameters of a Federal privacy law? This provision in this bill flies  in the face of protecting individuals' privacy, and it is odd because  in the committee, the other side seemed so eager to defend privacy in  any other forum.   Along with these partisan measures, we are also considering emergency  disaster funding for Puerto Rico. The supplemental appropriation  provides over $4 billion for cyber and energy security, electricity  restoration, education assistance, the Federal Highway Administration,  and the Community Development Block Grant.   In recent years, Puerto Rico has faced multiple natural disasters,  including Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017, and a series of  earthquakes in January of this year. There is no doubt that Puerto Rico  is facing a long road to recovery, but compounding the national  disasters is a mismanagement of aid.   Just a couple of weeks ago, a warehouse was discovered full of  emergency supplies. Some of them had been there since 2017. Citizens  were outraged. They broke into the warehouse and took it upon  themselves to distribute the aid.   President Trump released nearly $16 billion in aid funding in January  but did place restrictions on usage to help prevent any squandering of  Federal resources. This bill provides additional billions in aid  without any accountability measures. Existing disaster aid should be  expended before appropriating billions of taxpayer dollars. And then  here is the kicker: It may not go towards its intended recipients.  [[Page H862]]    Only a small portion of these funds are specifically directed to  Puerto Rico. The rest may be applied to unmet needs of disasters in  recent years. Yes, including Puerto Rico, but including many other  States.   FEMA has yet to complete its damage assessment, and initial  assessments indicate $40 million in Federal costs, a much smaller  amount than appropriated in this bill.   No one wants to deny any Americans support when they are in need, but  this appropriation is premature. We could and should take the time to  evaluate the best path for recovery for Puerto Rico, and we have the  ability because there is existing disaster aid that has been released  to meet those immediate needs.   Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to the rule, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  [[Page H863]]  Kentucky (Mr. Comer), who is a valued member of the Education and Labor  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Kentucky an  additional 1 minute.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to immediately consider a resolution reinforcing  policies that are part of the ``best is yet to come'' blueprint, which  was outlined by President Trump in this very Chamber on Tuesday night  in his historic and optimistic State of the Union Address.   His address highlighted the increase in wages for American workers,  the decrease in unemployment, the reduction in the number of those  receiving nutrition assistance, and the strength of our Armed Forces.  He went on to detail the ongoing efforts to decrease healthcare costs  and to improve access to broadband and the continuing defense of our  borders, among other priorities.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Riggleman) to speak on his amendment.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time I have  remaining?    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, one of the underlying bills here, H. Res. 826, is  really nothing more than a political exercise, and I really am  disappointed at how we have come to discuss the healthier adult  opportunity demonstration, in the manner that it is.   If we were to have a legitimate debate on an optional policy, we  should do so in a hearing in the committee of jurisdiction. That is why  the Committee on Energy and Commerce, Republican leader Walden and me  sent a letter to Chairman Pallone to request such a hearing.   We should be asking questions of agencies and States that are  deciding whether or not they would like to utilize this option to  deploy the new section 1115 waiver for this very specific population.   Should a State choose to apply for this Healthy Adult Opportunity  demonstration, it will only be allowed to address the adults that are  under 65 that fall into the expansion population. This optional  demonstration changes nothing for children. It changes nothing for  seniors, changes nothing for individuals with disabilities. All  essential health benefit requirements remain in place.   Most importantly, States do not have to take this option because it  is an option. States can maintain the status quo and continue to  operate their Medicaid programs as they were before this opportunity  was presented to them. Some States may find this demonstration provides  the necessary increased flexibility for them to handle the limited  healthy adult population that is now covered under Medicaid expansion.   In fact, under one of the financing mechanisms, if a State does not  spend all of its Federal allotment under the Healthy Adult Opportunity  demonstration, it can keep 25 to 50 percent of the savings not to  transfer over to the road and bridge fund, but to reinvest in Medicaid.  In the States that might be ravished by an opioid epidemic, that could  mean getting more individuals with opioid use disorder into treatment.   It could allow States additional flexibility to help their most  vulnerable populations. And we heard very compelling testimony in the  Rules Committee last night from the gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs.  Rodgers) about the unconscionably long waiting list for individuals  with disabilities to get coverage under Medicaid.   Madam Speaker, 700,000 people across the country are on that waiting  list. These shared savings could go in to reducing that case backlog  for those individuals.   Look, this may not be an opportunity that every State wants to take.  That is why it is optional. That is what optional means. My State, the  State of Texas, is working through whether or not this would be  beneficial, a beneficial demonstration opportunity for them. There is a  lot to look at in the rule that was produced by the Department of  Health and Human Services. After all, it was just a week ago that this  was received, and people are looking into whether or not it makes sense  for them.   But we, in this body, should take the time to understand this, rather  than simply jump to a conclusion with an action that is ultimately  going to be meaningless because it goes nowhere.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Iowa (Mr. King).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.   Madam Speaker, I just want to highlight a few things.   The gentleman from Virginia came and spoke about an amendment that  will be offered if we defeat the previous question.   As a consequence of that defeat of the previous question is the  consideration of the amendment offered by Mr. Riggleman. And some of  the things that people need to understand is that, well, they will be  voting against these things if they vote to approve the previous  question:   The acknowledgment that jobs and investment are coming into this  country at a rate that has previously not been known. America is now  energy-independent and energy jobs, like so many elements of our  country, are at a record high.   We are building an inclusive society that is making sure that every  young American gets a great education and the opportunity to achieve  the American Dream. That Congress wants to support our students and  back the plan to offer vocational and technical education to every  single high school in America.   In addition, the commitment to access to high speed internet,  including rural America, and the defense of religious liberty.   Many of us worked the prayer breakfast this morning and heard this an  additional time, but including the constitutional right to pray in  public schools. I just want people to be aware that if they defeat the  previous question, this is where we will be engaging.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   As I have stated many times over, the rule proposed by the Centers  for Medicare and Medicaid Services is an option for States. It does in  no way affect or impact the mandatory safety net populations that are  required to be covered under Medicaid.   The population that was included in Medicaid expansion, in States  that underwent expansion, this is where the Centers for Medicare and  Medicaid Services would provide those State Governors, those State  legislatures, an option to consider a block grant if they desired. It  is also written in the proposed rule that they could opt for a per- beneficiary allotment, which might even impart additional flexibility.   But one of the provisions of the rule, as has been proposed, is that,  if there is a significant change--the State undergoes a natural  disaster or emergency--the block grant number can be adjusted. It is  not something that is immobile.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I do want to share and introduce into the Record an  article published by the Brookings Institution--Brookings, of all  places--published in September of 2018 that analyzes global poverty  levels, finding that  [[Page H867]]  over 50 percent of the world's population can now be considered middle  class or above. That means, for the first time, a majority of the  world's population is above the poverty line.   According to this article from Brookings, worldwide, one person  escapes extreme poverty every second, and five people are entering the  middle class per second.   In the United States, the strength of our economy is partly based on  pro-growth and pro-business policies, including those policies included  in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   Madam Speaker, I include the Brookings article in the Record.                      [From Brookings, Sept. 27, 2018]  A Global Tipping Point: Half the World Is Now Middle Class or Wealthier                    (By Homi Kharas and Kristofer Hamel)         Something of enormous global significance is happening       almost without notice. For the first time since agriculture-      based civilization began 10,000 years ago, the majority of       humankind is no longer poor or vulnerable to falling into       poverty. By our calculations, as of this month, just over 50       percent of the world's population, or some 3.8 billion       people, live in households with enough discretionary       expenditure to be considered ``middle class'' or ``rich.''       About the same number of people are living in households that       are poor or vulnerable to poverty. So September 2018 marks a       global tipping point. After this, for the first time ever,       the poor and vulnerable will no longer be a majority in the       world. Barring some unfortunate global economic setback, this       marks the start of a new era of a middle-class majority.        We make these claims based on a classification of       households into those in extreme poverty (households spending       below $1.90 per person per day) and those in the middle class       (households spending $11-110 per day per person in 2011       purchasing power parity, or PPP). Two other groups round out       our classification: vulnerable households fall between those       in poverty and the middle class; and those who are at the top       of the distribution who are classified as ``rich.''        Our ``middle class'' classification was first developed in       2010 and has been used by many researchers. While       acknowledging that the middle class does not have a precise       definition that can be globally applied, the threshold we use       in this work has the following characteristics: those in the       middle class have some discretionary income that can be used       to buy consumer durables like motorcycles, refrigerators, or       washing machines. They can afford to go to movies or indulge       in other forms of entertainment. They may take vacations. And       they are reasonably confident that they and their family can       weather an economic shock--like illness or a spell of       unemployment--without falling back into extreme poverty.        By classifying all households in the world into one of       these four groups, using income and expenditure surveys from       188 countries, we are able to derive measures of the global       distribution of income. Our social enterprise World Data       Lab--the maker of World Poverty Clock--has refined these       estimates and created a new interactive data model to       estimate all income brackets for almost every country for       every point in time until 2030 by combining demographic and       economic data.        A lot has been written about the world's progress in       reducing the number of people living in extreme poverty, as       highlighted in the recent Goalkeepers report put out by the       Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. We believe that another       story relates to the rapid emergence of the global middle       class. This middle class story is probably bigger in terms of       the number of people affected. In the world today, about one       person escapes extreme poverty every second; but five people       a second are entering the middle class. The rich are growing       too, but at a far smaller rate (1 person every 2 seconds).        Why does it matter that a middle-class tipping point has       been reached and that the middle class is the most rapidly       growing segment of the global income distribution? Because       the middle class drive demand in the global economy and       because the middle class are far more demanding of their       governments.        Consider the structure of global economic demand. Private       household consumption accounts for about half of global       demand (the other half is evenly split between investment and       government consumption). Two-thirds of household consumption       comes from the middle class. The rich spend more per person,       but are too few in number to drive the global economy. The       poor and vulnerable are numerous, but have too little income       to spend. For most businesses, the sweet spot to target is       the middle class. This has long been true in individual       advanced economies; it is now true on a global scale.        Targeting the global middle class is not easy. The middle       class like differentiated products, and their tastes will       vary from country to country. The new middle class is       predominantly Asian--almost nine in 10 of the next billion       middle-class consumers will be Asian--but they are spread out       in China, India, and South and South East Asia. It's no       accident that the latest Hollywood hit is Crazy Rich Asians       or that Asian multinationals are emerging that have built a       domestic brand and now look to compete abroad.        The middle class is already the largest segment of demand       in the global economy. What makes it interesting for business       is that it is also the most rapidly growing segment,       projected to reach some 4 billion people by end 2020 and 5.3       billion people by 2030. Compared to today, the middle class       in 2030 will have 1. 7 billion more people, while the       vulnerable group will have 900 million fewer people. Trends       for the poor and the rich and more modest, at -150 million       people and +100 million, respectively.        By our calculations, the middle-class markets in China and       India in 2030 will account for $14.1 trillion and $12.3       trillion, respectively, comparable in size to a U.S. middle-      class market at that time of $15.9 trillion.        In most countries, there is a clear relationship between       the fate of the middle class and the happiness of the       population. According to the Gallup World Poll, new entrants       into the middle class are noticeably happier than those stuck       in poverty or in vulnerable households. Conversely,       individuals in countries where the middle class is shrinking       report greater degrees of personal stress. The middle class       also puts pressure on governments to perform better. They       look to their governments to provide affordable housing,       education, and universal health care. They rely on public       safety nets to help them in sickness, unemployment or old       age. But they resist efforts of governments to impose taxes       to pay the bills. This complicates the politics of middle-      class societies, so they range from autocratic to liberal       democracies. Many advanced and middle-income countries today       are struggling to find a set of politics that can satisfy a       broad middle-class majority.        The tipping point in the world today offers opportunities       for business but complications for policymakers.     Madam Speaker, labor unions were initially created to  ensure fair wages and fair working conditions for employees. Today,  Americans are more prosperous than ever.   While I support the freedom of an individual to join a labor union,  the necessity that required labor unions is waning as wages increase  and, subsequently, union membership decreases.   Why would we now pass a bill that is diametrically in opposition to  the benefits that have been enjoyed by this country?   And, again, I would like to emphasize that State participation in the  Healthy Adult Opportunity demonstration is optional. If this  demonstration project does not fit the needs or the goals of a State  Medicaid program, they do not have to participate.   As the Republican leader of the Energy and Commerce Health  Subcommittee, I believe conversations like this are best to occur at  the committee level first, where Members can call witnesses and have a  serious discussion.   Do you know what? Regular order can be your friend. It doesn't appear  that Democrats are taking this seriously.   Finally, Republicans remain committed to helping all Americans in  need, including those in Puerto Rico, but a thorough evaluation of best  and most accountable allocation of resources is needed. We support our  fellow Americans in Puerto Rico and will continue to find ways to  ensure their recovery.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question, ``no''  on the rule, ``no'' on the underlying measures, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I did want to speak in opposition to H.  Res. 826. It is indeed a political exercise, and I am disappointed that  the Democrats have decided to discuss the Healthy Adult Opportunity  demonstration in this manner.   If we are to have legitimate debate on this optional policy, then we  should do so in a hearing. We should do so in  [[Page H873]]  a hearing in our committee. That is why the Energy and Commerce  Committee Republican Leader Walden and I sent a letter to Chairman  Pallone to request such a hearing. We should be asking the questions of  the agencies and the States that are deciding as to whether or not they  want to utilize this option, a new section 1115 waiver for a very  specific population.   This optional demonstration changes nothing for children, seniors, or  individuals with disabilities.   The comments about the State of Texas are absolutely erroneous. Texas  did not expand Medicaid. This only applies to the Healthy Adult  expansion population, not to the traditional mandatory populations.   All essential health benefits requirements would remain in place, and  States do not have to take the option. States can maintain the status  quo and continue to operate their Medicaid programs as they were before  this opportunity was presented to them.   Again, this is an option. Give States flexibility. States are great  laboratories of innovation. We should let them innovate.
