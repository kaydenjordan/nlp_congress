 Mr. Speaker, with respect, I quote Mr. McKinley: ``We have  to do this for the people of West Virginia and around the country.''  And I agree, and this is why we need the stream protection rule.   It is a commonsense approach to minimizing the impacts to surface  water and groundwater from coal mining.   In Appalachia alone, mountaintop removal has been responsible for the  destruction of 2,000 miles of streams. Peer reviewed studies have  linked mountaintop removal mining to cancer, birth defects, and serious  health problems for residents living near these mining sites.   Just look at my Virginia map. The highest death rates in the State  and the most chronic diseases are in the coal fields.                                time  1430    I saw this firsthand while I was Lieutenant Governor of Virginia for  8 years, when mountaintop removal mining became the most prevalent coal  mining technique in central Appalachia.   That is why this is so important. Communities near coal mining sites  have a right to know what is in their water because it impacts their  livelihood and their lifespan.   This rule includes commonsense monitoring of streams--many of which  are important drinking water sources--for pollutants such as lead,  selenium, and manganese. Basic monitoring for these toxins is  essential, given their potential impacts on human health and the  environment.   The rule also requires that streams and lands disturbed by surface  coal mining be restored. This would result in the protection or  restoration of approximately 6,000 miles of streams and 52,000 acres of  forest over the next two decades.   This is really important because we know the contamination of streams  by coal mining pollution threatens everything from fishing and outdoor  recreation to small businesses like restaurants and farms that are  relying on clean, safe water. This rule is an appropriate balancing act  between our energy needs and our environmental protections, and it is  also appropriately flexible to coal mining companies.   Most importantly, the Congressional Review Act doesn't make sense  here. If you want to trim a tree, you don't chop it down and bury it  under cement so it will never grow again. The Congressional Review Act  is an extreme measure that would permanently damage our surface mining  laws. We have heard that it was a product of more than 7 years of work  and the chairman talks about the 13 hearings, but not one has been held  in the 18 months since the rule was proclaimed.   The Congressional Review Act describes the vast amount of work that  the Office of Surface Mining did in order to create this rule.    Mr. Speaker, what is most dangerous is, because of the  lack of clarity regarding the Congressional Review Act's prohibition on  similar rulemakings, the agency may never take future efforts to update  and improve surface mining regulations. Even if you don't like this  surface protection rule, disallowing any future protections for the  water and health of communities living near coal mining operations  makes no sense at all.   I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill.
