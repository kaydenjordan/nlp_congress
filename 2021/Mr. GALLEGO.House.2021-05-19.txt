 Madam Speaker, when I joined the Marine Corps, the most  sacred part of my oath was to defend the Constitution of the United  States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. I took that oath  again when I was sworn into office as a Member of Congress. I never  thought I would have to defend this oath against domestic enemies on  the floor of Congress--but on January 6, I did.   Democracy is fragile. We have seen it across the world: When leaders  cower in the face of an attack on democracy, it can be lost. Let's be  clear: Democracy itself was violently attacked on January 6. If we  don't stand up for it, it will happen again. If we don't tell the truth  about what happened on January 6, it will happen again. If we don't  have swift and harsh accountability for everyone involved in January 6,  it will happen again.   If all of us don't stand up to traitors and cowards in defense of our  Constitution, January 6 will happen again. That is why all of us have  an obligation today to defend our democracy and support the creation of  a national commission to investigate the January 6 attack, because it  can never be allowed to happen again.
