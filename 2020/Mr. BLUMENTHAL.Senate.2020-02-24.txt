 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Ms. Betty  Colbert on the occasion of her retirement from her position as program  assistant for the U.S. Senate Youth Program, USSYP, after 57 years of  remarkable service.   Ms. Colbert started working for the USSYP during its first program in  1963 and has continued her impressive tenure ever since. With her  guidance, the program has provided unparalleled educational  opportunities and experiences for countless high school students.   Her involvement with the program started thanks to her late husband,  Mr. George Colbert, a Tuskegee airman who served as Mr. Randy Hearst's  driver while Mr. Hearst was helping to develop the USSYP. Despite  working full time with the National Institutes of Health, Ms. Colbert  took leave each year in order to devote herself to the USSYP's  administration. A thoughtful, giving woman, she took a hands-on  approach, doing everything from taking calls from Senate offices and  the White House to making sure each participating student got an  individual flag flown over the Capitol to recognize their  accomplishment.   The success of USSYP alumni is in part thanks to Ms. Colbert's  tireless efforts. I participate in the program every year, including  serving as cochair in 2019, and I can attest firsthand to her unfailing  work ethic and the level of care she puts in to every aspect of the  USSYP.   Students, Senators, and staff members have all bore witness to Ms.  Colbert's extraordinary commitment to her role. Not only does she  ensure everything runs smoothly for all involved, but she also focuses  on the small details. Her driven, considerate nature plays a  significant part in giving students the most enjoyable and  transformative experience possible. Ms. Colbert leaves behind a legacy  that will continue to positively shape the USSYP for years to come.   I applaud her over half a century of service and hope my colleagues  will join me in congratulating Ms. Betty Colbert on her well-earned  retirement.
