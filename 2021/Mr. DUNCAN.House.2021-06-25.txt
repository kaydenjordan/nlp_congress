 Mr. Speaker, this CRA is another act by the Biden  administration to undercut American energy production. It is plain and  simple.   In committee, I offered an amendment to this resolution that would  simply express Congress' disapproval for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline,  which would bring Russian gas to Europe.   Now, for the entire Trump administration, Democrats were obsessed  with imagined Russian influence over his policies, repeatedly calling  him a Russian agent. If Trump had waived sanctions on a Russian company  and a friend of Vladimir Putin, like President Biden just did, there  would be an immediate call for an investigation. You guys would  probably try to impeach him again.   President Biden just killed the Keystone pipeline and continues to  hamstring domestic producers, particularly smaller producers, killing  American jobs and American energy production. It is truly baffling and  illogical to me that he is willing to greenlight Russian energy  projects while he kills American projects and kills American jobs.    You know, the irony is that these energy-destroying policies actually  have a negative impact on the environment. Think about this: Russian  natural gas exported to Europe has a lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions  profile that is 41 percent higher than American LNG exported to Europe.  If Europe were to switch from dirtier Russian gas to clean-burning U.S.  natural gas through LNG exports, global emissions would actually go  down by 70 million tons each year.   The United States is the number one oil and gas producer in the  world, but we also lead the world in emissions reduction, something you  all don't want to acknowledge.   Putin would love nothing more than for America to be energy  dependent, and President Biden is helping him achieve this goal. And  Vladimir Putin is laughing.   I urge my colleagues to defend American energy production and vote  against this resolution.
