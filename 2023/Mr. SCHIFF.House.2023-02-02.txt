 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this  resolution.   First, as to the false pretext, two members of the Republican  Conference were removed from committees for inciting violence and  encouraging violence against their colleagues. There is nothing at all  at issue like that here.   If you want to introduce a resolution to condemn someone for inciting  violence against a colleague or against people here in Congress,  introduce a resolution against Donald J. Trump. No one has incited more  violence against this Chamber than Donald Trump.   Now, let me talk about anti-Semitism.   Do not insult our intelligence by suggesting this is about anti- Semitism. If you want to introduce a resolution against someone guilty  of anti-Semitism, then introduce a resolution against someone dining  with anti-Semites, someone dining with white nationalists, members of  your Conference who are speaking at white nationalist rallies.   Introduce a resolution against Donald J. Trump, Marjorie Taylor  Greene, Paul Gosar, and others, but do not--do not--insult our  intelligence by saying this is about anti-Semitism.   Vote ``no'' on this resolution.
