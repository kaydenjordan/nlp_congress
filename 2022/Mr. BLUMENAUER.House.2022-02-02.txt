 Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, a careful examination of this bill shows  many bipartisan proposals. One area of bipartisan agreement is that for  too long America has been too weak in its engagement with China.   The Chinese Government is strengthening its economic power while  doubling down on religious persecution and forced labor. Those  practices undercut the competitiveness of American workers and  business. Congress must step up and confront China head on--our trade  title does just that.   Those damaged by trade, whether workers, business, or farmers will  benefit from a dramatically improved trade adjustment assistance  program, which expired in June and completely phases out in July. Our  provisions modernizing and reauthorizing GSP and MTB will improve  American competitiveness and labor standards around the globe.   And we get tough on China by closing the de minimus loophole that  allows $800 per day per person for products undoubtedly, including  forced labor, intellectual property theft, and illegal goods. China  doesn't give us reciprocity on de minimus--their threshold is less than  $8. They are not about to subject their companies to duty-free,  unregulated American competition.   Allowing items like air conditioners, microwaves, and suitcases under  MTB doesn't help American manufacturing, it undercuts it and directly  undermines Congress' goal of rebuilding domestic capacity.   Our changes restore the programs back to their original intent of  supporting American workers and domestic manufacturing, not  undercutting American suppliers.   At its simplest, this legislation meets workers' needs and bolsters  America's capacity to compete. If you want to support the American  worker and get tough on China, you have a chance to do so with this  bill.   Madam Speaker, I urge everyone to vote in the affirmative.
