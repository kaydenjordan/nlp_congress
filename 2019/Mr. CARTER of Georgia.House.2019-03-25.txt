 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  74th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron for being awarded the Gallant Unit  Citation on March 14.   An extraordinarily high honor for these pilots based at Moody Air  Force Base in the First Congressional District of Georgia, this is only  the fifth time ever the Gallant Unit Citation has been awarded, and the  first since 2001. It was created to honor remarkable acts of heroism  while engaged with an opposing foreign force on or since 9/11.   The 74th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron earned the award while they  were deployed in Turkey, flying for over 10,000 hours in Syria,  targeting objectives controlled by ISIS. Their efforts were critical to  the elimination of ISIS from 99 percent of Iraq and Syria.   I want to thank the 74th Fighter Squadron for their hard work and  sacrifices to make the entire world a safer place to live. I am also  very proud to see this work recognized.   Congratulations.                            ____________________
