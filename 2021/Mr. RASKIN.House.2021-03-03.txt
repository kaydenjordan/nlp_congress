 Mr. Speaker, the amendment proposes to knock out the  [[Page H1025]]  heart of the Honest Ads Act, so the public won't know who is purchasing  ads online. That is the exact opposite of what we need to be doing. We  need far greater transparency about who is polluting the airwaves and  who is polluting the internet with propaganda and fake news. We should  know who is paying for all of that.   This used to be a very solid bipartisan commitment between Democrats  and Republicans. Everybody agreed there should at least be disclosure  of campaign spending.   Now, they not only want to put out propaganda online, but they don't  even want anybody to know who is paying for it. That is the opposite  direction that we should be moving in America.   We should be defending everybody's right to vote, everybody's right  to participate against all of the schemes to undermine voting rights,  and we should make sure that everybody knows who is putting money into  the political system.   I urge a ``no'' vote on that amendment.
