 For 43 years, Ms. Black has served the Nation with honor  and professionalism. Now, as she retires from her position as Deputy  Director, General and Flag Officer Matters in the Office of the Deputy  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Military Personnel and Policy, we  are privileged to thank her for her four decades of service.    During Cheryl's time with the Department of Defense, she  worked diligently to ensure every general and flag officer recommended  for promotion or appointment was thoroughly vetted prior to a  nomination being submitted to the Secretary of Defense, the President,  and the Congress for confirmation. Because of her dedication to our  general and flag officer corps, we all live in a safer and more  prosperous nation.    Mr. President, we are proud to honor the achievements of  Ms. Cheryl Black, and on behalf of a grateful nation, we salute her 43  years of service to our great Nation. We offer her our thanks and  congratulate her on a well-earned retirement.                            ____________________
