 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, the Biden border crisis continues to  rage. Last month, U.S. Customs and Border Protection encountered  164,303 individuals attempting to illegally cross our southern border.  That is more than twice the number of encounters Customs and Border  Protection had the previous October and the highest October number ever  recorded by Customs and Border Protection. In all, more than 1.7  million migrants were apprehended attempting to cross our southern  border in fiscal year 2021--the highest number ever.   We are in the midst of a very serious crisis, and the response from  Democrats and the administration? Well, mostly crickets. Democrats seem  to hope that ignoring the border situation will make it go away or at  least ensure that no one pays attention. I am pretty sure the President  and his administration spent more time earlier this year fighting  against the use of the word ``crisis'' to describe the situation at the  border than they did actually thinking about how they might deal with  the influx. Apparently, the administration is still--still--trying to  avoid the ``crisis'' label judging by a recent hearing wherein the  President's nominee to head Customs and Border Protection seemed to  carefully avoid referring to the situation at the border as a  ``crisis.''   If the highest number of border encounters ever recorded isn't a  crisis, I am not sure what is. The situation at our southern border is  out of control. It is a security crisis, it is a manpower and  enforcement crisis, and it is a humanitarian crisis--although, again,  you would never guess it from the Democrats' behavior.   Despite the fact that this crisis has been raging for the best part  of a year now, Democrats and the administration have taken essentially  no meaningful action to address the situation, and that is not the  worst of it. The Democrats' policies are actually making the situation  worse.   Among other things, the President has significantly limited the  ability of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border  Protection to enforce immigration laws, and arrests in the interior of  the country dropped steeply under this administration. The Washington  Post recently reported:         Immigration arrests in the interior of the United States       fell in fiscal 2021 to the lowest level in more than a       decade.   [[Page S8410]]     The practical effect of the President's immigration policies has been  to encourage new waves of illegal immigration. It is hardly surprising.  If you think that your chances of staying in the United States are  good, even if you are here illegally, you are likely much more inclined  to undertake the journey in the first place.   The administration's actions--or lack thereof--have been compounded  by the actions of Democrats in Congress who have been doing their best  to guarantee widespread amnesty. Democrats have repeatedly attempted to  include some form of amnesty in their tax-and-spending spree. While  they have been partially foiled by the rulings of the Senate  Parliamentarian, the latest version of their bill still contains  provisions to grant de facto amnesty to many illegal immigrants.   Their spending spree also deliberately lacks restrictions on Federal  funding going to individuals in the country illegally, which means that  illegal immigrants could end up receiving the $3,000-per-year child  allowance, housing vouchers, and more. One analysis suggests that  illegal immigrants could collect $10.5 billion in child allowance  payments next year.   I haven't even mentioned reports that the Biden administration has  apparently been contemplating settling lawsuits brought by individuals,  who came here illegally, with payments of up to $450,000 per person-- $450,000. That is right. That is more than four times as much as the  government gives to the families of soldiers killed in action and nine  times--nine times--as much as the government gives to an individual  wrongly imprisoned for 1 year. The administration has suggested that  payments will not actually be that high, but even a settlement half  that size would dwarf the payments that we give to the families of  fallen soldiers.   Immigrants have helped make this country what it is today, and I am a  strong supporter of legal immigration, including temporary worker  visas, like H-2B visas, which help South Dakota employers and many  others address hiring challenges, but, again, immigration has to be  legal. Encouraging illegal immigration, as the Democrats are doing,  presents a serious security risk because it makes it easier for  everyone from terrorists to drug traffickers to enter the country  unidentified, to say nothing of drugs like fentanyl and other illegal  items.   Encouraging illegal immigration through lax immigration enforcement  and amnesty also undermines respect for the rule of law. The area of  immigration should not be an exception to the principle that the law  has to be followed and respected. Yet that is basically what Democrats'  policies are saying--that the law doesn't matter when it comes to  immigration.   Finally, we need to get away from any idea that there is anything  compassionate about policies that encourage individuals to come here  illegally. Attempting to enter the country illegally is fraught with  danger, from natural perils like weather, disease, and exposure, to  exploitation by smugglers and traffickers. Amnesty and lax enforcement  policies encourage thousands more individuals and families to expose  themselves to the dangers of an illegal border crossing.   President Biden and Democrats could help stem this crisis right now  by making it clear that immigration law will be enforced and that the  only acceptable way to enter the United States is to come here legally.  Unfortunately, it seems much more likely that the President will  continue to ignore this crisis and deemphasize immigration enforcement  while Democrats in Congress will continue to push for amnesty. It is a  serious failure of responsibility on the President's part and one that  will continue to have serious and sometimes deadly consequences.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
