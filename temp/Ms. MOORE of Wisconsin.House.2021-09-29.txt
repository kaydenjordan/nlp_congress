 Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge my  colleagues to support raising the debt limit and to keep the main thing  the main thing.   I really don't have time to address the Taliban, Afghanistan, the  southern border, socialism, and all the rest of the stuff that has been  raised. But I do have time to talk about blackmail that was raised  here. This is the failure to join the Democrats in raising the debt  ceiling to pay for one thing: the $2 trillion that Republicans ran up  providing tax cuts to the wealthiest corporations and individuals.    The blackmail is that they want to force us to restore those cuts to  the wealthiest people and to raise taxes on regular Americans by trying  to upend our initiative to provide, for example, the child tax credit  and to blackmail us into not providing those benefits.   We have heard a great deal, Madam Speaker, about how this will hurt  the markets and how this will create chaos, but who will really pay the  price?   It is everyday people and ordinary people, those Social Security  recipients and veterans whose benefits will be delayed; people who  won't be able to get a car or a washer and dryer at a reasonable  interest rate; and those thousands of people who will lose jobs. That  is where the damage will come in.   Madam Speaker, instead of paying these partisan games, I urge my  colleagues across the aisle to act responsibly. The full faith and  credit of the United States should never be put in jeopardy. And by the  way, people are not leverage.
