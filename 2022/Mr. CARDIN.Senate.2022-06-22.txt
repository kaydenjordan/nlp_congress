 Madam President, I take this time to celebrate the 50th  anniversary of the enactment of title IX. It was passed and enacted on  June 23, 50 years ago, when President Nixon signed title IX of the  Education Amendments of 1972 into law, which explicitly added the  following sex discrimination provision into the law:         No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex,       be excluded from participating in, be denied the benefits of,       or be subjected to discrimination under any education program       or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.    Broadly speaking, title IX prohibits any institution that receives  Federal education funding from discriminating against students or  employees on the basis of sex.   Today, I would like to reflect on how far we have come in terms of  combating sex discrimination in the United States, how far we still  need to go, and what steps we can take as we strive to guarantee equal  rights and equal justice under the law for all Americans, regardless of  their gender identification or sexual orientation.   Sex discrimination comes in many forms and historically has included  discrimination based on pregnancy or sex stereotypes. We have seen sex  discrimination that includes sexual harassment in our schools and in  the workplace, dating violence, and sex-based stalking. Such sexual  harassment and discrimination often leads to higher rates of  depression, anxiety, and suicide attempts for the women affected and  can lead to higher rates of dropping out of school.   Congress responded, in part, by passing the Violence Against Women  Act in 1994 and recently reauthorizing it and strengthening it in 2022.   Title IX is certainly responsible for much of the progress women have  made in the last half a century. Today, women earn nearly 60 percent of  the doctoral, master's, bachelor's, and associate degrees conferred in  this Nation. A stubborn disparity still exists, however, with respect  to women--and, in particular, women of color--earning science,  technology, engineering, and math--STEM--degrees.   In terms of sports, we have seen an enormous increase in women and  girls participating in athletic activities, with more than a 1,000- percent increase in high school-level sports and a 600-percent increase  in collegiate-level sports--an increase that helps them develop  leadership and teamwork skills and, in some cases, earn athletic  scholarships and become professional athletes.   In professions where women represent a majority of employees, women  are still held back from obtaining leadership positions. For example,  women represent more than three-quarters of the entire healthcare  workforce, yet just 27 percent of chief executive officer positions in  our hospital systems.   Looking at title IX progress and the road ahead, the National  Coalition for Women and Girls in Education, the National Women's Law  Center, and others recently released a report, ``Title IX at 50.'' The  report takes a look at title IX's impact over the last half a century,  celebrating the significant progress to end sex discrimination in  education while recognizing the work that remains to be done.   Let me quote from that report:         Despite the tremendous progress towards gender equity in       the last 50 years, students today continue to be deprived of       their education because of sex discrimination. . . . Schools       are not adequately protecting students from sexual       harassment, sex- and race-based discipline, and       discrimination based on their sexual orientation, gender       identity, or pregnancy or parenting status. Twenty percent of       girls have been victims of sexual assault or attempted sexual       assault while in high school, and 1 in 5 women and 1 in 4       transgender or gender nonconforming students are sexually       assaulted on college campuses.        Women and girls and LGBTQI+ students continue to face sex       discrimination in athletics, in STEM and [career and       technical education] programs, and in sex-segregated       classrooms and schools.    We still have progress that we need to achieve.   I support the U.S. Department of Education's effort to undo the Trump  administration's weakening of civil rights protections for student  survivors and to ensure the protection of the LGBTQ community and  students in the face of mounting violent threats, hateful rhetoric, and  cruel attacks from State officials.   As the Women's Law Center commented recently on the enhanced title IX  protections:         We urge the swift release of a robust proposed rule by the       Department of Education by the 50th anniversary of Title IX       on June 23, 2022. . . . Students are protesting across the       country, demanding that their schools meaningfully address       sex-based harassment; they are in desperate need of Title       IX's full protections. The proposed rule is critical to begin       the regulatory process for undoing the harmful changes made       to the Title IX rule in 2020 [by the Trump administration] .       . . and to address mounting threats to LGBTQI+ students and       school communities. While sex-based harassment in schools       remains pervasive, the 2020 Rule pushes schools to ignore       many instances of sex-based harassment, leaving scores of       survivors without recourse . . . [which] are harmful to       student survivors, [and] deter reporting. These harms       especially fall on women and girls of color, disabled       survivors, LGBTQI+ survivors, and pregnant and parenting       survivors, all who face stereotypes casting them as less       credible when they report sexual misconduct.    As I said, we still have a road ahead of us.   Let me close by saying that when it comes to equality for women in  our laws and Constitution, there should be no deadline on equality.  Most Americans already think the Equal Rights Amendment is part of our  Constitution. The needed 38 States have completed their legal  ratification. We now need to remove any ambiguity and finally complete  the ratification of the 28th amendment to our Constitution.   I have introduced bipartisan legislation with Senator Murkowski, S.J.  Res. 1, which would rescind the ERA arbitrary ratification deadline.  The House has passed this legislation, and it has 51 cosponsors in the  Senate.   After the Equal Rights Amendment itself was first passed by the  Senate in 1972, Congress changed the 7-year deadline to 10 years,  setting a precedent for such activity and authority. There is no  deadline in the ERA itself. Legal enactment of the Equal Rights  Amendment to the Constitution should take place 2 years after two- thirds of the House and Senate and three-fourths of the States ratify.  Nevada ratified the ERA in March of 2017; Illinois, in May of 2018; and  Virginia, the 38th State, in January of 2020.   Article V of the Constitution contains no time limits for the  ratification of amendments. The States finally ratified the 27th  Amendment in 1992 regarding congressional pay raises more than 200  years after Congress proposed it in 1789 as part of the original Bill  of Rights. That amendment is now part of our Constitution. The ERA time  limit was contained in a joint resolution, not the actual text of the  amendment.   The ERA would simply provide that ``equality of rights under law  shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any State on  account of sex.'' The amendment also provides that ``Congress shall  have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions  of this article.''   Just like with title IX, women are not asking for privileges; they  are simply asking to be treated equally under the law and to be  afforded the same legal rights as men under the law.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  vote at 6 p.m. on the motion to discharge the nomination of Hernan D.  [[Page S3061]]  Vera to be United States District Judge for the Central District of  California.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.
