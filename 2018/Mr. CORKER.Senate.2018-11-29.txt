 Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.

The estimated cost is $655 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security of the United States by improving the       security of a NATO ally which is an important force for       political stability and economic progress in Europe. This       sale is consistent with U.S. initiatives to provide key       allies in the region with modern systems that will enhance       interoperability with U.S. forces and increase security.        Poland intends to use these defense articles and services       to modernize its armed forces and expand its capability to       strengthen its homeland defense and deter regional threats.       This will contribute to Poland's interoperability with the       United States and other allies. Poland will have no       difficulty absorbing this equipment into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment will not alter the       basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be Lockheed Martin, Grand       Prairie, TX. There are no known offset agreements proposed in       connection with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will require U.S.       Government or contractor representatives to travel to Poland       for program management reviews to support the program. Travel       is expected to occur approximately twice per year as needed       to support equipment fielding and training.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 19-07       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) is a       highly mobile, all-weather indirect area fire artillery       system. The HIMARS mission is to supplement cannon artillery       to deliver a large volume of firepower within a short time       against critical time-sensitive targets. At shorter ranges,       HIMARS complements tube artillery with heavy barrages against       assaulting forces as well as in the counter-fire, or defense       suppression roles. The highest level of classified       information that could be disclosed by a proposed sale,       production, or by testing of the end item is SECRET; the       highest level that must be disclosed for production,       maintenance, or training is CONFIDENTIAL. Reverse engineering       could reveal SECRET information. Launcher platform software,       weapon operational software, command and control special       application software, and command and control loadable       munitions module software are considered UNCLASSIFIED. The       system specifications and limitations are classified SECRET.       Vulnerability data is classified up to SECRET.       Countermeasures, counter-countermeasures, vulnerability/      susceptibility analyses, and threat definitions are       classified SECRET.        2. Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) Unitary       M31A1 uses a Unitary High Explosive (HE) 200 pound class       warhead along with GPS aided Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)       based guidance and control for  [[Page S7232]]       ground-to-ground precision point targeting. The GMLRS Unitary       uses an Electronic Safe and Arm Fuze (ESAF) along with a nose       mounted proximity sensor to give enhanced effectiveness to       the GMLRS Unitary rocket by providing tri-mode warhead       functionality with point detonate, point detonate with       programmable delay, or Height of Burst proximity function.       GMLRS Unitary M31A1 end-item is comprised of a Rocket Pod       Container (RPC) and six GMLRS Unitary Rocket(s). The RPC is       capable of holding six (6) GMLRS Unitary Rockets and can be       loaded in a M270A1 launcher (tracked), HIMARS M142 launcher,       or European M270 (203 configuration that meets the GMLRS       interface requirements) launcher from which the GMLRS rocket       can be launched. The highest classification level for release       of the GMLRS Unitary is SECRET, based upon the software, sale       or testing of the end item. The highest level of       classification that must be disclosed for production,       maintenance, or training is CONFIDENTIAL.        3. Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System Alternative Warhead       (GMLRS-AW) M30A1. The GMLRS-AW, M30A1, is the next design       increment of the GMLRS rocket. The GMLRS-AW M30A1 hardware is       over 90% common with the M31A1 GMLRS Unitary hardware. The       operational range is between 15-70 kilometers, with an       accuracy of less than 15 meters Circular Error Probability at       all ranges, when using inertial guidance with Global       Positioning System (GPS) augmentation. The system uses a       proximity sensor fuze mode with a 10 meter height of burst.        The Alternative Warhead carries a 200 pound fragmentation       assembly filled with high explosives which, upon detonation,       accelerates two layers of pre-formed tungsten fragments       optimized for effectiveness against large area and       imprecisely located targets. The GMLRS-AW provides an area       target attack capability that is treaty compliant (no un-      exploded ordnance). It provides a 24 hour, all weather, long       range attack capability against personnel, soft and lightly       armored targets, and air defense targets. The GMLRS-AW uses       the same motor, guidance and control systems fuze mechanisms,       and proximity sensors as the M31A1 GMLRS Unitary. The highest       classification level for release of the GMLRS-AW is SECRET,       based upon the software, sale or testing of the end item. The       highest level of classification that must be disclosed for       production, maintenance, or training is CONFIDENTIAL.        4. The highest classification level for release of the       ATACMS Unitary M57 FMS Variant is SECRET, based upon the       software. The highest level of classified information that       could be disclosed by a sale or by testing of the end item is       SECRET; the highest level that must be disclosed for       production, maintenance, or training is CONFIDENTIAL. Reverse       engineering could reveal CONFIDENTIAL information. Fire       Direction System, Data Processing Unit, and special       Application software is classified SECRET. Communications       Distribution Unit software is classified CONFIDENTIAL. The       system specifications and limitations are classified       CONFIDENTIAL. Vulnerability Data, countermeasures,       vulnerability/susceptibility analyses, and threat definitions       are classified SECRET or CONFIDENTIAL.        5. The GPS Precise Positioning Service (PPS) component of       the HIMARS munitions (GMLRS Unitary, Alternative Warhead, and       ATACMS Unitary) is also contained in the launcher Fire       Direction System, is classified SECRET, and is considered       SENSITIVE. The GMLRS M30A1, M31A1, ATACMS M57 and HIMARS M142       launchers employ an inertial navigational system that is       aided by a Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module       (SAASM) equipped GPS receiver. To that end, this system       requires encryption keys controlled by, and issued by, the       National Security Agency. No GPS PPS design information,       including GPS software algorithms, will be disclosed in the       course of this sale to country. Susceptibility of GMLRS to       diversion or exploitation is considered low risk.        6. AFATDS is a multi-service (U.S. Army and U.S. Marine       Corp) automated, expert decision support system used for       Command, Control, Communications and integration and       synchronization of fires on ground targets during all phases       of military conflict. AFATDS provides the automated tools       that significantly augment the capability of fire support       coordinators, fire support asset commanders, and their       respective staffs at every echelon during the planning and       execution of fire support on the dynamic battlefields in       support of the Maneuver Commander and his plans.        7. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures or       equivalent systems which might reduce system effectiveness or       be used in the development of a system with similar or       advanced capabilities.        8. A determination has been made that the Government of       Poland can provide substantially the same degree of       protection for the sensitive technology being released as the       U.S. Government. This sale is necessary in furtherance of the       U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives outlined       in the Policy Justification.        9. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the Government of Poland.                            ____________________
