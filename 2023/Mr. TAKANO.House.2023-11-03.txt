 Mr. Speaker, I rise to acknowledge the service of one of  the most effective staffers this Chamber has ever known, Elizabeth  Austin-Mackenzie. As staff director of the Health Subcommittee, she  shepherded many of the most significant achievements of the House  Committee on Veterans' Affairs over the last 6 years.   Quiet and unassuming, Elizabeth has one of the sharpest minds I have  worked with. She has spent the majority of her professional life  advocating for this Nation's veterans with an unflappable determination  to doing right by them.   She has always advised me with a clear-eyed perspective and guided  her staff with an endless capacity for kindness and a good laugh.   In 2020, when many offices struggled to find ways to work effectively  from home, Elizabeth ensured the Health Subcommittee didn't miss a  beat.   It is safe to say that no congressional staffer did more for veterans  in 2020 than Elizabeth Mackenzie. The landmark legislation, the SAVE  LIVES Act, which vaccinated tens of thousands of veterans, their  spouses, and their caregivers, was made possible by her determination.    We are saddened to lose this brilliant, seemingly tireless advocate  to the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, but I know she will  continue to do great things for veterans and this country.                            ____________________
