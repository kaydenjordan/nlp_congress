 Mr. Speaker, understand this: the Republicans planned  to exempt Members of Congress from the provisions of TrumpCare until  they got caught.   So here are five numbers that show just how deadly and dangerous the  Republican bill is:   Twenty-four million is the number of children, adults, and veterans  whose health insurance will be ripped away.   $880 billion is the size of the cut to Medicaid, threatening health  care and long-term care for 74 million people: children, pregnant  women, the elderly, and the disabled.   $600 billion is the tax cut that goes to millionaires and  billionaires and corporations.   758 percent is the premium increase a 64-year-old making $26,000 a  year will pay because of the Republican age tax.   Seventeen percent is the percent of Americans who supported TrumpCare  before they made it worse.  [[Page H4142]]    The Republicans' attempt to improve TrumpCare is like trying to douse  a dumpster fire with gasoline. This bill is a disaster, and anyone who  votes for it does so at their extreme peril. The American people are  watching, and they will not forget.
