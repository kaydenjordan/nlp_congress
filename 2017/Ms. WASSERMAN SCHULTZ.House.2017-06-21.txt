 Mr. Speaker, I stand before you with your  congressional women's softball team, who are tanned, rested, and ready  to beat the press tonight.   Our bipartisan team has been practicing for the last 3 months at 7 in  the morning, two to three mornings a week, with batting practice at  night at the cages at the Nationals training academy.   We have been singularly focused on two things--I know it doesn't make  sense, because that would mean it wasn't singularly--making sure that  we can continue to raise awareness about the risk that young women face  of breast cancer and to make sure that we can shine a spotlight on the  fact that young women can and do get breast cancer.   This is our ninth annual game. It is the eighth time that we are  playing the common ``enemy''--we say that affectionately--the female  Capitol press corps. They have been incredible partners in helping this  year cross the incredible milestone of raising more than $1 million for  the Young Survival Coalition. We are so proud of that.   We want to thank our coaches who have been remarkable through all  these years. Of course, we have our head coach, Torie Barnes, Jo Ann  Emerson's daughter, who was the cofounder of this game 9 years ago; our  own House favorite, Natalie Buchanan, who is an amazing new mom who has  [[Page H5032]]  been out there with us, in spite of just having a baby a few short  months ago; Coach Jim, who has been amazing as well; and, of course,  our very own colleague, Coach Ed Perlmutter from the great State of  Colorado.   Come on out tonight at 7 p.m. at Watkins Recreation Center, 420 12th  Street, SE. Turn right at the CVS.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Mrs. Roby), my  cocaptain, friend, and fellow appropriator.
