 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call on my colleagues to  consider the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, legislation that  would preserve the longstanding Hyde amendment.   For the first time in over 40 years, the administration's proposed  budget does not include Hyde protections, protections that have long  ensured taxpayer dollars are not used to fund abortions.   Mr. Speaker, Hyde protections have saved 2.4 million babies.  Reversing this longstanding pro-life policy is wrong. The right to life  is the most fundamental of all of our rights. We must defend those who  cannot defend themselves.   I will always lend my voice to the voiceless and fight to ensure that  Iowa taxpayers are never forced to fund abortions against their will.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committees on Energy  and Commerce, Ways and Means, and the Judiciary, be discharged from  further consideration of H.R. 18, and I ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.
