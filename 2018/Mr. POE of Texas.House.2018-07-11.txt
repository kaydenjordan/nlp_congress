 Mr. Speaker, millions of data sheets spit out of  the printer inside a thick-walled, secure facility. Across the top are  Americans' names, a list of phone numbers dialed, the time and date  called, and the frequency in which they called or texted a person.   ``Who is doing this?'' you might ask. A criminal organization? A  private investigator? Who is intentionally stalking and gathering data  on innocent American citizens without their knowledge?   Well, it is not a nefarious organization operating behind closed  doors. It is not the Russians. It is the spying eyes of the United  States Federal Government.   In the aftermath of 9/11, the government authorized once-secret  programs by the NSA to collect information on bad actors, primarily  terrorists, who wish to create mayhem. They were terrorists overseas.   As the subcommittee chairman of Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and  Trade, I agree that we should go after terrorists. Our government  should use techniques they have on those people who wish to destroy  America and find out what those terrorists are doing.   But despite the overall intention of the law, the program has been  corrupted. Not only does the NSA collect information on terrorists,  which they should do, but it collects data on ordinary American  citizens, including communications, emails, and text messages.   The government does not have a specific Fourth Amendment warrant to  collect and search this data on Americans, but it does it anyway. The  Fourth Amendment says the warrantless search and seizure is  unconstitutional without a probable cause warrant. But the government  ignores the Constitution.   This sensitive information is placed into a searchable database by  the government, a secret database. Sometimes the government decides to  go into that database that was seized without a Fourth Amendment  warrant and checks to see how many times a name comes up. They take  that information and do a reverse search, checking to see if the  citizen's identifying information is in the database.   Remember, Mr. Speaker, this is done by our government on Americans,  in secret, without a Fourth Amendment warrant.   For years, the NSA has refused to provide data on the number of  Americans swept up in their secret searches. I have advocated for years  that the NSA level with Americans, our government, and the Congress as  to how much information they are seizing.   Several months ago, the House voted for a flawed FISA bill, the  Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which, unfortunately,  reauthorized the warrantless surveillance of American citizens. The  only good thing to come out of this spying bill is a hard-fought  provision releasing the numbers of Americans wrapped up in government  spying. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, they paint a grim picture for the  privacy of Fourth Amendment protections.   In 2017 alone, the NSA unconstitutionally gathered data on 7,512 U.S.  persons, a search without a probable cause warrant. This is up from  5,288 in 2016.   According to a previous report by The Washington Post, 90 percent of  the account holders whose communications were collected were not  targets. That means the government was just fishing around in the data  they had collected and searching information on Americans without a  warrant.   Privacy must not be forsaken on the false altar of national security.  As a former judge, I am very concerned about the loss of our Fourth  Amendment right of privacy in the United States based on this  unconstitutional action by the NSA.    The Fourth Amendment is sacred to this country and to the Founders  who drafted it. It is up to Congress to uphold Americans' Fourth  Amendment rights. We must reform an article called 702 to require that  if the government wants to look at the data that was seized on  Americans, they do it with a search warrant, based on the Fourth  Amendment. If they don't have a search warrant based on the Fourth  Amendment, then they cannot seize and go through that information.   It is a very simple concept, Mr. Speaker, and I would hope that  Congress would act to stop our government from spying on American  citizens in the name of national security. It is unconstitutional.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, 100 years ago, on November 11, 1918,  the war to end all wars came to an end.   Over 4 million American doughboys went off to fight on the  battlefields and in the brutal trenches of Europe. Mr. Speaker, 116,000  of America's sons and daughters were killed in combat, and 200,000 more  were wounded.   All the survivors of the great World War I have since died. They are  no more. We must never forget their selfless sacrifices to make this  world a freer place.   Last year, our country finally broke ground in Washington, D.C., on a  memorial to honor their service to our country. I am privileged that  Representative Cleaver and I helped make this memorial a reality.  Forever their sacrifice for this Nation and this world will be  preserved in bronze and stone in the heart of this city.   May our country never forget their sacred pledge, recited in George  Cohan's song:       We'll be over,      We're coming over,      And we won't come back,      Till it's over, over there.    And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
