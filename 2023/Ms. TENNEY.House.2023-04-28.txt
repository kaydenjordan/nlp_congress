 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.J. Res. 39, critical  legislation to undue to Biden administration's job-crushing solar  policies.   Last year, an American solar manufacturer petitioned the Commerce  Department to investigate whether China was circumventing tariffs on  solar products by sneaking them through countries in southeast Asia.   Before that investigation even finished, President Biden issued a  proclamation to allow the imports of unfairly traded solar products  from China. Later, just as we expected, it was discovered by the  Commerce Department that China was indeed violating U.S. trade laws.   President Biden's irresponsible proclamation is a slap in the face to  American manufacturers. It allows Chinese solar companies to flood our  market with their products tariff-free, hurting American jobs.   It is the Green New Deal agenda at work. President Biden's  proclamation also sends the message to trade cheats everywhere that  U.S. trade laws don't matter. This invites even more cheating.   This is only the tip of the spear of the dangerous Green New Deal  agenda. A recent report from the Coalition for a Prosperous America  revealed that the Chinese manufacturers could earn nearly $125 billion,  and that is with a b, in U.S. renewable energy tax credits as a result  of the so-called Inflation Reduction Act.   This would be a specific boon to Chinese solar manufacturers on top  of the massive giveaway given to China by President Biden's  proclamation. We must stand with American manufacturers and jobs, not  the Chinese Communist Party, and pass this crucial legislation.                                time  0945
