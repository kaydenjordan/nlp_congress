 Madam Speaker, on this third day of SALT, my  constituents have said to me that they think the holiday season is the  perfect time to eliminate the SALT marriage penalty.   The 2017 tax law violated more than 100 years of Federal tax policy,  capping the State and local tax deduction at $10,000. That means  married couples filing jointly are constrained to the same $10,000  level that applies to individual filers.   This penalizes tens of thousands of couples in my district. In Morris  County alone, there were more than 52,000 middle-class joint filers in  2016, and well over half were above the $10,000 cap. They are now  likely subject to a marriage penalty simply for filing their taxes  jointly.   I am a member of the SALT task force, and my bipartisan bill, the  SALT  [[Page H9338]]  Relief and Marriage Penalty Elimination Act, should be the basis for  righting this wrong done to families. It will raise the SALT deduction  across the board and restore incentives for charitable giving and  homeownership.                            ____________________
