 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R.  1215, the Protecting Access to Care Act of 2017, a much needed piece of  legislation aimed at reforming medical malpractice law in order to help  drive down the cost of providing healthcare and, thereby, making it  more affordable for all Americans.   I had the privilege of practicing medicine in the great State of  Tennessee for 31 years before coming to Congress. The one thing that  took away some of the joy from that practice was the threat of  frivolous lawsuits.   Because of trial attorneys, over the years, the premiums for  malpractice insurance have ballooned to levels that make it difficult  for providers to practice and are driving more people out of practice,  away from small practices, and into large hospital systems just so they  can survive as a practitioner. Worse still, the jury awards aren't  going to the victims of actual malpractice.                                time  1430    In Tennessee, prior to implementing some malpractice reforms, over  half the premium dollars were paid out to attorneys, and less than 40  cents of every dollar paid out have gone to people who have actually  been injured. So we are not compensating the injured party.   Thankfully, States like my home State of Tennessee are taking action  and have enacted much-needed reforms in the last decade, and the costs  associated with providing care have plummeted since then. In 2008, the  Tennessee Medical Malpractice Act was signed into law and created  requirements that the plaintiff in a healthcare liability action  provide the defendant with a pre-suit notice of the claim as well as a  qualified expert to review the case and certify it has merit.   Adding onto these reforms, in 2011, the Tennessee Civil Justice Act  was signed into law, and it included a $750,000 cap for noneconomic  damages and a cap on punitive damages at the greater of twice the  compensatory damages or $500,000.   With these changes, between 2008 and 2014, the number of medical  malpractice lawsuits in Tennessee decreased by 36 percent, from 584 to  just 374. And, Mr. Chairman, between 2009 and 2014, the annual medical  malpractice premium for an OB/GYN doctor like myself decreased from  $52,000-plus to $33,000-plus, nearly a $20,000 decrease in premiums per  year.   Those of us who were here in 2009 when the Affordable Care Act was  debated remember that President Obama acknowledged that the cost of  defensive medicine was a bipartisan concern and something that he  wanted to address. Despite the fact that our legislation is modeled on  a California law that has stood the test for 40 years through both  Republican and Democratic Governors, Democrats made no serious attempt  to address medical malpractice as their healthcare bill was pushed  through, which is yet another flaw of the ACA.   Today's bill is common sense. With these reforms, we will ensure  patients, not trial attorneys, are compensated for legitimate  malpractice claims--and there are legitimate claims out there. But we  will also prevent frivolous litigation from moving forward.   For those concerned about the 10th Amendment, this bill respects  States' rights and only subjects claims with a Federal nexus to this  law, while giving a great deal of latitude to States to act in their  own accord.  [[Page H5266]]    Mr. Chairman, I loved what I did while I was in practice. I had the  chance to deliver about 5,000 babies, and it never felt like a job. It  is just what I did and enjoyed doing. But at a time when healthcare  costs are spiraling out of control, an easy fix like H.R. 1215 just  makes sense and is just another piece of the puzzle to help the costs  of healthcare go down.   I strongly support the much-needed reforms in this legislation, and I  urge my colleagues to vote in favor of final passage.   One final thing, Mr. Chairman. I have a list here of our premiums in  the State of Tennessee, and under every specialty listed here--and  there are numerous--there were dramatic decreases in each of these.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Add, at the end of the bill, the following (and amend the       table of contents accordingly):       SEC. 11. LIMITATION ON EXPERT WITNESS TESTIMONY.         (a) In General.--No person in a health care profession       requiring licensure under the laws of a State shall be       competent to testify in any court of law to establish the       following facts--        (1) the recognized standard of acceptable professional       practice and the specialty thereof, if any, that the       defendant practices, which shall be the type of acceptable       professional practice recognized in the defendant's community       or in a community similar to the defendant's community that       was in place at the time the alleged injury or wrongful       action occurred,        (2) that the defendant acted with less than or failed to       act with ordinary and reasonable care in accordance with the       recognized standard, and        (3) that as a proximate result of the defendant's negligent       act or omission, the claimant suffered injuries which would       not otherwise have occurred,      unless the person was licensed to practice, in the State or a       contiguous bordering State, a profession or specialty which       would make the person's expert testimony relevant to the       issues in the case and had practiced this profession or       specialty in one of these States during the year preceding       the date that the alleged injury or wrongful act occurred.        (b) Applicability.--The requirements set forth in       subsection (a) shall also apply to expert witnesses       testifying for the defendant as rebuttal witnesses.        (c) Waiver Authority.--The court may waive the requirements       in this subsection if it determines that the appropriate       witnesses otherwise would not be available.    The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 382, the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Roe) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, medical malpractice lawsuits in this country have  gotten out of hand, which is hurting both providers and patients.  Something must be done.   I have spent 31 years practicing medicine in Tennessee before coming  to Congress. In that time, I saw my medical malpractice insurance  premiums increase from $4,000 a year to over $50,000 a year, by the  time I left practice.   Why were the premiums so expensive? My practice group took everyone:  private insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, and the uninsured. Some  practices limit their patient populations, but when you are in rural  Appalachia, you take all comers.   The reality is, when you are taking care of patients with elevated  risk, you get more frequent negative outcomes, increasing your risk for  lawsuits, and this creates an issue for patient access to care.   Finally, right when I was leaving practice in 2008, Governor Haslam  signed into law some of the best reforms we have in Tennessee, in the  Tennessee Medical Malpractice Act, which created a 60-day notice  statute and a certificate of good faith certifying a case has merit  before it can be filed.   In 2011, Governor Haslam then signed the Tennessee Civil Justice Act  into law, which contained a restriction on who could testify as an  expert witness in medical malpractice litigation.   Too often, physicians practicing medicine are pitted in litigation  against a professional witness who has gone to medical school but  specialized in a different field and wasn't even licensed to practice  in their State or a contiguous State. Mr. Chairman, that is absolutely  wrong.   The fact is, these changes work. In Tennessee, we saw medical  malpractice premiums reduced from 2009 to 2014 by between 25 and 40  percent, depending on the specialty. OBs saw average premiums reduced  from over $52,000 to just over $33,000; neurosurgeons saw average  premiums reduced from $49,000 to $35,000; cardiovascular surgeons saw  their premiums go down from $44,000 to $31,000. There were other  changes that were put into place that helped, including caps, but the  fact was, this change had a major impact.   My amendment follows Tennessee's law and strengthens the changes  contained in the underlying text of the bill, H.R. 1215, by adding  further restrictions to those individuals who would qualify as an  expert witness for medical malpractice litigation. My amendment limits  who can be called as an expert witness, not only by the individual's  professional accreditation, but also by his or her geographic location.   The fact is, as Tennessee's law proved, we needed medical  professionals from the area where the incident in question occurred to  testify as an expert, not a foreign jurisdiction hundreds of thousands  of miles away. If that proves to be impossible, the court can waive  this requirement if a witness that fits these criteria is otherwise  unavailable.   Mr. Chairman, no one knows the people or healthcare providers in an  area better than the people and healthcare providers in that area.  Whether testifying for the plaintiff or defendant, it is important that  those individuals called as experts really know the people in the area  and aren't simply flown in from a faraway place just to get a paycheck.   We all want improved quality and lower costs of care. Reforming the  litigation process is a step in the right direction.   Mr. Chairman, I encourage Members to support my amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, where the subsidies were going in  our State were to the lawyers, since they got over 60 percent of any  medical malpractice settlement. The poor patients got less than forty  cents on the dollar.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King).    Mr. Chairman, I wish the damages did go to  patients in Tennessee. They don't. The majority goes to lawyers.   Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from  Kansas (Mr. Marshall), my good friend and a fellow OB/GYN.                                time  1600     Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
