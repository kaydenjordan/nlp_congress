 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of a  truly great American, Mary Phillips White Gettys, who will turn 99 on  August 6 of this year.   Ms. Gettys was born in Chester, South Carolina, on August 6, 1920,  which was the same year that women gained voting rights. She graduated  from Chester High School, where she was valedictorian of her senior  class. She enrolled in Erskine College and graduated in 1941 with a  degree in music.   Her first job was teaching junior high school in Anderson, South  Carolina, and she later joined WAVES, which stands for Women Accepted  for Volunteer Emergency Service, in 1943. She began her training at  Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts, where she  specialized in communications while studying at Smith College in North  Hampton, Massachusetts. She was assigned to the communications office  in the Norfolk Navy Yard in Portsmouth, Virginia.   After achieving the rank of lieutenant, she was tasked with the  complicated task of coding and decoding communications received and  sent by the Naval Command. Her duties included delivering urgent top  secret messages to military leaders, where she would have to strap on  her weapon and be escorted across the yard to deliver the vital  information.   In 1946, Ms. White left the Navy and began working for AAA, the  American Automobile Association, located in Charlotte, North Carolina.   In 1947, she met Tom Gettys, whom she would become engaged to after 3  weeks and married 3 months after their engagement. Little did she know  that she would become the lifelong partner of a man who would  successfully become the Fifth District Congressman of South Carolina,  where he would serve for five terms until retiring in 1974.   They returned to his hometown of Rock Hill, South Carolina, where  they would raise two daughters, Julia Martin Gettys Burchett and Sara  Elizabeth Gettys Pierce. The Gettys were married for 56 years until the  death of Congressman Gettys in 2003.   Mary Phillips Gettys is a true leader in her community and received  many awards, including: Woman of the Year from the First ARP Church,  where she faithfully attended; the Cross of Military Service from the  United Daughter of the Confederacy in 2001; the Quilt of Valor award in  2015, presented by the Quilts of Valor Foundations for veterans touched  by war; the National Award in 2017, presented from DAR, the Daughters  of the American Revolution for Women in American History.   Mary Phillips Gettys is the proud and devoted grandmother of six  grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. She is the epitome of a  gracious and charming Southern lady, and by her life, she has  demonstrated a love for her God, a love for her family, the love of her  fellow man, and the love of her great country.   She is a true American patriot who always has a smile on her face and  has lived her life in true service to her fellow man.                            ____________________
