 Madam Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 1, the  Lower Energy Costs Act.   Only a few years ago, our country was comfortably meeting our energy  needs with our own production. Under President Biden's reckless energy  agenda, however, we have dramatically increased our dependence on  foreign oil, sent gas prices sky-high last year, and increased the cost  of energy bills for Americans and the people in Indiana who I  represent.   House Republicans made a commitment to America that we would end the  war on American energy, and we are demonstrating that commitment today  by passing H.R. 1.   This bill will flip the switch on domestic energy production,  reversing the administration's anti-energy policies and streamlining  our energy infrastructure.   Included in this bill is my Securing America's Critical Minerals  Supply Act, which would address the broad set of critical energy  resources that we need to properly assess our Nation's energy supply,  identify critical resources for our economy, and help locate  vulnerabilities in our supply chains.   Under this legislation, the U.S. could produce energy that is cleaner  and safer than other parts of the world--which we already are--where  production is tied to dangerous working conditions, child labor  exploitation, and extremely low pay.   It would also help us shift away from our reliance on energy  resources from countries controlled by foreign dictators, better  protecting our national security.   As a supporter of an all-of-the-above energy approach, I know how  crucial it is that we take steps to safeguard and secure the energy  resources necessary to keep the lights on, rates down, and emissions  low.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to pass H.R. 1 so that we can  address America's energy crisis created by the administration and meet  America's energy needs on our own.
