 Mr. Speaker, this is a historic moment in the U.S.  House. We need to pass an unprecedented economic package that will  prevent financial disaster for millions of Americans. We must get  people working again.   This bill funds programs for small businesses, including independent  contractors and nonprofits. It provides up to $1,200 for taxpayers who  earn $75,000 or less, as well as $500 per child.   Additionally, seniors and disabled veterans are also eligible for  checks. These payments will not be considered taxable income for 2020,  Mr. Speaker.   Most importantly, critical funding to provide personal equipment and  test kits for healthcare professionals is on the way.   For sure, this is a spending bill. I am not happy with everything,  but I will vote ``yes'' to save the lives and livelihood of my  constituents.   I ask for swift passage as soon as possible, Mr. Speaker.
