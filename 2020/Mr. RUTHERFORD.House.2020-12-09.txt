 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate David Shoar  on a well-deserved retirement from a 40-year, lifelong career from law  enforcement. David has been with the St. Johns County Sheriff's Office  since being elected sheriff there in 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016. That  is 16 long years of faithful service to the St. Johns County Sheriff's  Office.   He has been an outstanding leader for the St. Johns County Sheriff's  Office and initiated many innovations during his tenure. Sheriff Shoar  actually began his law enforcement career with the St. Augustine Police  Department in 1981, serving as a patrol officer before being promoted  to sergeant in 1991.   Because of his leadership, knowledge, skills, and abilities, in 2000,  he was appointed as chief of police, following successful stints as  operations commander and administrative services commander. Just 4  years later, in 2004, he would then begin his career as sheriff of St.  Johns County.   Mr. Speaker, that is when I really came to know Sheriff Shoar, during  the Florida Sheriffs Association's new sheriffs school. Although we  both attended an earlier training class in Wakulla Springs and really  had gotten to be close friends, it was at this new sheriff's training  that I truly began to appreciate Sheriff Shoar's intelligence and his  insights.   Sheriff Shoar is also a decorated soldier in the Florida National  Guard, later retiring as a major after 24 years of service to our  Nation and our State. He served in the Gulf War and led North Florida's  recovery efforts following Hurricanes Andrew and Opal. His public  service record and leadership in northeast Florida is truly second to  none.   Mr. Speaker, all of Sheriff Shoar's awards and accolades are too  numerous to list, but they do include the America's Most Wanted  National First Responder Award, the American Legion's Top Cop Award,  the Catholic Charities  [[Page H7054]]  of St. Johns County Good Samaritan Award, the Salvation Army's Gus  Craig Award, and the prestigious Colonel Ed Taylor Award from the St.  Johns County Veteran's Council for his many years of dedication to our  Nation's veterans.                                time  1045    In addition to his many successes in law enforcement, military  service, and community service, Sheriff Shoar also holds bachelor's and  master's degrees from the University of North Florida and an honorary  doctorate of law degree from Flagler College.   During his 40 years of service, Sheriff Shoar made a positive  difference in his community, his country, his agency, and the lives of  many people, including my own.   His life reminds me of a quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson:         The purpose of life is not to be happy. It is to be useful,       to be honorable, to be compassionate, to have it make some       difference that you lived and lived well.    Sheriff Shoar, David, my friend, you have made a difference and lived  well.   On behalf of the Fourth Congressional District of Florida, I wish  David well in his retirement and thank him for dedicating his life to  the safety of our community and our Nation.                            ____________________
