 Mr. President, small businesses play an integral  role in Oklahoma's economy. They consist of over 52 percent of all  employees in Oklahoma. Additionally, within Oklahoma, over 84 percent  of all exports come from small businesses. Today I have the distinct  honor of recognizing one of the many successful small businesses in my  home State of Oklahoma for National Small Business Week. While there  are many businesses worthy of recognition, I am particularly proud of  Webco Industries.   Webco Industries, based in Sand Springs, OK, has proven themselves as  a leader in the metal tubing industry. Their philosophy of  ``continuously building'' is a testament to how they have grown since  1969 into the 1,000-employee company they are today. With seven  manufacturing plants and two distribution facilities, they provide the  widest variety of tubing in North America. With engineering,  metallurgical, production, and QA staff averaging 20 years of  experience, Webco delivers exceptional tubing products and service to  their customers.   I want to congratulate and thank Webco founder, Bill Weber, and CEO  Dana Weber of Webco for their outstanding and devoted work in creating  a shining business model. The Weber's dedication to making these  products in America should not only make Oklahomans proud, but all  Americans. Webco's success should be an example for all businesses, and  I am proud to recognize their hard work and dedication.                            ____________________
