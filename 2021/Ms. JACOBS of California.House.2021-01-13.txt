 Madam Speaker, the response to political  violence must always be accountability. Without accountability, more  violence will follow. I learned that working at the United Nations and  the State Department in conflict settings around the world, and the  United States Congress is now a conflict setting.   A violent mob threatened our lives in this Chamber and almost  succeeded, incited by the President, who broadcasted live about the  outcome of our election. We must hold this President accountable. It is  the only way to protect our democracy.
