 Mr. President, I rise in support of this resolution  offered by the Democratic leader. We are calling for an end to a  horribly flawed congressional investigation. The foreign threats to our  democracy--attempts to poison it with disinformation and to sow  distrust--are an established matter of fact.   It is especially troubling because for periods over the last year,  two Senate committees have conducted an investigation involving  Ukraine, former Vice President Biden, and his son Hunter: the Homeland  Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, led by our colleague from  Wisconsin, Chairman Johnson; and our colleague from Iowa, Chairman  Grassley, of the Finance Committee, in which I am the  [[Page S5628]]  ranking Democrat. My staff has joined in interviews and received  documents pertinent to the investigation.   Given my Finance Committee role and my position on the Senate  Intelligence Committee, I am unable to discuss classified information  or details of an ongoing inquiry. However, I can discuss public  information about the spread of Russian propaganda and the pathway it  is following from Russian agents, through the U.S. Senate, to the  American people.   The Russian Government is again interfering in our election. This has  been confirmed by our intelligence community. Its interference campaign  includes disinformation about Vice President Biden and the work he was  doing to fight corruption in Ukraine.   To spread this disinformation, Russia enlists the help of characters  like Andriy Derkach and Andriy Telizhenko. Derkach has been identified  by American counterintelligence as an active agent for Russian  intelligence. This agent, instead of being treated as a foreign enemy,  has met personally with the President's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to  further his task of undermining elections in America. I am not sure,  colleagues, what you should call an American who aids a Russian agent,  but counselor to the President is certainly not it.   In August, the Director of the National Counterintelligence and  Security Center issued a threat assessment on foreign threats to our  election. It identified Derkach as a Kremlin-linked actor involved with  attempting to denigrate former Vice President Biden.   On September 3, Senator Schumer and I wrote a letter, along with  several of our Democratic colleagues, urging the Treasury Department to  issue sanctions against Derkach. It did so the following week,  describing his role in what it called ``a covert influence campaign  centered on cultivating false and unsubstantiated narratives concerning  U.S. officials in the upcoming 2020 Presidential Election.''   Telizhenko is yet another Giuliani associate who, according to press  accounts, American counterintelligence has identified as a conduit for  Russian attacks on our elections. He has also been a star witness in  the Johnson-Grassley investigation   Derkach and Telizhenko have released what appears to be heavily  edited portions of phone calls Vice President Biden held with Ukrainian  officials in the course of his anti-corruption work. Some were released  on the very same day. Telizhenko is promising further releases.  Telizhenko also told the Washington Post that he forwarded more than  100 emails to staff on Senator Johnson's committee and answered their  questions.   Our colleague from South Carolina, Senator Graham, was involved in  the earliest stages of the Johnson-Grassley inquiry in 2019, but in  February of 2020, Chairman Graham said: ``I called the attorney general  this morning and Richard Burr, [then, of course] chairman of the Intel  Committee, and they told me take very cautiously anything coming out of  the Ukraine against anybody.''   The disinformation that these two have spread--Derkach and Telizhenko  have spread--the disinformation these two have spread, largely a  collection of unproven allegations and wild conspiracy theories, has  obviously made it into many media outlets in the country all too  willing to spread the products of Russian intelligence. It has been  circulated by the President's own legal team.   From there, that disinformation became the basis of much of the work  of the Johnson-Grassley inquiry. I am going to have more to say on the  details of that investigation in the days ahead, but for now, I will  say this: Chairman Johnson has repeatedly claimed in the media that he  has uncovered new and damaging information about Vice President Biden's  activity in Ukraine. This is simply not true. Nothing I have seen--not  one bit of evidence--could lead to the conclusion that Vice President  Biden did anything wrong in Ukraine. What I have seen is a monthlong  investigation that still has no legitimate basis, burning through an  incredible amount of manpower and taxpayer-funded resources. Neither of  these committees, by the way, under the rules of the Senate, have any  jurisdiction over our diplomatic ties with Ukraine. It has no  legislative purpose.   This investigation, as I have pointed out on a number of occasions,  also is happening under a clear double standard that has favored  Republicans in the Senate and stonewalled oversight by Democrats. In my  view, that is a sign that the flimsy accusations made against the Vice  President can't stand up to real scrutiny.   The real nature of this inquiry has been clear all along. It began as  a counterprogramming during the impeachment trial, and the urgency  behind the investigation really almost seemed to die out when the trial  ended. It only returned--and again, these are facts. All of these are  facts. It only returned when the Vice President established himself as  the Democratic frontrunner. The day after the Biden victory in the  South Carolina primary, Chairman Johnson sent a letter to the committee  announcing his intention to kick-start the investigation with a  subpoena.   So now what I am going to do is outline what Senator Johnson said in  his own words, because I think that is also very important as Senators  consider this resolution. These are Senator Johnson's words  specifically.   My colleague said in March: ``[I]f I were a Democrat primary voter,  I'd want these questions satisfactorily answered before I cast my final  vote.''   The chairman said in August: ``I would think it would certainly help  Donald Trump win reelection and certainly be pretty good, I would say,  evidence about not voting for Vice President Biden.''   He said in September: ``Stay tuned. In about a week we're going to  learn a whole lot more of Vice President Biden's unfitness for  office.''   Furthermore, the chairman, in my view, looking again at the public  record, cannot credibly take issue with the work the Vice President was  doing because he supported it publicly at the time.   In June 2014, at a Foreign Relations Committee hearing on Ukraine,  Chairman Johnson stated: ``If we have to tie aid or help to make sure  that anti-corruption laws are passed, I think we should do it.''   In 2016, Chairman Johnson wrote a letter with a bipartisan group of  members of the Senate Ukraine Caucus to former Ukrainian President  Petro Poroshenko. The letter reads:         Succeeding in these reforms will show Russian President       Putin that an independent, transparent and democratic Ukraine       can and will succeed. It also offers a stark alternative to       the authoritarianism and oligarchic cronyism prevalent in       Russia. As such, we respectfully ask that you address the       serious concerns raised--    And we are talking here about the Minister of Economic Development  and Trade.         We similarly urge you to press ahead with urgent reforms to       the Prosecutor General's Office and Judiciary.    So these are the words, colleagues, the words of the chairman of the  committee. That is why Senator Schumer and I believe this  investigation, the Johnson-Grassley investigation, is baseless. We have  brought forward a resolution that we believe is important to defending  our democracy. It comes down to a question of what we want campaigns  and elections to be all about.   In my view--and I have always said this--right at the core of my  being, I want elections about our best ideas. That is why I serve on  the Finance Committee, to try to come up with the best ideas in  healthcare, taxes, trade, and the like. Elections ought to be about our  best ideas and having real debates and not attacking the other side  with farfetched foreign misinformation, especially at a time when the  American people are dealing with the crushing weight of one crisis  stacked on another.   There are 200,000 Americans who have died of COVID-19. I couldn't  disagree more with the President's handling of the coronavirus  pandemic. We have seen so much economic hurt. I championed on the floor  and, for a while, we had bipartisan support for basically bringing  unemployment into the relevant century and getting an extra $600 per  week to people and covering gig  [[Page S5629]]  workers and all kinds of other people. Yet, still, the economy has  collapsed, and millions are out of work. My Oregon neighbors--a number  of them--have seen their communities reduced to ashes. Thousands and  thousands of homes and businesses have been lost. There has been a  national outcry against racism and violence against Black Americans.   Our elections are supposed to be about those kinds of issues, and in  all of them, what I have tried to do is devote my public service to  bringing people together and getting parties to find common ground on  the best ideas of how to make changes in these areas. Now, that sure  seems to me to be what the Senate should be all about rather than  baseless attacks and foreign disinformation.   I urge my colleagues to support the resolution that Senator Schumer  and I have championed. It is long past time for this badly flawed  investigation by our colleagues to end.   As in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of a resolution opposing efforts  to launder Russian disinformation through the Congress, which is at the  desk. I further ask that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be  agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I am very disappointed that my colleague  has objected.   I just want to make a brief response reflecting on my role as a  senior member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Again, as  I indicated earlier, I can't get into anything classified or sources  and methods, but before we leave this subject, I just want to remind  the Senate that the Russian disinformation campaign is going on now. It  is not some abstract issue. The Russian disinformation campaign is  going on now.   The Russians have attempted to rewrite the history of the 2016  campaign. It is the conclusion of the intelligence community--this is  not Democrats; it is not Republicans; it is the intelligence  community--that they are trying to interfere again, this time in the  2020 election, including with these attacks on Vice President Biden,  and they are saying this now. And active Russian agents, like Mr.  Derkach, apparently are having press conferences. I heard a report that  he may have had one today.   So Members of the Senate--again, this is a matter of public record-- have been presented with specific warnings about these Kremlin-backed  conspiracies and lies again and again, including in classified  settings. As I wrap this up, I would only ask that Members of this  great institution reflect on that.   I yield the floor.
