 Mr. Speaker, this morning, for the fourth time in the  history of the House of Representatives, we will read aloud on the  floor of the House the full text of the U.S. Constitution.   It is our hope that this reading will help demonstrate to the  American people that the House of Representatives is dedicated to the  Constitution and the system it establishes for limited government and  the protection of individual liberty. We also hope that it will inspire  many more Americans to read the Constitution themselves.   The text we will read today reflects the changes to the document made  by the 27 amendments to it. Those portions superseded by amendment will  not be read.   In order to ensure fairness to all those interested in participating,  we have asked Members to line up to be recognized on a first-come,  first-served basis. I will recognize Members based on this guidance.  Each Member will approach the podium and read the passage laid out for  him or her.    In order to ensure relative parity and fairness, I may recognize  Members out of order in order to ensure bipartisanship and balance.  Additionally, because of his long-term leadership on civil rights  issues, I will recognize the gentleman from Georgia, Representative  John Lewis, to read the Thirteenth Amendment.   I want to thank the Members of both parties for their participation  in this historic event. I will begin by reading the preamble to the  Constitution:   ``We the People of the United States, in order to form a more perfect  Union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the  common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings  of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this  Constitution for the United States of America.''

The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) and the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Johnson) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, regulatory reform plays a critical role in ensuring  that our Nation finally achieves a full economic recovery and retains  its competitive edge in the global marketplace. Congress must advance  pro-growth policies that create jobs and restore economic prosperity  for families and businesses across the Nation and make sure that any  administration and its regulatory apparatus is held accountable to the  American people.   America's small-business owners are suffocating under mountains of  endlessly growing, bureaucratic red tape; and the uncertainty about the  cost of upcoming regulations discourages employers from hiring new  employees and expanding their businesses. Excessive regulation means  higher prices, lower wages, fewer jobs, less economic growth, and a  less competitive America.   Today, Americans face a burden of over $3 trillion per year from  Federal taxation and regulation. In fact, our Federal regulatory burden  is larger than the 2014 gross domestic product of all but the top eight  countries in the world. That burden adds up to about $15,000 per  American household--nearly 30 percent of average household income in  2015.   Everyone knows it has been this way for far too long; but the Obama  administration, instead of fixing the problem, has known only one  response: increase taxes, increase spending, and increase regulation.  The results have painfully demonstrated a simple truth: America cannot  tax, spend, and regulate its way to economic recovery, economic growth,  and durable prosperity for the American people.   Consider just a few facts that reveal the economic weakness the Obama  administration has produced. In the December 2016 jobs report, the  number of unemployed workers, workers who can only find part-time jobs,  and workers who are now only marginally attached to the labor force  stood at 9.3 percent. They number 15 million Americans. America's labor  force participation rate remains at lows not seen since the Carter  administration, and median household income is still below the level  achieved before the financial crisis, which is after the entirety of  the Obama administration.   The contrast between America's current condition and the recovery  Ronald Reagan achieved as President is particularly stark in that, 4\1/ 2\ years after a recession began in 1981, the Reagan administration,  through policies opposite to those of the Obama administration's, had  achieved a recovery that created 7.8 million more jobs than when the  recession began. Real per capita gross domestic product rose by $3,091,  and real median household income rose by 7.7 percent.   To truly fix America's problems, the REINS Act is one of the  simplest, clearest, and most powerful measures we can adopt. The level  of new major regulation from the Obama administration is without modern  precedent. Testimony before the Judiciary Committee during recent  Congresses has  [[Page H125]]  plainly shown the connection between skyrocketing levels of regulation  and declining levels of jobs and growth.   The REINS Act responds by requiring an up-or-down vote by the  people's representatives in Congress before any new major regulation,  which is defined in the bill generally as a rule that has an effect on  the economy of at least $100 million, can be imposed on our economy. It  does not prohibit new major regulation. It simply establishes the  principle: ``no major regulation without representation.''   The REINS Act provides Congress and, ultimately, the people with a  much-needed tool to check the one-way cost ratchet that Washington's  regulatory bureaucrats too often turn. During the 114th, 113th, and  112th Congresses, the REINS Act was passed multiple times by the full  House of Representatives, each time with bipartisan support.   I thank Mr. Collins of Georgia for reintroducing this legislation,  and I urge all of my colleagues to vote for the REINS Act.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I listened intently to my colleague's opening remarks, and he seemed  to try to justify the passage of the REINS Act, which I rise in  opposition to, by the way, by saying that it has been the Obama  administration's job-killing regulations that have put our economy in  its position, which is one that is not good.   Despite trying to convince the American people of that allegation,  the American people are aware of the facts. They are aware of the fact  that, 8 years ago, when President Obama came into office and under a  Republican stewardship that used trickle-down economics as its model,  this economy neared that of the Great Depression's. In fact, we call it  the period of the Great Recession. This country almost went into a  depression, and it went into a Great Recession because of George Bush's  and the Republicans' policies of trickle-down economics, which Daddy  Bush--George Herbert Walker Bush--once referred to as ``voodoo  economics,'' and he was right about that.    Let's look at where we were then and look at where we are now and ask  ourselves: Are we not better off now than we were then?   There are not many voices that could say, No, we are not better off  now than we were then, because they know, since then, there have been  81 straight months of positive private sector job growth.   They know that over 15.6 million new jobs have been added to our  economy by President Obama. They also know that 30 million more people  have health insurance and access to the healthcare system now than they  did back then. They know that regulations had to ensue from the passage  of the Affordable Care Act in order to enable those 30 million people  to have coverage now. That is why they want to introduce this  legislation to cut regulations. They want to try to hurt the Affordable  Care Act. They also know that regulations had to spring forth from the  Dodd-Frank, Wall Street regulation, legislation that was passed in this  body. They know that those regulations have protected the finances and  the financial security of Americans who are doing far better now than  they were 8 years ago when President Obama took office.   The American people know that they are much better off now. They know  that bankruptcies have gone down. They know that foreclosures have gone  down. They know that they have better jobs. They know that things are  better now than they were back then.   You will remember and the American people will remember that on the  very day of President Obama's first inauguration, Mitch McConnell and a  cabal of Republicans met from both the House and Senate, crying in  their beers at a Capitol Hill bar. They embarked on a strategy to-- what?--make sure that President Obama would be a first-term President.  So they resolved to oppose everything that he proposed, and they  certainly did. Despite unprecedented opposition from the Republicans'  just saying ``no'' to everything, the American people know that they  are in a better position today than they were at this time 8 years ago  when coming into the Obama administration.   The Republicans want to introduce legislation to do away with the  rules and the regulations concerning the Affordable Care Act and the  Dodd-Frank legislation, which has protected the financial security of  Americans over the last 8 years. That is why they come forward with  this so-called jobs bill. This regulatory reform bill called the REINS  Act is not going to produce or create one single job. What it will do  is cut measures to protect the health, safety, and well-being of  Americans.                                time  1445    This misguided legislation would amend the Congressional Review Act  to require that both Houses of Congress pass and the President sign a  joint resolution of approval within 70 legislative days before any  major rule issued by an agency can take effect. In other words, this  bill would subject new major rules to nullification by Congress through  an unconstitutional legislative veto by one Chamber of Congress.   Following Republican attempts earlier this week to gut ethics and  oversight rules that are necessary to police corruption, it is telling  that the REINS Act is the next bill that the House would consider in  the 115th Congress. Americans should understand what the game plan is  of the Republicans. They want the fox to guard the henhouse. That is  why the very first act that they tried to get passed was reform of the  House ethics regime. They wanted to neuter it, place it under the  control of the Republican-controlled House Ethics Committee, where it  would then languish and die like a prune on a vine that was unwatered.   That is the first thing they came up with, and the American people  called them on it and wouldn't let them pass it. So they have postponed  it. America needs to keep their eyes on this Congress to make sure that  they don't follow through with that measure that would install the  foxes over the henhouse. What they want to do is install the corporate  foxes over America's henhouse with this REINS Act.   The REINS Act is central to the Speaker's so-called Better Way  agenda, which is really only a better way for rich, corporate elites to  further insulate themselves from public accountability and is  emblematic of the same tired and crony-capitalist proposals that have  been kicked around by opponents of environmental and public health  protections since the 1980s. In fact, in 1983, Chief Justice John  Roberts, who was then a counsel to President Reagan, criticized a  similar proposal as unwise because it would hobble agency rulemaking by  requiring affirmative congressional assent to all major rules and would  seem to impose excessive burdens on the regulatory agencies.   In addition to being an unmitigated disaster for public health and  safety, proposals like the REINS Act will actually do major harm to  regulatory reform attempts, as the late Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in  1981. Then a professor at the University of Chicago Law School, Justice  Scalia cautioned: ``Those in the Congress seem perversely unaware that  the accursed `unelected officials' downtown are now their unelected  officials, presumably seeking to move things in their desired  direction; and that every curtailment of desirable agency discretion  obstructs (principally) departure from Democrat-produced, pro- regulatory status quo.''   Now, it is not often that I quote Justice Scalia, but, ironically, I  do so today.   The REINS Act also imposes deadlines for the enactment of a joint  resolution approving a major rule that could charitably be referred to  as Byzantine. So as not to use too lofty language, I will just declare  that this thing is like throwing a monkey wrench in a well-oiled  machine.   Under new section 802, the House may only consider a major rule on  the second or fourth Thursday of each month. In 2014, for example,  there were only 13 such days on the legislative calendar. I think on  the legislative calendar for 2017, there are only about 13, maybe 14 or  15, such days where we could consider these major rules on this  legislative calendar. I would point out that there are approximately 80  such rules of importance that come through in a typical year.  [[Page H126]]    Furthermore, under new section 801, Congress may only consider such  resolutions within 70 legislative days of receiving a major rule. This  creates a lot of red tape that threatens to end rulemaking as we know  it, and that is the exact, precise intent of this Congress. Even if  agencies reduce the number of major rules in contemplation of a bill's  onerous requirements, Congress would still lack the expertise and  policy justifications for refusing to adopt a major rule.   As over 80 of the Nation's leading professors on environmental and  administrative law noted in a letter in opposition to a substantively  identical version of this bill, without this expertise, any  ``disapproval is therefore more likely to reflect the political power  of special interests, a potential that would be magnified in light of  the fast-track process.''   Lastly, by flipping the process of agency rulemaking so that Congress  can simply void implementation by not acting on a major rule, the REINS  Act likely violates the presentment and bicameralism requirements of  Article I of the Constitution.   It is my pleasure to oppose this bill. I urge my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to do the same.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Marino), the chairman of the Subcommittee on  Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Marino), the chairman of the Subcommittee on  Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Marino), the chairman of the Subcommittee on  Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law.    Mr. Chairman, it is my pleasure to yield 3 minutes to  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Farenthold), a member of the Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, at this time, it is my pleasure to yield  2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bishop), a member of the  Judiciary Committee.   Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Goodlatte for  all of his leadership on this matter.   I rise today in strong support of H.R. 26, the REINS Act, which will  restore the constitutional authority of Congress and rein in runaway  government.   Mr. Chairman, as we have seen over the last 8 years, our economy has  been strangled by Federal regulations which are burying small  businesses and families. Federal regulations imposed on  [[Page H128]]  America's job creators and households created a staggering economic  burden of almost $2 trillion in 2014. That is almost $15,000 per U.S.  household, and 11.5 percent of America's real GDP.   But today, the House has an opportunity to cut through the red tape  and restore the balance of powers. Economic growth cannot happen from  Washington, D.C., it can only come from Main Street. That is why I  adamantly oppose unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats issuing their  own closed-door regulations in place of congressional regulations. The  REINS Act will restore Congress' Article I powers and give a voice back  to the American people. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for  H.R. 26.   Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, at this time, I am pleased to yield 3  minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Trott), currently a member  of the Judiciary Committee but soon to move to another committee.    Mr. Chairman, may I ask how much time is remaining on  our side?   The CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia has 15 minutes remaining. The  gentleman from Georgia has 5 minutes remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Iowa (Mr. Young).   Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the REINS  Act, legislation that I and many of my colleagues are proud to have  cosponsored to help bring expensive and expansive regulations under  control.  [[Page H129]]    Over the past several years, major regulations have cost small  businesses, States, local government, and individuals billions of  dollars and have cost them jobs. So this is a commonsense bill to  enhance transparency and give Americans greater say in their  government, and I thank Representative Collins of Georgia and Chairman  Goodlatte for their leadership on this issue.   By requiring Congress to approve any major regulation with an annual  economic impact of $100 million or more on the economy, the bill opens  the process so our constituents--the people--can have their voice heard  in the process.   I'm also pleased an amendment I offered last year, which was accepted  by this body, is included in the bill's base text, section 801. That  provision requires more transparency by forcing agencies to publish the  data and justification they are using to issue the rule. It's important  the American people have access to the information in which these  conclusions are made. Section 801 directs the regulatory bodies to post  publicly the data, studies, and analyses that they use to come up with  their rules and conclusions so that we can all be on the same page.  Transparency.    Too often I hear concerns from Iowans about how overreaching  regulations are hurting their farms and businesses and impacting their  daily lives. From how our kids are taught, how we manage our personal  finances, or even drain the water in our communities, we have seen how  regulations and those who craft them have an enormous impact.   I hear from constituents how these regulations are out of touch,  don't reflect the basic, fundamental understanding of the important  sectors driving our economy or the daily lives of Iowans and all  Americans. These regulations, which have the full force of law, are  putting Americans out of work and increasing costs for consumers.   The REINS Act is an important, commonsense bill to help address this  problem. We must do more. I appreciate Chairman Goodlatte's commitment  to work with me on my Fingerprints bill to ensure further transparency  and accountability by naming those who author and write these  regulations. I thank Chairman Goodlatte and Representative Collins of  Georgia for prioritizing the REINS Act.   Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Chairman, there are approximately 2.8 million civil servants out  there. Americans who work for the Federal Government go to work every  day. They work hard and play by the rules. They have a good, middle  class job. Your jobs are at stake, Federal employees.   There are those who say that we have too many Federal employees.  Well, the number of Federal employees that we have now is at the same  level as they were in 2004, which was when President Bush was in  office. Basically we are at a 47-year low, as far as the number of  Federal employees, since 2013.   The Federal regulatory regime, which is just simply Federal workers-- Federal civil servants--is not out of control, but your jobs are going  to be lost when these Republicans finish doing what they want to do to  these regulations.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Lance).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Yoho).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Yoho).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Garrett).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly).   Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I come from the private  sector; so when I come to the House and I listen to the debate going  back and forth, I almost feel like I am somebody not from a different  planet, but from a different galaxy.   When we talk about overregulation, when we talk about the effects of  unelected bureaucrats leveling on the American people $2 trillion and  an impact to the economy, then somebody ought to sit up and listen.   All we are talking about is scrutiny, scrutiny of any piece of  legislation, any executive order that comes out that is going to have  an impact of $100 million or more on the economy. Around here, $100  million sounds like nothing. From where I am from, it is unbelievable  that we would even think that $100 million should be the point that we  look at.   What could be more common sense than to look at the heavy burden we  are putting on everyday Americans and saying that, somehow, unelected  bureaucrats who have never walked in their shoes, who have never done  their job, who have never worried about meeting a payroll, who have  never had to worry about regulation and taxation that make it  impossible for them to compete, these poor, stupid folks just don't get  it?   705,687 people in your districts are who you represent. Whether they  voted for you or not is not the point. The point is we represent them.  Why in the world would Congress cede its power to the executive branch  and to unelected bureaucrats to determine what the American people are  going to be burdened with? It is just common sense. Why can't we not  see what is right in front of us right now?   I invite you to please go home to your districts, walk in those  shops, walk in those little towns, talk to those people and find out  the two things that really inhibit them from being successful are  overtaxation and overregulation. We can handle both those things right  here in the people's House.   This is not a Democratic House. This is not a Republican House. This  is America's House. We should be looking at things that benefit the  American people.   If we truly want to act in a bipartisan way, then let's stop this  back-and-forth debate about what Republicans want, what Democrats want,  and let's talk about what is good for the American people. That is who  sent us. That is whose responsibility we have on our shoulders. If we  can't do that, we ought to go home.   Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   As far as unelected bureaucrats that we have heard people rail  against, speaker after speaker today being concerned, those are nothing  more than the civil servants that make our government work. They  protect our water, protect our air. They protect us, as a matter of  fact--the FBI, the law enforcement. These are good people who go to  work every day, work hard, like my dad did, for instance. He was a  civil servant. I guess you could call him an unelected bureaucrat. He  did everything during his job that he needed to do, and he retired with  dignity.    There are so many others who work for the post office. They work for  TSA, Homeland Security. They are doing nothing but working a job  honestly, and they deserve more than to be referred to derisively. We  need them.   Mr. Chair, I am in opposition to this legislation. We need real  solutions for real problems. In stark contrast, however, the REINS Act  attempts to address a nonexistent problem with a very dangerous  solution.   We need legislation that creates middle class financial security and  opportunity, not legislation that snatches that away.   We need sensible regulations that protect American families from  economic ruin and that bring predatory financial practices to an end.   We need workplace safety regulations that ensure hardworking  Americans who go to work each day are protected from hazardous  environments on the job.   We need strong regulations that protect the safety of the food that  we eat and the air that we breathe and the water that we drink.   Unfortunately, H.R. 26 does nothing to advance those critical goals.  This explains why more than 150 organizations strongly oppose this  legislation, including Americans for Financial Reform; the American  Lung Association; Consumers Union; The Humane Society of the United  States; the League of Conservation Voters; Public Citizen; the American  Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees; Earthjustice; the  Coalition for Sensible Safeguards; the American Public Health  Association; the Environmental Defense Action Fund; the Center for  American Progress; and the Trust for America's Health. I, therefore,  urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 26.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   During this debate, my friends on the other side of the aisle have  raised quite a few false alarms:  [[Page H131]]    If this bill passes, all important regulation will stop, they say.  But that is not true. All regulation that is worthy of Congress'  approval will continue;   If this bill passes, expert decisionmaking will stop because Congress  will have the final say on new, major regulations, not Washington  bureaucrats. That is not true.   Congress will have the benefit of the best evidence and arguments  expert agencies can offer in support of their new regulations. Congress  is capable of determining whether that evidence and those arguments are  good or not and deciding what finally will become law. That is the job  our Founding Fathers entrusted to us in the Constitution. We should not  shirk from it.   I will tell you, though, what will stop if this bill becomes law: the  endless avalanche of new, major regulations that impose massive,  unjustified costs that crush jobs, crush wages, and crush the spirit of  America's families and small-business owners. Think about what that  will mean to real Americans who have suffered the real burdens of  overreaching regulations.   Support the American people and listen to the major organizations  across the country, which I include in the Record, who support H.R. 26,  the REINS Act.   Support the American people.

Hon. Doug Collins,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Collins: Serious regulatory reform is       needed to revitalize entrepreneurship, small business growth,       our economy, and quality job creation. Therefore, the Small       Business & Entrepreneurship Council (SBE Council) strongly       supports the Regulations from the Executive In Need of       Scrutiny (REINS) Act of 2017.        U.S. entrepreneurship and startup activity are in a frail       state. While economic uncertainty and difficulties accessing       capital present barriers to new business formation, excessive       government regulation drives uncertainty and creates new       obstacles. When the policy ecosystem becomes noxious for       startups and small businesses, our entire economy suffers.       For existing businesses, overregulation is driving costs       higher and undermining confidence, investment and growth. The       system is out-of-control, and common sense tools and       solutions are needed to rein in the explosive growth of       federal red tape.        The REINS Act requires that Congress take an up-or-down       vote on every new major rule--defined as having an economic       impact of $100 million or more--before such a rule could be       enforced. This substantive regulatory reform measure would       serve as an important check on the regulatory system, and       have a positive effect in terms of how regulation affects       small businesses, and therefore, consumers, America's       workforce and the economy.        The REINS Act will bring needed accountability to our       nation's regulatory system, and SBE Council thanks you for       your leadership in spearheading this important legislative       effort.            Sincerely,                                                    Karen Kerrigan,      President and CEO.                                   ____                                                    National Roofing                                         Contractors Association,                                    Washington, DC, January 3, 2017.      To All Members of the House of Representatives.        Dear Representative, The National Roofing Contractors       Association (NRCA) strongly supports the Regulations from the       Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act and urges you to       support this legislation when it comes to the House floor for       a vote.        Established in 1886, NRCA is one of the nation's oldest       trade associations and the voice of professional roofing       contractors worldwide. NRCA has about 3,500 contractors in       all 50 states who are typically small, privately held       companies with the average member employing 45 people and       attaining sales of about $4.5 million per year.        The roofing industry has faced an avalanche of new       regulations from numerous government agencies in recent       years. The cumulative burden of often counterproductive       regulations is highly disruptive to entrepreneurs who seek to       start or grow businesses that provide high-quality jobs. Most       important, federal agencies have failed to work with industry       representatives to provide greater flexibility for employers       in achieving regulatory goals and minimizing adverse impacts       on economic growth and job creation.        NRCA strongly supports regulatory reform to provide small       and midsized businesses with much-needed relief from       burdensome regulations, and the REINS Act is a key component       of regulatory relief. It would require Congress to approve,       with an up-or-down vote, any new major regulation issued by a       federal agency before the regulation would become effective.       Under the REINS Act, a major regulation is defined as any       rule that is estimated to have an economic impact of at least       $100 million on the private sector; would result in a major       increase in costs or prices; and would have significant       adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,       productivity or U.S. competitiveness.        NRCA believes the REINS Act, by requiring major regulations       undergo a vote in Congress to become effective, would       substantially increase accountability among federal agencies       seeking to issue new regulations. This legislation would help       provide employers in the roofing industry with the certainty       they need to invest in their businesses and create more jobs.        NRCA supports the REINS Act and urges you to vote for this       legislation in the House. If you have any questions or need       more information, please contact NRCA's Washington, D.C.,       office.                                                  Dennis Conway,                                 Commercial Roofers Inc., Las Vegas,      NRCA Chairman of the Board.                                   ____                                                 Associated Builders                                           and Contractors, Inc.,                                    Washington, DC, January 4, 2017.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of Associated Builders and       Contractors (ABC), a national construction industry trade       association with 70 chapters representing nearly 21,000       chapter members, I am writing in regard to the Regulations       from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act of 2017       (H.R. 26) introduced by Rep. Doug Collins (R-GA) as well as       the Midnight Rules Relief Act of 2017 (H.R. 21) introduced by       Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA).        From 2009 to present, the federal government imposed nearly       $900 billion in regulatory costs on the American people which       requires billions of hours of paperwork. Many of these       regulations have been or will be imposed on the construction       industry. ABC is committed to reforming the broken federal       regulatory process and ensuring industry stakeholders' voices       are heard and rights are protected. ABC supports increased       transparency and opportunities for regulatory oversight by       Congress and ultimately, the American people.        The Obama administration issued numerous rulemakings that       detrimentally impact the construction industry. In some       cases, these regulations are based on conjecture and       speculation, lacking foundation in sound scientific analysis.       For the construction industry, unjustified and unnecessary       regulations translate to higher costs, which are then passed       along to the consumer or lead to construction projects being       priced out of the market. This chain reaction ultimately       results in fewer projects, and hinders businesses' ability to       hire and expand.        ABC members understand the value of standards and       regulations when they are based on solid evidence, with       appropriate consideration paid to implementation costs and       input from the business community. Federal agencies must be       held accountable for full compliance with existing rulemaking       statutes and requirements when promulgating regulations to       ensure they are necessary, current and cost-effective for       businesses to implement.        ABC opposes unnecessary, burdensome and costly regulations       resulting from the efforts of Washington bureaucrats who have       little accountability for their actions. H.R. 26 will help to       bring greater accountability to the rulemaking process as it       would require any executive branch rule or regulation with an       annual economic impact of $100 million or more to come before       Congress for an up-or-down vote before being enacted.       Moreover, H.R. 21 will further enhance congressional       oversight of the overreaching regulations often issued during       the final months of a president's term and help to revive the       division of powers.        Thank you for your attention on this important matter and       we urge the House to pass the Regulations from the Executive       in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act of 2017 and Midnight Rules       Relief Act of 2017 when they come to the floor for a vote.            Sincerely,                                             Kristen Swearingen,                                       Vice President of Legislative                                               & Political Affairs.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Subparagraph (A) of section 804(2) of title 5, United       States Code, as proposed to be amended to read by section 3       of the bill, is amended to read as follows:        ``(A) an annual cost on the economy of $100,000,000 or       more, adjusted annually for inflation;''.    The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 22, the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I offer this manager's amendment to assure that, just as the REINS  Act strengthens Congress' check on rules that impose major new costs on  the economy, it does not unduly delay the effectiveness of major new  deregulatory actions, those that alleviate regulatory burdens of $100  million or more.   When first introduced in the 112th Congress, the REINS Act  incorporated the definition of major rule in the underlying  Congressional Review Act--generally, a rule that has ``an annual effect  on the economy of $100,000,000 or more.''   This was done in the interest of consistency with prior terminology,  and it  [[Page H135]]  swept in both actions that imposed costs and actions that lifted costs.  But, especially after the regulatory onslaught we have witnessed during  the Obama administration, it is time to revise that definition.   We should assure that the REINS Act focuses Congress' highest  attention on the rules that hurt the economy the most: those that  impose $100 million or more in costs per year. We should likewise make  sure that the REINS Act does not impose additional hurdles in the way  of the most important and desperately needed deregulatory actions:  those that free the economy of $100 million or more in annual  regulatory burdens. A deregulatory action with that level of economic  effect is one that Congress should be encouraging, not slowing down.   This refinement of the REINS Act's major rule definition is also  needed to assure consistency with the major Administrative Procedure  Act reform legislation the House is due to consider next week, the  Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017. That measure already modernizes  the major rule standard for APA purposes to $100 million or more in  annual costs imposed on the economy. The REINS Act should mirror it.   I urge my colleagues to support this manager's amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1545    Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.   The CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.   Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chair, the Goodlatte amendment clarifies  that a major rule is any rule with an annual cost on the economy of  $100 million or more adjusted for inflation. This amendment revises the  bill's definition for a major rule to include any rule with an annual  cost of $100 million or more as determined by the Office of Information  and Regulatory Affairs, also known as OIRA.   I oppose this amendment because it focuses only on the cost of  regulatory protections while completely overlooking the monetary  benefits of these critical rules. It also strips OIRA's ability to  consider the benefits of a rule in connection with a rule's cost. I  don't understand the logic of that.   In 2015, The Washington Post's Fact Checker blog criticized cost-only  regulatory estimates as misleading, unbalanced, and having serious  methodological problems. Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen,  likewise observed in 2015 that ignoring the benefits of regulation is  akin to grocery shoppers deciding to buy no groceries simply because  groceries cost money. That doesn't make any sense to me.   Even Thomas Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, has  stated that ``many of these rules we need, they're important for the  economy, and we support them,'' conceding that the benefits of  regulatory protections must be considered hand in hand with their  costs.   Indeed, under both Democratic and Republican administrations, the  Office of Management and Budget regularly has reported to Congress that  the benefits of regulations far exceed their costs. During the three  hearings on the REINS Act in previous Congresses, we heard from three  distinguished witnesses that the benefits of regulation routinely  outweigh their costs, according to cost-benefit analysis done by the  Office of Management and Budget under administrations of both parties.   For example, in the 112th Congress, Sally Katzen, a former  administrator of the OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory  Affairs, testified that ``the numbers are striking: according to OMB,  the benefits from the regulations issued during the ten-year period''-- from fiscal year 1999 through 2009--``ranged from $128 billion to $616  billion.''   I will repeat. Benefits from regulations ranged from $128 billion to  $616 billion.   ``Therefore, even if one uses OMB's highest estimate of costs and its  lowest estimate of benefits, the regulations issued over the past ten  years have produced net benefits of $73 billion to our society.''   Those are the words of Sally Katzen. That 10-year timeframe  encompasses the Clinton, Bush, and Obama administrations.   We also heard in the 112th Congress from David Goldston, a former  Republican House committee chief of staff, who testified that  ``administrations under both parties have reviewed the aggregate impact  of regulations and found their benefits to have exceeded their costs  (and not all benefits are quantifiable).''   Their testimony is bolstered by the Office of Management and Budget's  2016 Draft Report to Congress, which notes that estimated annual  benefits of major Federal regulations reviewed by OMB over the past  decade estimated annual benefits of regulatory protections are between  $269 billion and $872 billion, while regulatory costs are between $74  billion and $110 billion.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, once again, because it focuses  only on the cost of regulatory protections while completely overlooking  the monetary benefits of these critical rules, and for that reason I  oppose my colleague's amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time  only to urge my colleagues to support this important amendment and not  lose the opportunity to benefit from deregulatory reforms that will  grow our economy and save America's economy hundreds of millions of  dollars. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte).   The amendment was agreed to.                    Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Messer    The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in  House Report 115-1.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Indiana for  offering this amendment, and I rise in support of it.   The cumulative burden of Federal regulation will surely be reduced by  the REINS Act, but that burden has two elements: the burden being added  by new regulations and the burden already there.   This amendment adds a useful provision to the REINS Act to address  the elimination of unnecessary burdens already in the Code of Federal  Regulations. It does so, moreover, in a manner that parallels  President-elect Trump's promise to pursue a policy of one-in/two-out  when it comes to new regulatory actions by his administration.   Mr. Chair, I support the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to  recommit.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized  for 5 minutes.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to  recommit.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized  for 5 minutes.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   On the floor of this House in 2011, the President of the United  States promised the American people ``to reduce barriers to growth and  investment . . . when we find rules that put an unnecessary burden on  businesses, we will fix them.''   But, Mr. Speaker, those were just President Obama's words. His  actions were starkly different. Throughout the entire 8 years of the  Obama administration, a flood of new, major regulations has been  burying America's job creators and households at record levels; and to  make matters worse, when Congress declined to legislate the President's  misguided policies for him, he increasingly resorted to unilateral  regulatory actions to legislate by executive fiat.   It is time to say, ``Never again.'' The REINS Act, in one fell swoop,  puts a stop to abuses like President Obama's and assures that  Congress--the body to which the Constitution assigns the power to  legislate--has the necessary tools to block the most overreaching  [[Page H173]]  regulations and mandates on the American people.   This motion to recommit seeks only to distract from the urgent need  to reform our regulatory system and reduce unnecessary burdens on the  public. When health care reform regulations are adopted, they should be  adopted with the approval of this body.   I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill, reject this motion  to recommit, and show America that Congress can act for the good of job  creators and all Americans who desperately want and need jobs.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is  ordered on the motion to recommit.   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the noes appeared to have it.
