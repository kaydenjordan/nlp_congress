 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank Bob and Linda Bracken  of Port Washington for their 35 years of teaching in New York's Third  Congressional District. I had the privilege of meeting them today and  showing them around this very Chamber.   Mr. Bob Bracken is chock-full of knowledge, and he taught history  courses for Port Washington public schools. His delightful wife, Mrs.  Bracken, taught business courses in Great Neck South.   Unspoken heroes like Mr. and Mrs. Bracken paved the way for future  generations, and I would like to place their names and legacy in the  Congressional Record.   I thank Mr. and Mrs. Bracken from the bottom of my heart and on  behalf of New York's Third Congressional District for all of their  invaluable service to our community.                            ____________________
