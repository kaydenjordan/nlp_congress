 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of National  Police Week to honor the heroes who dedicate their lives to keep our  communities safe and secure.   Montana's courageous law enforcement officers are the epitome of  selfless public service. Yesterday marked the 37th annual National  Peace Officers' Memorial Service. It is only fitting that I honor one  of Montana's fallen heroes.   One year ago today, Broadwater County sheriff's deputy, Mason Moore,  made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. A routine traffic stop  turned into a pursuit of two violent suspects who callously took Deputy  Moore's life.   Deputy Moore was a dedicated husband and father of three, including  twin teenage boys. His sacrifice to keep his community safe will not be  forgotten.   Today, Mr. Speaker, I honor the law enforcement community in Montana  during National Police Week for their dedication, service, and  sacrifice. I am grateful for those in uniform who serve and protect our  communities and pray for their safety.                            ____________________
