 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment indicates that no funding in  this act shall be used or otherwise made available by this act to end  Reserve Officers' Training Corps, ROTC, programs at HBCUs, Hispanic- Serving Institutions, and Tribal Colleges and Universities.   I want to emphasize this program because so many of us have these  colleges in our congressional districts. Those ROTC programs provide  training to college students to prepare them for future service in the  branches in the U.S. military, the Army, Air Force, and Navy.   Coming from the State of Texas, I can assure you, Mr. Chairman, with  my interaction with so many in the United States military, those who  have said that it is a pathway to leadership and success, I know how  important these programs are.   The Army ROTC alone provides $274 million in scholarship money to  more than 13,000 students. It is interesting to take note of the fact,  as it relates to African Americans and Hispanics, the leadership that  has come from these programs: Andrew P. Chambers, lieutenant general,  retired; George A. Alexander; Colonel Claude A. Burnett; Colonel  Derrick W. Flowers; Colonel Senodja Sundiata-Walker, currently serving  as the chief of program support branch.   These are all individuals who have been the beneficiaries of ROTC  programs at HBCUs, Hispanic-Serving Institutions, and Tribal Colleges  and Universities.   Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairwoman for her remarks  and concern. I believe that the military has great interest in the ROTC  program and particularly in recruitment in HBCUs and Hispanic-Serving  Institutions.   Let me also say, however, Mr. Chairman, I want to rise to emphasize  my commitment to PTSD funding. I want to ensure as we go forward that  we will increase the PTSD funding. I am interested in it being  increased in particular by $5 million, but I know there are other  amendments that would increase it even more.   If we know the suffering from those who have PTSD as I have, this is  something that I have worked for, fought for, and advocated for. The  reason, Mr. Chairman, is I see it every day.   My amendment would focus on the needs of those who want to live a  normal life with post-traumatic stress disorder. Our soldiers are still  coming back from places like Syria. We know they have come back from  Afghanistan and Iraq, but they are still fighting there. And PTSD,  recently diagnosed in these wars, to give these people the ability to  be with their family, to be able to have positions because the  treatment is there, to regain their life because what they have seen  from the bloodshed of IEDs and the tragedies of war warrant this  support of post-traumatic stress disorder funding.   So I want to make note of that on the Record, of my support and the  support for the increase. I close by saying I ask for those in support  of the Jackson Lee amendment dealing with the ROTC, HBCUs, Hispanic- Serving and Tribal Institutions. It is a valuable program and a  valuable use for that program to recruit more people from those  communities.   Mr. Chairman, I ask support for the Jackson Lee amendment.   Mr. Chair, I thank the Chair and Ranking Member of the Rules  Committee for making this Jackson Lee Amendment in order for  consideration of ``H.R. 6157, the Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal  Year 2019.''   I also thank Chair Kay Granger and Ranking Member Peter J. Visclosky  for their work in bring the Defense Appropriations bill before the  House for consideration.   This Jackson Lee Amendment is No. 1 on the Second Rule for H.R. 6157  and provides that no funding in this Act shall be used or otherwise  made available by this Act to end Reserve Officers Training Corps  (ROTC) programs at HBCUs, Hispanic Serving Institutions and Tribal  Colleges and Universities.   ROTC provides training to college students to prepare them for future  service in branches of the U.S. military: the Army, Air Force, and  Navy.   The Army, Navy, and Air Force ROTC programs are annual scholarship  awards, which combined, are the nation's largest scholarship grantors.   The Army ROTC alone provides $274 million in scholarship money to  more than 13,000 students each year, according to the U.S. Army Cadet  Command.   Nationally about 12,000 high school seniors compete for about 2,000  Army ROTC scholarships.   About half of these are three-year scholarships, and the other half  are four-year scholarships   Once students reach college, they can explore specific military  branches by enrolling in ROTC programs provided by the Army, Navy, or  Air Force.   ROTC programs train future officers to serve in the U.S. Armed  Forces.   To students who qualify, the ROTC programs offer scholarships that  cover the cost of their education.   In exchange, students make a commitment to maintain academic  excellence and later to fulfill active duty services in their chosen  branch of the Armed Forces.   ROTC programs reward academic excellence to students attending HBCUs,  Hispanic Servicing Institutions, and Tribal Colleges by providing a  path to military service.   I ask my Colleagues in the House to support this Jackson Lee  Amendment to the Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2019.

Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk,  Amendment No. 14.    Mr. Chairman, let me thank Chairwoman Granger and  Ranking Member Visclosky for their devotion to the men and women of the  Armed Forces who risk their lives to keep our Nation safe.   My amendment, and I appreciate the opportunity in presenting it, is  identical to an amendment that I offered and was adopted last year to  the Defense Appropriations Act of fiscal year 2018, H.R. 3219. My  amendment increases funding for Defense Health Program research and  development by $10 million. These funds will address the question of  breast cancer in the United States military.   Mr. Chairman, I am a breast cancer survivor, and the relief of the  care and cure is one that you cannot imagine. Just imagine being in the  United States military and being diagnosed. These funds are important  to increase that research to help our men and women in the United  States military.   The American Cancer Society called several strains of breast cancer a  particularly aggressive subtype associated with lower survival rates.  In this instance, it is triple negative breast cancer. That is one that  is deadly, more so than many other types, and I have seen close  friends, my neighbor, succumb to triple negative breast cancer.   This increased funding should be and, hopefully, will be utilized to  do important research in that area. This was evidenced by an article,  ``Fighting a Different Battle: Breast Cancer and the Military.''   Breast cancer can affect both men and women. The bad news is that  breast cancer has been just about as brutal on women in the military as  combat. Breast cancer has been just about as difficult to overcome as  well. More than 800 women have been wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan,  according to the Army Times; 874 military women were diagnosed with  breast cancer, just between the years 2000 and 2011. According to the  same study, more are expected as it grows.   The good news is that we have been working on it and, therefore, much  progress has been made.   The Jackson Lee amendment will allow the additional research on, as I  said, devastating triple negative breast cancer. That research is  particularly needed since women are joining the armed services in  increasing numbers and serving longer, ascending to leadership.   With increased age comes increased risk and the incidence of breast  cancer. Military people, in general, and, in some cases, specifically,  are at a significantly greater risk for contracting breast cancer,  according to Dr. Richard Clapp, a top cancer expert at Boston  University who works with the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention on military breast cancer issues.   Dr. Clapp notes that life in the military can mean exposure to a  witch's brew of risk factors directly linked to greater chances of  getting breast cancer.   So I ask my colleagues to remember that there are many challenges for  those who serve in the United States military. Health is one of them.   I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, let me thank the chairwoman for  acknowledging the importance of the research that is already  established. I want to reemphasize that, in the midst of breast cancer  research, there will be a focus on many subtypes, if you will, one of  them including triple negative breast cancer.   So with the expansion of women in the military, it is extremely  important to move forward with this amendment to help ensure that the  men and women who risk their lives to protect our freedom can live  longer, healthier lives.   I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment.   Mr. Chair, I want to thank Chairwoman Granger and Ranking Member  Visclosky for shepherding this legislation to the floor and for their  devotion to the men and women of the Armed Forces who risk their lives  to keep our nation safe.   Mr. Chair, thank you for the opportunity to explain my amendment,  which is identical to an amendment that I offered and was adopted last  year to the Defense Appropriations Act for FY2018 (H.R. 3219).   My amendment increases funding for the Defense Health Program's  research and development by $10 million.   These funds will address the question of breast cancer in the United  States military.   As a Member of Congress, a mother, a sister and a spouse, and a  breast cancer survivor, I feel a special responsibility to do all I can  to ensure every American can win in the fight against all types of  breast cancer but especially triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).   Breast cancer can affect both men and women.   The bad news is breast cancer has been just about as brutal on women  in the military as combat.   Let me say that sentence again.   Breast cancer has been just about as brutal on women in the military  as combat.   More than 800 women have been wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan,  according to the Army Times; 874 military women were diagnosed with  breast cancer just between 2000 and 2011.   And according to that same study, more are suspected; it grows.   The good news is that we have been working on it, and I want to add  my appreciation to the military.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 14, however, will allow for the additional  research.   That research is particularly needed since women are joining the  Armed Services in increasing numbers and serving longer, ascending to  leadership.   Within increased age comes increased risk and incidence of breast  cancer.   Not only is breast cancer striking relatively young military women at  an alarming rate, but male service members, veterans and their  dependents are at risk as well.   With a younger and generally healthier population, those in the  military tend to have a lower risk for most cancers than civilians-- including significantly lower colorectal, lung and cervical--but breast  cancer is a different story.   Military people in general, and in some cases very specifically, are  at a significantly greater risk for contracting breast cancer,  according to Dr. Richard Clapp, a top cancer expert at Boston  University who works at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  on military breast cancer issues.   Dr. Clapp notes that life in the military can mean exposure to a  witch's brew of risk factors directly linked to greater chances of  getting breast cancer.            statistics on african american women and breast cancer    In 2013, the American Cancer Society Surveillance and Health Services  Institute estimated that 27,060 black women would be diagnosed with the  illness.   The overall incidence rate of breast cancer is 10 percent lower in  African American women than white women.   African American women have a five-year survival rate of 78 percent  after diagnosis as compared to 90 percent for white women.   The incidence rate of breast cancer among women under 45 is higher  for African American women compared to white women.   Triple Negative Breast Cancer:   Accounts for between 13 percent and 25 percent of all breast cancer  in the United States;   Onset is at a younger age;   Is more aggressive; and   Is more likely to metastasize.   Currently, 70 percent of women with metastatic triple negative breast  cancer do not live more than five years after being diagnosed.  [[Page H5800]]    African American women are 3 times more likely to develop triple- negative breast cancer than White women.   African-American women have prevalence TNBC of 26 percent vs. 16  percent in non-African-American women.   African-American women are more likely to be diagnosed with larger  tumors and more advanced stages of breast cancer.   Currently there is no targeted treatment for TNBC exists.   Some researchers theorize that higher rates of triple negative tumors  among young African American Women may be explain, to some degree, the  poor prognosis of breast cancers diagnosed.   Not knowing if you have Triple Negative Breast Cancer is the biggest  threat to health.   Breast cancers with specific, targeted treatment methods, such as  hormone and gene based strains, have higher survival rates than the  triple negative subtype, highlighting the need for a targeted  treatment.   There continues to be a need for research funding for biomarker  selection, drug discovery, and clinical trial designs that will lead to  the early detection of TNBC and to the development of multiple targeted  therapies to treat this awful disease.   The dedication of funding for research into breast cancer is the  right track, we're on the right road.   The expansion of women in the military, makes this area of DoD  research particularly important to addressing the real breast cancer  risk posed to our women in uniform.   Today women make up around 15 percent of all service personnel in the  combined branches of the French military.   Women are 11 percent of the Army forces, 13 percent for the Navy, 21  percent of the Air Force and 50 percent of the Medical Corps.   In 2015, All U.S. military combat positions were opened up to women.   The fighting capacity of the military is linked to the health and  wellbeing of women throughout the armed services.   We can offer another tool in the work to keep the women of the  military healthy and free of breast cancer through development of test  that can detect the disease in its earliest stages and treatments that  increase survival rates should breast cancer be contracted.   I urge my colleagues to support Jackson Lee Amendment No. 14.   Mr. Chair, I want to thank Chairwoman Granger and Ranking Member  Visclosky for shepherding H.R. 6157, the ``Defense Appropriations Act  for Fiscal Year 2019,'' to the floor and for their devotion to the men  and women of the Armed Forces who risk their lives to keep our nation  safe.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 14 increases funding for the PTSD by $5  million.   These funds should be used toward outreach activities targeting hard  to reach veterans, especially those who are homeless or reside in  underserved urban and rural areas, who suffer from Post-Traumatic  Stress Disorder (PTSD).   Mr. Chair, along with traumatic brain injury, PTSD is the signature  wound suffered by the brave men and women fighting in Afghanistan,  Iraq, and far off lands to defend the values and freedom we hold dear.   For those of us whose daily existence is not lived in harm's way, it  is difficult to imagine the horrific images that American servicemen  and women deployed in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other theaters of war see  on a daily basis.   In an instant a suicide bomber, an IED, or an insurgent can  obliterate your best friend and right in front of your face.   Yet, you are trained and expected to continue on with the mission,  and you do, even though you may not even have reached your 20th  birthday.   But there always comes a reckoning. And it usually comes after the  stress and trauma of battle is over and you are alone with your  thoughts and memories.   And the horror of those desperate and dangerous encounters with the  enemy and your own mortality come flooding back.   PTSD was first brought to public attention in relation to war  veterans, but it can result from a variety of traumatic incidents, such  as torture, being kidnapped or held captive, bombings, or natural  disasters such as floods or earthquakes.   People with PTSD may startle easily, become emotionally numb  (especially in relation to people with whom they used to be close),  lose interest in things they used to enjoy, have trouble feeling  affectionate, be irritable, become more aggressive, or even become  violent.   They avoid situations that remind them of the original incident, and  anniversaries of the incident are often very difficult.   Most people with PTSD repeatedly relive the trauma in their thoughts  during the day and in nightmares when they sleep.   These are called flashbacks; a person having a flashback may lose  touch with reality and believe that the traumatic incident is happening  all over again.   Mr. Chair, the fact of the matter is that most veterans with PTSD  also have other psychiatric disorders, which are a consequence of PTSD.   These veterans have co-occurring disorders, which include depression,  alcohol and/or drug abuse problems, panic, and/or other anxiety  disorders.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 14 recognizes that these soldiers are first  and foremost, human, who live their experiences.   Ask a veteran of Vietnam, Iraq, or Afghanistan about the frequency of  nightmares they experience, and one will realize that serving in the  Armed Forces leaves a lasting impression, whether good or bad.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 14 will help ensure that ``no soldier is  left behind'' by addressing the urgent need for more outreach toward  hard to reach veterans suffering from PTSD, especially those who are  homeless or reside in underserved urban and rural areas of our country.   I urge all Members to support Jackson Lee Amendment No. 14.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
