 Madam Speaker, I have to tell you, there is a  virus infecting this Congress, and it is not the 'rona. It is  Republican testosterone poisoning.   All year long, we have heard not one peep from Republicans about  Social Security or Medicare--nothing. They have been passing  legislation that erodes the health protections of Americans and then  high-fiving after these horrible bills pass.   They won't admit that 63 million seniors will be hurt by their cuts  to Social Security--so watch out, granny, because they are coming for  you--or that they will cut the lifeline of millions who depend on  Medicare to survive.   Instead, we have been stuck in this Republican romper room.   The American people don't want to hear your lies, and they don't want  to watch your Republican civil warfare meltdown.   They care about their healthcare, jobs, keeping the government open,  growing the economy, and protecting us at home and abroad.   They care about being able to put food on the table and having a home  to go to.   They care about having a Social Security check in the mail, one that  they were promised for their years of work.   They care about what is real to them, and you are not it.  [[Page H4966]]    For this reason, I ask my colleagues to defeat the previous question  so that we can bring up H.R. 178, an important piece of legislation  affirming the House's commitment to protecting Social Security and  Medicare.
