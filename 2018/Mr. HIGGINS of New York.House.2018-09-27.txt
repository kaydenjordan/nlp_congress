 Mr. Speaker, since 2010, Congress has  invested $2.5 billion to fund the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, a  program that has protected and restored the largest source of fresh  water in the world.   A new study coordinated by the Great Lakes Commission and conducted  by the University of Michigan has shown restoring our waterways is also  restoring economic opportunity in the once struggling Great Lakes  region. Every Federal dollar invested is producing three to four times  that amount in regional economic growth and activity.   Thirty years ago, the Buffalo River was declared biologically dead  and ecologically destroyed because of industrial dumping of toxic waste  directly into the river. In Buffalo and western New York, Great Lakes  Restoration Initiative investments in and around the Great Lakes and  the Buffalo River have led to more than $100 million in private sector  investments along the water's edge, new residential demand, increased  tourism, and a waterfront rebirth.   Time and again, I have stood on this floor and fought to maintain the  Great Lakes restoration funding, and this is why: the investments made  are bringing our waterways and our cities back to life.                            ____________________
