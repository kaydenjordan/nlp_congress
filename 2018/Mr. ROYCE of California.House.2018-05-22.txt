 Mr. Speaker, it was 5:39 a.m. on June 25,  2010 when we passed the Dodd-Frank Conference Committee Report. At that  early morning hour--other than a need for sleep--there was little we  agreed upon. But one thing stood out, Republicans and Democrats openly  discussed that there were problems in the bill that would need fixing.  We knew some of the unintended (and intended) consequences that  community banks and credit unions would face when looking to lend to  homeowners and small businesses.   Sadly, Mr. Speaker, it has taken nearly 8 years for us to pass into  law any meaningful changes of those sweeping reforms. Smaller  institutions have suffered; they have fewer assets over which to spread  ever-increasing compliance costs. That's what leads to this conundrum  where we have fewer banks today than we did during the Great  Depression.   Today, we take a step in rewriting these wrongs. I'm particular proud  that the bill before us includes many provisions I authored on a  bipartisan basis. S. 2155 provides potential homeownership for the so- called ``credit invisibles,'' increases small business lending from  credit unions, and improves access to capital for companies looking to  go public and hire more workers.   I urge my colleagues to pass these overdue reforms.
