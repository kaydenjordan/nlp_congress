 Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the people of Pennsylvania's  12th Congressional District, I rise to offer our condolences on the  passing of former State representative J. Doyle Corman.   Senator Corman represented the 34th senatorial district, including  areas within Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District from 1977 to  1998. While in the State Senate, Senator Corman championed lower taxes,  transportation issues, local government, and reforming the State's  welfare system.   More importantly, Senator Corman was a family man who prided himself  on titles other than ``senator.'' Titles like: Public servant, husband,  father, grandfather, great grandfather. These titles are Senator  Corman's lasting achievements. Even more so fitting, as an example for  his son, Jake, who ran for and won his Senate seat following his  father's retirement and has served as the Pennsylvania State Senate  majority leader for the last three legislative sessions.   A family man, community servant, and friend--that is the legacy of  Senator J. Doyle Corman.   On behalf of the people of Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional  District, I again send our heartfelt condolences to the Corman family  for the loss of such a great figure and public servant.                            ____________________
