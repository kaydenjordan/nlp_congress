 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the month of  March as Women's History Month. This is a time dedicated to recognizing  and honoring the women throughout American history who have helped  shape our Nation.   Let me be clear: I do mean Women's History Month. Women have been  fighting for over a century for our right to vote, our right to be  heard, and our right to have a seat at the table.   Now, the woke left is claiming that instead of celebrating women this  month, we should be celebrating birthing people.   Well, last I checked, the only person who could actually give birth  was a woman, but let's not let the facts get in the way of a good  story.   They claim the phrase ``woman'' is offensive to trans women, and  because of that, we should choose a more inclusive phrase.   Well, let me just say: I will be celebrating Women's History Month. I  will not celebrate the woke left forcing the rest of America to call a  man a woman, especially when these men are actively threatening women's  rights by demanding to be allowed to compete in sports against  biological women like Riley Gaines.   So congratulations to all the women.                            ____________________
