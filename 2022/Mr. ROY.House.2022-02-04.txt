 Madam Speaker, I appreciate my colleague from Arizona (Mr.  Schweikert), as he always does, making such a strong case for the need  for this body to do the hard work that we are supposed to do and  actually using not just taxpayer money but borrowed money remotely  effectively.   He has made the case for a long time about how mandatory spending,  the spending that we had promised to people through Medicare, Social  Security, and other programs, is blowing the lid off of our budget and  the need for us to get right and that there are ways that we can solve  the problem. There are ways that we can take dramatic steps to lower  the costs of healthcare, which the gentleman from Arizona talks about  regularly, about the need for us to do to drive down the costs of  healthcare so that we can actually contain this beast that is consuming  our expenditures and causing us to have to borrow so much money, weaken  ourselves against China, and so forth.   So, I thank the gentleman from Arizona for his consistency on this  matter. Would that our body or even our own Conference be so consistent  in having an interest in having that conversation.   I would note again for my constituents, for those people across the  country, all of you that are watching this on C-Span, that I am  speaking to an empty Chamber.   This is what we do. This is debate on the floor of the United States  House of Representatives. We come down, and we had five votes earlier  today--I think four. One got wiped off. We have four votes on two  amendments.   Amendments, right? They are amendments that are offered in the Rules  Committee, where the powers that be decide what we get to debate on the  floor of the House.   I am a Member of the United States Congress with an election  certificate for the some 700,000-odd people in central Texas that I  represent, yet I have never had the opportunity to offer an amendment  on the floor of the House of Representatives.   This is not the people's House. This is a House of a handful of hand- selected individuals on both sides of the aisle who sit in a back room  and decide what we get to debate about and what we get to discuss and  what we get to vote on. My colleagues on both sides of the aisle know  this, yet this is what we continue to do.   I gave a speech a little while back in December about the United  States House of free stuff because that is what we are. Neither party  has ever met a bill that they are not willing to vote for because it  sounds good, right?   It doesn't matter how much it costs. It doesn't matter what it means  in terms of debt, as my colleague from Arizona was just talking about  in terms of debt. It just doesn't matter because we are the United  States House of free stuff.   You got a bill that sounds good? You got a problem that you want to  solve? Come to Congress. We will write you a bill. We will print you  some money because there is no consequence to printing the money.   In what world is that a way to govern? The world is supposedly  looking at us being this august institution, the people's House, and  here I sit alone. My colleagues have headed off to the airport to fly  home. We will come back on Monday. We will punch through a no doubt  really important list of predetermined items decided by some Rules  Committee people dropped on the floor and say: Take it or leave it.  Vote yes or no.   Boy, that is inspirational, looking at how a bill becomes a law.  Schoolhouse Rock laughs at us because there is no debate. There is no  amendment. Both sides just come down here and vote to spend more money  we don't have in order to buy your votes.    Well, our message to the American people is, are you for sale? Are  the American people for sale by listening to every Member of this body  go home and tell you all of the stuff they are bringing back home for  you with borrowed money?   Well, we have a decision to make about how we are going to spend the  people's money in the next 14 days.   Do we have a debate this week? Do we have a debate this week about  the continuing resolution? No. That is the bill that is continuing to  fund government that expires on February 18.   Did my Democratic colleagues, did the Speaker, come down and offer an  appropriations package or bill and say: Hey, let's have a debate and a  discussion about how we should spend the people's money and borrow more  money in order to carry out the functions and our obligations. No, we  haven't had that debate.   We voted on a garbage piece of legislation today that will do nothing  to check China while we are sending our athletes over to bow down to  the Chinese and allow them to take center stage on the world's stage.  China. Never mind all the slave camps. Never mind what they are doing  around the world. Never mind the espionage. Never mind the  cyberattacks. Never mind what they are doing in working with Iran,  working with our enemies.   Ignore all of that. Ignore the slave labor. Ignore the persecution.  Ignore what they did to doctors trying to tell the truth about what  happened at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Ignore the virus born in  China. Ignore all of that.   Just send our athletes over there, and then pass a bill on the floor  of this House that has literally no chance of checking China, holding  them to account, ensuring that they no longer continue to carry out the  atrocities that they are carrying out and continue to attack the United  States of America on a daily basis.   No, no, no, you just pass a bill, and you go give some speeches  about: Oh, we are focusing on China. Oh, but rally around the TV  tonight and watch our athletes hanging out over in China.   And then have the Speaker of the House say: Oh, don't speak out.  Don't say anything. Something bad might happen to you.   Where is the spine or backbone of the woman from Texas sending the  message to the coach of the Miracle on Ice hockey team that said beat  those commie bastards? We don't have any of that here.   In 14 days, the funding of government expires, and what will we do?  We will come down here on the floor with some forced, last-minute CR,  and then each side will go out and give their talking points about how  the other side's priorities are wrong, and you are going to borrow more  money as we have now surpassed $30 trillion.   More important than that, when Members of this body or the United  States Senate vote for a continuing resolution--I want every American  to listen to me. When they vote for a continuing resolution to fund  government, they are voting to fund the enforcement of vaccine mandates  that are causing our men and women in uniform to be forced out of  service, to be discharged. They are enforcing laws against our men and  women who are serving so valiantly on the front lines in healthcare,  nurses and doctors that are getting forced out of service, forced out  of the ability to care for people after a lifetime of work, doctors in  the  [[Page H972]]  Defense Department daring to say they want to have informed consent  getting fired, getting fired for daring to question a politicized  vaccine, if you can even call it a vaccine. It is a shot for a  politicized virus.   And we all know it is a sham, just like all the mask mandates,  sitting here on the floor of the House Chamber, are a sham, just like  all the mask mandates on our kids in schools are a sham.   They are forcing our kids into the corners and forcing kids out of  their schools and causing mental health issues and causing health  issues and causing suicide rates to go up, all of which was entirely  predictable.   And this body cowers in fear, running around here. If you dare walk  down the hallway not wearing a mask, people say: Get away. Get away.   What kind of a country are we? Putting our children in the corner in  masks when there is zero science to back up that it in any way, shape,  or form is good for them or their families or the teachers that are  allegedly teaching them.   God bless the woman at Prince George County, Virginia, who yesterday  took the school board to task for their duplicitous lies about masks,  blaming the Governor. And now you got a new Governor. Now you have got  a new Governor who has changed the law. And what is that school board  doing? Finding every reason in the world to force those kids to be  masked because that is what this is about. It is about power and force.   Well, the American people have had it. Parents across this country  have had it. They have had it with school boards that are forcing  critical race theory on their kids. They have had it with school boards  that are forcing their kids to be masked. They have had it with the  inability to get healthcare and the inability to get treatments when  they know full well there are treatments that will help people, and we  refuse to allow them to exist.   We have the FDA shutting down monoclonal antibody treatments in Texas  and in other parts around the country when there is no basis to do so  when you have the omicron burning through with very reduced lethality,  with very little indication that it would impact our children. You have  study after study demonstrating that the risk for our children of dying  from the virus is so statistically insignificant relative to the need  for a so-called vaccine and/or the dangers posed by a vaccine in kids.   Then everybody throws back and says, oh, Chip, we have had vaccine  mandates forever. Hold on a second. We have never had a Federal vaccine  mandate like this administration is cramming down the throats of the  American people.   Show it to me. We haven't had a vaccine that was adopted across the  country even by local governments and school boards that didn't have  exceptions or didn't have a significant amount of time, science,  evidence, and studies behind it. That is the truth.   My dad had polio. He got polio in 1949 before the Salk vaccine 5, 6  years later.                                time  1300    Go study how that vaccine got rolled out. It didn't get rolled out  crammed down by the Federal Government in less than a year. People  figured out to adopt it, take time, roll it out. And by the way, we  rolled out this vaccine exponentially faster than the polio vaccine.   And all those people would come and say, Oh, Chip Roy would cause  polio to come back. These are all lies. They are all said to create and  intimidate and cause fear. I am not going to play the, Oh, I am going  to tell you absolutely I love the vaccine, go get vaccinated. I just  don't want a mandates' game because that is all my side wants to do  because they don't want to take this issue head-on.   This is about power, and this is about limiting freedom. This is  about undermining the ability of the American people to make choices  for themselves. And it is causing harm. It is killing people by taking  away our ability to focus on therapies and treatments because we have  gotten so focused on a vaccine and cramming that vaccine down the  American people. And it is political. And we should be ashamed of  ourselves. And we shouldn't fund it.   We should not fund a government enforcing vaccines on the American  people. We shouldn't force them on our doctors. We shouldn't force them  on our nurses. We shouldn't force them on our students. We shouldn't  force them on our brave men and women in uniform. We shouldn't force  them on Border Patrol--all of whom, having these forced mandates, are  causing some of them to lose their job, lifetime public servants;  people that have served their country honorably for years.   We are standing here in the House Chamber, and I am looking up at the  13 stripes, the 50 stars, in a country that says, ``the land of the  free.'' And yet, this government, through the power of government, is  forcing people to get vaccinated against their will when we know it is  absolutely true that natural immunity is real, that natural immunity,  if you had the virus, is every bit as strong or stronger than vaccine  immunity. So you are forcing an individual to take a shot, even if they  have natural immunity, or lose their job, in America.   I, for one, will not abide that, and I am going to take every step I  can in the next 14 days to make everybody up here in Washington  understand, if you vote to fund this government without stopping the  vaccine mandates, you are voting for those vaccine mandates being  applied to doctors, healthcare workers, our men and women in uniform,  Federal contractors, Border Patrol--all of those people that are  serving publicly and trying to serve their country.   I see the gentleman from California here.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Issa).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California. That  means a lot coming from him and his great service here in this body, as  well as his experience in the private sector, working in the healthcare  industry, a great expertise that I don't have. My expertise is mostly  on the other end of that as a cancer survivor and watching my dad deal  with polio and those other issues.   But I find it astonishing, whether you are talking about people  getting fired from their job--or using a slightly  [[Page H973]]  different example--if you look at the vaccine mandates that are being  applied at our Nation's capital in the seat of liberty, here in the  United States of America, if you are in the District of Columbia and  you go to a restaurant and you show them that you took a test that  afternoon and are negative for COVID but you are not vaccinated, you  can't go in. But if you are vaccinated and you are positive for COVID,  you can go in.   In what universe does that make sense? But that is what we are doing.  We are turning logic and common sense on its head. And we are doing so  because--I agree with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, by  the way--we politicize the virus, and we politicize our response to it.    Our friends in Japan, they put out their public policy as: There is a  vaccine. We think it is good. We think you ought to consider taking it  or strongly encourage you to take it. There are some risks that we are  studying. We are not going to mandate it.   And their vaccination rates are higher than ours. Now maybe they are  a more compliant society. There are all sorts of reasons behind it; we  are bigger. But it tells you something. Why is that not our position as  a country. Right? Encouraging people.   My dad is 79 years old and a polio survivor. I wanted him to get the  vaccine; I wanted him to get the boost. He is particularly vulnerable.  My mom. But it ought to be up to us. We ought to be able to decide for  our families. I assume the gentleman agrees.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California. I am  just going to wind down here and say this is our time to lead. It does  not matter who is the majority in this body. This is the people's  House, and this is the people's House whether the Democrats are in  charge or the Republicans are in charge.   And we have a question before the body, and the Senate will have a  question before that body: Will you continue to fund the enforcement of  mandates and vaccines in a way that is causing the best among us, of  our public servants, in our military, in our hospitals to lose their  jobs with no basis in science for continuing to do so?   If this is the land of the free, then let us stand up. Let's stand up  for freedom and let us reject these mandates.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
