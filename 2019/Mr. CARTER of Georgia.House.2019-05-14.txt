 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Sergeant Kelvin Ansari, who passed away in the line of duty on Saturday  night at the age of 50.   On Saturday night, Sergeant Ansari and Officer Douglas Thomas arrived  to investigate a robbery in downtown Savannah. Both officers returned  to the scene later that night after receiving a description of the  suspect's car, who they thought had left the scene. However, the  individual was still inside the car and opened fire. Both police  officers were struck, but Sergeant Ansari later succumbed to his  injuries.   Joining the police department in Savannah in 2008, Sergeant Ansari  had previously served in the United States Army for 21 years. He was a  father of four, a husband, and a leader who dedicated so much of his  life to protecting our country and our community.   It is unfortunate in times like these that we are reminded of the  danger that our police officers face each day in keeping our  communities safe.   Sergeant Ansari's family and friends, as well as the entire Savannah  Police Department, are in our thoughts and prayers during this most  difficult time.                            ____________________
