 Madam President, I appreciate the words of the  distinguished Senator from Hawaii. Those of us who served in law  enforcement know the temptation to seek out this kind of military  hardware and the basic uselessness and cost of it when that is done.   I will just be very brief in mentioning that we had a small, very  safe, and very quiet community. The police chief was in my office when  I was State's attorney, and the chief law enforcement officer of the  county was all excited because he was going to get an armored personnel  carrier. I said: What are you going to do with it?   Well, just in case there is an uprising.   I said: An uprising is whether somebody is shouting too much on your  Fourth of July parades. I said: If you get that, I can assure you that  if it is used, I will have an inquiry into why it was used, and no  cases from your jurisdiction will be allowed in the court. He decided  he could find better uses of their other things.   I said: Besides, you are going to get laughed out of town if you get  it.                                 Coronavirus    I have spoken many times about the need for another COVID-19  supplemental. We see the frightening trajectory of this virus. The  terrible human suffering, loss, and economic devastation that is  causing families, businesses, and public services in every State and  municipality in this country have greatly accentuated the urgency of  that need.   As the coronavirus continues to outpace the White House's appallingly  belated, I would say, incompetent, inadequate, and incoherent efforts  to contain it, and while they keep trying to make a sound bite, the  number of Americans becoming sick and dying continues to rise.   They ought to be worried, first and foremost, about Americans and  Americans' health and Americans' safety far more than what might be a  political sound bite for this fall's election. I remind those who are  running this fall, if you want to make sound bites about this and not  do anything, as of yesterday, the virus has infected more than 3.8  million Americans. It has killed more than 143,000. Those are not  numbers. Those are people. There have been 30,000 more Americans who  have been killed by this virus in the past 5 months than died in  Vietnam, Korea, Iraq, and Afghanistan combined.   What is the President's response? Well, the virus will soon just go  away. After dismissing the virus as nothing to worry about and  predicting that the U.S. economy would come roaring back in June, our  self-proclaimed wartime President has, for all intents and purposes,  left the battlefield.   Unfortunately, the people who are fighting COVID have not left the  battlefield. These are friends of mine. I have known people who have  died from this. We all do. Hopefully, we all know doctors and nurses  and others who work on the frontlines of this.   After months of the President belittling those who wear masks to  protect themselves and others, almost nothing he has said about this  pandemic has turned out to be accurate or, worse yet, helpful. At this  point, his priority appears to be keeping the Confederate flag flying  and honoring those who fought to defend slavery and destroy the Union.  This is appalling, even for this divisive President who wants to  protect the names of people who are traitors to the United States and  fought against the United States. Why not put names of people on those  forts and those military bases who actually defended the United States  and fought for us?   Back to COVID-19. We know the virus toll in this country is  staggering, and unlike many countries where governments quickly put in  place effective controls, and the virus has receded in those countries  that put the controls in and their economies have largely reopened,  here, it is getting worse.   We also need to be aware of what the virus is doing in other parts of  the world because that will determine how long it is going to take to  defeat this pandemic and how long before life returns to normal in our  own country. Any virus is only an airplane trip away from our shores,  but that has been ignored by the White House.   Last week, the World Health Organization, which the White House  blames for favoring China--at the same time, incidentally, President  Trump was praising Xi Jinping for China's response to the virus-- reported more than 14 million confirmed infections and more than  600,000 deaths worldwide. The virus has spread to 216 countries and  territories. It affected the entire world. Countries with the most  advanced healthcare systems in the world are struggling to cope with  the flood of sick people. As bad as that is, the situation is far worse  in developing countries, where billions of people have no access to  quality medical services, and,  [[Page S4318]]  for that matter, even safe water and sanitation.   Their governments have minimal ability to stop the spread of the  virus or to shore up their failing economies and to stop the virus from  going elsewhere. Without aid from the United States and other donors,  the virus spreads out of control. You know, we are not isolated from  the rest of the world. We have already seen this happening in our  hemisphere.   According to USAID; the World Food Programme; the Vaccine Alliance,  GAVI; the Global Fund; and other public health and humanitarian  organizations, COVID-related needs around the world are spiking in  every area. USAID said that whatever amount of resources the Congress  provides is not going to be enough.   They describe massive gaps in meeting what they foresee as a tidal  wave of need in the making, at the same time that they and others are  trying to stop the backsliding in other infectious disease programs,  which, because we are all on one globe, ultimately affect us.   If the current trend continues, 270 million people will be without  adequate food by the end of this year, an increase of 150 million due  to the pandemic alone. U.S. Food for Peace Program, known as P.L. 480  Title II, has been a lifesaver for over 60 years. More than 3 billion  people in 150 countries have received P.L. 480 food aid, and it has  been backed strongly by both Republicans and Democrats in this body. It  is absolutely vital to the COVID-19 response.   The World Food Programme is undertaking the biggest humanitarian  response in its history. Does that affect us in the United States? Of  course, it does because we are interrelated, and because if these  problems continue in other parts of the world, ultimately, they do  affect us very, very much.   In the United States, we see that our agriculture economy is  continuing to suffer. The Trump trade wars have hurt our farmers. The  pandemic has accelerated their decline. Actually, additional funding  for P.L. 480 will help address immediate global hunger needs, while it  would also support America's farm community suffering from the economic  crisis caused by COVID-19.   The U.N. believes the number of COVID-19 infections are massively  underreported and is running out of funds to support the hundreds of  passengers and cargo flights carrying international aid and workers'  food and medical supplies, and, of course, many of these humanitarian  workers are themselves becoming ill.   Both USAID and the U.N. have stated that you have to have U.S.  leadership to get other countries to help. It is a practice widely  understood, apparently everywhere except at the White House. The less  prepared we and other countries are for what lies ahead, the worse it  is going to be for them and for us.   You know, this is not just being good humanitarians on our part; we  have an interest in this, too--in the world being healthy. It is not a  problem that is going to be solved by an ``America First'' policy or by  building a wall and saying somebody else will pay for it or by blaming  others.   Americans can't safely resume normal international travel and  commerce without a successful global strategy to reduce the number and  rate of infections. As long as the virus is spreading in this  hemisphere and beyond, Americans will continue to become infected and  die, and the U.S. economy will suffer, no matter how many tweets and  sound bites come from the White House.   The amount appropriated for the international response to the virus  in previous COVID-19 supplementals totals $2.4 billion, including less  than $1 billion for food and other humanitarian aid. That is about one- half of 1 percent of the sum total of those emergency supplementals.   I will put much of these numbers in the Record, but there are  billions needed for the cost of purchasing and distributing billions of  doses of a coronavirus vaccine, as soon as one is available. GAVI will  play an essential role in that, protecting the world and protecting us  because that distribution is going to be immensely difficult and  costly, and we have to be prepared as soon as the vaccine is proven to  be safe and effective.   The longer Congress delays, then the more costly--in lives and  dollars--an effective international response to COVID-19 becomes.   The President does not want to be the leader we need at this critical  time. So it is up to Congress--an independent branch of government--to  actually stand up and do our work.   On July 10, the House Appropriations Committee marked up its fiscal  year 2021 bill for the Department of State and Foreign Operations,  which includes $10 million in emergency funding to respond to COVID-19.  That is a good start, but we have a lot more to do. I hope the proposal  that will finally be unveiled by the majority leader will include funds  for an international response.   Senator Graham--a Republican--and I have worked together on this  Foreign Ops bill. We are in agreement that we need strong U.S.  leadership at this critical time. I am going to be making  recommendations to other members of the Appropriations Committee on  this.   I will close on an entirely different matter.   When I see a Navy veteran come and ask masked, unidentified soldiers,  police officers--nobody really said who they were--dispersing a crowd  in Portland, and he just stands there and says: Look, who are you? What  are you doing? He was not being in any way threatening. What is their  response to him? They start beating him and beating him and firing tear  gas at him. He simply asked: Who are you? Why are you in our town? What  are you doing? Will you please tell me who you are. They start beating  him, and they break his hand. This is a Navy veteran who has served our  country.   This is as out of control as anything else. And to hear smug comments  from members of the administration saying that we have to do this--no,  everybody knows they are doing that hoping that somehow it will help  the President's reelection.   I want to help the United States of America   I have spoken many times about the need for another COVID-19  supplemental. The frightening trajectory of this virus and the terrible  human suffering, loss, and economic devastation it is causing families,  businesses, and public services in every State and municipality in this  country, have greatly accentuated the urgency of that need.   As the coronavirus continues to outpace the White House's appallingly  belated, incompetent, inadequate, and incoherent efforts to contain it,  the number of Americans becoming sick and dying continues to rise.   As of yesterday, the virus has infected more than 3.8 million  Americans and has killed more than 143,000.   Those are not numbers. They are people. Thirty thousand more  Americans have been killed by this virus in the past 5 months than died  in Vietnam, Korea, Iraq, and Afghanistan combined.   The President's response? That the virus will ``soon just go away''.  After dismissing the virus as nothing to worry about and predicting  that the U.S. economy would come ``roaring back'' in June, our self- proclaimed ``war time President'' has for all intents and purposes left  the battlefield.   After months of belittling those who wear masks to protect themselves  and others, almost nothing he has said about this pandemic has turned  out to be accurate or helpful.   At this point, his priority appears to be keeping the confederate  flag flying and honoring those who fought to defend slavery and destroy  the Union. That is appalling, even for this divisive President.   The virus's toll in this country is staggering, and unlike many  countries where governments quickly put in place effective controls and  the virus has receded and economies have largely reopened, here it is  getting worse.   But we also need to be aware of what the virus is doing in other  parts of the world because that will determine how long it will take to  defeat this pandemic and how long before life returns to normal in our  own country. This, too, has been all but ignored by the White House.   Last week, the World Health Organization--which the White House  blames for favoring China at the same time President Trump was praising  Xi Jinping for China's response to the virus--reported more than 14  million confirmed infections and more than 600,000 deaths worldwide.  The virus has  [[Page S4319]]  spread to 216 countries and territories--in effect, the entire world.   Countries with the most advanced health care systems in the world are  struggling to cope with the flood of sick people. As bad as that is,  the situation is far worse in developing countries, where billions of  people have no access to quality medical services or even safe water  and sanitation.   Their governments have minimal ability to stop the spread of the  virus or to shore up their failing economies. Without aid from the  United States and other donors, the virus will spread out of control.  In fact, that is already happening in this hemisphere.   According to USAID, the World Food Programme, WFP; The Vaccine  Alliance, GAVI; the Global Fund; and other public health and  humanitarian organizations, COVID-related needs around the world are  spiking ``in every area'' and USAID says that whatever amount of  resources the Congress provides ``will not be enough.''   They describe ``massive gaps'' in meeting what they fore see as a  ``tidal wave of need'' in the making, at the same time that they and  others are trying to stop the backsliding in other infectious disease  programs.   According to WFP, if current trends continue, 270 million people will  be without adequate food by the end of this year, an increase of 150  million due to the pandemic alone.   The U.S. Food for Peace Program, known as P.L. 480--Title II, has  been a life-saver for over 60 years. More than three billion people in  150 countries have received P.L. 480 food aid.   This program is absolutely vital to the COVID-19 response. As  countries restrict international travel to slow the spread of the  virus, it is disrupting the transport and movement of food.   WFP is undertaking the biggest humanitarian response in its history.  According to David Beasley, ``[t]his unprecedented crisis requires an  unprecedented response. If we do not respond rapidly and effectively to  this viral threat, the outcome will be measured in an unconscionable  loss of life, and efforts to roll back the tide of hunger will be  undone.''   In the United States, the agriculture economy is continuing to  suffer. Not only have the Trump trade wars hurt our farmers, the  pandemic has accelerated their decline. Additional funding for P.L. 480  would help address immediate global hunger needs, while also supporting  America's farm community suffering from the economic crisis caused by  COVID-19.   The United Nations believes the number of COVID-19 infections is  ``massively under-reported,'' and is running out of funds to support  the hundreds of passenger and cargo flights carrying international aid  workers, food, and medical supplies. Their efforts are also threatened  by the fact that many health and humanitarian workers are getting sick.   All of this requires large infusions of money, and USAID and the U.N.  both say that U.S. leadership is crucial to obtaining contributions  from other donors. It is widely understood--at least everywhere except  inside the White House--that the less prepared we and other countries  are for what lies ahead the worse it will be for them and for us.   This is not a problem that will be solved by an ``America First''  policy or by building a wall or by blaming others.   Americans cannot safely resume normal international travel and  commerce without a successful global strategy to sustainably reduce the  number and rate of infections. As long as the virus is spreading in  this hemisphere and beyond, Americans will continue to become infected  and die and the U.S. economy will suffer.   The amount appropriated for the international response to the virus  in previous COVID-19 supplementals totals $2.4 billion, including less  than $1 billion for food and other humanitarian aid. That is less than  one-half of 1 percent of the sum total of those emergency  supplementals.   Today's appeals from just the Global Fund, WFP, and GAVI total $10  billion, and that doesn't include the needs of agencies like the UN  High Commissioner for Refugees, UNICEF, or our own programs  administered by USAID and the State Department.   Several billion dollars are needed just for the cost of purchasing  and distributing billions of doses of a coronavirus vaccine as soon as  one is available, in which GAVI will play a central role. The  distribution will be immensely difficult and costly, and we have to be  prepared as soon as a vaccine is proven to be safe and effective.   The longer Congress delays, the more costly--in lives and dollars--an  effective international response to COVID-19 becomes. Controlling the  outbreak here at home is ultimately a lost cause if we do not act  aggressively to assist other countries in the global fight against this  pandemic.   President Trump has shown that he cannot and will not be the leader  we need at this critical time. It is up to Congress. The longer we  delay, the more difficult and costly it will be to defeat this virus.   On July 10, the House Appropriations Committee marked up its fiscal  year 2021 bill for the Department of State and Foreign Operations,  which includes $10 billion in emergency funding for the international  response to COVID-19. That is a good start, but it is too little. The  virus is racing around the world and the costs of stopping it are  increasing every day.   I hope the proposal about to be unveiled by the majority leader  includes the necessary funds for the international response because, to  repeat, controlling the outbreak here at home is ultimately a lost  cause if we do not act aggressively to assist other countries against  this pandemic.   I believe Senator Graham and I are in agreement about the need for  strong U.S. leadership at this critical time. I will be making my own  recommendation to the other members of the Appropriations Committee for  the necessary funding to combat the virus overseas, and I urge other  Senators to support it.
