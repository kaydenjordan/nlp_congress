 Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from Vermont  for his kind words. We do agree, occasionally, about a few things. We  are, in some ways I think, the odd couple when it comes to things like  open government and freedom of information. We agree on those things,  somebody, I would say, from the left end of the political spectrum and  somebody like me from the right end of the political spectrum, which I  find particularly gratifying, but there are a lot of other things we  have different views on. That is not unusual or to be unexpected, but I  enjoy working with him when we can find those areas of common ground to  work on.                             Iran Sanctions Bill    Mr. President, last night, the Senate voted to move forward with  tough, new sanctions to hold Iran accountable for its continued support  of terrorism. The unanimous vote we had is a strong message to the  world that the United States will not tolerate Iran's complicity on  terror and a clear indicator of just how important this legislation is.   Just last month, Secretary of State Tillerson noted that ``Iran  remains a leading state sponsor of terror.'' I would amend that  slightly and say it is ``the'' leading state sponsor of terror.   The Secretary said he would be undertaking a review of the success or  failure of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action--what we know as the  lopsided nuclear deal President Obama inked with Iran--because,  unfortunately, as we have seen, the Obama administration's deal,  relative to Iran's nuclear aspirations, did zero--zero--to stop Iran's  investment in terrorism around the world. As a matter of fact, it  generated quite a bit of new cash which Iran could use to pay for acts  of terrorism around the world. So the JCPOA, the Iran nuclear deal, all  but cemented the status of the state sponsor of terrorism as a future  nuclear power.   I remember being in the House Chamber when Prime Minister Netanyahu  of Israel talked about this paving the way to Iran achieving a nuclear  weapon, albeit some 10 years hence, which may seem like a long time to  us, but if you are the nation of Israel, 10 years is right around the  corner if you are living in that neighborhood and going to be in its  crosshairs.  [[Page S3422]]    Part of the JCPOA, the Iran nuclear deal, released billions of  dollars to the Iranian regime and empowered our adversary--our avowed  enemy--to engage in even more terrorist activities abroad. Instead of  weakening Iran, it actually bolstered Tehran's hostile capabilities. On  top of that, President Obama pushed aside our strongest ally in the  region--I mentioned Israel--in order to lay a gift at the feet of one  of greatest antagonists of the United States, with little or no benefit  to our Nation. That is why it is no surprise Iran continues to violate  international restrictions against ballistic missile testing and  illicit arms transfers, flying in the face of any promises that were  made in the agreement.   Last year, then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper  testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee, confirming what  we had all feared: ``Iran's ballistic missiles are inherently capable  of delivering [weapons of mass destruction], and Tehran already has the  largest inventory of ballistic missiles in the Middle East.''   Under President Obama's nuclear deal, their conventional inventory  and capability are essentially free to grow, and grow they have.   So what kind of deal was the JCPOA, the Iran nuclear deal? It was a  lopsided deal. More importantly, it was a dangerous deal as well.   Of course, Iran's reach goes far beyond their own border. They  support the Assad regime in Syria and the Houthi rebellion in Yemen,  two groups which have continually encouraged violence against Americans  and even murder of their own citizens.   Last month, on his way to Saudi Arabia, Secretary of Defense James  Mattis confirmed that Iranian-supplied missiles were being fired by the  Houthis into Saudi Arabia. So not only is Iran breaking the nuclear  deal but also U.N. Security Council resolutions as well.   In Syria, Iran continues to prop up and shield the Butcher of  Damascus, Bashar al-Assad, even after he has brutally used chemical  weapons against his own people. Some 400,000 Syrians, at last count,  have lost their lives in the Syrian civil war, supported by Iran,  supported by Russia, propping up this butcher who is head of the  regime.   So last night's show of bipartisan support is more than just a  message of unity against terrorism; it is a sign the Senate will fight  to stop Iran from tightening its grip on power. The legislation we will  pass this week introduces new sanctions and embargoes on Iran.   First, it imposes new restrictions on persons who transact with and  support Iran's ballistic missile programs, giving our President  authority to impose sanctions on their weapons providers.   The legislation also makes clear that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard  Corps bears responsibility for destabilizing activities and terrorism  in the region by extending new sanctions to them as well.   This bill also addresses Iran's human rights abuses by directing the  Secretary of State to submit a list of people who are guilty of human  rights violations so we can take further action against them.   Lastly, it reaffirms the arms embargo by allowing the President to  block the property of any person or entity involved in the supply,  sale, or transfer of prohibited arms and related materiel to and from  Iran.   I also submitted yesterday an amendment to this Iranian sanctions  legislation that targets Mahan Air, which is Iran's largest commercial  airline. As a transporter of terrorists and weapons, Mahan Air is  nothing more than a commercial coverup for terrorist activities, and,  with routes in and out of Europe, it is essential for us to stop their  continued expansion and to understand how their activities bear on the  safety of American lives.   I am thankful for Chairman Corker's leadership on the Iran and now  Russia sanctions bill, and the expediency in which we are moving  forward. While we can't, in this bill, undo all of the harm caused by  the foreign policy of the Obama administration, we can work to correct  course, and I am glad we are doing so in a bipartisan way. Last night's  vote was a sign of unity, and I am looking forward to getting this  legislation through the Senate and onto the President's desk.   Mr. President, I wish to take a moment and talk about the Saudi arms  sale, which we will be voting on this afternoon at about 2:30 or in  that timeframe. We know Saudi Arabia remains under threat from the  violent ambitions of Iran, which I just got through speaking about, but  that is not just a threat to us, it is a threat in the region,  particularly to Sunni allies like Saudi Arabia.   A stronger Saudi Arabia will provide a powerful deterrent to Iranian  aggression. This particular sale of weapons, announced by the President  when he was in Saudi Arabia a couple weeks ago, will help provide  greater regional stability to pushing back the advancing tide of  Iranian-backed terrorism. It will help against Iranian-backed Houthis'  weak government control, which allows terrorism to flourish in the  region.   Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula has been described by U.S.  officials as the most active and dangerous affiliate of al-Qaida today,  with several thousands of adherents and fighters inside of Yemen  supported by the Iranian regime. AQAP, al-Qaida in the Arabian  Peninsula, has continued to take advantage of the political and  security vacuum. This arms sale will also bolster the kingdom's ability  to provide for its own security and continue contributing to  counterterrorism operations across the region, thereby reducing the  burden on the United States and our own military forces by equipping  them to do their own security and not depend on us.    The sale will also help deter regional threats and enhance the  kingdom's ability to protect its borders, contribute to coalition  counterterrorism operations, and target bad actors more precisely.   Finally, it will improve the kingdom's defensive military  capabilities. Since 2015, Saudi Arabia has intercepted more than 40  missiles fired at the kingdom by Iranian-backed Houthi militias. Nine  of these missiles have struck Saudi territory itself.   I look forward to voting in the 2:30 timeframe this afternoon against  the resolution of disapproval filed by our colleague. I think it is  important for us to help our allies defend themselves, to fill a power  vacuum left that would otherwise be filled by U.S. forces and military  effort.   I think it sends a strong message to Iran and their affiliates in the  Middle East that we will not stand quietly or stand silently in the  face of the continued growth of their terrorist activities and support  for terrorist activities around the world.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
