 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   As we make this transition, let me try and sum up where we are at  this particular time.   This particular bill was done in coordination with the U.S. Forest  Service under both the Obama administration and the Trump  administration. This has the approval of local governments, Tribes,  sportsmen's groups, and labor unions. The last time we had this bill,  it had a good bipartisan vote on it, but these are issues that the  Forest Service needs and they can use on day one of their issue.   What the Forest Service needs are resources, obviously. We know that.  But they also need the tools that they need to actually do their work.   Now, there are some on the fringe who are going to say that  everything is wrong here, but I would encourage them to get rid of the  usual rhetoric and to pocket the dogma for a minute and realize that  what we need to do is come up with a system that affects the planning  process.   The Forest Service admits they have 50 to 60 million acres of  forestland today that is ready to be a catastrophic catastrophe. They  want to treat 25 percent of what they own a year. They are only  treating 2 to 3 percent. That means, of the 50 to 60 million acres they  have that are in dire situations right now, they can only treat 3 a  year. That would take them 20 years to try and get through what needs  to be treated unless we give them new tools to reform the system to  make that process going in, and that is exactly what this bill does: it  rewards collaboration; it tries to stop unnecessary litigation; it  comes up with arbitration concepts that are in there; it expands the  ability of streamlining the process so they can get to work.   Our people need the resources to do their job. They need the tools.  We should make it very clear that money alone is not going to solve the  problem of wildfire catastrophe. What we have to do is solve the  conditions that create the catastrophic wildfires in the first place,  and that means that we need to make sure that we are doing things so we  can prohibit what has happened, which has been devastating to people  and their property; which has destroyed habitat for species, endangered  and unendangered; and which has created conditions of pollution in our  atmosphere.   All that has to take place. Everything in this bill is what the  experts in the Forest Service said they can do on day one after it is  passed. It needs to take place. It needs to be in addition to the  financial solving of the wildfire situation. You need to have these  reforms, and that is what we are pushing in this bill. It is why it is  so desperately needed and why it was worked out with the experts in the  field.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record a letter  from the National Conference of State Historic Preservation Officers  and a letter sent from 40 forestry coalitions that are in support of  this particular bill.                                        National Conference of State                                  Historic Preservation Officers,                                   Washington, DC, October 24, 2017.      Hon. Rob Bishop,      Chairman, House Committee on Natural Resources, Washington,           DC.        Dear Chairman Bishop: On behalf of the National Conference       of State Historic Preservation Officers (NCSHPO), we would       like to thank you and Congressman Bruce Westerman for       including language in the manager's amendment to H.R. 2936,       the Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017. The language,       which calls for the establishment of a Nationwide       Programmatic Agreement to pursue an efficient and effective       solution to historic preservation review, ensures state and       local input on the impact of federal undertakings on historic       resources.        The establishment of the Nationwide Programmatic Agreement       is consistent with the principal of states and communities       having a lead role in evaluating the impact of federal       projects on historic resources. This principal was enshrined       in law more than 50 years ago with the passage of the       National Historic Preservation Act and strengthened more than       40 years ago by the creation of the Historic Preservation       Fund.        Wildfires pose a threat to historic resources and NCSHPO       supports your effort to reduce their risk. As the bill moves       forward, NCSHPO and its members remain ready and willing to       help find a solution to any challenges faced in the       management of our nation's forests. Our members are committed       to assisting federal agencies in achieving this goal, while       also ensuring that state and local governments continue to       have say in the impact of federal undertakings on historic       resources.        We look forward to working with you on this important       issue.            Sincerely,                                                      Erik M. Hein,      Executive Director.                                   ____                                                      June 27, 2017.      Hon. Rob Bishop,      Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Raul Grijalva,      Ranking Member, Committee on Natural Resources, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Bishop & Ranking Member Grijalva: We write to       you today in strong support of HR 2936, the bipartisan       Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017.        Our federal forests are facing serious threats from fires,       insects, and diseases due to lack of active forest       management. The poor health of our federal forests also       threatens wildlife habitat, watersheds, and neighboring non-      Federal lands, as well as the vitality of rural, forested       communities across the country. HR 2936 contains provisions       intended to both address the disruption caused by fire       borrowing and to expedite needed forest management to improve       the health and vitality of our federal forests.        The Resilient Federal Forests Act provides Categorical       Exclusions (CE's) under the National Environmental Policy Act       will allow needed forest management projects to be more       quickly prepared, analyzed, and implemented. It will also       allow forest recovery projects to proceed more quickly,       addressing a dire need created by recent wildfire seasons.       The Forest Service has long experience with management       techniques to reduce forest pests, thin hazardous fuels,       create and maintain habitat for species, recover damaged       timber and protect water quality. These projects mitigate       risk and help create early successional forest habitat which       is good for wildlife.        The Forest Service does more complex NEPA documentation       than most other Federal agencies, and even after years of       collaboration, frequently finds itself in court where judges       scrutinize procedural issues, delaying needed management,       sometimes for years. The Resilient Federal Forests Act       addresses the complex, court-imposed NEPA burden that has       been forced on the Forest Service, while preserving       collaborative efforts and avoiding sensitive forest lands.        HR 2936 addresses both the excessive analysis requirements       imposed on even modest forest management projects, as well as       the dysfunctional system of funding suppression costs out of       forest management program accounts. Provisions in the bill       limit the acreage of Categorical Exclusions, and prohibits       their use in sensitive areas. The legislation provides access       to the disaster relief fund for wildfire suppression expenses       in excess of the 10-year average.        The House acted on a similar, bipartisan bill in 2015. The       need for action to address forest health conditions on our       national forest system is even higher today. Wildfire       suppression funding mechanisms developed in the past are no       longer adequate to address the conditions we are       experiencing. We urge to take up and pass HR 2936 as quickly       as possible.        We stand ready to work with both of you advance responsible       solutions to these serious national problems.

Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. McClintock), who has sat through 2 years of  discussions of the ideas from the Forest Service in creating this bill.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, 45 years ago, Congress enacted laws,  such as the National Environmental Policy Act, that promised to improve  the health of our forests. They imposed what have become endlessly  time-consuming and, ultimately, cost-prohibitive restrictions on our  ability to properly manage our national forests so that we can match  the tree density with the ability of the land to support it.   I think after 45 years of experience with these laws, we are entitled  to ask: How are our forests doing? The answer is damning. Our forests  are now catastrophically overgrown, often carrying four times the  number of trees that the land can support. In this stressed and  weakened condition, our forests are easy prey for drought, disease,  pestilence, and fire.   There is an old adage that excess timber comes out of the forest one  way or the other--it is either carried out or it burns out. When we  carried it out, we had resilient, healthy forests and a thriving  economy, as excess timber was sold and harvested before it could choke  our forests to death. In the years since then, we have seen an 80  percent decline in timber sales from our Federal lands and a  concomitant increase in acreage destroyed by forest fire. I would  remind my friend from Oregon that timber sales used to generate us  money, not cost us money.   The direct revenues and spin-off commerce generated by these sales  provided a stream of revenues that we could then use to improve our  national forests and share with the local communities affected.   The Resilient Federal Forests Act begins to move us back towards  sound and scientific forest management practices. It requires forest  managers to consider the cost of no action alternatives; it streamlines  fire and disease prevention programs and ensures that fire-killed  timber can be quickly removed to create both revenues and room to  restore fire-damaged lands; it ends the practice of raiding prevention  funds to fight fires; it streamlines onerous environmental review  processes without sacrificing environmental protection; and it provides  our forest managers with alternatives to resolve frivolous lawsuits.   Provisions that streamline the environmental reviews were already  signed into law last year for the Tahoe Basin, and the Forest Service  regional manager told me that is going to take their revenue processes  from 800 pages down to 40 pages and allow them to get their forest  there back to a sustainable level.   We made some very big mistakes 45 years ago, and our forests have  paid the price. This bill starts the long process of correcting those  mistakes and recovering our national forests, and I urge its adoption.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record two letters, one from the South  Tahoe Public Utility District, and the second from the Public Lands  Council and the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, in support of  H.R. 2936.                                                     June 22, 2017.      Hon. Rob Bishop,      Chairman, House Committee on Natural Resources, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Raul Grijalva,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Energy and Natural           Resources, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Bishop and Ranking Member Grijalva: As       entities responsible for delivering sustainable water supply       and renewable hydropower for millions of citizens throughout       the western U.S., we are writing in support of H.R. 2936, the       Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017. National Forest lands       are the largest single source of water in the U.S. and in       some regions of the west contribute nearly 50% of the overall       water supply that supports our farms and cities. The current,       unhealthy state of these forests, which contain some of the       nation's most valuable watersheds, increases the threat of       catastrophic wildfires. These high intensity wildfires       jeopardize the reliability, volume and quality of water for       tens of millions of  [[Page H8337]]       Americans, along with the wildlife, recreational, and multi-      purpose value of these lands.        The H.R. 2936 supports collaborative forest management,       streamlines the environmental review process, addresses the       unsustainable practice of fire borrowing, and includes an       innovative arbitration process. We believe it is critical       that both forest management reforms and resolution of the       ``fire borrowing'' issue are addressed in any legislation to       ensure on-the-ground forest restoration activities can       proceed at the pace and scale of the problem.        We appreciate your leadership on this important issue and       urge prompt passage of H.R. 2936, the Resilient Federal       Forests Act of 2017.            Sincerely,      National Water Resources Association.      Utah Water Users Association.      Association of California Water Agencies.      Placer County Water Agency.      South Tahoe Public Utility District.                                   ____                                                      June 27, 2017.      Hon. Rob Bishop,      Chairman, House Natural Resources Committee, Washington, DC.      Hon. Raul Grijalva,      Ranking Member, House Natural Resources Committee,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Bishop and Ranking Member Grijalva: The       Public Lands Council (PLC) and the National Cattlemen's Beef       Association (NCBA) strongly support H.R. 2936, the Resilient       Federal Forests Act of 2017, introduced by Rep. Bruce       Westerman (R-Ark.). PLC is the only national organization       dedicated solely to representing the roughly 22,000 ranchers       who operate on federal lands. NCBA is the beef industry's       largest and oldest national marketing and trade association,       representing American cattlemen and women who provide much of       the nation's supply of food and own or manage a large portion       of America's private property.        The Resilient Federal Forests Act will expedite       environmental reviews and assessments for the removal of dead       trees and set deadlines for reforestation projects to occur.       Such changes ensure forests are no longer neglected and       establish a healthier management pattern. Further, this       legislation discourages frivolous litigation by requiring       litigants who oppose a management project to come to the       table with an alternative, rather than just tying up agency       time and resources in court. The bill provides an incentive       for collaborative efforts between local governments, local       stakeholders and federal land management agencies. Finally,       the legislation prevents ``fire borrowing'' and stops federal       agencies from raiding accounts necessary for proper forest       and range management.        The severe mismanagement of federally-owned forests and       rangelands, due to outdated environmental laws and       regulations along with the abuse of the legal system by       radical special interest groups, creates devastating economic       hardship and danger for our members and rural communities       across the west. The livestock industry and rural economies       will spend decades attempting to recover from millions of       dollars' worth of infrastructure damage and forage loss that       have been the result of catastrophic wildfires in recent       years, not to mention the loss of valuable wildlife habitats.        It is scientifically proven that proper timber management       and rangeland management through grazing is the key to       maintaining healthy forests and preventing catastrophic       wildfires. However, according to the BLM, livestock grazing       has been reduced on BLM lands by as much as 50 percent since       1971, while the timber industry has been all but destroyed       over the last 30 years, due almost entirely to federal laws       and regulations and predatory environmental groups.       Restrictions have allowed the accumulation of fuel,       increasing risk of wildfires and leading to harm of forest       ecosystems and western communities--the watershed, wildlife,       air quality, rural communities and the taxpayers are all       negatively impacted.        PLC and NCBA believe that H.R. 2936 is a positive step       forward to returning management flexibility and fiscal       responsibility to the federal land management agencies. PLC       and NCBA appreciate the opportunity to provide our input on       behalf of our members--the nation's food and fiber producers.       H.R. 2936 is proactive, common sense legislation, and we       would encourage the committee to pass the bill out of       committee without delay.            Sincerely,      Dave Eliason,        President, Public Lands Council.      Craig Uden,        President, National Cattlemen's Beef Association.     Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. LaMalfa) for the purpose of a colloquy.   Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Chairman, I rise for the purpose of engaging in a  colloquy with the chairman to seek a clarification on the applicability  of the provisions in title I and title II of this bill to national  forest lands.   As my colleagues know, the State of California has been on fire. We  have all seen the devastation across the State, ranging from the Sierra  Nevada to the Bay area, and even the wine country. Even today, CalFire  and Forest Service personnel remain deployed on fires across the State.   Ensuring that the Forest Service returns to active management of our  forests is critical to promoting forest health and helping reduce the  risks and likeliness of catastrophic wildfires that we have seen  already this year.   The Resilient Federal Forests Act includes what I believe to be  critically important reforms to forest management, such as expedited  environmental reviews and availability of categorical exclusion for  forest management activities, to help achieve these needed goals.   In California, there are six national monuments managed by the Forest  Service or jointly between the Forest Service and BLM. Oftentimes,  management activities in these areas are highly restricted, which only  leads to hazardous fuels buildup and increased risk  [[Page H8338]]  of catastrophic fires. We see the results every year in the West.   H.R. 2936 clearly identifies certain national forest lands that these  provisions do not apply to. This includes wilderness areas, national or  State inventoried roadless areas, or areas where timber harvesting is  prohibited by statute.   However, it is my belief that provisions of this bill, Mr. Chairman-- based on the definition of National Forest System lands in the bill-- apply to all other Forest Service lands not explicitly prohibited in  the bill.   Respectfully, I would like to clarify with the chairman that it is  his intent that provisions in title I and title II of H.R. 2936 apply  to all other Federal lands managed by the United States Forest Service.  This includes national monuments managed by the Forest Service.   Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for his work on this critical  bill.    Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague from  California for his work on forestry issues and understand the  importance this bill has to forestry management in his state.   It is my intent, and I believe the intent of my colleagues, that all  provisions of H.R. 2936, including title I and title II, unless  explicitly excluded, apply to national monuments and all other lands  managed by the United States Forest Service.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Colorado (Mr. Tipton).    Mr. Chairman, I am amazed at how critical people  have been about the experts of the Forest Service, as if people don't  realize that these provisions in Mr. Westerman's bill weren't coming  out of thin air. Somebody told us the tools they need to deal with  this.   Mr. Chair, may I also add, there are still other issues which we will  work out when we get to the Senate on these, some that Mr. Gohmert  presented. We will still work on those issues.   Mr. Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Westerman), the author of this bill, the only Member on  the floor who has a degree in forestry.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. DeFazio. Mr. Chair, I voted for last Congress' version of this  bill, one of 19 Democrats to do so. It wasn't perfect, but the bill was  step in the right direction. I hoped the Senate would improve it and we  would finally make needed changes forest management and fix ``fire  borrowing.'' But the Senate never acted on it, or on any other forest  management bill.   In the 113th Congress, I worked with Reps. Schrader and Walden and  crafted a bipartisan bill to create a long-term solution to properly  manage statutorily unique forestlands in Western Oregon. It would have  devoted nearly 1.3 million acres for sustainable timber production for  local mills, created thousands of private sector jobs, and provided  much-needed revenue for our rural counties. The legislation was  included in a larger bill which passed the House in September 2014.  Again, the Senate failed to act.   Like last Congress, there are provisions in this bill I support.  However, there are provisions that I cannot support. For example, the  bill doubles the amount of acres exempt from nearly all environmental  analysis for projects up to 10,000 acres, and in some cases 30,000  acres, nearly 47 square miles.   I agree there is a need to need to increase the pace and size of  forest restoration projects. But the Forest Service and BLM already  have many tools to accomplish more management objectives. What they  need is funding to complete projects. In fact, Forest Service NEPA  experts have initiated a comprehensive review to determine  opportunities, already allowed under law, to increase efficiencies and  management tools to expedite environmental review, including proposing  new categorical exclusions.   It's true that in some cases the Forest Service and BLM don't use  authority they have because of legitimate concerns about the threat of  litigation and the accompanying expenses it incurs. But it is  disingenuous for us to claim that this bill, or any forest management  bill, is a miraculous fix to harvest more timber, improve forest  restoration, or reduce fuels to reduce the threat of catastrophic  wildfires, without Congress providing funding to do so. In fact,  according to the Forest Service, in Oregon there are over 1.8 million  acres of treatment projects that are ``shovel ready,'' meaning all  environmental analysis has been completed. But they stay on the shelf,  because the Forest Service doesn't have the funds to complete them.   We've all seen the destruction from this year's severe fire season.  Homes and businesses were destroyed, and dozens of lives were lost in  Northern California. In my district, over 300,000 acres burned. The  Forest Service says that nationally there are now more than 44 million  homes are within the Wildland Urban Interface, at high risk of burning  in a wildfire.   In 2004, Congress passed, on a bipartisan basis, the Healthy Forests  Restoration Act, which if properly implemented would go a long way to  reduce the threat of wildfires in our communities. It authorized up to  20 million acres to be treated to remove hazard fuels in the Wildland  and Urban Interface, as well as protect municipal water supplies from  catastrophic wildfires. We authorized $760 million annually to perform  the work. So far, thirteen years later, only 2.5 million acres have  been treated.   Why is that? We have never come close to appropriating enough funding  to get the job done. In Fiscal Year 2017, Congress appropriated $390  million for hazardous fuels reduction.   As always, I stand ready to work with my colleagues on both sides of  the aisle to improve forest management and help our rural communities  get back on their feet. But it must be balanced approach.  Unfortunately, this bill is not a balanced approach.   The Acting CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.

The Acting CHAIR. No amendment to that amendment in the nature of a  substitute shall be in order except those printed in House Report 115- 378. Each such amendment may be offered only in the order printed in  the report, by a Member designated in the report, shall be considered  as read, shall be debatable for the time specified in the report,  equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall  not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand for  division of the question.  [[Page H8350]]                        Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. Schrader    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1  printed in House Report 115-378.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, although I am not totally opposed to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman is recognized for  5 minutes.   There was no objection.    Mr. Chair, I appreciate the amendment that has  been presented by the gentleman from Oregon. I think it is a well- thought-out amendment.   I also appreciate the comments he made, as he is trying to get us  past the rhetoric and the dogma, and to try and come up with a truly  bipartisan effort to solve the problems that the Forest Service has  clearly delineated, giving them the tools that they want to try and  solve these problems in the future.   I think the gentleman is also correct when he said that if you go  through the list of those that are going to use categorical exclusion,  you can't actually do those functions without producing timber. So, at  worst, the language that was put in here is redundant. We are still  after the same goal. We are still after the same game. That is why I  actually will accept the amendment offered by the gentleman from Oregon  and urge its adoption.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Schrader).   The amendment was agreed to.                    Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Khanna    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2  printed in House Report 115-378.    Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chair, I have to strenuously oppose this  particular amendment because it strikes one of the core provisions of  this bill.   From 1989 to 2008, there were 1,125 lawsuits filed against the Forest  Service, and hundreds have been filed since that time. Half of the  active management lawsuits of the Federal Forest Service account are  spent, and 40 percent of all Forest Service lawsuits are brought on  this specific point.   In addition to that, the Forest Service, in an effort to try and  mitigate against that, simply tries to delay the processes, which  creates a culture of analysis paralysis going through there, and at the  end they get sued anyway.   This provision is one of few creative efforts we have had that does  not impact people's access to justice, but having a binding arbitration  pilot program allows us to try and give you the merits of a lawsuit and  move forward quickly. This is creative. This is what they need.   If we need to end endless litigation, frivolous lawsuits that impede  the  [[Page H8351]]  work of our land managers and cost taxpayers millions of dollars, this  is the kind of thing that we need to start doing. The Forest Service  recognizes they need this. It is about time we recognize they need  this, too.   Mr. Chairman, keep this creative approach in the bill.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Westerman), the author of this bill.    Mr. Chair, once again, I would ask our Members to  reject this particular amendment. It is a core provision, one of the  few creative efforts, and only a pilot project to try and find a  solution. It has received bipartisan support. It has received support  from a broad coalition of outside groups. Admittedly, some of those who  actively litigate and raise money and profit by it don't like this  provision, but most of the other people recognize this is something the  Forest Service can use on day one. They need this tool.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Khanna).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, this is another one of the  amendments that basically guts the whole purpose of this entire bill.   There is nobody who is cut out of the process. None of the public is  cut out of the process. What is cut out is redundant, duplicative NEPA  analysis, all of which can result in litigation. It simply says you do  the process the first time. You don't have to redo it again and again  and again and admit the Forest Service to litigation again and again.  In fact, they admit 71 percent of all their lawsuits mention these  types of provisions in there.   As we said before, these provisions were not coming out of thin air.  They are coming from what the Forest Service tells us they need to do  their job, the tools they need so they can take the resources they have  and do it once the first time and get it over with and do it right and  not have to spend it on frivolous litigation.   NEPA is not taken away. The analysis is not taken away. The public is  not taken out of the system. All you are simply doing is saying you  don't have to do it repetitively, in other words, don't have to do it  redundantly. This is one to streamline it. This is what they need  desperately.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. O'HALLERAN. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the fact that there are  many items within the bill that do allow for the issues to be  addressed. But taking this part of the bill and understanding that,  when our national forest plans are put forward, we are part of it--I  live in the national forest. I have watched three fires outside my  front window. I have lived through watching, time and time again, the  ramifications of not addressing these issues appropriately.   I was co-chair of the Arizona Forest Health Oversight Committee for  3\1/2\ years and have been addressing forestry issues for 20 years. Mr.  Chair, I just simply believe that, when it comes to wilderness areas  and other areas of major concern, we should not disregard it.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I will say once again, the tools  the Forest Service needs to do their job are harmed if these sections  do not remain in the bill. It is not talking about public input. It is  talking about redundant, unnecessary public review that goes through  there that creates unnecessary and redundant litigation. There is a  NEPA process that needs to go forward. You just don't have to do it  four and five and six times just because. We have an analysis  paralysis.   I remind you once again, we have 50 to 70 million acres that are in a  desperate, dire situation, ready to explode in catastrophic wildfire.  The Forest Service can only get to 3 million acres a year, and part of  it is the problems they have that we are trying to remove with these  specific provisions. They need these tools. If we don't give them these  tools, we exacerbate our wildfire problems. We don't need to do that.  We shouldn't do that.  [[Page H8352]]    Mr. Chairman, we need to defeat this amendment. It is essential to  defeat this amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. O'Halleran).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.   Mr. O'HALLERAN. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona will  be postponed.                   Amendment No. 4 Offered by Mr. Cardenas    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4  printed in House Report 115-378.

Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to  the motion to recommit.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from  Arizona presenting this issue about Secure Rural Schools. I am an old  school teacher. I understand how significant and important it is.   The issue, though, for Secure Rural Schools is not the  reauthorization, it is finding a funding stream to keep it going.  Unfortunately, this amendment doesn't solve the problem. It is not  reauthorization, it is the funding, and this provides no funding  whatsoever. It doesn't do what we need to do. It simply is another  delay tactic.   And let's face it, we are dealing with more significant issues in  this Nation, like who is going to win game seven tonight. That is  important stuff. That is what we should be talking about. And if you  don't pass this forest resiliency act today, there won't be enough  trees to make bats for next year's season.   Please vote ``no'' on this amendment, vote ``yes'' on the underlying  bill, and let's go home.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore.
