 Madam Speaker, I stand here today as a Member of  Congress because, 3 years ago, I watched as this body took a vote to  repeal the Affordable Care Act, which would have ripped healthcare away  from tens of thousands of constituents in my district and over 2  million Floridians in my home State.   This was an unconscionable move that would have taken away  protections for millions with preexisting conditions, like my  constituent Michelle Garcia, who still suffers after a faulty medical  device left broken pieces in her that, to this day, cause her chronic  pain that requires persistent treatment.   It is because of the ACA that her coverage is protected.   It is because of the ACA that disparities in coverage for Latino  communities and African-American communities have narrowed.   It is because of the ACA that insurance plans can't deny or make  healthcare more expensive because of someone's gender.   It is because I watched my colleagues across the aisle try to take  the ACA away that I ran for Congress and am here fighting to protect  their care.   Today's vote is very important to me. While the President continues  his efforts to take away much-needed healthcare, especially during a  pandemic, we are making quality care more affordable and accessible  while removing junk plans. We are lowering health insurance premiums  and prescription drug prices. We are also putting in incentives for  States like Florida so that they can expand Medicaid and bring care to  millions who need it.   It is simple. We shouldn't be taking care away from anyone right now,  not ever. We shouldn't be making quality care more expensive.   We need to make it more accessible. We need to make it more  affordable.   That is why I am proud to vote ``yes'' on today's legislation, and,  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to do the same.
