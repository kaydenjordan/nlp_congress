 Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of World Refugee Day  and in support of the community of refugees who have resettled in my  district.   One of these refugees is Kifah Abdulla, who lived in Baghdad until  war broke out at home. He spent over 8 years as a prisoner of war. He  was isolated because of his activism against the dictatorship.   He was a refugee for 11 years in Amman, Jordan, and 5 years in the  Netherlands, before coming to Portland, Maine in 2011. He is now an  Arabic teacher, a published poet, a performer, and an activist.   There is a reason America has signed international treaties and  passed laws giving shelter to those fleeing persecution. Many refugees,  like Mr. Abdulla, were jailed or tortured because they protested,  organized, or challenged their government. These values are at the core  of our Nation.   Every year, refugees travel 1.2 billion miles in search of safety.  And right now, we are in the midst of the greatest refugee crisis since  World War II. Sadly, when people fleeing the violence need us most, the  administration has dramatically reduced refugee admissions.   In a Nation where nearly all of us have come ``from away,'' as we say  in Maine, I urge us all to make our communities warm, safe, and  welcoming to refugees across the globe.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I thank my colleague for yielding me time,  and I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Huffman) for raising  concerns that I think many of us have. But in this case, I am  supporting this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I have long fought to protect the health of our oceans and  the sea life that inhabit them. That is why I have opposed the Trump  administration's plan to drill in the gulf of Maine since day one. And  I am proud that this Chamber recently passed our ocean acidification  bill.   Along with my colleague from Maine's Second District, we represent 90  percent of all the lobster landings in the United States. Lobster is an  iconic symbol of our State, especially this time of year when Mainers  and visitors from across the country enjoy our coastline and our food.   I am proud of our very well-managed and highly restrictive lobster  fishery of responsible operators. We need to work together on a new  peer-reviewed tool to address this problem.   Our State also is the home of a vibrant conservation movement that  supports marine conservation and protecting the right whale. We have  been successful over the past several years in creating tools with  NOAA, our lobster industry, and conservationists. Indeed, the State of  Maine has been actively involved in right whale conservation and worked  with NOAA in the past to ensure that our State is doing all we can to  keep whales safe in our very active fisheries.   Unfortunately, in April, NOAA's Large Whale Take Reduction Team  announced a plan to reduce right whale deaths that forced lobstermen to  reduce their vertical lines by 50 percent. This risk-reduction tool, as  my colleague mentioned, has not gone through a peer-review process  despite significant concerns from the stakeholders that should be  addressed. It does not account for many of the issues specific to the  gulf of Maine.   Mr. Chair, for that reason, I urge my colleagues to stand for a fair  process, and I support this amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.    Madam Chair, I am sorry to say that I have to oppose the  amendment from the gentleman from Oklahoma and appreciate his thoughts,  but he is completely wrong.   The amendment is a harmful rider that would prohibit the EPA from  considering the social cost of carbon as part of rulemakings.   The ``social cost of carbon'' may sound a little confusing to people,  but, frankly, it is an estimate of the economic damages associated with  the small increase in carbon dioxide emissions in a given year. It  represents, currently, our best scientific information available for  incorporating the impacts from carbon pollution into regulatory  analysis.   Weakening or eliminating the use of the social cost of carbon as a  tool for Federal agencies would ignore the sobering cost of health,  environmental and economic impacts of extreme weather, rising  temperatures, intensifying smog, and other impacts.   We just cannot afford to abandon science at this critical moment in  time. Our country needs to face the challenges ahead of us with climate  change and have the best scientific tools available, and this is one.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I do appreciate my colleague from Oklahoma  clarifying that it is a big State for renewables and Texas is as well,  and I encourage them to continue farther down that path because that is  certainly an important challenge that we have to overcome is having  more renewables in our country.   I would again say that climate change is the greatest environmental  threat that mankind has ever faced. We need to deploy every available  tool at our disposal and address this crisis, including the best  available science and economics, which I believe is also represented in  the social cost of carbon analysis.   I strongly oppose the Mullin amendment, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition, although I do  not oppose the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Oregon  (Mr. Schrader).    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this amendment, and I  thank my colleague from the Appropriations Committee for doing this.  This is an important amendment that would prohibit any changes to the  Job Corps centers or their closure.   I appreciate that Secretary Perdue has announced his change of heart,  but I want to make sure that the administration doesn't change the plan  again.   I think everyone else has said it very articulately. These are really  important operations. They teach our young people a tremendous number  of things. They provide full-time and temporary jobs. In New England-- as on the West Coast, I am sure--we need a lot of these people to help  us with some of the challenges that are going on today.   The Department of Labor had previously announced a proposal to close  nine of the facilities. That would have impacted 356 full-time and 107  temporary and contract employees. More than 3,000 students were at risk  of losing the opportunity to develop the skills and work experience  they need to get jobs, and that would include the 966 students at  centers that have been proposed for closure.   Our Nation would lose out as well. We have already heard some of the  ways that would happen on the West Coast, as it certainly would on the  East Coast as well. These are countless hours for young people in  conservation work, forest restoration work, and wildland firefighting.   To quote a USDA web page, I will say that ``there has never been a  time when Civilian Conservation Centers were more necessary or a more  worthwhile investment in our Nation's future.''   Mr. Chair, I concur with the gentleman, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment, which  would strike section 117 from the bill.   I have been a strong opponent of the current administration's  offshore drilling proposals. I am proud to have the chance to manage  this time in opposition to this amendment, which would be so  devastating to States like my home State of Maine.   I want to start by correcting a mischaracterization that I think has  been made. The description of the gentleman's amendment states that it  is removing language from the Interior bill ``which prohibits funds''  for the administration's 5-year offshore drilling plan. That is  actually not correct.   The language in the bill does not prohibit the administration from  working on its plan. What the language in section 117 does is to tell  the Interior Department that if it moves forward with oil and gas  activities in 2020, it must do so only with respect to lease sales that  have been through the entire approval and review process spelled out in  the law.   Our language recognizes the fact that the 2017 offshore drilling plan  under the previous Presidential administration is the only plan that  has completed all the steps required by the Outer Continental Shelf  Lands Act. Because of  [[Page H4969]]  that, we agree that the Interior Department is free to continue to  implement the previous 2017 narrow plan.   In the meantime, it is true that the current administration is  working on a new oil and gas drilling plan that would cover the 2019 to  2024 timeframe. This new plan, if implemented, would open up the entire  East and West Coasts to drilling.   To date, the current administration has put out one iteration of its  plan, with two more to go. Despite not having completed the process,  the administration has acknowledged it is already conducting pre-lease  work in the mid-Atlantic, south Atlantic, and southern California  planning areas.   The budget for the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management states that it  is preparing ``four new environmental impact statements for the lease  sales that are planned in early 2020 or early 2021,'' which is where  the problem comes in.   The new 5-year plan, which is nothing more than a work in progress,  is under siege, both from the courts and a complete lack of political  support. In late March, a Federal court reinstated the moratorium in  the north Atlantic planning area. That decision has essentially frozen  work on the new plan.   In fact, the Secretary told me, under questioning in an Interior  Subcommittee hearing last month, that he did not know the outcome of  the proposed plan. He said a new plan wasn't ``imminent.'' He was also  quick to point out that no previous 5-year plan has ever included  drilling in a State that was opposed to such activity.   If that is his bottom line, then he might as well throw in the towel  right now as there is not a single State along the Atlantic or Pacific  Coasts that is in favor of drilling.   My home State of Maine has a $5.6 billion tourism industry, 71  percent of which comes directly from the Maine coast. Thirty thousand  Mainers make their living in marine industries. Our world-famous  lobster fishery alone brings in $500 million annually.   Our Governor, our Senators, our congressional delegation, and many of  our cities and towns oppose the OCS drilling proposal.   As nearly one-third of the United States population lives in the  coastal areas impacted by this proposal, and there is broad bipartisan  opposition to this issue, moving forward makes no sense, either  fiscally or practically.   The language in our Interior bill simply supports that position. It  says to follow the law, complete all procedural steps, including  responding to the concerns of the American public, the concerns of  their Governors, and the concerns of their Members of Congress, before  moving forward on individual drilling projects.   To the Department, it says to save its money until it completes the  process and finds out if it can drill for oil off the coast of South  Carolina or off the coast of Florida or off the coast of California.   Following a well-thought-out process, especially one contained in  law, shouldn't be controversial, and I don't think it is.   As such, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Louisiana; protect our coastlines from Maine to Florida,  from Washington State to California; and support the process contained  in the OCS Lands Act.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I am sorry to disagree, but I hope that my  colleagues won't be fooled by the comments coming from the proponents  of this amendment.   This is not about energy security or energy imports and exports. It  is not about jobs. Instead, this is about whether the Interior  Department is going to be held to the same procedural standard we  expect every other department and agency to adhere to.                                time  1530    Mr. Chair, if my colleagues think the Department of the Interior  should follow the law and complete the process, then I urge them to  oppose the gentleman's amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I strongly oppose this amendment. I  appreciate the thoughts of the gentleman, but this is the wrong place  to go about it.   This amendment just indiscriminately cuts programs in this bill  without any thought to the relative merit of the programs contained in  the bill.   For instance, this cut would result in fewer patients seen at the  Indian Health Service, fewer safety inspectors ensuring accidents do  not occur, deferred maintenance on our Nation's water and sanitation  infrastructure.   More generally, investments in our environmental infrastructure and  our public lands will be halted and the associated jobs will be lost.   This amendment would not encourage the agencies to do more with less.  Simply put, it would force the agencies and our constituents to do less  with less.   Yes, it is true the Interior budget does not meet the same numbers  that the President sent over to us, but the President cut the  Environmental Protection Agency by a third, he cut the National  Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities. I  can make a very long list that the President cut that this Congress  would never stand for.   So this does not stand. We cannot go back to the President's original  budget. We must stand together to oppose this amendment, which if it  was passed, would harm the American people.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment and encourage my colleagues to  join me in opposing it, and I yield back the balance of my time.
