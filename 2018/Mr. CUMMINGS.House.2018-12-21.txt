 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the resolution before us would change the enrollment of  H.R. 4174 to make several corrections to the bill. Concerns were raised  earlier today about the impact H.R. 4174 would have on independent  agencies, particularly financial regulators.   The changes would make clear that the bill should not apply to  monetary policy. It would also make clear that title 1 of the bill  applies only to the 24 largest Federal agencies.   The underlying bill would establish a framework to support greater  access and use of government data and help ensure that Congress and the  Federal agencies are able to make important policy changes based on the  best available evidence.   I urge Members to support this resolution and the underlying bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
