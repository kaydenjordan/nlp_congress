 Mr. Speaker, I was unable to attend votes on June 7, 2017  on account of attending my son's graduation. Had I been present, I  would have voted as follows: ``yea'' for rollcall vote No. 288, ``yea''  for rollcall vote No. 289, ``yea'' for rollcall vote No. 290, ``yea''  for rollcall vote No. 291, ``yea'' for rollcall vote No. 292, ``yea''  for rollcall vote No. 293, and ``yea'' for rollcall vote No. 294.                             personal explanation
