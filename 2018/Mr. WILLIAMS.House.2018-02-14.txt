 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3978, the TRID  Improvement Act introduced by my colleague from Arkansas (Mr. Hill) and  my colleague from Nevada (Mr. Kihuen).   This important and overwhelmingly bipartisan legislation, which  passed out of the House Financial Services Committee by a vote of 53-5,  is a straightforward, commonsense solution that will help hardworking  Americans buy a new home or refinance their existing home.   Under the CFPB's misnamed ``Know before you owe'' TRID rule, those in  the home buying or refinancing process may not actually know everything  about the price they are going to pay before closing.   Because of the TRID rule and the restrictions placed on the listing  of discounted title loan insurance rates on loan estimates, consumers  may see one title loan insurance price on their loan estimate and  another on their closing form.   The TRID rule creates unnecessary confusion, and this bill is a step  in the right direction to reducing the burdensome and overreaching  authority of the CFPB.   I am proud to join this bipartisan effort, but I do wish that the  CFPB had been more willing to work with the chorus of voices from both  sides of the aisle calling for this change.   The home buying experience is complicated enough as it is, and the  rationale displayed by the CFPB discourages homeownership and levies  unjust penalties for those Americans striving for the dream of  homeownership.   I am proud to join my colleagues in support of this measure, the TRID  Improvement Act.   In God we trust.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve  the balance of my time.
