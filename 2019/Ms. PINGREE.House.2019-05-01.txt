 Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. McGovern for his good work  and for yielding me the time.   Greenhouse gas emissions did not happen in isolation. They have  widespread impact and will not be curbed without global coordination.  The Obama administration understood that fact, and that is why they  entered America into an international compact to curb emissions on a  global scale.   When the Trump administration retreated from the Paris accord last  year, it meant the effects of climate change would only get worse in my  home State of Maine. In Maine, climate change isn't an abstraction, it  is not a silly floor debate that has no meaning. It is a very real  threat to our economy and to our way of life.   I recently met with farmers in my State who told me climate change is  here now and we need real solutions to adapt and to mitigate.   I met with climate scientists from the University of Maine who told  me invasive species are threatening the livelihoods of our foresters.   I also met with shellfish growers and harvesters who are grappling  with the effects of ocean acidification, of extreme weather events, and  of the very real fact that the Gulf of Maine is warming faster than 95  percent of the Earth's other waters.   This is real, and I don't want my grandchildren looking back and  saying: ``Why didn't Congress fix the problem when they could?''   H.R. 9 is the first piece of positive climate change legislation to  receive a vote in the House in years. The bill will reaffirm America's  commitment to fighting climate change and will put this Congress on a  course to take on the climate crisis before it is too late.
