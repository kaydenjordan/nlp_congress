 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize not one, not two,  but three championship high school football teams in my district.   Anaheim's own Katella High School varsity football team won their  first ever CIF Division 11 championship victory. On December 1, the  Katella Knights varsity football team brought a championship title to  their school for the first time in the school's history.   On December 2, Orange High School, another public school in my  district, brought home the Division 13 CIF title.   Also on December 2, Mater Dei High School's varsity football team won  their first CIF Southern Section Division 1 title since 1999.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating these fine athletes,  their coaches, and their outstanding football programs.   I must say congratulations to the Knights, Panthers, and Monarchs.  All three teams will be playing for their State titles in their  respective divisions this Saturday.                            ____________________
