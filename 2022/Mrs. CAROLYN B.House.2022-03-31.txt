 MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I thank the  gentleman for yielding.   Insulin prices in the United States are the highest in the world. I  support the Affordable Insulin Now Act, a bill that would cap patient  costs at $35 a month. It would make lifesaving medicine affordable for  millions of Americans living with diabetes.   My committee's investigation found that since the 1990s, insulin  manufacturers have been raising the price of this lifesaving medicine  despite no improvements to the drug, while making record profits.   The price gouging has harmed Americans. More than one in four  Americans with diabetes report having to ration insulin, and some have  died.   Nearly 2 million New Yorkers have diabetes. Capping out-of-pocket  costs to $35 a month is an important step that Congress can take to  reduce insulin costs for patients with diabetes.   Let's make prescription drugs affordable. Vote for this bill.   I thank Representatives Kildee, Craig, and McBath for their  leadership in authoring this bill.
