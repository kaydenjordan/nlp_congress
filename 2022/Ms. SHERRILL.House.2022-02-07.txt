 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Sewa Diwali  for their work supporting communities in need in NJ-11 and across the  country.   Their mission is to bring people together, foster commitment to  selfless giving, and embody the spirit of Diwali. They do this through  organizing food collections and other donation drives.   In my district, New Jersey-11, I have joined Sewa for multiple food  drives and community events. Sewa donated 1,700 pounds of food to the  Morris Plains food pantry and 2,400 pounds to Parsippany food pantry in  2021 alone. The enthusiasm toward doing good and giving back to the  community Sewa brings to our towns is truly heartwarming.   Nationally in 2021, they collected 590,000 pounds of food which  provided an estimated 491,000 meals throughout 31 States and 200  townships.   I want to thank every volunteer who has aided Sewa in helping so many  of our neighbors, friends, and families. I look forward to seeing and  being a part of the good they will do in 2022.                            ____________________
