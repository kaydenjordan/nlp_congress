 Madam President, I rise today to recognize a  remarkable Utahn who has recently announced his retirement after a long  career of public service to our great State. Ed Leary has served  honorably as commissioner of the Utah Department of Financial  Institutions--DFI--for the past three decades, and his retirement marks  the conclusion of 45 years at the agency.   His ascendency through the ranks of the agency is a testament to his  strong character, wealth of knowledge and expertise, and impressive  leadership abilities. From first serving as examiner, to industry  supervisor and chief examiner before his appointment as Utah banking  commissioner in 1992, Ed Leary garnered the necessary experience to  become an indispensable advocate of smart banking policy.   Ed's list of accomplishments during his tenure is a long one. To name  just a few, he led his agency's successful effort to achieve  accreditation of the Utah DFI, shepherded the development of Utah's  industrial banks community, and was instrumental in reforming the  regulatory environment to improve conditions for commerce, bolstering  Utah's economic might. By virtue of his thoughtful policy advocacy, Ed  has earned the trust and admiration of friends, colleagues, and  associates in both the public and private sectors.  [[Page S784]]    Thank you, Ed, for your decades of impressive service to the great  State of Utah. You have set a robust example for public servants to  follow in our financial, housing, and banking communities. We wish you  and your family all the best in your next chapter.                            ____________________
