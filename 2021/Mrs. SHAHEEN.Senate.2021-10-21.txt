 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the fiscal  year 2022 Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies, CJS,  Appropriations Act. As chair of the CJS Appropriations Subcommittee, I  developed this bill in partnership with my vice chairman, the Senator  from Kansas, Jerry Moran. In order to draft this bill, the CJS  Subcommittee held substantive hearings, considered 2,084 individual and  group requests from 88 Senators, and worked in a bipartisan way to meet  the needs of the Nation and our individual States.   The end result is legislation that provides $79.7 billion to invest  in important priorities for New Hampshire and the Nation, including  funding for key Federal programs that respond to the substance use  disorder crisis, help domestic and sexual violence survivors, invest in  law enforcement programs, and assist Granite Staters in recovering from  the far-reaching consequences of the pandemic.   I am particularly pleased that the bill delivers the greatest funding  ever  [[Page S7157]]  to Violence Against Women Act programs, as well as substantial funding  to help communities and first responders address substance misuse and  the climate crisis. But we can't limit our action to the immediate  problems of today; we also need an eye towards the future. That is why  this bill also invests in American competitiveness on the global  stage--ensuring our workforce is poised to lead in scientific  innovation and space exploration in the years to come. These priorities  are all essential to the success of families and communities across New  Hampshire and our Nation, and I look forward to working with my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle and the administration to see  this bill signed into law.   I would like to highlight a few specific items included in this  legislation.   Highest, funding level ever for Violence Against Women Act Programs.  Once again, this subcommittee has provided increases to law enforcement  and grant programs that fight gun violence and violent crime. For the  fifth year in a row during my tenure on this subcommittee, the CJS bill  provides the highest funding level ever for Violence Against Women Act  programs, totaling $760 million for the Office on Violence Against  Women, OVW. This is a 48-percent increase from last year's funding  level and will support training officials to improve services for  victims, rape prevention programs, college campus violence prevention  programs, domestic violence hotlines and women's shelters, and  transitional housing support services. Funding is provided for several  new initiatives, including a restorative justice program, a National  Deaf Services Line, and special assistant U.S. attorneys to address  violence against women in Indian Country.   Critical funding for Department of Justice anti-opioid grants. To  combat the substance use disorder epidemic, the bill provides $615  million to help communities and first responders respond to substance  crises, including opioid addiction and drug trafficking. This is $73.5  million higher than the fiscal year 2021 funding level and includes  $447 million for Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, CARA,  grants. These grants support programs like drug, mental health and  veteran treatment courts and substance use disorder treatment programs  administered by State and local correctional facilities.   Bolstered funding to support victims of violent crimes and bolstered  legal services. This year, we have heard from Crime Victims Fund, CVF,  State administrators and victim service providers about the impacts of  lower CVF funding. That is why we provided $2.65 billion of spending  from the fund this year--$635 million more than last year. This fund  provides direct assistance and programs to survivors of domestic  violence, sexual assault, child abuse, human trafficking, and other  violent crimes. But I remain concerned that receipts into the fund will  not be able to sustain this needed level of spending. That is why the  passage of the VOCA Fix to Sustain the Crime Victims Fund Act earlier  this year was so important.   The bill also provides $515 million for the Legal Services  Corporation, which is the largest funder of civil legal aid in the  country with counsel on family law, domestic violence, housing and  financial fraud.   Support for law enforcement and to enhance police-community  relations. Department of Justice law enforcement agencies are funded in  the bill $23.8 billion--$1.1 billion more than last year. This  increased funding will allow the hiring of additional agents, deputy  marshals, intelligence analysts, and other personnel to help keep our  communities safe. There is also $640 million for the Byrne-JAG Program,  which helps law enforcement agencies in New Hampshire and across the  country, strengthens the criminal justice system, and bolsters services  for victims of crime. Within Byrne-JAG, $416 million will go to support  State and local criminal justice systems, an increase of $56 million  more than last year. Additionally, $248 million is allocated for  community oriented policing services, COPS, hiring, an increase of $11  million from the fiscal year 2021 level. This program supports State,  local, and Tribal law enforcement agencies' ability to hire, preserve,  and/or rehire law enforcement officers and increases community policing  efforts.   The bill provides $283 million for State and local law enforcement  assistance and COPS Office grant programs to support programs that  improve police-community relations. This is an 84-percent increase from  last year's funding levels and will support programs on deescalation,  implicit bias, crisis intervention, and training to respond to  situations where individuals are mentally ill or disabled.   Increased funding for the Economic Development Administration and  trade. The bill provides $10.7 billion for the Department of Commerce,  of which $395 million is for the Economic Development Administration,  EDA, which awards infrastructure and planning grants to communities  around the country. This level is an increase of $49 million above the  prior year. It is estimated this funding will generate $3.5 billion in  local and private investment and support more than 30,000 American jobs  this year. EDA has recently awarded grants to Granite State communities  for a wide variety of projects ranging from flood control  infrastructure in Plymouth to economic development projects in the  Monadnock region. The EDA funding also includes $5 million to assist  communities recovering from biomass plant closures.   The bill includes $1.5 million for the Bureau of Economic Analysis to  continue the annual assessment of the economic value of the outdoor  recreation industry--a key sector supporting local economies across New  Hampshire. This report, which was created as a result of the enactment  of my bipartisan legislation, the Outdoor Recreation Jobs and Economic  Impact Act, provides a comprehensive assessment of the role that  outdoor recreation plays in supporting jobs and economic growth,  allowing policymakers to craft legislation to further support the  sector. The bill also provides $584 million for the International Trade  Administration, ITA, which promotes American exports, supports small  and medium-sized businesses, and ensures fair trade practices on the  global stage. This marks a $43 million increase above fiscal year 2021.   Investments in science and to advance U.S. space exploration, The  National Science Foundation, NSF, is funded at $9.49 billion--$1  billion higher than last year's level. This funding will support U.S.  competitiveness in key areas like quantum computing, artificial  intelligence, and climate science, as well as help build an innovative  workforce fueled by a diverse pipeline of scientists and engineers. The  bill supports the creation of a new technology directorate, similar to  what the Senate endorsed in the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act, to  ensure that research is translated into the technologies and products  that will drive economic growth for the next several decades. There is  also $1.49 billion for the National Institute of Standards and  Technology, NIST, to invest in STEM programs that improve the  competitiveness of U.S. manufacturers and strengthen domestic supply  chains, which is a 35-percent increase above fiscal year 2021.   The bill also provides $3 million for NIST to continue research into  the prevalence of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, PFAS, n  firefighter personal protective equipment--marking a $1 million  increase from last year's funding. This research is a key component of  my legislation, the Guaranteeing Equipment Safety for Firefighters Act,  which was signed into law last year and will help to address concerns  regarding firefighters' occupational exposure to PFAS chemicals.   To support America's continued leadership in space, NASA is funded at  $24.8 billion. This is $1.5 billion higher than the fiscal year 2021  level and will support climate research, space missions, and the launch  of the powerful James Webb Space Telescope. The bill also includes  funding to support the International Space Station and returning humans  to the Moon. Additionally, within the $7.9 billion for NASA Science,  $825.7 million is for NASA Heliophysics, an increase of $74.7 million  above the fiscal year 2021 level. The University of New Hampshire is a  leading heliophysics research institution, with instruments on 16 of 22  operating heliophysics missions.   Support for ocean research and conservation efforts and weather  satellites. The bill provides $730 million to  [[Page S7158]]  support National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA,  research, including critical research to combat the climate crisis,  marking a 19-percent increase from 2021. This funding will help coastal  communities in New Hampshire and across the Nation bolster their  resilience to changing climate, as well as support ocean health and  research. In addition, the bill invests in successful job-creating  programs, sustainable economic development, and environmental  restoration. The bill provides full funding to cover the full cost of  at-sea monitoring in the New England groundfish fishery and an increase  of $14 million for research and conservation efforts to protect the  endangered North Atlantic right whale, including $10 million to help  defray costs paid by the lobster fishing industry to protect right  whales. The bill includes $6.5 million specifically targeted for  research related to key New England seafood species, including to study  the effects of climate change.   Finally, there is $405 million to continue construction of polar  weather satellites, which help forecast weather to protect property and  economic security for families in New Hampshire and across Nation. One- third of U.S. GDP is affected by climate and weather--from farmers in  the North Country trying to protect livestock and crops to climate  disasters costing billions of dollars of damage.   Mr. President, these are just a few of the highlights of the fiscal  year 2022 CJS bill. While I wish we could consider this bill under  regular order, have a conference with the House, and enact it into law,  I know the reality is that to finish the work on all 12 appropriations  bills by the time the continuing resolution runs out, we will likely be  negotiating an omnibus. I urge my colleagues across the aisle to come  to agreement with us soon on how to allocate funding among the bills so  the Appropriations Committee can get to work. I look forward to working  with Senator Moran and our House colleagues to craft a final CJS bill  that will assist crime victims, invest in scientific research, and spur  innovation in our communities--critical needs that we all support.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN:   S. 3043. A bill to promote minimum State requirements for the  prevention and treatment of concussions caused by participation in  school sports, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions.    Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the fiscal  year 2022 Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies, CJS,  Appropriations Act.
