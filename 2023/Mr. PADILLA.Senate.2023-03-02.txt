 Madam President, I rise to introduce the Everett  Alvarez, Jr., Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2023. This bipartisan  legislation would award a Congressional Gold Medal to Everett Alvarez,  Jr., in recognition of his service to the Nation.   This legislation would honor Navy Commander Everett Alvarez, Jr., the  second longest held POW in American history, with a Congressional Gold  Medal.   On August 5, 1964, while flying Operation Pierce Arrow, Commander  Alvarez's A-4 Skyhawk was shot down, and he became the first aviator  captured in Vietnam. He spent 8 years and 6 months in captivity,  becoming the second longest held prisoner of war in U.S. history. While  being held in Vietnam, Alvarez crossed paths with the late Senator John  McCain, who was also being held as a POW at the Hoa Lo prison, Hanoi  Hilton.   Despite facing torture, isolation, and starvation, he encouraged and  inspired fellow POWs to ``Return with Honor'' by not cooperating with  the enemy and remaining loyal to the United States. Following his  release and hospitalization, Commander Alvarez resumed his naval  service, completing a 20-year career with the Navy and retiring in June  1980.   Our bill would recognize his incredible sacrifice by awarding him  with the highest award that Congress can bestow.   This year marks the 50th anniversary of Commander Alvarez's release  from captivity in Vietnam. It is time that Congress recognizes the  second longest held prisoner of war in American history for his  enduring commitment to the United States.   I would like to thank my colead, Senator Lummis, for her support to  ensure we properly recognize, on a bipartisan basis, the profound  impact of Commander Alvarez's service and support for other prisoners  of war. I also thank Representatives Panetta and Fallon for introducing  companion legislation in the House of Representatives.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact the Everett  Alvarez, Jr. Congressional Gold Medal Act as quickly as possible.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise to introduce the Everett  Alvarez, Jr., Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2023.
