 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Kris  Hansen, a great Montanan and a dear friend who passed away just last  week.   Kris was a mighty warrior who loved her country and embodied the  highest ideals of public service in the State of Montana.   She served overseas with both the National Guard and the CIA,  followed by an exceptional tenure with the Montana State legislature,  alongside me in the Montana State Auditor's office, and most recently  as Lieutenant Attorney General.   She was a blessing and a light upon all the lives that she touched.   Kris was also a strong advocate for students and families. She used  her gifts to fight for access to quality education for children across  the State of Montana.   Her commitment to protecting and preserving our way of life will  always be a defining pillar of her legacy.   I am so thankful to have worked with Kris and developed a special  friendship with her.   Our thoughts and prayers are with Fred and Nancy and the Hansen  family during this most difficult time.                            ____________________
