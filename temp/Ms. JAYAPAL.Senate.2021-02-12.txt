 Mr. President, I object to the certificate       from the State of Georgia on the grounds that the electoral       vote does not----        Vice President BIDEN. There is no debate. There is no       debate.         The objection is signed by a Member of the       House but not yet by a Member of the Senate.        Vice President BIDEN. Well, it is over.    (Laughter.)   Mr. Counsel SCHOEN. And when the House managers realized that the  President's actual words could not have incited the riot, as you  alleged in your Article of Impeachment, you attempted to pivot. You  said that raising the issue of election security and casting doubt on  the propriety of our elections was dangerous.   One of the House managers, Mr. Cicilline, told you that this is not  about the words Mr. Trump used in isolation. Rather, it is about the  big lie, the claim that the election was stolen. The House managers  told you that it is the big lie that incited the riot and that the big  lie was President Trump's claim that the election was not a fair  election or that the election was stolen.   Claiming an election was stolen, you were told, are words that are  inciteful to a candidate's followers and cause people to respond  violently. Claiming an election was stolen or not legitimate is  something that a candidate should never do because he or she knows or  should know that such a  [[Page S674]]  claim and such words can actually incite violent insurrection, you were  told.   Well, it seems that the House managers' position must actually be a  bit narrower than that. The House managers' position really is that,  when Republican candidates for office claim an election is stolen or  that the winner is illegitimate, it constitutes inciting an  insurrection and the candidate should know it, but Democratic Party  candidates for public elective office are perfectly entitled to claim  the election was stolen or that the winner is illegitimate or to make  any other outrageous claim they can.   It is their absolute right to do so, and it is their absolute right  to do so irrespective of whether there is any evidence to support the  claim. Democratic candidates can claim that an election was stolen  because of Russian collusion or without any explanation at all, and  that is perfectly OK and is in no way incitement to an insurrection,  and somehow, when Democratic candidates publicly decry an election as  stolen or illegitimate, it is never a big lie. You have been doing it  for years.   (Text of video presentation of 2-10-2021.)         Mr. Manager CASTRO of Texas. But can you imagine telling       your supporters that the only way you can possibly lose is if       an American election was rigged and stolen from you? And ask       yourself whether you have ever seen anyone at any level of       government make the same claim about their own election.    (Text of video presentation of 11-14-2018.)
