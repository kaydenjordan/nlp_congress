 Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman  [[Page H4753]]  Bishop for moving this fine bill through his committee.   James Weldon Johnson was born in 1871 in Jacksonville. This is very  significant and probably should have been done many years ago for his  contributions to education and the accomplishments he was able to make  throughout his life.   He also was not only the first African American admitted to The  Florida Bar but also the first African American to teach at New York  University. I think most significant was that he was appointed by  President Roosevelt to serve as a dignitary to Venezuela and Nigeria.  His accomplishments are revered by everyone in the United States.   He was a great writer. In fact, when he wrote ``Lift Ev'ry Voice and  Sing,'' he wrote it to celebrate President Lincoln's birthday. His  brother later put it into lyrics. It was adopted by the NAACP as the  Negro national anthem.   Ever since I was small, we would hear ``Lift Ev'ry Voice,'' ``Lift  Ev'ry Voice.'' Little did we know that ``Lift Ev'ry Voice'' would be  presented at every festivity and graduation throughout America, at  football games and everywhere, because of Mr. Johnson's contributions.   I feel very honored to have this historic site among our Park Service  so people can know the history of James Weldon Johnson, not only in the  Jacksonville community but throughout America. I think it would be  fitting that many people have the opportunity to visit his birthplace  to see the contributions he has made.
