 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Anita Clark, the 2019  Reverend Fred Handy In-Service Award winner.  [[Page H8528]]        Ms. Clark was honored on October 25 by the Montclair, New Jersey,  branch of the NAACP. Few honorees have been more dedicated to serving  the public good.   Ms. Clark has spent her entire life helping the underserved and the  most vulnerable residents of Essex County. She started in child  development at the Newark Day Care Center. She has worked for social  services and served as the director of a needs-based youth summer camp.   During her 30 years in the Essex County judicial system, she helped  single mothers get child support and worked to keep juveniles from  becoming criminals.   She is a respected and beloved resident of my district, as well as a  great friend and family member and a loved one, and this honor is well- deserved.   We are very proud of the work that Ms. Anita Clark has done for her  community throughout her time in Essex County.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, let me first thank the gentlewoman from  Detroit for her leadership on this issue tonight. We felt it was only  fitting that she lead us in this Special Order hour for Mr. Conyers.   I rise to honor the former Congressman, John James Conyers, after his  passing on October 27, 2019. I would like to start by offering my  thoughts and prayers to his wife, Monica, and his sons, John and Carl,  during this time of loss.   Mr. Conyers spent 53 years as a Congressman from Michigan, mostly  from districts in and around the Detroit area. Mr. Conyers was the  third longest-serving Congressman and the longest-serving African  American Congressman in United States history.   He helped found the Congressional Black Caucus with some of our  Nation's most prominent civil rights leaders and colleagues such as  Shirley Chisholm and William Lacy Clay, Sr., the father of my esteemed  colleague, William Lacy Clay, Jr., from Missouri's First District.   During his life he had several accomplishments in and out of  Congress. He joined voter registration drives in Selma, Alabama, in  1963, a year before the landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act even became law.  As a Congressman, he led the drive to help make Martin Luther King,  Jr.'s birthday a national holiday and succeeded through perseverance  and continued efforts to make that happen despite insurmountable odds.  He helped calm revolters in his district during Detroit's racial strife  of 1967. He was a vocal opponent of apartheid in South Africa, a  political system of legal racial discrimination that he just--as many  of us in this great Nation--would not tolerate. He fought for  restrictions on gun ownership to prevent violence, because he knew what  it meant in so many of our communities to have these lax laws.   At one point Mr. Conyers was called the leading Black voice in  Congress. He was also known as one of the best dressers on Capitol Hill  and a lover of jazz. He even got the Congress to declare jazz a  national American treasure in 1987.   He was a dedicated public servant, an honored Korean war veteran, a  champion of racial equality, and a strong figure in this House for half  a century. His legacy will be remembered long after his passing. The  work that he has done on this floor and in these Halls is second to  none. He cared about this Nation, he cared about his colleagues, and he  cared about his constituents in his district.   We will miss him dearly. Mr. Conyers was one of a kind. We are  saddened by his loss, so we are here to honor him in the manner in  which he should be as an esteemed former Member of this House.
