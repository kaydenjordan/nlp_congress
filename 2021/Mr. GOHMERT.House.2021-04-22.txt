 Mr. Speaker, it was good to hear the majority leader say  this is about politics. We knew that. But for some of us, it is about  principle.   And if it were about taxation without representation, I would have a  slew of Democrats cosponsoring the bill I have been filing for many  terms to eliminate Federal income tax in the District of Columbia.   But I was told years ago: We are not going to join in with your bill  because it will weaken our chance to get a representative full voting  for D.C.   That is what this has been about.   Mr. Speaker, for some of us, principle is a big deal. When the Bush  Justice Department was violating constitutional rights, some  Republicans got furious. When the Obama administration did that, they  circled the wagons and  [[Page H2079]]  protected. This is about principle for some of us.   Mr. Speaker, we got a tiny taste when the Mayor of D.C., of an  opposite party of President Trump, wasn't sure she was going to provide  the police to protect the White House.   This is about the Constitution and principle. Vote against this.    Madam Speaker, it is my honor to yield to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Cammack).                     Farmers to Families Food Box Program     Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Florida, who truly  is my friend, for her comments.   At this time, it is my privilege to yield to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Baird), my friend, a Baird man.                      Plight of Lakes Shafer and Freeman     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments.  It is obviously an important issue. We have been taking up such issues,  but it is not necessarily the best way to proceed.   For one thing, the bill that was passed today to make the District of  Columbia a State flies in the face of the brilliance of the Founders  when it came to setting up our Federal Government.   Before we had the Constitution ratified in 1789, our first President  was sworn in under the new Constitution in 1789, George Washington, and  the first Vice President, John Adams. They were all sworn in in Federal  Hall there in New York City, so that was technically the first Capital  under the new Constitution. Before that, under the Articles of  Confederation, they used Philadelphia and, obviously, New York.   But in the Constitution itself, there was a provision for a Federal  district 10 miles by 10 miles square. It included land that was ceded  from Maryland that was on the east side of the Potomac River, as well  as a little bit less land from the west side of the Potomac from  Virginia.   The reason the Founders felt it was so important to have a separate  Federal entity that was not wholly contained within a State, not  contained within a city, but a Federal enclave as the Capital, was so  that--the big reason--no State, no city government could try to extort  or hold the Capital hostage.   For example, if the Capital got its water from or through a State or  city, then they would be subject to having their water turned off. Of  course, that was a rather big issue back in the day.   We know that New York City had a problem with disease and lack of  water to put out fires. A guy named Aaron Burr, who ended up being Vice  President and hoped to be President, he and some partners made a  proposal for legislation that would create the Manhattan Water Company  that would provide all the water that was needed, and it would be  clean. That would help stop the disease.   They would provide water free to put out fires, and so that seemed  very attractive. The thing is, though, they said they needed a monopoly  so that they could afford to pay for all they were going to do.   They had Alexander Hamilton review it. They got him to sign on that  it was a worthy, honorable project. Somewhere after Alexander Hamilton  reviewed the language for that, other words were inserted not only to  provide for the Manhattan Water Company, or water business, but also  such other economic practices or businesses they felt appropriate.   Well, that was the scheme the whole time, to create a bank that was  not created under other Federal law. So, the Manhattan Bank was  created. Aaron Burr and his partners let Manhattan suffer without the  water. So, even back then, in the late 1700s, early 1800s, water was a  big deal.   Electricity was, obviously, not a big deal yet, but the same thing.  If you have to get things you need to subsist through another State or  city, then there is always a possibility that you could be extorted.   We saw the brilliance of the Founders back last summer when we had a  Democrat Mayor that did not like the President of the United States.  Some of us were wondering whether she was going to authorize  Washington, D.C., police to protect the White House itself.   Obviously, she didn't provide much help to stop fires from being lit  at the historic church right there, catty-corner to the White House.  But some of us observed what was going on and a Mayor who didn't seem  to care too much about the President.   Wow, what if you saw that play out? It is exactly what the Founders  wanted to avoid, the U.S. Capital, the U.S. Government, being held  hostage. You could see how it could very easily have played into that  situation.   So, it was brilliant. The Federal enclave, the Federal district that  was provided for in our Constitution, would not be part of any State,  would not be part of a city. It would be the District of Columbia. It  was brilliant.   Now, as the majority leader pointed out, purely for politics--this  was all about politics. The majority decided they wanted to make the  District of Columbia a State unto itself. If that were to become a part  of our system here, then this government would be totally subject to  the whims of the State of Columbia.                                time  1315    We could be prevented from going into session. We could be prevented  from leaving. It creates a situation down the road for when things  could truly get out of hand.   And even though the mainstream media and our friends across the aisle  referred to the at least $2 billion of damage, the deaths, shooting,  looting, government buildings being burned as peaceful demonstrations,  they certainly weren't in the areas where things were being burned,  stores were being looted, and destruction was the lot.   That could come back again, and you could have people who would be  that active. It certainly appears that BLM is more concerned about  making this a socialist country, an Orwellian, a totalitarian country  than they are about any race. Antifa is just all about creating chaos,  because they figure, out of chaos, will come a totalitarian, Orwellian  government.   So this time we are going through right now will be looked at  historically in other countries and whatever this country becomes, and  this will be pointed to as a very, very important time.   Now, we were accused of playing politics with this issue on the  Republican side. I can't speak for everyone, but I can speak for all  the Republicans I have talked to. This is still an important concept  that we not have a Capital subject to being held hostage. And if D.C.  becomes a State, that scenario is then set up, and it is not good for  the country.   In wrestling with these issues after I got here--you know, I saw the  license plate, and I mentioned this before in years past--that, at  first, when I saw ``taxation without representation,'' you know, I  didn't get it. It didn't seem appropriate. But then you find out that  actually every territory that does not have a full voting Member of the  House of Representatives that is a territory of the U.S.--whether it is  Puerto Rico,  [[Page H2095]]  Guam, Samoa, U.S. Virgin Islands, a number of places--if they don't  elect a full voting representative, they do not pay Federal income tax.   And in going back to the Revolution--and I put this in what is H.R.  1295, in this Congress, but I filed it back several Congresses ago, and  I filed it, I think, in most every Congress since because I believe it  is the right thing to do. To me, it is not a matter of politics; it is  a matter of being consistent with an ideal.   As Ben Franklin said, if we don't elect one Member of the British  Parliament, they have no right to tax us.   That was a righteous concept, and it still is. As a matter of  principle, I have to agree with that. The people of D.C. are right,  they shouldn't have to pay a Federal income tax.   But as I put in my bill and have in all these different Congress  sessions we have been through, as I filed it each time, the phrase ``no  taxation without representation'' was a rallying cry of many American  colonists during the period of British rule in the 1760s and early  1770s. The slogan gained widespread notoriety after the passage of the  Sugar Act on April 5, 1764. American colonists increasingly resented  having taxes levied upon them without having any legislators they  elected who were voting in Parliament in London.   The idea that there should be no taxation without representation  dated back even further. This issue became even more defined in 1765,  with the passage of the Stamp Act, which was the first true attempt to  levy a direct tax on the American colonies. Ultimately, that tax was  repealed, but the idea of no taxation without representation persisted.   Article I, Section 2, Clause 1 of the United States Constitution  says: ``The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members  chosen every second Year by the People of the several States.''   That is why, unless someone was from a State, then under the  Constitution, they didn't get a full voting Member of the House.   By the same token, if we are going to be consistent with the founding  principles, the residents of the District of Columbia should not be  paying Federal income tax, just as those in Puerto Rico and other  territories don't pay Federal income tax.   So the bill goes on, and it points out that Puerto Rico, the U.S.  Virgin Islands, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands,  American Samoa, all of these, don't pay Federal income tax.   So the rest of this bill, H.R. 1295, in this Congress, just has, in  effect, the residents of D.C. shouldn't have to and don't pay Federal  income tax.   Now, since I have been here, this issue has been coming up, just as  it has over the centuries, about the District of Columbia  representation. It came up back in 1847. The Federal Government was not  really utilizing the land west of the Potomac, and the people there  were saying, Look, we want to elect two Senators, Representatives as  our population allows; and you are not using our land; let us go back  to being part of Virginia.   So, in 1847, Congress, the House and Senate, signed by the President,  ceded land back to Virginia, the State from which it came, because to  do otherwise would have been to cheat Virginia, because Virginia gave  that land for the purpose of being used as part of the Federal enclave,  the Federal Capital.   So if the U.S. Government had done anything besides use it as a  Federal enclave for part of the U.S. Capital, without Virginia's  permission, that basically the Federal Government would have stolen  that from Virginia. The right thing, the proper, honorable thing to do,  if it wasn't going to use the land, was to give it back to Virginia.   Now, some of us can see why it might have been nice if they had said,  No, we are going to use it, so we are not going to cede it back, but  you don't have--when Federal income tax came along, you don't have to  pay that.   But that is not what happened. It was ceded back to Virginia. That is  why, when anyone sees a map of the District of Columbia, it is not a  perfect square. On the west, it follows the Potomac River.   So I have that bill. I have had it for many Congresses now. I wish  that when Republicans were in the majority, I could have gotten our  leadership to bring it to the floor, because it should have been  brought to the floor and it should have passed. But I really thought  that at some point--and I had even offered to redo the bill and put any  Democrats, including Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, have it as her  bill. She has not chosen to ever be part of this bill. And then we hear  today, well, it is all because of politics.   Well, I have not ever proposed this for politics. I am proposing it  because I know our history and I know this is the right thing to do.  They should not have to pay Federal income tax.   What I have offered in prior years is, Look, you are trying to have  D.C. have a full voting representative with just legislation. That will  be unconstitutional at some point. Why don't you at least go ahead and  get this bill passed, especially while Democrats are in the majority,  so that until such time as D.C. has a full voting representative, you  at least don't have to pay taxes without full representation?   But I have never gotten Democrats to agree to do that. So it was not  brought to the floor by Republican leaders over the years. That may  well have been for political reasons. But it is being pushed by me, and  has all these years, as a matter of principle, and it still is.   Why wouldn't Democrats agree to go ahead and do this bill until such  time, when and if, it becomes unnecessary? Why would Democrats continue  to allow taxation without representation to go unchanged?   I have been trying to do this for 13 years or so. Apparently, it is a  problem on both sides of the aisle. I wish people would quit playing  politics and just be fair to the people of Washington, D.C.   Back when I first proposed a bill to eliminate the Federal income  tax--as Puerto Rico knows, there is no Federal income tax, but they  have a very, very substantial local tax, which is what happens when you  have approaching 30 percent of the workers working for the government.  You are going to have a lot of taxes to pay.   But on the other hand, in 1847, since land was ceded west of the  Potomac back to Virginia, if you are bent on giving people two Senators  to vote for, as well as at least one Representative, then the proper  thing to do would be to cede the land back to the State from which it  came; don't cheat that State. The Federal Government should not be in  the business of cheating people or cheating States.   This bill--it has had another number before, but in this Congress it  is 2651, and it is cited as the ``District of Columbia-Maryland Reunion  Act.'' It goes through and gives some history. I am kind of big on  that. It is important to know where we came from so we know where we  should go. It cites some of the things I have already mentioned, but  then it gets into actually drawing a descriptive line around the  Federal buildings, to include the Capitol and the White House and the  important Federal buildings--so that would still be Federal property-- and then ceding the rest of the land back to Maryland.   Now, I would prefer just to keep the District of Columbia and the  residents not pay Federal income tax, rather than trying to do what is  unconstitutional--it seemed pretty clear to me--to cheat Maryland out  of the land they gave. I mean, it is a bait and switch. Yeah, you gave  it for the Federal enclave, but we are going to take it and make it a  separate State. And, yes, each time you create a new State, it weakens  the power of those States already in existence, because their two  Senators' votes are not quite as important as they once were. But this  would be a constitutional and appropriate solution if the majority  chose to go that way.                                time  1330    I still think, regardless, even as the majority persists in trying to  create a State, which I think should ultimately be struck down, why not  go ahead and give the residents of the District of Columbia the relief  they deserve and say, In the meantime, Congress has full authority to  say who is taxed and who isn't, and the residents of the District of  Columbia do not elect a full voting Representative yet, so they don't  pay any income tax.   And, again, I will extend that offer. I was told by State senator  Bill Ratliff--  [[Page H2096]]  and I can't remember who he quoted--but ``It is amazing what you can  get done if you don't care who gets the credit.'' I have often been  willing to say, put whoever's name will help this bill get through.   In fact, sometimes I have made my own leadership mad enough that, you  know, if I had a good idea, I would provide it to somebody on the  committee of jurisdiction and say, ``This is a good bill, why don't you  lead on it?   ``Well, why don't you do it?   ``Because you are on the committee of jurisdiction, and I have made  Republican leaders mad, and so it has got a better chance if you do  it.'' And it has been nice to see people make good use of their  authority in that way.   Of course, there has been plenty of things written about this issue.  There is one from a blog of the National Archives, ``Unratified  Amendments: D.C. Voting Rights,'' interesting article there.   National Review has an article from March of this year, ``D.C.  Statehood is an Idea Whose Time Should Never Come.''   Another from David Harsanyi, ``Concerning D.C. Statehood, the  Founders Have Already Spoken.'' That is from March of this year also.   Something called the Wayback Machine has an article on  ``Constitutional Amendments Not Ratified,'' and of course, D.C.  statehood is one such, as is the idea of giving full representation,  though the Constitution says it will come from the several States. That  was something we had voted on in a prior Congress since I have been  here.   There is a great letter from the Attorney General of South Carolina,  Alan Wilson, on this issue, and he makes a great argument just stating  how Article IV, Section 3 provides that new States may be admitted by  Congress in the Union, but goes on to explain why the only lawful way  to provide statehood to the District of Columbia is to amend the  Constitution. The District of Columbia's creation traces to Article I,  Section 8, Clause 17 of the Constitution, and he goes on and makes a  very compelling case.   So I don't know what the Senate is going to do. I hope that at least  some of the Democrat Senators will understand that this is no time to  be violating our Constitution when things have been going out of  control. You have got even some people right in our own House of  Representatives that are calling for and have called for confrontation,  getting in people's faces, making them miserable, intimidating,  threatening, making sure they aren't feeling welcome.   This is a tragic time. The Founders would normally quote Voltaire-- some say the attribution lies elsewhere--but the statement was, ``I  disagree with what you say, but will defend to the death your right to  say it.'' And nowadays it seems like the majority in power in Congress  and the White House more takes a position: I disagree with what you  say, and I am truly woke, so I want you fired. I want you never to be  able to get work again. I want your children harassed. We are going to  threaten to rape, kill, destroy, do all kinds of damage to your family,  and we hope that, you know, your family is destroyed and no longer  exists very soon.   I mean, that is a long way from where we came. We have come so far,  and in each century we made major steps forward so that the  Constitution would mean exactly what it says. And now we are arriving  at a time where, instead of reaching what Dr. King dreamed of, people  being judged by the content of their character and not the color of  their skin or anything else, we are going back to being a more racist  society. We do want segregation.   I mean, there was a time when segregation was considered evil. You  shouldn't segregate people by their skin color. Yes, Franklin Roosevelt  believed in it, Democrat that he was. Democrat Woodrow Wilson believed  in segregation and did so and used segregation inappropriately.   And now we are coming back to a time where people on the left are  advocating for segregation, advocating for judging people by their skin  color. It is still wrong. It has always been wrong. It still is.   One of the beauties of a country founded on Judeo-Christian  principles was, regardless that slavery existed, if this country was  going to continue under the principles on which it was founded, there  was going to have to be a day of reckoning when people who were leaders  in this country said, Look, we were endowed by our God, our Creator  with certain inalienable rights, and it doesn't matter what your skin  color is.   Those things don't matter. God loves every human being. There are  some things we are told in the Bible God hates. Lying lips is one that  God detests, and that is easy to understand. But God doesn't want for  any of us to stumble, and he doesn't want people causing others to  stumble. We seem to have been approaching that more closely than ever  in our history.   It took a Civil War, it took a Christian minister named King  preaching nonviolence, peaceful demonstration, not getting in people's  faces and intimidating them or using violence. We were making so much  progress. We had come further than any country in the history of the  world.   I heard somebody this week say we are really probably the most  racially diverse country, and we don't penalize people for their race.  That has been a problem throughout history for the world, and yet we  have made so much progress, and now we have people on the left  advocating for segregation and advocating for judging people by  characteristics instead of by the content of their character.    It was also shocking this week in debate in the Judiciary Committee  to hear somebody across the aisle saying that no Democrats have ever  advocated for defunding the police, and I am sure it was intended as an  honest statement. The trouble is it is simply not true. And you don't  have to do much of an online search. Even with Google and Facebook and  Twitter covering for the Democratic Party, you still don't have to work  too hard to find so many Democrat-controlled cities that are defunding  the police. They are cutting funds to the police. It is easy to find.  And there are more even in this body itself that are advocating to just  completely do away with the policing like we have.   Having dealt with the justice system for most of my adult life, I  know the police are not immune to having bad apples, but it always  struck me that there were a whole lot fewer bad apples, percentage  wise, in law enforcement than there were in most any other area of  life, of any other profession. And they are owed our respect. That is  why it becomes very unpleasant when anyone in control ends up using law  enforcement as a political battering ram against those who are not in  the majority.   We have known for many weeks now that there was and is, according to  the chief of Capitol Police and Sergeant at Arms, no intelligence from  any source that any Member of Congress is a threat to any other Member  of Congress, which means the metal detectors that the Speaker has had  installed around the west, east, and north entrance were totally  unnecessary.   And then, of course, after I pointed out that I was being fined  $5,000 for going to the restroom right out that door, where there was  no metal detector there or at the other end of the Speaker's lobby, and  I didn't avoid the metal detectors. I went through the metal detector  on the west and did so satisfactorily, and for days when I was in here  for a long period of time, I could go right there to the restroom, the  guards right there at the entrance of the Speaker's lobby could see you  go in, see you come out. They checked out the restroom, you know. There  is not even a tank where you could do like was done in ``The  Godfather'' where a gun was put in the tank of the toilet. Not even a  tank to do that in there. I had never been told you need to be wanded  or checked or anything. That was totally new. But since I raised that,  now metal detectors have been put there so that Democrats can go after  Republicans. And I say that because we now have examples of even the  Speaker and others who have gone through metal detectors, set off the  metal detector, and refused to be wanded and have not been fined.   Now, I understand the majority whip may have done that today. I am  very sorry for Mr. Clyburn, they may have to make an example of him  just to keep the pressure, to keep me from getting out of my fine, but  it doesn't change the fact that to this time the use of the metal  detectors has been  [[Page H2097]]  very arbitrary and capricious, and the enforcement of the metal  detectors has been very arbitrary and capricious.   Hopefully, those being utilized to harass Members of Congress-- especially since a couple of our folks have missed votes. If they  hadn't had to go through the metal detector, they would have gotten in  here in time to vote.                                time  1345    It is time to open things up. Then we get word: Well, we are going  start opening up, but you have to go through us, tell us anybody you  are proposing to meet with and what the purpose is, this kind of stuff.  We are not letting a good crisis go to waste. We are going to be very  Orwellian here, and we are going to use this as an excuse to control  who Members of Congress can see, who they can talk to, and really have  an iron grip on what people can do.   It has gotten really sad around this place.   Here is an article from Stephanie Pagones, ``Cities such as Austin,  L.A., Minneapolis, New York City, and Portland have shifted funds from  police departments.'' Obviously, this lady, Stephanie, knows that when  Democrats have said they are not defunding the police, that is not  true. Democrats around the country are pushing for and actually getting  budgets slashed for police departments.   ``Cities in parts of the U.S.,'' she said, ``that slashed their  police department funding last year, in part as a result of police- involved shootings, have seen an uptick in certain crimes over the past  year, according to data analyzed by FOX News. Cities such as Los  Angeles, Minneapolis, New York City, Portland, Oregon, and Austin,  Texas, have shifted funds from police departments to social services  programs. Such cuts have led some departments to lay off officers,  cancel recruiting classes, or retreat from hiring goals.   ``As police departments were left to make do with shrunken budgets  and less support, some big cities have seen sometimes drastic upticks  in murders and other violent crimes. . . . The `defund the police'  movement is not necessarily about gutting police department budgets,  though some groups have tried. And budget cuts were already expected as  a result of alternative needs for funding because of the coronavirus  pandemic.''   Then, the article goes on and looks at the cuts that some of these  cities have had.   Here is an article: ``Democrat Representative Maxine Waters Demanded  Special Police Motorcade and Escort Before Calling for Violence at  Anti-Police Event,'' by Jordan Davidson at The Federalist.   Daily Caller's Henry Rodgers reports: `` `The Squad' Pushes to  `Defund the Police' While Spending Thousands on Private Security to  Protect Themselves.''   You have to have some protection from somewhere. Otherwise, you are  not going to be able to maintain a position of authority in government.  There are always going to be evil people, in this world at least, who  are going to attempt to bring down people in authority.   This article is from Matt Palumbo, December 30, 2020: ``2020 Homicide  Surge Sets Record Amid `Defund the Police' Hysteria.'' It has facts and  figures on that.   One other thing I want to touch on. Since we have some people who  believe climate change is the most pressing issue of our time, I was  surprised to hear the former leader of NASA say that they had found  that our Moon, the Earth's Moon, is slightly changing its orbit because  I had not read that or seen that anywhere, and that even Earth's orbit  around the Sun is slightly changing.   Of course, I had seen previously that the ice caps were melting, and  some people say it is because of the cars, pollution. But it still  doesn't explain to me why the ice caps on the planet Mars have melted  or have been melting for cow flatulence or different things here on  Earth. How is that causing the ice caps on Mars to melt?   Here is an article from NASA, from February 27, 2020. It says: ``Our  lives literally revolve around cycles: series of events that are  repeated regularly in the same order. There are hundreds of different  types of cycles in our world and in the universe. Some are natural,  such as the change of the seasons,'' that is one form of climate  change, ``annual animal migrations, or the circadian rhythms that  govern our sleep patterns. Others are human-produced, like growing and  harvesting crops, musical rhythms, or economic cycles.''   It goes on to point out something called the Milankovitch cycles, and  they include: ``The shape of Earth's orbit, known as eccentricity; the  angle Earth's axis is tilted with respect to Earth's orbital plane,  known as obliquity; and the direction Earth's axis of rotation is  pointed, known as precession.'' It goes on to discuss this.   Apparently, there is another article from Forbes from April of last  year, ``Earth Is Spiraling Away From the Sun for Now, But Eventually  Will Crash Into It.'' I had not heard or read that before, about our  Moon's orbit changing at all or the Earth's orbit around the Sun  changing at all. I don't know what, if anything, could be done about  that, but there is no question that the Moon's orbit changing or  Earth's orbit changing around the Sun can't help but have significant  effects on our climate.   This article, the headline says that Earth will eventually crash into  the Sun. Well, it is amazing. I remember in the 1970s reading that we  were at the beginning of a new ice age. It was very early in the new  ice age, but eventually, Earth would be covered by ice. It would mean  the end of life as we knew it.   As a Christian, I was thinking that is not how the Earth is going to  end, and I didn't really believe that. Lo and behold, it wasn't too  many years later we find out, or we are told: Well, the Earth is  warming, and the Earth's warming is going to destroy the planet. It is  global warming.   Then, of course, global warming, we found out some places it was  cooling. As one witness said some years back, actually, the Northern  Hemisphere is not nearly as warm as it was back when the Norse were  coming over and having these big farms in what we now call Greenland.   There are cycles, and there is something that could come into play in  the great design of our Creator that would keep Earth from crashing  into the Sun. But in the meantime, it is important that we not run  around like Chicken Little and destroy the rich blessings we have out  of fear that we may miss out on other blessings. Let's use the wisdom  and common sense that most of our constituents have.   In the meantime, I think we really need to find out more about the  changing orbit of Earth around the Sun and the changing orbit, if any,  of the Moon around the Earth. It is a lot to learn.   If we are going to help contribute to the downfall of the greatest  experiment in self-government in the history of the world, then making  our Nation's Capital where it could be subject to being extorted, held  hostage, then these other things may not matter anyway.   In the meantime, we have a responsibility to the Nation, our oath,  and the Constitution to ensure that we keep this experiment in self- government going.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
