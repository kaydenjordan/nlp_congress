 Mr. President, before my colleague from Oregon leaves,  I want to ask him a question.   I am reminded, in 2009 and 2010, as we were working on the Affordable  Care Act, that the HELP Committee held 14 bipartisan roundtables, 13  bipartisan hearings, 20 bipartisan walkthroughs on healthcare reform.  The HELP Committee then considered nearly 300 amendments and accepted  more than 160 Republican amendments, and the Finance Committee--where  my colleague is the ranking member--held 17 roundtables, summits, and  hearings on the topic. The Finance Committee also held 13 member  meetings and walkthroughs, 38 meetings and negotiations, for a total of  53 meetings on  [[Page S1727]]  healthcare reform. During its process, the Finance Committee adopted 11  Republican amendments.   Don't you find it particularly ironic that we are seeing this  TrumpCare legislation being pushed through on the House side--and what  we are hearing, the rumors about what is going to happen in the Senate  is it is not going to have any hearings and it is going to be brought  to the floor and we are expected to vote on it without having a chance  for the public to know what is in it.    Right.    I appreciate the eloquent comments from the Senator  from Oregon and all of his efforts to make sure we don't take away  healthcare for so many people who desperately need it.   That is why I came to the floor today, because I spent the week we  were back home--not last week but the week before--talking to  constituents in New Hampshire and listening to what their concerns  were.   What I heard was that people were deeply, deeply concerned and very  upset by the efforts here to repeal the Affordable Care Act, when they  didn't know what the replacement meant for them. In dozens of  conversations and roundtable discussions at a townhall forum, Granite  Staters shared stories of how the Affordable Care Act has been a  lifeline for them. I heard from people who say their lives have been  saved by the law.   In fact, we can see what is at risk in the State of New Hampshire,  where we have almost 600,000 Granite Staters who have preexisting  conditions. We have 118,000 people who could lose coverage. We have  50,000 Granite Staters with marketplace plans who are in the exchange,  42,000 who are enrolled in Medicaid, and 31,000 who have tax credits  that lower the cost of healthcare for them. If that is taken away, so  many of those people have no option for getting healthcare.   What we know now, after we have finally seen the plan Republican  leaders are talking about, we know those fears were well founded that  they were worried they were going to lose their healthcare. What we  have seen is legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act that would  have catastrophic consequences not only for people in New Hampshire but  for people across this country.   It is especially distressing that TrumpCare--as it has been  introduced by the Republicans--would roll back expansion of the  Medicaid Program, which has, in New Hampshire and across this country,  been an indispensable tool in our efforts to combat the opioid  epidemic. In addition, we are seeing, as the Senator from Oregon  pointed out, that TrumpCare would terminate healthcare subsidies for  the middle class and for other working Americans, and it would replace  those subsidies with totally inadequate tax credits--as low as $2,000,  which doesn't begin to pay for healthcare coverage for an individual,  much less a family. This means as many as 20 million Americans could  lose their healthcare coverage.   Even as the bill makes devastating cuts to the middle class, it gives  the wealthiest Americans a new tax break worth several hundred thousand  dollars per taxpayer. I think this proposed legislation is totally out  of touch with the lives of millions of working Americans, people whose  health and financial situation would be turned upside down by the bill.   Last week, in his response to President Trump's address to Congress,  former Gov. Steve Beshear of Kentucky said something that really  resonated with me. He reminded us that people who have access to  healthcare thanks to ObamaCare are ``not aliens from some other  planet.'' As he described, ``They are our friends and neighbors. . . .  We sit on the bleachers with them on Friday night. We worship in the  pews with them on Sunday morning. They're farmers, restaurant workers,  part-time teachers, nurses' aides, construction workers,  entrepreneurs,'' and often minimum wage workers. ``And before the  Affordable Care Act, they woke up every morning and went to work, just  hoping and praying they wouldn't get sick, because they knew they were  just one bad diagnosis away from bankruptcy.''   To understand why people in New Hampshire are so upset and fearful  about efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, we have to look again  at this chart because some 120,000 Granite Staters could lose their  health insurance. That is nearly 1 in every 10 people in the State of  New Hampshire.   In particular, repeal of the Affordable Care Act would very literally  have life-or-death consequences for thousands of people who are  fighting opioid addiction, who have been able to access lifesaving  treatment thanks to the expansion of Medicaid and the Affordable Care  Act.   Sadly, one of the statistics we are not happy about in New Hampshire  is that we have the second highest rate of per capita drug overdose  deaths in the country. We trail only West Virginia. The chief medical  examiner in New Hampshire projects that there were 470 drug-related  deaths in 2016, including a sharp increase in overdose deaths among  those who were 19 years old or younger. For a small State like New  Hampshire, this is a tragedy of staggering proportions, affecting not  just those who overdose but their families and entire communities.   I am happy to say, in the last couple of years, we made real progress  in combating this epidemic because we had the Affordable Care Act and  its expansion of Medicaid, which has given thousands of Granite Staters  access to lifesaving treatment. Over the past year, I had a chance to  visit treatment centers all across New Hampshire. I met with  individuals who are struggling with substance use disorders and  providers who are trying to make sure they get the treatment they need.   Last month, at a center in the Monadnock region of New Hampshire, I  had an amazing private meeting with more than 30 people in recovery  from substance use disorders. They are putting their lives back  together, hoping to reclaim their jobs, to get back with their  families, and they are able to do that largely because of treatment  that is made possible by the Affordable Care Act.   One patient shared her story with me. As with so many others in  treatment, her story is one of making mistakes, of falling into  dependency, of struggling with all her might to escape her addiction.  She is in recovery for the second time, and she said that this time for  her is a life-or-death situation. She has no family support. She  worries that she will be homeless when she leaves the treatment  program, but she is grateful for the Affordable Care Act because it has  given her one more shot at getting sober and the chance for a positive  future.   At a forum in Manchester--New Hampshire's largest city--a courageous  woman named Ashley Hurteau said  [[Page S1728]]  that access to healthcare as an enrollee in Medicaid expansion was  critical to her addiction recovery. She had been arrested following the  overdose death of her husband. Ashley said an understanding police  officer and a drug court were key to her recovery. She added this:         I am living proof that, by giving individuals suffering       with substance use disorder access to health insurance, we,       as a society, are giving people like me the chance to be who       we really are again.    Without that access to treatment, where would Ashley be?   Several weeks ago I received a letter from Nansie Feeny, who lives in  Concord, the capital of New Hampshire. She told me the Affordable Care  Act had saved her son's life. This is what she wrote:         [My son] Benjamin went to Keene State College with the same       hopes and dreams many have when building their American       dream. While there he tried heroin. Addiction overcame him       but did not stop him from graduating. After graduation he       suffered a long road of near death existence. After a couple       of episodes where he had to be revived (fentanyl) he chose       recovery. And it was due to ObamaCare that we were able to       get him insured so he could get the proper help he needed and       [into] a suboxone program that assisted him with staying       ``clean.''        In April--    She wrote, and you could read between the lines how relieved she  was--         it will be a year for Ben in his recovery. Without       ObamaCare, this would not have been possible. . . . I can't       find the words to define my gratitude to President Obama. I       believe my son would not be alive today if it were not for       this plan that provided the means he needed to get the help       he needed at the time he needed it. Ben still has a long road       ahead of him but I will see to it that he never walks it       alone.    I also want to share a powerfully moving letter from Melissa Davis,  an attorney in Plymouth, NH. Ms. Davis writes:         I am a lawyer who frequently works on behalf of clients who       are suffering from substance use disorder, mental health       conditions, or a combination of both. I have been working       with these clients for over 10 years and I can tell you that       access to health insurance has always been the biggest       obstacle in obtaining quality and consistent treatment. Since       passage of the Affordable Care Act and the expansion of       Medicaid, my clients are actually able to access real       treatment in ways they never were before. Before the ACA,       there were far too many times where my clients were unable to       afford private substance use disorder treatment, wait lists       at community mental health agencies were extremely long, and       AA and NA were not enough. Without treatment, these clients       often ended up in jail or worse, dead. I still have clients       who face obstacles to obtaining quality treatment, but the       ability to get insurance removes a huge obstacle.    Ms. Davis concludes with this warning:         I am sincerely afraid for what will happen to my clients       and my community if access to quality substance use disorder       and mental health treatment is taken away from those people       who need it most because they are unable to get insurance.       Please do everything you can to save the ACA.    In dozens of visits to New Hampshire during the campaign, President  Trump pledged aggressive action to combat the opioid crisis. In his  address to Congress last week, he once again promised action to expand  treatment and end the opioid crisis. But despite these bold words and  big promises, the President's actions have sent a totally different  signal. His actions threaten an abrupt retreat in the fight against the  opioid epidemic.   By embracing the House Republican leadership's plan to repeal the  Affordable Care Act, President Trump has broken his promise to the  people of New Hampshire. This misguided bill would roll back the  expansion of Medicaid, and it could terminate treatment for hundreds of  thousands of people in New Hampshire and across America who are  recovering from substance use disorders.   Meanwhile, the President's nominee to serve as Administrator of the  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Seema Verma, has been an  outspoken advocate of deep cuts to Federal funding for Medicaid. As we  have seen with so many of the Trump administration nominees, Ms. Verma  has an underlying hostility to the core mission of the agency that she  has been asked to lead.   Seema Verma is currently a health policy consultant who has called  for less Federal oversight of the Medicaid Program and advocated for  policies expressly designed to discourage patients from seeking care-- for instance, by imposing cost-sharing burdens on Medicaid recipients.  In addition, she is a staunch advocate of block-granting Medicaid and  turning it into a per capita cap system. Over time, this would lead to  profound cuts to Medicaid, forcing States to raise eligibility  requirements and terminate coverage for millions of recipients.   Let's be clear as to who these recipients are. In 2015, the 97  million Americans covered by Medicaid included 33 million children, 6  million seniors, and 10 million people with disabilities. Seniors,  including nursing home costs, account for nearly half of all Medicaid  expenditures.   These are some of the most vulnerable people in our society, and they  will be the targets of Ms. Verma's determined efforts to cut funding  for Medicaid and terminate coverage for millions of current recipients.   I also have deep concerns about this nominee's commitment to  protecting women's healthcare. During her confirmation hearing in the  Finance Committee, Ms. Verma was asked if women should get access to  prenatal care and maternity coverage as afforded under the Affordable  Care Act or whether insurance companies should get to choose whether to  cover this for women.   Ms. Verma tried to clarify when she met with me that she hadn't  really meant what she said. But what she said was that maternity  coverage should be optional, that women should pay extra for it if they  want it. Of course, the problem with this position is that it takes us  backward to the days before the ACA, when only 12 percent of policies  on the individual insurance market offered maternity coverage.   In the State of New Hampshire, before the Affordable Care Act, you  could not buy an individual policy that covered maternity benefits.  They were not written. Insurers who offered coverage charged exorbitant  rates with high deductibles, plus benefit caps of only a few thousand  dollars. This is a major reason why, before the Affordable Care Act,  women were systematically charged more for health insurance than men.  In the eyes of insurance companies, being a woman was seen as a  preexisting condition, and they charged us more accordingly.   Well, the American people don't want drastic cuts to Medicaid, cuts  that will threaten coverage for children, for seniors, for people with  disabilities, and for those receiving treatment for substance use  disorders. That is why I intend to vote against the confirmation of  Seema Verma to head CMS.   In recent years, we have made impressive gains, securing health  coverage for millions of Americans and significantly improving the  health of the American people. I can't support a nominee who wants to  reverse these gains.   In recent weeks, all of our offices have been flooded with calls,  with emails, with letters opposing the Trump administration's plans to  repeal ObamaCare and undermine both the Medicare and Medicaid Programs.  We need to listen to these voices. We need to keep the Affordable Care  Act and the expansion of Medicaid.   There are things we can do to make it better, and we should work  together to do that. But we have heard from people loud and clear  across this country. It is time now to respect their wishes, to come  together to fix this landmark law, and to ensure that it works even  better for all Americans.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Absolutely.    That is absolutely correct.   I remember meeting one young man early in the fall, in the middle of  the campaign early last year. He came up to me in Manchester and said:  I am so worried about what is going to happen in this election because  I am in recovery; I am an addict. He said: I am worried that whoever  gets elected is not going to continue to make sure that I can get the  treatment I need. He said: I am worried about Mr. Trump.   As my colleague pointed out, Donald Trump, when he was campaigning in  New Hampshire, made a lot of promises about how he was going to address  the heroin and opioid epidemic, how he was going to make sure that  people could get treatment, treatment at a cost they could afford.   Well, thanks to the Affordable Care Act and the expansion of Medicaid  and the great work by our Republican legislature and our Democratic  Governor--then-Governor Hassan, who is now in the Senate--we passed a  plan to make sure that people who had substance use disorders could get  treatment.   Last year we had 48,000 applications submitted under the expansion of  Medicaid for treatment of substance use disorders. If we pulled the  plug on that Medicaid expansion so that people couldn't get that  treatment, they wouldn't have anywhere to go.   That is what I heard when I was at Phoenix House in Dublin, in the  western part of New Hampshire, a couple of weeks ago. I was sitting  around with about 30 people in recovery, people who are hopeful for the  first time in a long time because they are in treatment and they can  see they can put their lives back together.   I said to them: What happens if we no longer have the Medicaid  Program?   They said: We don't have any other options. We don't have treatment.   What we heard from President Trump is that he was going to introduce  a healthcare plan that was going to cover more people for less money  and better quality. Well, that is not what we are seeing.   The TrumpCare that was introduced in the House this week that they  marked up and that is going to be coming to the Senate doesn't do that.  It reduces coverage under the Medicaid Program. It would throw  thousands of people off of their treatment for substance use disorders,  and there is nowhere else for them to go.   This is not an acceptable plan. This does not do what the President  promised he was going to do. It is not what he promised in New  Hampshire, it is not what he promised in the campaign, and it is not  what he has promised since he became President.    I think that is a huge problem. New Hampshire has a  population that is one of the fastest aging in the country. As Senator  Wyden points out, not only does the TrumpCare legislation change how  people on Medicare are charged for their health insurance, but it also  would change the other aspects of the Affordable Care Act that have  been beneficial, such as preventive care under Medicare.   It would also change the effort to close the doughnut hole--the cost  of the prescription drugs that seniors buy. That has been a huge  benefit to people in New Hampshire over the last few years because they  are beginning to see their costs for prescription drugs affected  positively. So it will have a huge impact on seniors in New Hampshire.   The other issue that will have an impact not only on seniors but on  everybody is what will happen to our rural hospitals. In New Hampshire,  because we have a lot of rural areas in the State, we have a lot of  small towns. Most of our hospitals are small and rural. They have  benefitted significantly under the Affordable Care Act because they  have been able to get paid for people who come to the emergency room  for treatment. We have gotten a lot of people out of emergency rooms  and into primary care. Most hospitals have seen about a 40-percent  decline in people using emergency rooms for their healthcare. That has  been a huge, important benefit to our rural hospitals that are  operating on very thin margins that we need to keep open, not just  because of the healthcare they provide but because of the jobs they  provide. In most of our small communities, those hospitals are among  the biggest employers.   There are huge impacts if we repeal the Affordable Care Act and we  put in place this TrumpCare policy that doesn't cover as many people.  It is going to cost more, it is going to reduce the help people are  getting  [[Page S1730]]  through their healthcare coverage, and it is going to have a  detrimental impact on people in the State of New Hampshire and across  this country.    I thank the Senator, and thank the Senator for his  fight to help as we try to prevent people across this country from  losing their healthcare.
