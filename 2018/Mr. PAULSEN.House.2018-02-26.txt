 Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize Fairview Southdale  Hospital in Edina for recently receiving the 2018 Distinguished  Hospital Award for Clinical Excellence from Healthgrades.   Fairview Southdale was also named one of the country's top 100 best  hospitals for cardiac care, coronary intervention, and pulmonary care.  Distinguished hospitals are determined and measured by whether they  achieve outstanding outcomes in at least 21 of 23 common conditions and  procedures.   Patients who are treated in these hospitals, on average, face a lower  risk of death than if they were treated in hospitals without this  designation. These hospitals also achieve better clinical results than  95 percent of hospitals across the country.   Mr. Speaker, the doctors, the nurses, the staffs at Fairview do  incredible work, and I know they deserve this recognition, and we also  know their patients are in good hands.                            ____________________
