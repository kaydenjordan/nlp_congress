 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to talk about the  question of impeachment, which, of course, is being debated across the  country.   Evidence continues to mount regarding actions the President has  taken. Of course, this issue is not only worthy of debate but also  worthy of inquiry and review and even debate and discussion here in the  Senate.   From the Mueller report to the recent revelations regarding the  President's dealing with Ukraine and its President, evidence indicates  that the President is not only willing to take actions which, in my  judgment, amount to an abuse of power--in fact, I think the behavior of  the President on the phone call with the Ukrainian President was a  textbook case of abuse of power. Apparently, he wants to enlist others  to defend the indefensible--this behavior--and has said other things  that are troubling to so many Americans.   I think it is important to provide some historical perspective on  impeachment, and I will seek to do some of that today. This is by no  means a full review of the history, but I think it is important to talk  about some of the questions our Founders were wrestling with.   Our Founders grappled with many different questions as they debated  the Constitution itself, particularly the nature and the power of the  Office of the President of the United States. As our Founders debated  how to hold the President accountable during the 1787 Constitutional  Convention in Philadelphia, Elbridge Gerry said as follows regarding  the issue of impeachment: ``A good magistrate will not fear  [impeachments]. A bad one ought to be kept in fear of them.''   Consistent with Gerry's remarks, our Constitution provides an  impeachment process for ``Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and  Misdemeanors.'' At the time of the drafting, our Founders'  understanding of ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' was informed by  centuries of English legal precedent.   We know, as Alexander Hamilton explained in Federalist No. 65,  impeachment should stem from ``abuse or violation of some public  trust.'' I will say it again: ``abuse or violation of some public  trust.'' Informed by this history, Congress has consistently  interpreted the phrase broadly to mean ``serious violations of the  public trust''--that was one understanding--and has explained that  ``the phrase refers to misconduct that damages the state and the  operations of governmental institutions, and is not limited to criminal  misconduct.'' That is an important distinction--``not limited to  criminal misconduct.''   There is no requirement for a President to engage in a quid pro quo.  Any kind of quid pro quo arrangement is not required for impeachment,  although it is certainly an impeachable offense to engage in that kind  of conduct. Rather, our Constitution merely requires ``abuse or  violation of some public trust,'' as Hamilton spoke to.   Since Special Counsel Mueller issued his report on Russian  interference in the 2016 election and, more recently, as testimony has  emerged about President Trump's conduct toward Ukraine, I have  attempted to assess how President Trump's actions fit in our historical  and current understanding of what ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors''  means.   This is an undertaking that must be done in a considered manner and  after reviewing all of the relevant information that is available. But  I am increasingly convinced that Speaker Pelosi was correct in calling  for a formal impeachment inquiry into President Trump's conduct. A  failure by Congress to pursue impeachment in the face of grave offenses  by the President would be insulting to our Constitution and insulting  to our values.   Let's talk about the Ukraine example for a moment. Over the past  several weeks, our Nation has been confronted by credible and detailed  press reports, as well as exhaustive testimony, in some cases lasting 8  hours, 9 hours, 10 hours at a time, just for one witness, and this  testimony has come from both career diplomats and State Department  officials indicating that the  [[Page S5913]]  President has been employing his personal attorney to manage a shadow  diplomacy agenda focused on personal vendettas and unfounded conspiracy  theories in Ukraine.   In a telephone call with President Zelensky of Ukraine, President  Trump--immediately after the Ukrainian President raised the issue of  purchasing Javelins to defend his country from Russian aggression-- asked the Ukrainian President to ``do us a favor though'' by working  with his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and launching an investigation into a  discredited conspiracy theory regarding a DNC server in Ukraine. To say  that theory is discredited is an understatement. It has been debunked,  so said a former Homeland Security Advisor to President Trump, among  others.   President Trump also asked President Zelensky ``to look into'' Joe  Biden's son and explained that ``a lot of people want to find out''  about Biden--a political rival who, of course, is running for  President.   After a memorandum of the phone call was released to the public, the  House Intelligence Committee released a text message from the top U.S.  diplomat in Ukraine, who indicated that he thought it was ``crazy [for  the President] to withhold security assistance for help with a  political campaign.''   Other officials have since come forward, some even resigning because  of their serious concerns over the White House's handling of Ukraine  policy. Michael McKinley, a former senior adviser to the U.S. Secretary  of State, testified that he resigned for two reasons: ``the failure, in  my view, of the State Department to offer support to Foreign Service  employees caught up in the impeachment inquiry on Ukraine, and, second,  by what appears to be the utilization of our ambassadors overseas to  advance a domestic political objective.'' That is what Mr. McKinley,  who just left the State Department, said.   Our Founders had the foresight to ensure that the power of the  President was not unlimited and that Congress could, if necessary, hold  the Executive accountable for abuses of power through the impeachment  process. Surely, not every instance of Presidential wrongdoing merits  impeachment. Using the vast powers of impeachment in a cavalier fashion  would be an insult to our Constitution.   This inquiry is not simply about President Trump's abuse of power.  This inquiry is about our democracy and the values that the Founders  agreed should guide our Nation.   Impeachment is not what anyone in this town would prefer. It is what  our Constitution demands--demands--when an Executive abuses his or her  power in a manner that ``damages the state and the operations of  government institutions.'' That is from an earlier impeachment in the  1860s.   As Hamilton said so long ago--but so prescient--when there is an  ``abuse or violation of some public trust,'' we are summoned-- summoned--by our constitutional duty to act.   To fail to act would be a dereliction of that duty, thereby inviting  this executive and future executives to abuse that public trust with  impunity. We should never do that.                                  H.R. 3055     Mr. President, very briefly, I wanted to highlight a story  that was in today's Wall Street Journal, entitled ``As Court Case  Imperils Affordable Care Act, Some States Prepare Contingency Plans.''  That is the headline. The subheadline is this: ``Lawmakers explore ways  to preserve coverage, benefits if the health law is struck down.''   This is the opening paragraph that I will read--it is not very long,  but I want to read it--from the story today:         A federal appeals court decision that could strike down the       Affordable Care Act as soon as this month has rattled       officials in several states who are pursuing legislation to       preserve some coverage in the absence of any Trump       administration contingency plan.        Lawmakers in states including Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico       and California have passed bills or are reviewing action       aimed at dealing with the fallout if the ACA is overturned.    That is from the very beginning of the article. I will not go  further, other than to say that this is a grave matter. If a Federal  appeals court were to rule in favor of the moving party on appeal--or I  should say the moving party at the beginning of the suit--and affirm  the district court, what would happen if that were the case? The  patient protection in the Affordable Care Act would be wiped out, and  it would cause not just chaos but would take away protections from  people like those who have protections for a preexisting condition and  would also take healthcare coverage away from millions, if not tens of  millions.   This is a critically important matter, and it deserves and warrants  the attention of Members of the Senate and the House as well.   With that, I yield the floor.    I yield the floor.
