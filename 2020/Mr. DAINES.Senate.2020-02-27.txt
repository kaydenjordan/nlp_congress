 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Fred and Tressie Fike of Mineral County for their  commitment to helping others in the community.   Fred and Tressie lead the Superior Community Church Shoebox Ministry,  which is part of the Samaritan's Purse's national initiative, Operation  Christmas Child Shoebox Ministry.   Fred and Tressie partner with their church and folks in the community  to provide shoeboxes filled with toys, hygiene items, clothes, sewing  kits, and school supplies around the world to children impacted by  devastating circumstances like war, natural disasters, poverty and  disease.   When Superior Community Church first participated in this ministry 15  years ago, they were able to deliver 25 boxes. In 2019, thanks to the  leadership of Fred and Tressie, they delivered 900.   It is my honor to recognize Fred and Tressie for their generous and  selfless efforts within their church ministry helping children across  the world. The world is a better place as a result of their  dedication.                            ____________________
