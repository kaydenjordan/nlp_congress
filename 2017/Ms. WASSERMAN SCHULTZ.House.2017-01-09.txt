 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with the Florida  delegation and other colleagues with the heaviest of hearts. In the  last few days, our State has witnessed two horrific tragedies.   The first occurred Friday, in my congressional district, when a  gunman mercilessly unleashed a hail of gunfire on passengers in the  baggage claim area at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International  Airport, murdering five and injuring six other innocent victims. Our  thoughts and prayers are with the victims, the wounded, their families,  and the countless others traumatized by this tragedy.   I commend both the Broward County Sheriff's officers who swiftly took  down the perpetrator and minimized the loss of life and the airport  personnel who are tirelessly reuniting passengers with 23,000 personal  items left behind in the chaos that ensued, stranding many of them  without identification or an ability to travel.   The second tragedy occurred today when Orlando Police Officer Debra  Clayton was slain by a murder suspect. Later, Orange County Sheriff's  Deputy Norman Lewis went looking for her killer and died in a traffic  accident.   On behalf of the Members from Orlando, I want to say, to lose two  officers on Law Enforcement Appreciation Day is an unspeakable tragedy.  Mr. Speaker, I ask, on behalf of my colleagues, for this moment of  silence to remember these victims.
