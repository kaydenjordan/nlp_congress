 Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Radewagen for  yielding to me, and I thank my friend, Mr. Barr, for his leadership on  this important issue.   We live in an information-based technological world. As we look  around us, all our lives are touched by STEM innovation. It is the  science- and math-based education that will continue to shape our  country and world and drive our economy into the next century.   H.R. 2196 is a commonsense, bipartisan fix to give student veterans  who are enrolled in STEM programs more flexibility to utilize the  educational benefits they earned through their service.   By allowing student veterans to take additional credit hours, such as  additional math and science courses, the Edith Nourse Rogers  Scholarship helps veterans receive a strong STEM education, which is  essential for succeeding in technological industries.   As I travel around my district in Pennsylvania, I consistently hear  from local businesses about the widening skills gap, and I know these  are sentiments echoed in districts throughout the Nation. Our workforce  demands more individuals with a STEM education, and who better to have  on the front lines of our evolving global economy than men and women  who bravely served our country.   We owe it to our student veterans the ability to pursue a STEM  education and to ensure they have the tools and resources they need as  they transition back into civilian life. This legislation takes an  important step in doing just that.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues in the House to vote in support of  this bill.
