 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Protecting  America's Strategic Petroleum Reserve from China Act, which will work  to unleash American energy dominance.   In an election-year gimmick, President Biden raided oil from our  Strategic Petroleum Reserve, depleting it to its lowest level in  decades and allowing it to be sold to a company affiliated with the  Chinese Communist Party.   Selling off American oil to the Chinese Communist Party for its own  strategic use poses a direct threat to our national security. The  petroleum reserve is our insurance card. It is to be used to protect  our great country during national emergencies or weather events.  Depleting it is dangerous, and restocking it at higher prices is  foolish.   Let's restore some sanity here. Protect America and end the foolish  practice of sending oil to our enemies that would hate us for free.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the House to pass this important legislation this  week to stop this reckless, America-last practice from happening again.      Congratulating the Alleghany High School Girls' Cross-Country Team     Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the Alleghany High  School girls' cross-country team for winning their Class 2 State  championship. This victory marks the first-ever Alleghany High School  girls' team to win a State title.   By training hard, staying motivated, and keeping the pressure on, the  Mountaineers left it all on the track, tallying a total of 65 points.   These talented athletes include Kiera Lowman, Gracie Barron, Macyn  Cash, Meredith Minter, Lucy Nicely, Alivia Hoover, and Bryce Leitch.   Freshman Kiera Lowman blazed to the finish line with an impressive  time of 18 minutes and 59 seconds, becoming the first-ever freshman to  win the individual State title.   Two other top-10 finishes from Alleghany High School were Gracie  Barron and Macyn Cash.   All of these young ladies are a true testament that with hard work  and determination, you can achieve your dreams.   Congratulations again to the Mountaineers. Virginia's Sixth  Congressional District is incredibly proud of your accomplishment.                            ____________________
