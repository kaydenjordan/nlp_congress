 Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate confirmed two  more superbly qualified circuit court nominees. Joel Carson and John  Nalbandian are the 20th and the 21st circuit judges we have confirmed  this Congress.   This morning our colleagues on the Intelligence Committee finished  their consideration of Gina Haspel to be CIA Director and reported her  nomination favorably with bipartisan support. Ms. Haspel's testimony  and record have showcased the poise, talent, and experience that make  her an excellent selection.   Senators heard about her 30-plus years of CIA experience, spanning  sensitive operations from the Cold War to the Global War on Terror.  That background makes Ms. Haspel an ideal pick at this particular  moment, when Secretary Mattis has explained that counterterrorism and a  renewed great-power competition are two of the key challenges facing  our Nation.   So it is no wonder that James Clapper, President Obama's Director of  National Intelligence, said: ``I think the world of Gina; she is  capable, smart, very experienced, well-respected by the Agency rank and  file, and a great person.''   Just yesterday, our current DNI, Dan Coats, wrote in USA Today that  ``she is a person of high integrity with valuable frontline and  executive experience . . . who is willing to speak truth to power when  required on behalf of our nation.''   Gina Haspel is the right woman at the right time. Her nomination has  support from national security leaders and Senators in both parties.  There is no reason why her confirmation should be delayed, and I look  forward to advancing it expeditiously following the committee's action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following  leader remarks on Thursday, May 17, Senator Paul or his designee be  recognized to make a motion to proceed to S. Con. Res. 36; further,  that there be up to 90 minutes of debate on the motion, with 45 minutes  under the control of Senator Paul or his designee and 45 minutes under  the control of the Democratic leader or his designee; finally, that  following the use or yielding back of that time, the Senate vote in  relation to the motion.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session for the consideration of the following  nomination: Executive Calendar No. 829; that the nomination be  confirmed; that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table; that the President be immediately notified of the  Senate's action; that no further motions be in order; and that any  statements relating to the nomination be printed in the Record.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  resume legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.
