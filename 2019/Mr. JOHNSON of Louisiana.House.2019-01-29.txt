 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from the  great State of North Carolina for inviting me to speak on this topic.   I stand before you in disbelief and in sorrow tonight. It has been  mentioned that the State of the Union Address was originally scheduled  to take place today, and it has been rescheduled for next week.   I think it is appropriate for us then to bring attention to what is  happening here in the people's House. I think the American people  deserve to know that. As we speak, I think the American people need to  know that partisan tactics are underway by certain House Democrats to  undermine American values and traditions that have been cherished and  practiced here since the time of our founding.    As we finally begin our committee work in the 116th Congress, I am  proud to serve again on the Judiciary Committee and the House Natural  Resources Committee. We have just begun the process of adopting our  committee rules there, and today, we were issued a list of proposed  rule changes that the Democrat majority and the Natural Resources  Committee will apparently push through at our hearing tomorrow.   Among the radical new changes to the rules is a stunning action to  remove the phrase, ``So help me God'' from the oath taken by witnesses  before they testify to Congress. Did you hear that? Let me repeat it.  Among the radical new changes in our committee is a stunning action to  remove the phrase ``So help me God'' from the oath taken by witnesses  before they testify to Congress.   This latest example of the aggressive surge to the far left that we  are seeing  [[Page H1273]]  has to be stopped. This new agenda is threatening the very fabric of  our Nation. Throughout America's history, our Presidents and elected  officials have taken a solemn oath of office including the words, ``So  help me God.''   This goes back to our founding. Since the Judiciary Act of 1789,  every justice of the U.S. Supreme Court and all lower-court judges have  taken an oath of office which concludes with the same phrase and, of  course, every court of law across this land, in every one of them, all  witnesses have always been sworn in for testimony with those same  concluding words.   For more than two centuries, immigrants from all around the world  have come here and taken America's oath of allegiance to become  naturalized citizens which also concludes with the phrase, ``So help me  God.''   Madam Speaker, some of our Democrat colleagues need to be reminded of  our history. Why did the Founders institute this practice? Well, let's  remember what they said. Our first President, George Washington, was  the Father of our country. And in his famous farewell address, he gave  his advice that echoes down through the generations to you and to me as  the elected Representatives of the people. He said, famously: ``Of all  the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity,  religion and morality are indispensable supports.''   John Adams was our second President. He came next. What did he say?  He said: ``Our Constitution is made only for a moral and religious  people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.''   In other words, what these two Founders and their fellow patriots all  understood from our history, was that there are many important rules  and practices that can help sustain and build a healthy republic, but  the key they said, the essential foundation of a republic has to be a  common commitment among the citizenry to the principles of religion and  morality and accountability to God himself.   The Founders acknowledged this self-evident truth that all men are  created equal and that God gives all men the same inalienable rights.  However, they knew, that in order to maintain a government ``of the  people, by the people, for the people,'' as Lincoln later said, those  inalienable rights must be exercised in a responsible manner.   They, thus, believed in liberty that is legitimately constrained by a  common sense of morality, and a healthy fear of the God who granted all  men our rights.   The Founders understood that all men are fallen and that power  corrupts. They also knew that no amount of institutional checks and  balances or decentralization of power and civil authorities would be  sufficient to maintain a just government if the men in charge had no  fear of eternal judgment by a power higher than their temporal  institutions.   That is just a quick review of our history, but that is the reason we  conclude our oaths in this country with the phrase ``So help me God.''  Heaven help us if we ever forget that obligation.   Inscribed on the third panel of the Jefferson Memorial right here in  Washington, D.C., just a few blocks from here, is his sobering reminder  to every single one of us as American citizens. He said this, it is  right there on the wall: ``God who gave us life gave us liberty. Can  the liberties of a nation be secure when we have removed a conviction  that these liberties are the gift of God? Indeed, I tremble for my  country when I reflect that God is just, that his justice cannot sleep  forever.''   Madam Speaker, I just want you to know and I want the American people  to know back home here on the night that should have been the State of  the Union Address, as we talk about the State of our union, I want you  to know that we are going to fight this radical rules change tomorrow  in our committee because it matters. And we will continue to raise the  alarm about the dangerous leftist agenda that is taking hold here in  this Congress.   While I am at it, I would be remiss if I did not note, Madam Speaker,  that this is not the end. The radical agenda is advancing in State  legislatures now as well.   Last week, New York's Governor signed the infamous Reproductive  Health Act, the RHA, into law. This bill's extreme provisions eliminate  protections for the unborn, endangering the health of mothers, and  eliminate New York's few remaining safeguards for developing human  life.                                time  1545    As enacted, the RHA establishes the fundamental right to abortion. It  permits nonphysicians to perform abortions; it repeals State  protections for children born during an abortion; and it eliminates all  fetal homicide provisions. The bill's broad health exception allows for  an abortion at, literally, any point in their pregnancy.   Look, this measure is unconscionable. It is disturbing. And we expect  our friends and all people of good conscience--even on the other side  of the aisle--to condemn this outrageous attack on the vulnerable.   Madam Speaker, we are forgetting our history. We have to remember why  we as Americans believe in the sanctity of human life.   I will conclude with this, by just reminding us, again, that our  Founders openly acknowledged, they broadly proclaimed what has been  called the American Creed. It is listed in the second paragraph of the  Declaration that ``we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all  men are created equal,'' and that God is the one that gives us our  rights, and our rights are unalienable. The first listed is the right  to life.   Have we thought about why the Founders said that? Because they  understood that every single person is made in the image of God. And  because every person is made in the image of God, every single person  has inestimable dignity and value. Your value is not related in any way  to where you grew up or the color of your skin or how intelligent you  may be, what your talents are, what you make for a living. Those are  irrelevant. Your value is inherent because it is given to you by your  creator.   Madam Speaker, I conclude with this: As we reflect upon the State of  the Union, the state of the Union is strong in so many ways, but we  have our challenges. Among the challenges is an assault, an aggressive  agenda to remove and erase these critical and important foundations.   So here on the People's Night, here in the people's House, we want to  remind the people of what is happening on our watch. We will stand  against these things. We will continue to defend what is best about our  American traditions, and we are honored to have that opportunity.
