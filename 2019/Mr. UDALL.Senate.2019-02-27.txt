 Mr. President, I would associate myself with the comments  of Senator Van Hollen, who I think hit the nail on the head when it  comes to this overreach by the President.   I rise in support of the growing calls for action on climate change  that are echoing in every corner of this Nation.   The science is overwhelming, the evidence is clear, and unless we  take immediate action, we will lose our planet as we know it. There is  nowhere that has more at stake than my home State of New Mexico and the  Southwest, which are in the bullseye of global warming. Unless we act  against greenhouse gas pollution, rising temperatures, drought,  wildfires, deforestation, we will permanently harm our communities.   Because I believe in climate science and because I believe we  desperately need to act, I must strongly oppose the confirmation of  Andrew Wheeler to lead our Nation's Environmental Protection Agency.  Mr. Wheeler has consistently advocated for measures that would damage  the environment, hurt public health, and do long-term injury to the  economy, and his record on climate change and the record of his  administration are simply disqualifying.   Mr. Wheeler's nomination is among the worst in a long line of  backward nominations by this President. For someone who wants to lead  the EPA--the key word being ``protection''--Mr. Wheeler's priorities  are upside down.   Let's be blunt with the American people. Mr. Wheeler was not  nominated to protect the environment and human health. He was nominated  to unravel and undo the environmental protections that are now in  place. He was nominated to stop any new environmental and public health  protections from being initiated. He was nominated to go easy on those  who violate existing environmental laws. He was nominated to stand in  the way of climate science and climate action.  [[Page S1534]]    So far, by these measures, he has been a great success for a  President who mocks climate science and who denies that this  existential threat even exists, but there is no success for the  American people. Mr. Wheeler's nomination puts the American public at  great risk, and we should firmly oppose making his appointment  permanent.   Unfortunately, Mr. Wheeler's upside-down priorities don't end at  climate change. In addition to actively resisting climate action, Mr.  Wheeler is not looking out for the health and well-being of my  constituents or protecting my State's most precious resource, our  water. There, like in so many other parts of the country, fire foam  used by the Air Force has contaminated groundwater with toxic chemicals  known as PFAS. These chemicals are linked to various cancers, heart  disease, and other ailments. Groundwater in and around Cannon Air Force  Base, near Clovis, NM, is contaminated with PFAS.   This is dairy country. One dairy is actually being put out of  business because the PFAS is in groundwater and it has contaminated  this farmer's water wells. The family that owns the dairy and its hard- working employees have drank water from these wells for years.   Will a Wheeler EPA put us in this situation? Will they help us out of  it? During his confirmation hearings, he refused to commit to setting a  drinking water standard. Then, later, we find out that he had already  decided not to set standards for these toxic chemicals in December of  last year. Under bipartisan pressure, he has since backed down and says  EPA will set a standard--someday. I wouldn't hold my breath. In the  meantime, millions of Americans and the dairies in eastern New Mexico  are being hurt.   Furthermore, Mr. Wheeler is a committed soldier in the long-running  assault on science that President Trump has championed. One of my  constituents, Celerah Hewes, wrote this week asking me to vote against  this nomination. She writes:         I grew up in Corrales, surrounded by farmland and fresh       air. I remember when the Rio Grande was full of water and the       ditches in the bosque flowed freely.        Climate change and drought have forever changed the land I       call home and my daughter will not remember a time without       severe fire danger and ozone pollution.    Celerah wants me to vote no because Mr. Wheeler ``is putting our  children's health and future at risk.''   According to the 2018 ``Fourth National Climate Assessment,'' we have  12 years to turn this around for Celerah, her daughter, and the world.  Soon, the impacts will become irreversible.   The previous EPA set rules to reduce carbon pollution from  powerplants by 32 percent by 2030. Mr. Wheeler's new plan will allow  increased emissions from fossil fuel plants instead.   He is no better when it comes to even modest standards for methane  waste from oil and gas operations. Methane is an extremely potent  greenhouse gas, 84 times more potent than carbon dioxide over the  initial 20-year period. EPA's prior methane rules would have cut back  methane pollution in a cost-effective way. Those regulations are out  the window under Mr. Wheeler and replaced with loose rules, adding  hundreds of thousands of tons of methane, volatile organic compounds,  and toxins into the air.   Climate change is the most significant threat facing our planet. The  EPA is the Agency that should be leading the charge on tackling this  threat, but Mr. Wheeler is a former lobbyist for the coal industry.  Like so many other nominations, the President has again put the fox in  charge of the henhouse. This time, the consequences could be disastrous  and irreversible for our country and our planet. If we vote to confirm  him, there will be little, if any, hope for climate action for the next  2 years.   Mr. Wheeler leaves no doubt whose side he is on. His record shows  that, under his watch, big polluters will get off scot-free.   Companies that pollute often try to reduce their cost of business and  increase their profits by dumping that pollution and its costs on  society as a whole. When environmental officials fail to enforce the  rules against polluters, bad actors get an unfair advantage. Lax  environmental enforcement is bad for American businesses that do the  right thing and bad for taxpayers, who get stuck with the cleanup  bills.   Sadly, Mr. Wheeler's EPA is the poster child for lax enforcement. In  2018, EPA collected the smallest amount of civil penalties against  polluters since 1994. Inspections are half of what they were in 2010.  EPA charged the fewest criminal defendants since 1991. It saw a steep  drop in civil judicial enforcement cases as well. The bad news goes on  and on.   So the best that can be said of Mr. Wheeler's record is that he is  not Scott Pruitt. As far as we know, he has not abused taxpayer funds  or staff for a variety of luxurious perks or rented his house from a  lobbyist. But the bar is so low that it is in the Capitol basement.   Indeed, I believe that the EPA under this President has reached an  all-time low. There is hardly even any pretense that their goal is to  safeguard the environment and public health. They are actively damaging  our environment and actively resisting action on climate change at a  time when young people and so many others across New Mexico and this  country are crying out for action. We simply must do better.   So I will vote no, and I will urge my colleagues to consider the  consequences of this nomination for their children, grandchildren, and  beyond, and to vote no as well.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
