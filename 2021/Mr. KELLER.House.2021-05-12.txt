 Mr. Speaker, service to our Nation comes in many forms,  but none is more foundational to upholding our laws and protecting our  communities than the service of America's men and women in blue.   On the surface, celebrating National Police Week means taking a  moment to thank police officers for their service.   Looking deeper, National Police Week gives each of us a chance to  reflect on the critical role that law enforcement plays in our society  and to reaffirm our commitment to their important work.   Respect for law and order is necessary to build a strong community.  Our vision forward increases funding for law enforcement to improve  education and ensure police have the tools to keep themselves and their  communities safe.                                time  1845    Now more than ever, we must stand united in our fight against  Washington Democrats' radical calls to defund our police. This rhetoric  is dangerous and has real consequences on the safety of officers  everywhere.   Tragically, more officers have been killed in 2021 than in the past 2  years combined. Every officer who puts on that uniform does so at great  risk to themselves. They run toward dangerous situations and, by their  courage, ensure the protection of those whom they serve. Many make the  ultimate sacrifice in service to their communities.   For these reasons, and so many more, our Nation owes these heroes a  debt of gratitude. This National Police Week, know that we salute  police officers, not just today but every day. We are with them, and we  are grateful for all they do to keep us safe.
