 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from the Virgin  Islands. And I always enjoy hearing from the gentlewoman from the  Chicago area, and I appreciate everything that she is doing as well.   It is interesting the President posed that question: What do you have  to lose?   What he was referencing to was the African-American community.  Instead of offering anything of substance, he just put out that very  simple question.   I have got to tell you that it is pretty evident what we have to lose  now. It is not only a lot of the gains that were made under the Obama  Administration, but something that is near and dear to all of us, and  that is health care.   I think about the district that I represent, and 40,000 people or  more have actually been covered because of the Affordable Care Act.  They will probably lose that insurance if TrumpCare were to become law.  And if you represent low-income families and workers out there, that is  a scary prospect.   It is already bad enough that the State of Texas made probably what  is considered one of the biggest policy blunders in Texas State  legislative history when they decided not to expand Medicaid, which  left so many others statewide, including in the district I represent,  again, off of the insurance rolls.   What do you have to lose?   God, there are so many ways and so many areas that I can sort of  describe what you would have to lose. The first thing I think about is,  in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, if you lose your insurance, of course,  that means that the burden is going to fall back on John Peter Smith  Hospital, which is one of our county hospitals in the north Texas area,  and Parkland Hospital in Dallas.   So instead of people having insurance that they pay into, that they  have where they can go and see a doctor, they will end up back in the  county hospital rolls and, of course, that will end up costing the  taxpayers more money.   During President Trump's first 50 days, the Republicans introduced  this legislation that, again, will just decimate the progress that so  many people around the country have seen under the Affordable Care Act.   This Thursday, as we actually mark the seventh anniversary of the  signing of the Affordable Care Act, the House is set to vote on the  Republicans' healthcare replacement. Ironically, on a day that we  should be celebrating the tremendous progress our country has made  since this landmark law's passage, we will be defending the merits in  our continued battle to fight its repeal.   So what does the Black community have to lose?   Again, we pose that question. The Congressional Budget Office--and  there is a Republican appointee that runs that office, by the way--says  that 24 million people are going to lose their healthcare insurance. Of  those 24 million who are set to be kicked off of their healthcare plan  and sent out to nowhere, African Americans are going to be hit the  hardest.   The ACA boosted the African-American insured rate from 79 percent to  88 percent, just slightly below the 91 percent national figure. Some of  those gains stem from Medicaid expansion under the ACA, where nearly 15  million of the nearly 40 million African Americans gained coverage.   That is what I was talking about a little bit earlier, Representative  Plaskett. In Texas, we did not get to benefit from that. That would  have been a huge benefit to us. Again, it is really considered one of  the biggest policy blunders in the country.   As you see, Republican governors are actually afraid right now that  the Medicaid expansion that has benefited their States that they are  going to lose out on that because of this repeal that is going to take  place. They are pushing back. They are saying this whole TrumpCare and  RyanCare plan is a hot mess and that they absolutely want nothing to do  with it.   It is also important to remember, under the Republican plan, the  decision to cut $880 billion from Medicaid over the next 10 years will  translate into millions of African Americans potentially losing health  care. While these numbers are alarming, it is the human impact that  cannot be lost on GOP colleagues.  [[Page H2229]]    I have heard directly from constituents that I serve how the ACA has  improved or saved their lives, and I would like to actually share some  of those stories with you today.   One of the constituents that I serve worked for the same company for  35 years but was forced to retire because of declining health before he  was eligible for Medicare. He faces drug costs of over $500 per day and  requires a lifesaving procedure four times a year that costs $14,000  per treatment. You can imagine what $14,000 per treatment would do, and  that is four times a year. Overall, his medical costs per month is  $15,000.   With the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, he had access to  quality care that helped ease his financial burden. Under the  Republican plan, this hardworking man, this taxpayer, this person that  has worked hard, that worked for one company for 35 years--that used to  mean so much in this country when people would give 35 years to one  company and expected to be treated right--under the Republican plan,  this hardworking man would pay thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket  medical expenses for lifesaving care that would not be covered by this  disastrous plan that we are actually going to have to take a vote on on  Thursday.   It is stories like that that I think are really sad and why we need  to tap the brakes and see what we can do to help make the current  healthcare plan that we have, the ACA, stronger and better, to help out  people like this gentleman who are going to be left out in the cold.   You have to really be wondering what our Republican colleagues are  thinking, because it is not just the constituents that I represent. It  is many of the constituents that they represent, too. I can tell you  that out in the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex, while I do represent  largely urban areas--Dallas, Fort Worth, Irving, Grand Prairie,  Arlington--I know that there are a lot of people that live out in these  rural areas, that live outside of Dallas and Fort Worth, that live  outside of Dallas County and Tarrant County. They consider themselves  conservatives, and I can tell you that they cannot afford $14,000 per  treatment; but if the Republicans pass their plan, that is what they  are going to be left with and they are not going to be able to afford  it. They are not going to get the care that they need, and that is what  they need to understand tonight and that is what the Republicans need  to understand tonight.   The only thing that they can guarantee individuals, like I just  talked about, is that they are going to be paying a whole lot more for  a lot less coverage. I think that is really a shame.   Another constituent was forced to pay $100 per month for medically  necessary birth control pills after her husband lost his job in 2010.  Luckily, the Affordable Care Act provided access to health care, and  now her birth control that she needs is covered in full. And that is  important, too.   We have actually seen teen pregnancy rates in this country drop all  over the country, which is good. Because when people can afford to  start a family when they are ready, when they are financially ready to  start a family, those kids are more likely to do better in school. They  are more likely to be in a stable household. They are more likely to  get the education that they need to be able to achieve the things they  want to achieve when they leave the house. So there are a lot of these  initiatives around the country where we have really seen teen pregnancy  rates drop 20, 30 percent or more. It has been great.   I can tell you that in Dallas County, while the teen pregnancy rate  is dropping all over the country, we have actually seen it rise at an  alarming rate.   So what does that tell me?   That tells me that if you see the teen pregnancy rate going up and  that you are going to kick all these people off their health care, that  is going to be more of a strain on the social service system.   Republicans used to pretend like they were for people to have an  opportunity to get off the system. But once you take people's birth  control away and not give them the options that they need for family  planning, you are increasing the social services. The Republican CBO  report actually points that out, and they are still going ahead with  this. So I think that that is really what is sad.   I think overall what we want to get at tonight is that the Affordable  Care Act has been a lifeline for African Americans and African-American  families. The full repeal will snatch the safety net out from under the  Black community.   Despite the lies that our colleagues across the aisle and in the  White House want to spread about the ACA, my colleagues and I will  continue to defend it to the very end because it turns out that the  Black community has a lot to lose under the Republican healthcare plan.   I am so glad that so many of our colleagues came out tonight. I am  glad that you are here helping lead this hour because we need to get  the word out. We can stop something really devastating from happening  here. The thing about it is that we really need to try to stop  something devastating from happening on a bipartisan basis, such as  people losing their health care, getting left out in the cold, being  kicked off of their health insurance; trying to figure out, if they  have a preexisting condition, how they are going to afford being pushed  back into a high-risk pool.   What is this going to do to so many Americans? We are here focusing  on the African-American community tonight with the Congressional Black  Caucus, but what is this going to do to all Americans?   It is going to hurt them. It is going to hurt their bottom line. It  is going to hurt their families. It is going to leave them in financial  disrepair. I think it is going to be a sad day for our country.   Instead of trying to destroy something, we need to be trying to work  together to try to strengthen the current system and make sure that all  Americans have the opportunity to be covered.    Absolutely, Representative Plaskett. And one of our  colleagues, who also happens to be my neighbor, Eddie Bernice Johnson,  you can easily make the argument that she knows something about health  care, considering that she worked in the healthcare arena before she  came to Congress. And not only did she work in the healthcare arena,  she has a lot of people that were uninsured that live in her district  that are now insured because of the Affordable Care Act.   So, again, not only does she have that healthcare experience, she has  been out in the community and has met with people for many years now on  health care, even before she came to the Congress, when she was in the  State Senate; so she has sat down and she has talked to people. She  understands why it is important for people to have health care. She  understands why it can be financially hard on people when they are hit  by a catastrophic illness.   She gave a speech on the House floor--or she has a speech that she is  going to submit--where she talks about the fact that the district that  she represents, the uninsured rate dropped 27.3, all the way down to  20.8 percent; and that was a huge benefit for the constituents that she  serves on a daily basis.   I mentioned Parkland Hospital a little bit earlier. Parkland Hospital  is a Dallas County public hospital. Parkland Hospital provided $1  billion in uncompensated care in 2015--$1 billion. And if this  RyanCare-TrumpCare bill were to become law, you can imagine what a  large system like Parkland, that already provides so much in  uncompensated care, what they are going to be hit with. It is going to  be absolutely devastating.   I already talked about the fact also that Texas--and Representative  Johnson mentions Medicaid in her letter. I have already talked about  the fact that Texas made a big public policy blunder and decided not to  take the money that the Federal Government was going to give them to  help expand Medicaid coverage. They just prefer to just leave all those  people uninsured.   So now one of the things that will happen under this GOP bill that  the Congresswoman points out is that the money will be sent to people  in a block grant; and you can imagine the shortfalls that that would  create, particularly in a large State like Texas, because there are  going to be shortcomings. So hospital systems like Parkland, like John  Peter Smith, they are really going to be hit with a hammer were this  ever to pass and become law just because they are already being pushed  so much.   Again, what just doesn't make any sense is that the Republicans so  prided themselves for so many years about being the party that was  about self-empowerment and helping people out, so  [[Page H2231]]  now they want to kick people off of their insurance and leave them out  in the cold and have them start going back to Parkland, start going  back to John Peter Smith because they are not going to be able to  afford their insurance anymore under this. It doesn't make any sense.    All of those are absolutely good points, and I was  talking about the uncompensated costs there for public hospitals. The  one thing that I did not mention--and everybody knows this--is that if  you don't have insurance and you do find yourself having to depend on  the county hospital system or the public hospital system in your area,  and those lines get longer and longer, which is what would happen if  this bill were repealed--people have to remember that if someone is  having an emergency and they know that the lines at the county hospital  are just out of control and long, they are going to go to the private  hospital.                                time  2015    They are going to go to the nonprofit hospital like in Dallas County  that could be Baylor, that could be Huguley, and those hospitals are  going to take on uncompensated costs. That is what is going to end up  happening. They can't get a regular appointment there without  insurance, but if they go to the hospital emergency room, they can't be  turned away. Not only is it going to be a burden on our county hospital  system, it is going to be a burden on our nonpublic providers as well.   Again, one thing to remember is that, before the Affordable Care Act,  we had over 1 million people in Dallas-Fort Worth that did not have  insurance. Just in the congressional district, alone, that I represent,  I have the largest uninsured rate out of any congressional district in  the entire country. That surprises a lot of people just because of the  growth and the opportunities that the Dallas-Fort Worth area have been  blessed with. But I actually have the largest uninsured rate out of any  congressional Member in the country.   So when you think about the district that I represent and then you  expand that across the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, you are talking  about 1 million people in a very prosperous area that still find  themselves without insurance. That is scary.   I mentioned a little bit earlier the district I represent, the  uninsured rate has gone from 37.9 percent to 31.4 percent since ACA was  implemented; 2,003 individuals in the district now have health  insurance that covers preventive services like cancer screenings and  flu shots.   When you start talking about kidney dialysis, for instance, I visited  a kidney dialysis center in Dallas County shortly after I was first  sworn in. I was taking a tour of the kidney dialysis center, and I  asked the doctor who was in charge of the center, I said: Wow, there  are a lot of younger people in here.   About 60 percent of the patients were African American. About 40  percent were Hispanic. There was one White patient that was in there.   The lady said: It doesn't matter where you go. If you go to visit any  of our clinics or any of our kidney dialysis centers, this is what a  typical day looks like.   I asked her: Is it hereditary? What is going on? I don't understand  what the problem is here.   She said: No. A lot of it is because they weren't receiving the care  that they needed.   The sad part about that, she went on to explain to me, is sometimes  it can be a person who has high blood pressure issues, and if they had  just gotten those high blood pressure issues addressed, it could have  been the difference between them taking some high blood pressure  medicine instead of them basically having to give up their careers and  go and sit in a chair to receive dialysis treatment 3, 4 days a week, 2  to 3 hours each time. That is sad.   She also talked about diabetes and how some people have diabetes, and  they don't get that diabetes treated in time. Maybe they didn't even  know they had diabetes. Again, type 2 diabetes is something very  treatable. You can imagine the difference between treating somebody,  giving them a prescription to treat their type 2 diabetes or their high  blood pressure versus your earning capacity being greatly diminished by  you having to go sit in a chair 2, 3, or more times 3 or 4 days a week  versus if they had just been able to go see a primary care physician.   That is the type of thing that the Affordable Care Act is doing,  giving people the opportunity to go and get those things treated before  they become more costly to the system. That is something that is being  missed.   The other thing that I think scares everybody--and it doesn't matter  if you, again, live in my district or you live in the one of many  districts in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, when you start talking  about people who have preexisting conditions and you start talking  about the fact that people are going to lose consumer protections that  have been put in place under the Affordable Care Act and that they are  going to see those consumer protections killed--like the prohibition on  annual and lifetime limits, protection against unfair policy  rescissions and coverage of preexisting conditions--again, if you see  the ACA repealed, it is people like that who, for the first time,  didn't have to worry about those limits, and they are going to see that  snatched away from them. That is just really one of the tragedies.   Mr. Speaker, 27,000 people in the district that I represent, again,  received financial assistance to purchase marketplace coverage in 2016.  Now they are going to risk being uninsured again, and the insurance is  going to be unaffordable under the Republican plan. There are just so  many stories like that.   One of the things that I didn't point out about some of the people  that are going to lose some of these consumer protections is that some  of those people have worked really hard on their jobs, they are still  working on their jobs, and they are going to be hit with those lifetime  limits. It is going to be completely unfair to them while they are out  there working hard every day. It was something they didn't have to  worry about before, or at least when the ACA was put in place. If the  ACA is repealed, they are going to be subject to that, too.   I think the narrative that has been put out there by the Republicans  is that, no, it is just people that are taking advantage of the system.  But understand, there are people that fall into these categories that  we are talking about right now that get up and they  [[Page H2232]]  go and work hard every day--every single day--and they have health  insurance on their jobs, and they are going to be greatly impacted by  this.   Speaking of people who go and work hard on their job every day, one  of the things that I know that a lot of Democrats would like to see put  in place--and even some Republicans have said they would like to see  put in place--is they want to see the Cadillac tax repealed. That is  not happening under this Republican plan. That is completely out of it.   So, again, there are a lot of problems with this and a lot of  unfairness about this, about the people that are going to be harmed and  affected. I hope that we can work in a bipartisan manner to really stop  this from happening. And again, like we are here talking about tonight,  the African-American community, in particular, will really be hit very,  very hard.
