 Madam President, I don't know what is up in the skies,  what is going around, flying around, being spotted, and I think there  are a lot of questions that need to be answered. If it is a threat to  the United States in any way, shape, or form, it is absolutely  unacceptable, and I think we all agree--both political parties. But  when we start giving advice to this President and the Department of  Defense in these matters, we have to stop and reflect on the manager of  my local car wash in Springfield, IL.   I went there about a week ago when the first balloon was spotted.   He said: Senator, what is going on up there?   I said: I don't know. I think China is responsible for it.   He said: What are they trying to tell us?   I said: Whatever it is, we better answer them and answer them  decisively. We don't need anybody from China or any other country  flying in our airspace and endangering Americans in the process.   Then he said to me: But what about those cowboys in Congress who want  to shoot it down wherever it is? Are they thinking about what is going  to happen if the debris from that--whatever it is--falls on a city,  hospital, school playground? They don't want to do that, do they,  Senator?   Well, I hope they don't. But I wonder, when I listen to the comments  of some people here who argue that we should have shot down that  balloon when it was going across the United States, if they reflect on  what might have been the collateral damage. We didn't know what was on  that balloon. We knew it was the size of three schoolbuses. That is not  a small operation. And whether it included anything that was dangerous  to us, radioactive or some sort of explosive, we just didn't know.   I think we did the right thing. We waited until it was off the coast,  the Atlantic Coast, still near our own territorial waters, and shot it  down, and now we are recovering what was in it.   As for the other elements, we are going to be briefed this week on  China, and I believe those questions are certainly going to be asked  and should be asked. I will be there on a bipartisan basis, as I was  last week. It is serious, and we ought to take it seriously. But the  notion that we would shoot this down over Louisville, KY, or  Springfield, IL, or Chicago--that is not responsible. I trust our  military to make that decision and to understand where the debris field  might be that would endanger people.  [[Page S335]]         Madam President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm  Cindy Chung to a Pennsylvania seat on the Third Circuit Court of  Appeals. Ms. Chung has worked in public service for two decades and is  an accomplished litigator. She received degrees from Yale University  and Columbia Law School before clerking for Judge Myron Thompson on the  U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama.   Ms. Chung began her career as a prosecutor handling public corruption  and other matters in the New York County District Attorney's Office  before joining the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, where  she prosecuted human trafficking and criminal civil rights violations,  including the first case prosecuted under the Shepard-Byrd Hate Crimes  Prevention Act. She then joined the U.S. Attorney's Office for the  Western District of Pennsylvania where, for more than 7 years, she  handled a range of criminal matters. In 2021, President Biden nominated  Ms. Chung to serve as a U.S. Attorney for the Western District of  Pennsylvania, and the Senate unanimously confirmed her to that role. As  U.S. Attorney, Ms. Chung has prioritized the prosecution of hate crimes  and violent crimes.   As a practicing attorney, Ms. Chung has appeared in both State and  Federal court and has tried 24 cases to verdict. She has significant  experience in the courtroom and was unanimously rated ``well  qualified'' by the American Bar Association. Ms. Chung has deep ties to  the Pennsylvania legal community and enjoys bipartisan support, having  received positive blue slips from her home State Senators for her  nomination in the 117th Congress, and a bipartisan vote out of  committee. When confirmed, she will make history as the first AAPI  judge on the Third Circuit.   I strongly support her nomination and urge my colleagues to do the  same.    I annnounce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr.  Heinrich), the Senator from California (Mr. Padilla), the Senator from  Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Warnock) are  necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Fetterman), the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Heinrich), and the Senator  from California (Mr. Padilla) are necessarily absent.    Madam President, I rise to speak on the confirmation of  DeAndrea Benjamin to a South Carolina seat on the Fourth Circuit Court  of Appeals.   Judge Benjamin has had a prominent career as both a litigator and as  a jurist. She received degrees from Winthrop University and the  University of South Carolina School of Law before clerking for Judge L.  Casey Manning on South Carolina's Fifth Judicial Circuit. She then  joined the South Carolina Fifth Judicial Circuit's solicitor's office  as a State prosecutor and also served as a county juvenile drug court  liaison. She later joined the South Carolina Attorney General's Office  and was named the State Violence Against Women Prosecutor. In this  role, she prosecuted cases statewide where violence was perpetrated  against women and children. Judge Benjamin entered private practice  after 3 years of public service and focused on employment law,  including workplace discrimination claims. In 2004, she became a  municipal judge for the city of Columbia, South Carolina. Seven years  later, the South Carolina General Assembly elected her to serve as a  circuit court judge in South Carolina's Fifth Judicial Circuit.   As a practicing attorney, Judge Benjamin appeared in both State and  Federal court and tried 21 cases to verdict. In her time on the bench,  she has presided over thousands of matters involving both civil and  criminal issues, including over 300 trials.   Judge Benjamin has significant experience in the courtroom and was  unanimously rated ``qualified'' by the American Bar Association. In  addition, she has deep ties to the South Carolina legal community and  enjoys bipartisan support, including from her Republican home-State  Senators.   I strongly supported her nomination and was glad to see her  confirmed.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
