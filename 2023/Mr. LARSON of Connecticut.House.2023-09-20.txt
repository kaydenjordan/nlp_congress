 Madam Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to  the mayor of Windsor, Connecticut, Don Trinks, a dear friend and person  who served in the capacity of mayor for 22 years, and a public servant  in Windsor for nearly three decades, as well.   He is a lifelong resident in what he would claim is the oldest  community in the State of Connecticut, the town of Windsor. It may be  disputed by some in Wethersfield, but that is what Don would claim, and  that is where he met his wife, Barbara, in high school. They went on to  get married, and he went on along with Barbara to be the go-to people  in the community of Windsor.   Now, he also happens to run and manage, and probably is well known  for running Bart's, which is second only to Augie & Ray's in East  Hartford as the greatest hot dog you can receive in the State of  Connecticut.   Madam Speaker, Don's commitment to the community of Windsor is  unsurpassed. In political office, Don always sought to bring people  together. He has the right temperament for public service and the  ability to bring people together, as he did time and again, and why he  was so successful at getting more than $3 million to revitalize  downtown Windsor.   I was always happy to work alongside of him. It has been his  leadership throughout his career, his temerity, especially during  difficult times and especially during COVID, where he was one of those  chief elected officials who led by example, especially for small  businesses, of which he was very much one of them. He was also a  devoted fan of Social Security, and we had an opportunity to work on  that and visit many senior centers.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to submit for the Record a tribute to Don  Trinks, the mayor of Windsor for 22 years.   I commend Congresswoman Julia Letlow who came before the Committee on  Ways and Means last week to discuss her concerns about WEP and GPO and  Social Security. I look forward to working with her. I think there is  an opportunity here, Madam Speaker, to recognize with more than 10,000  baby boomers a day becoming eligible for Social Security, with almost  70 million people who are currently receiving Social Security, and with  more than 40 percent of them Social Security being their only form of  retirement and pension, it is long overdue for the United States  Congress to act.   It has been 52 years since Congress has enhanced Social Security.  Madam Speaker, more than 5 million of our fellow Americans get below- poverty level checks from the government, and, of them, the majority  are women, because they were the care providers and were at home with  their children or caring for someone that was sick, and also because  when they were in the workforce they weren't making as much as their  male counterparts.   There is no rational reason why these people in the wealthiest Nation  in the world, who have worked all their lives  [[Page H4416]]  and paid into the system, gets below-poverty level checks, except for  the fact that the United States Congress hasn't taken any action to  correct this. It is long overdue.   With people like Julia coming in, Mr. Speaker, I know that there is a  great opportunity for us to come together and succeed and make sure  that all Americans know that Social Security is there for them.   This is not the time to talk about cutting their benefits. This is  the time to talk about extending their benefits.   Yes, it is true that people are living longer, but for every year you  raise the age of Social Security, that is a 7 percent cut. What sense  does it make if you are living longer that you receive less Social  Security money to live on? Of course, it does not.                            ____________________
