 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a community  leader and longtime friend, W. Eugene Burrell, of Fannett, Texas, who  passed away on Wednesday, December 30, 2020, at the age of 86.   Eugene was a lifelong cattle rancher, rice farmer, and civic leader  in southeast Texas. He had the respect of all who knew him. Eugene was  born on October the 27, 1934, in Beaumont, Texas, to Louise DeVillier  Burrell, and Walter Jordan Burrell.   He began farming rice at the age of 18 and worked in that role until  the age of 21, when he decided to serve his country in the United  States Army.   After serving the Army from 1955 to 1957, where he was stationed  overseas in Germany, Eugene returned home and continued rice farming,  an occupation that would last for 52 years.   Apart from growing rice, he was also a dedicated cattle rancher for  more than 70 years. Eugene served as a board member on numerous  industry and community boards, such as the American Rice, Inc., board  in Houston; American Rice Growers board in Cheek, Texas; the Coastal  Cattlemen's Association board; the Equalization Board from the  Jefferson County Appraisal District; the West Jefferson County  Municipal Water District; and the Texas Rice Festival, where he  volunteered with his wife, Sandra, who was the love of his life.   In 1999, Eugene was named the Texas Rice Festival Farmer of the Year,  and subsequently its Pioneer Farmer of the Year in 2017. His steadfast  faith was always very important to him. In fact, he served as a member  of St. Mary's Fannett Knights of Columbus organization.   In addition to ``Eugene,'' his friends and family lovingly referred  to him as ``Dad,'' ``Pawpaw,'' ``Boogie,'' and ``Fred.'' Supporting his  children, and later his grandchildren, by attending their sporting  events and various competitions over the years was always a very top  priority to him.   Eugene is survived by his loving wife of 63 years, Sandra Ray  Burrell; daughter Karen Burrell Reneau and her husband, Charlie;  daughter Kelly Burrell Alton and her husband, Randy; son, Troy Eugene  Burrell and his wife, Shelly; grandchildren Landon Reneau and his wife,  Hillary; William Reneau and his wife, Amanda; Lane Stuart; Reid Alton;  Mary Alton; Abby Alton; Cody Burrell; Cameron Burrell and his wife,  Lauren; great-grandchildren Eli Reneau, Ella Reneau, and Bryar Burrell;  and numerous nieces and nephews.   He is preceded in death by his parents, Louise and Walter Burrell;  and his brother, James Jack Burrell.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to honor my friend W. Eugene Burrell for  his very many years of faithful service to his community.   My thoughts and prayers remain with his family and friends during  this very difficult time.   May God bless his family.                            ____________________
