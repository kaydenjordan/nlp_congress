 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the further consideration of  the Senate amendment to H.R. 1892.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 727, I  call up the bill (H.R. 1892) to amend title 4, United States Code, to  provide for the flying of the flag at half-staff in the event of the  death of a first responder in the line of duty, with the Senate  amendment thereto, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, for the fifth time since last fall, I rise today to  present another continuing resolution, the House amendment to Senate  amendment to H.R. 1892, to fund the operations of the Federal  Government through March 23, fund the Department of Defense for the  rest of fiscal year 2018, and extend critical healthcare programs,  including funding for community health centers.   Our current continuing resolution expires on Thursday, and without  this legislation, large segments of the Federal Government will shut  down again. Of course, all of us are keenly aware that more time is  needed for our leaders in the House, the Senate, and the White House to  negotiate overall funding levels for the 2018 fiscal year. This bill  should allow that to happen.   Mr. Speaker, this continuing resolution also makes a very limited  number of technical changes in funding levels for only the most  essential needs, including:   To prevent delays in preparation for the 2020 Census;   To ensure that the judicial branch is able to pay jurors;   To provide $225 million in emergency funding for the Small Business  Administration to provide emergency loans to those whose lives and  livelihoods were destroyed by last year's historic natural disasters.   This legislation also includes the full fiscal year 2018 Department  of Defense Appropriations bill, totaling $659 billion for our Armed  Forces.   And I don't have to remind my colleagues that this bill has already  passed this House three times on a bipartisan basis--most recently,  last week.   Mr. Speaker, we ask a great deal of our men and women in uniform, and  we have an obligation to provide them and their families the resources  they need to be safe, to complete their missions successfully at home  and abroad. Governing from CR to CR just creates more unpredictability,  more instability, and has real-life consequences for both our troops  and civilians who support them.   Mr. Speaker, the challenges we face around the world cannot be met  under this Federal CR stop-and-go process. While we delay doing the  Nation's business, our military and economic competitors are  consolidating their gains.   Finally, I would add, this legislation includes necessary funding  extensions for bipartisan health priorities like community health  centers and other public health programs. It also funds important  Medicare extenders and includes commonsense reforms and improvements in  the program.   But let no one doubt our position on continuing resolutions. They are  bad fiscal policy. They do not allow programs to grow, to be reduced or  eliminated, if that is needed. They maintain outdated policies and stop  new, critically important programs from ever starting, including  programs that enhance national security and protect our Armed Forces  from our enemies.   Continuing resolutions are fiscally wasteful and prevent the  executive branch and Congress from planning and preparing, and this is  true for the private sector as well.   Most importantly, they undermine congressional oversight that is  constitutionally mandated for our appropriations.   While I am pleased that we are here to include the Defense  Appropriations  [[Page H889]]  bill in this continuing resolution, we must still pass all 12  appropriations bills for the 2018 fiscal year, as well as our third  emergency disaster supplemental.   As soon as congressional and White House leaders reach a bipartisan  agreement, which could and should happen at any moment, our committee  will get to work immediately to finish negotiations on all 12 year-long  funding bills.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Alabama (Mr. Aderholt), the chairman of the Subcommittee on  Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and  Related Agencies.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Carter), the chairman of the Committee on  Appropriations' Subcommittee on Homeland Security.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to  the gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady), the chairman of the Ways and  Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to  the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Smith), chairman of the Subcommittee  on Human Resources of the House Ways and Means Committee.    I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman  from Nebraska.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Barton), who is the vice chairman of the Energy and  Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), who is a member of the House Energy and  Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Carter), who is a member of the House Energy and  Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Dunn).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Tennessee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume  to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden), the chairman of the Energy  and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am in receipt of the Statement of  Administration Policy, which indicates that the administration supports  this continuing resolution and that the President's advisers would  recommend his signature on the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the Statement of Administration  Policy dated February 6, 2018.                     Statement of Administration Policy        House Amendment to H.R. 1892--Further Extension of Continuing             Appropriations Act, 2018--Rep. Frelinghuysen, R-NJ         The Administration supports the House Amendment to the       Senate Amendment to H.R. 1892, the Further Extension of       Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018. This bill funds most       Government programs at current levels through March 23, 2018,       while incorporating the text of the House-passed fiscal year       (FY) 2018 Department of Defense Appropriations Act, which       provides the resources the military needs to keep the Nation       safe. As the Administration has noted previously, the House-      passed Department of DefenseAppropriations Act is consistent       with the President's pledge to undo the looming defense       spending reductions that are harmful to America's national       security and military readiness.        The House-passed Department of Defense Appropriations Act       incorporated in the bill includes a total of $659 billion for       the Department of Defense (DOD), including $584 billion in       base spending and $75 billion for Overseas Contingency       Operations. These amounts are consistent with a total funding       level for DOD similar to that authorized by the National       Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, which was       signed into law by the President. It includes $1.2 billion       requested by the Administration to support increased troop       levels in Afghanistan, special operations forces       capabilities, and other urgent needs.        The United States military's greatest asset is the men and       women who volunteer to serve. This bill keeps faith with       service members by providing a 2.4 percent military pay       raise. It increases end strength across the military services       for active duty, reserve, and National Guard personnel, and       includes funding for training and maintenance to ensure that       United States troops are properly equipped and ready to       fight.        In addition to supporting the defense bill, the       Administration supports language in the House Amendment to       H.R. 1892 that provides for an extension of a variety of       healthcare provisions, including Community Health Centers.       The Administration is also appreciative that the bill       includes language requested by the Administration to ensure       continuity of operations for the 2020 Decennial Census       Program and the Small Business Administration's Disaster       Loans Program.        The Administration supports continuing discussions over a       two-year budget agreement that ensures funding for national       defense and other priorities. As those discussions continue,       however, it is dangerous to  [[Page H896]]       hold defense funding for the current fiscal year hostage to       arbitrary demands for lower-priority domestic programs.        If the Further Extension of Continuing Appropriations Act,       2018, were presented to the President in its current form,       his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law.     Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues in the  House to support this continuing resolution to keep the government open  for business until March 23 and to support our men and women in the  armed services who do the work of freedom each and every day.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I send to the desk a concurrent  resolution and ask unanimous consent for its immediate consideration in  the House.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the  House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow.
