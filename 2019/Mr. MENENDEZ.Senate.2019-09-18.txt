 Mr. President, I wish to express my reservations about  the nomination of John Rakolta, Jr., to be Ambassador to the United  Arab Emirates. Historically, the United States has sent career foreign  service officers to serve as ambassadors to the United Arab Emirates,  men and women well-versed in the complexities and challenges facing the  region. Mr. Rakolta would be the first political nominee to serve as  Ambassador to this critical post. The U.S. mission in the United Arab  Emirates has benefitted from experienced, trained diplomats who can  adroitly navigate our important security partnership while also  addressing some of our major policy disagreements, particularly  regarding involvement in conflicts throughout the Middle East.   In nominating Mr. Rakolta, this administration is putting a political  nominee with no diplomatic experience at the helm of one of our most  critical Middle East posts. While Mr. Rakolta possesses extensive  business experience, he lacks knowledge of the arms sales process,  security commitments, and complex diplomacy that we should demand of  our emissaries to the United Arab Emirates. This is a risky venture  that could jeopardize our effectiveness in the region. It also is part  of a concerning trend that has reduced the number of career ambassadors  serving abroad. The historically even split between political and  career nominees is becoming further skewed toward political  ambassadors.   Mr. Rakolta's nomination is also indicative of the lack of due  diligence and forthrightness demonstrated by a number of this  administration's nominees. It took months for the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee to obtain an accurate and complete picture of the  extent of Mr. Rakolta's business holdings, litigation history, and the  role he played at a questionable nonprofit, ostensibly related to  economic development.   Mr. Rakolta initially failed to include key details in the paperwork  he submitted to the committee. He did not disclose dozens of companies  that he had owned or managed, including many with an international  presence, and omitted dozens of foreign lawsuits, among other details.  More concerning, however, he did not disclose that he had served on the  board of a nonprofit that had been the subject of intense public  scrutiny, including questions about payments the board approved for its  executive director. These issues and omissions not only slowed down Mr.  Rakolta's nomination, but raised concerns about Mr. Rakolta's candor  and forthrightness with the committee.   The committee relies on nominees to be transparent and forthcoming  about relevant information to ensure that there are not actual or  potential conflicts of interest or issues that call into question a  nominee's fitness for public service. When these details are obscured,  omitted, or hard to obtain, it further erodes the confidence that a  nominee is well-qualified and committed to serve in a given position.  Mr. Rakolta's failure to provide accurate details to the committee did  not inspire confidence about his diligence or transparency. Further,  the details that the committee did obtain raise concerns about the type  of leadership that  [[Page S5571]]  he would bring to a critical U.S. embassy. Therefore, I opposed his  nomination.                            ____________________
