 Madam Speaker, I would like to report on what I did  during my time off. I spent time at the Mexican border, both in San  Diego and Yuma, and received a further shock, if that is possible, on  what I think is the most important story facing America today. Indeed,  every reporter or every major news organization ought to have somebody  making daily reports on the border.   Two weeks ago tonight, in Yuma, I saw two groups--about 80 people-- crossing the border. So you understand, those people were from  Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Cuba, Bangladesh, India, and Uzbekistan. In  other words, the whole world is coming here.   Because of the huge amount of paperwork, the average Border Patrol  agent reports to work, and unlike immediately guarding the border, like  they should, 70 percent of them are doing paperwork. At the end of  their shift, 90 percent are doing paperwork.   For that reason, it is not surprising the confiscation of drugs is  going down--not because there are less drugs coming into our country  and killing 100,000 people a year. The reason so few drugs are being  confiscated is we have a shortage of Border Patrol agents and they have  got to spend all their time doing paperwork.   Madam Speaker, I beg the rest of my colleagues to go to the border  and learn about this.                            ____________________
