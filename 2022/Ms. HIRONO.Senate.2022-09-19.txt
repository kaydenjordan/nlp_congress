 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill, the  Continued Rapid Ohia Death Response Act of 2022. This bill requires the  Secretary of the Interior to continue partnering and collaborating with  the Secretary of Agriculture and the State of Hawaii to address Rapid  Ohia Death, ROD. ROD is a fungus, Ceratocystis, that was first found in  Hawaii in 2014 and has since killed over a million native Ohia trees.  Since then, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service has  partnered with the State of Hawaii and the U.S. Department of the  Interior in efforts to detect and respond to the spread of ROD.  Sustained efforts, such as those supported by this bill, are necessary  to protect Ohia trees, which comprise 80 percent of Hawaii's native  forests.   Over the past 8 years, ROD has been detected on Hawaii Island, Kauai,  Maui, and Oahu. Efforts are currently underway to educate the public to  reduce the spread, research transmission vectors of ROD such as humans,  beetles, ungulates, and weather events, and test ROD resistant  varieties of Ohia. This bill directs the Secretary of the Interior,  acting through the U.S. Geological Survey, to continue providing  resources for the purposes of researching ROD vectors and transmission.  It also requires the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the U.S.  Fish and Wildlife Service, to work with the State of Hawaii and other  local stakeholders on ungulate management in control areas on Federal,  State, and private land. Finally, the bill requires the Secretary of  Agriculture, acting through the Chief of the U.S. Forest Service, to  continue providing resources to prevent the spread of ROD and restore  the native forests in Hawaii and to also continue to provide financial  and staff resources to the Institute of Pacific Islands Forestry, IPIF,  located in Hilo, to continue research on ROD.   The bill authorizes $5 million in appropriations for each fiscal year  from 2023 through 2033 for both the Secretaries of Agriculture and  Interior to carry out these actions, which are necessary to protect and  restore Hawaii's most abundant native tree--Ohia--for future  generations.                                  ______                                         By Ms. HIRONO:   S. 4884. A bill to require the Secretary of the Interior, in  coordination with the Secretary of Agriculture, to establish a joint  natural infrastructure science program, and for other purposes; to the  Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.    Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill, the  Natural Infrastructure Act of 2022. This bill requires the Secretary of  the Interior, in coordination with the Secretary of Agriculture, to  establish a Joint Natural Infrastructure Science Program. This program,  which would be a joint effort by the U.S. Forest Service FS and the  U.S. Geological Survey USGS, would  [[Page S4824]]  seek to further research on the use of natural solutions to address  evolving infrastructure needs across the country. The bill also  requires the Secretary of the Interior to assess the costs and  effectiveness of select natural infrastructure projects on an annual  basis.   The bill defines natural infrastructure as constructed landscape  features and systems that employ nature-based solutions that promote,  use, restore, or emulate natural ecological processes. These features,  when compared to grey infrastructure solutions, are often more cost- effective, increase community resilience to climate change impacts, and  attract community support. The American Society of Civil Engineers  estimates that our country's need for infrastructure repairs through  2025 totals over $4 trillion. In order to meet our country's short- and  long-term infrastructure needs, research is needed to inform the  decisions being made by the people charged with addressing these  infrastructure needs--civil engineers, local governments, developers,  and the construction industry. The Joint Natural Infrastructure Science  Program established by this bill directs USGS and FS to work with  colleges and universities to advance ongoing natural infrastructure  research efforts to inform future infrastructure projects. The bill  also establishes a stakeholder advisory group to inform the Secretary  of the Interior on appropriate research topics to be assessed by the  Joint Natural Infrastructure Science Program.   The bill authorizes $4 million in appropriations for each fiscal year  from 2023 through 2033 for both the Secretaries of Agriculture and  Interior to implement the Joint Natural Infrastructure Program.  Additionally, the bill requires the Secretary of the Interior to  publish an annual report on no fewer than 30 natural infrastructure  projects across the country to assess the cost and effectiveness of the  projects as well as provide recommendations on ways to improve future  natural infrastructure projects in terms of construction, costs, and  effectiveness. The selected projects should be diverse in terms of both  geographic location as well as project type. These reports, coupled  with the research generated by the Joint Natural Infrastructure Science  Program, will help inform future infrastructure projects as we seek out  cost-effective solutions all across the country that maximize human and  environmental benefits in the face of evolving challenges, including  the increasing impacts of climate change.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill, the  Continued Rapid Ohia Death Response Act of 2022.
