 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I came to the floor last week to talk  about our police officers. It was during Police Week. We talked about  the bravery and heroism of our officers back home. I talked about  tragic stories of police officers who were gunned down in the line of  duty and talked about what they do for us every day.   Today I want to talk about an issue that is endangering their lives  and the lives of so many in our communities but specifically law  enforcement. This happens in every single State represented in this  Chamber. This danger is this new epidemic of synthetic heroin, of  opioids.   We know more about heroin and prescription drugs. Now we have these  synthetic heroins coming in that are even more powerful. Being a police  officer has always been a tough job, but it is becoming riskier today  because of this. Some people have heard it as carfentanil or fentanyl  or U4. Most of this synthetic poison coming into our communities is  coming through the mail system. It is coming from overseas, primarily  from China, where they have laboratories, where some evil scientist is  mixing up this chemical mix and sending it over here into our  communities.   Let me tell you about something that happened last Friday in East  Liverpool, OH. Some of you may know the name ``East Liverpool'' because  it is the same city where there was a photograph that went viral on the  Internet of a couple who had overdosed in the front of a car, with  their 3-year-old grandson in a car seat behind them. It showed the  grandson, and it showed the two who had overdosed passed out in the  front of the car.   In this same town of East Liverpool, OH, an officer by the name of  Chris Green pulled over a car in a routine traffic stop. As he came up  to the car, he noticed there was white powder sprinkled around the car.  He took the appropriate precautions. He put on his gloves, he put on a  mask, and he began to deal with the situation at hand. The people in  the car apparently had spread the powder to try to avoid it being  detected, but it was easily detectible.   At the end of his arrest process, there was a small amount of powder  that was left on his jacket, which he did not notice. He went back to  the police station. When he got there, he noticed the powder on his  shirt and instinctively he went like this to get the powder off of his  shirt. This small amount of powder touching his hand caused him to  overdose. Officer Green is not a small guy; he is about 6 feet 3  inches, 225 pounds. He is a big, strong police officer who overdosed  just by trying to get a few flakes of powder off of his jacket. Why?  Because this fentanyl is so powerful. It is so deadly.   Fortunately, his fellow police officers were able to save his life  with naloxone. This is a miracle drug which reverses the effects of an  overdose and which is being used on our streets every single day to  save people from dying from overdoses. In this case, it was used to  keep a police officer who was doing his duty and who had simply tried  to get a few flakes of powder off of his uniform from dying of an  overdose.   East Liverpool police chief John Lane put it this way:         If he had been alone, he'd be dead. That's how dangerous       this stuff is.    Chief Lane later made the point that if Officer Green had gone home  in that shirt and unknowingly had this powder on his shirt or his  jacket, he could have endangered the lives of his family. That is a  scary thought. Obviously, that is true. That is how deadly these drugs  are.   It only takes a few milligrams, just a few specks, to kill you. This  chart will show you how much it takes. Here you see that 10 milligrams  of carfentanil is powerful enough to sedate a 15,000-pound elephant.  Here is the carfentanil over here, as shown on this chart. You will see  why a fatal dose can be a very, very small amount--30 milligrams for  heroin, 3 milligrams for fentanyl, even less than 3 milligrams for  carfentanil.   By the way, for those of you at home, if you look at a penny, you  will see Abraham Lincoln's profile on one side of it. The deadly dose  of fentanyl that we are talking about here is enough to only cover up  the face of Abraham Lincoln on a penny. That is how little we are  talking about and how deadly this stuff is. You can see why our law  enforcement officers are so concerned about this.   Officer Green is not the only one to experience this. There was a  famous case last year where two officers in Atlantic County, NJ-- Detective Dan Kallen and Detective Eric Price--overdosed on fentanyl  just by breathing fentanyl in the air at a crime scene. As some of you  have heard, fentanyl is so dangerous that they are afraid to use dogs  to try to sniff it out because just by trying to sniff these packages  to see whether fentanyl is included in them, the dogs could overdose  and die. Fentanyl is dangerous stuff.    By the way, it is taking up more and more of the resources of our  police officers and other first responders. Earlier this year, I came  to the floor and talked about Officer Ben Rhodes of Chillicothe, OH.  Last year Officer Rhodes reversed more than 50 drug overdoses. This is  one officer in one small town.   Talk to the firefighters in your community and ask them whether they  go on more fire runs or more heroin and fentanyl and carfentanil  overdose runs. I almost guarantee you they will say they go on more  overdose runs. As a result, in some communities, those firefighters are  not there to be able to protect us as you would typically think from  the fires that still continue to be a major problem. So this is a real  issue. It is taking up more and more of their time and more resources  and causing more and more crime.   On Thursday, in Middletown, OH, which is a town in Southern Ohio, a  family was getting ready to leave the house. In fact, they had already  strapped their 3-month-old baby into a car seat. It is not clear  whether they had shot up with heroin before they put the baby in the  car seat or after, but they went back into the house and they overdosed  in the house. They had the baby in the car seat in the car. They  overdosed in the home.   They have another son who is 5 years old. He ran out of the house  barefoot. He went to a neighbor's house, to his stepfather's home,  which is a few blocks away, and yelled at the door: Mom and dad are  dead. Mom and dad are dead.   The grandfather called the police, and they rushed to the scene. They  were able to revive the boy's dad with naloxone. They used seven doses  of naloxone on the mother, but she still couldn't wake up. From talking  to police officers about this, they tell me that there is a very good  sign this involved fentanyl, perhaps carfentanil, because after two,  three, four, five, six, seven doses of naxolone, she still could not be  revived. Fortunately, the police rushed her to the hospital, where they  were finally able to bring her back.   Again, this is what police officers are facing every day in my home  State of Ohio, in your State, in your community.   After this incident, the Middletown Police said on Facebook:         It has to stop. Please get help before it's too late. Not       only to save yourself, but to save your kids. Give these kids       a chance by getting help. If you or someone you love has a       drug problem, please seek help right now.    This is a cry from our police officers saying that this can't  continue.   Talk to the firefighters and police officers who have administered  naloxone to the same individual time and time again, overdose after  overdose. These brave officers and police officers around the country  are feeling overwhelmed.   Drug overdoses are now the No. 1 cause of accidental death in the  United States of America. It has now surpassed car accidents. It has  way surpassed gun violence. In the last 3 years, more Americans have  died of drug overdoses than died in the Vietnam war. More Americans are  dying of drug overdoses now than died of AIDS at the peak of the AIDS  epidemic in 1995. This year, 2017, more people will die from overdoses  from opioids than died from AIDS at the peak in 1995--another tragedy.  According to an article in the New  [[Page S3057]]  York Times, more than four times as many people are dying every day  from this epidemic than were dying of drug overdoses at the peak of the  crack cocaine epidemic. When I say it is the worst drug crisis we have  faced in this country and that it is an epidemic, that is not  overstating it.   The Fraternal Order of Police and the Major County Sheriffs of  America are actually focused on this issue, and they want better tools  to be able to at least try to stop some of this poison--the fentanyl  and the carfentanil--from coming into our communities.   I mentioned earlier the fact that this actually comes by the mail  system. Unbelievable. It doesn't come by all mail systems. It comes  through the U.S. mail system, as opposed to the private carriers, such  as FedEx, UPS, DHL, or others. One reason is because our mail system in  the United States does not require the kind of advanced notice of where  the package is from, what is in it, and where it is going that the  private carriers require. So where do the traffickers go? They go to  our mail service, the U.S. Postal Service, and the postal service in  the country that interacts with and connects with our postal service.   This is why the Fraternal Order of Police, the Major County Sheriffs  of America, and other law enforcement are saying: Help us by passing  legislation called the STOP Act. The STOP Act is to help stop  traffickers from bringing these deadly poisons into our communities,  the kind of stuff that caused Officer Green to overdose.   Fentanyl and these other synthetic drugs are not just coming in from  overseas; they are coming in through our mail system. What we are  saying in the STOP Act is, let's close the loophole. Let's say that the  mail system in the United States has to say the same thing that other  private carriers say, which is, if you want to ship something through  our system, that is fine, but you have to tell us what is in it. You  have to tell us where it is from and where it is going. Otherwise, they  can't effectively stop these packages. It is like finding a needle in a  haystack.   I talked earlier about the difficulty of detecting it and how  poisonous it is, and sniffing dogs can't be used because of the  potential of them overdosing and dying. It is also very difficult for  our officers to find these packages without some information. Expert  testimony, including that from the Secretary of Homeland Security,  General Kelly, from Customs and Border Protection, and from the folks  at DEA all reach the same conclusion, which is that this policy change  would make it easier for law enforcement to detect suspicious packages  of fentanyl, carfentanil, and other synthetic drugs and help keep this  poison out of our country.   Support for this legislation is bipartisan, and it is growing. We now  have 16 cosponsors in the Senate--8 Democrats and 8 Republicans.  Completely bipartisan. In the House, Congressman Pat Tiberi of Ohio and  Richard Neal of Massachusetts--a Republican and a Democrat--have  introduced bipartisan companion legislation. They now have 128  cosponsors. Support is building. It is an obvious way to help push  back. Is it the silver bullet? No. There is not one silver bullet. We  need to do more in terms of prevention, treatment, and recovery, and  help our law enforcement more to make sure they have naloxone to be  able to save lives.   At least, let's stop some of this poison from coming in, and let's at  least increase the cost of the fentanyl because one reason you see this  big increase in overdoses from fentanyl and carfentanil and traffickers  using more of it is because of the cost. At the very least, by helping  our law enforcement, giving them the tools they need, we can stop some  of it and increase the cost on the street.    I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the STOP Act. We have a  hearing on this legislation on Thursday of this week in the Permanent  Subcommittee on Investigations. We have experts coming in--law  enforcement officers who care a lot about their colleagues. They talk  about what a danger this is to them, what a danger this is to our  communities. It is time for us in the U.S. Senate to stand up and take  this important step, not the silver bullet but the important step to be  able to help save lives and make our communities safer.   Thank you, Madam President.    Absolutely.    I thank my colleague from Florida. He has been a  stalwart on this issue. We have never made this a partisan issue, have  we. We always kept this a bipartisan issue because this is a danger to  our country, our communities--all Americans. The Senator is absolutely  right. It is 30 to 50 times more powerful than heroin. A flew flakes  can kill you, as you see here.   It is absolutely necessary we figure out a way together, as  Republicans and Democrats. With the recovery efforts the Senator  supported and the Cures Act he already supported, this is the next  logical step to deal with the new threat, which is this synthetic  heroin coming to our country.   I thank my colleague from Florida.   I yield back.
