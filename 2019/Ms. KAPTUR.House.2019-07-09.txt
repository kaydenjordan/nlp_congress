 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to condemn President Trump, his  administration, and all the anti-life Republicans in Congress who seek  to strike down the Affordable Care Act using the judicial system this  time. Their callousness would cut off millions of Americans from their  affordable healthcare plans.   Today, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit began hearing  oral arguments in Texas v. United States, a case supported by the Trump  administration that would strike down every health benefit afforded to  the American people under the Affordable Care Act.   If Republicans strike down the Affordable Care Act, then the  protections for 130 million Americans with preexisting conditions, more  than a third of our people, would be erased, including nearly 5 million  Ohioans. The uninsured rate would go up by 65 percent. The Affordable  Care Act's historic Medicaid expansion, which covers 17 million people,  would go out the window. And protections for women that prevent  insurance companies from charging them higher rates than men would  disappear, as well.   These popular and lifesaving provisions would be repealed.   Mr. Speaker, since its inception, the Affordable Care Act has  provided quality coverage for more than 16 million Americans. Let's  ensure that high-quality healthcare remains a right for all, not a  privilege for just a few.                            ____________________
