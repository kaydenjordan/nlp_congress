 Mr. Speaker, many Members here, including myself, have  traveled to Afghanistan for years to express our gratitude to our  heroic men and women in uniform serving there. We remain in awe of  their patriotism and courage.   And just as awe-inspiring are their partners on the ground: the local  Afghan interpreters, drivers, embassy staff, contractors, security  personnel and others who have worked shoulder-to-shoulder with the  American military and our diplomatic personnel.   These Afghan partners have been vital to the safety of American lives  and to the success of our mission. They accepted an extraordinary risk  to their lives and families, with the understanding that we would stand  by them.   And now, they are under attack--facing the threat of deadly  retribution from the Taliban.   Today, with the ALLIES Act, the U.S. Congress is honoring our  promises to these brave heroes: to respect their service and to not  leave them behind.   Thank you to Congressman Jason Crow--a former Army Ranger who served  our Nation in Afghanistan and Iraq.   He, with Congressman Seth Moulton and the entire bipartisan  ``Honoring our Promises'' Working Group, has been firm, principled and  relentless in fighting for this legislation and other action to protect  our ``Afghan allies.''   Earlier this summer, with their leadership, the House proudly passed  the HOPE for Afghan SIVS Act, which took the first step in that  mission.   This group has also been instrumental in coordinating Congress's  response with the Biden-Harris Administration.   As President Biden has said, ``Those who helped us are not going to  be left behind.'' And with his action this week, evacuating Afghan  partners to Fort Lee as they await final processing, that promise is  being honored.   The Averting Loss of Life and Injury by Expediting SIVs Act will fix  the Afghan Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) process, created over a decade  ago to provide safety for Afghan interpreters, contractors, security  personnel and others who worked with the United States.   Sadly and unconscionably, the SIV process has long been plagued by  severe delays and backlogs, leaving many applicants waiting years for  their visas--and hundreds have been killed before receiving approval.   Currently, there are many thousands of applicants in the pipeline,  not including their spouses and children. This delay is not only  demoralizing--it is deadly, because of the imminent danger posed by  Taliban.  [[Page H3817]]    The ALLIES Act builds on the HOPE for Afghan SIVs Act, as it  increases the Afghan SIV cap, streamlines the application process and  strengthens protections for surviving spouses and children, among other  important steps.   And it does this without compromising the strict background check and  national security vetting procedures or other processes to confirm  eligibility.   The threat facing our ``Afghan allies,'' as the national security and  defense community calls them, cannot be overstated.   According to the nonprofit organization No One Left Behind, more than  300 translators and their family members have been killed since 2014.  Many died while waiting for their visas to be processed.   Over 90 percent of the hundreds of Afghan partners report having  received at least one death threat because of their work with  Americans.   One Afghan partner, who has been waiting six years for a visa  decision, worries, ``If the Taliban take over, they'll easily find me  and kill me. Then my wife will have no husband and my daughter will  have no father.''   Another says, ``I get phone calls from the Taliban saying, `We will  kill you.' They know who I am and that I worked for the Americans. If  they find me, they'll torture me and then kill me. It's better if I  just kill myself first.''   These courageous allies cannot wait a day longer.   As the United States prepares for and executes the strategic and  important withdrawal from Afghanistan, we must do so in a way that  protects those who protected us.   With that, I urge a strong and bipartisan vote for our ``Afghan  allies.''    =========================== NOTE ===========================        July 22, 2021, on pages H3816-H3817, the statement by Ms. Pelosi  was inadvertently placed just before Roll No. 218.      The online version has been corrected to read: . . . and I yield  back the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, many Members  . . . -- vote for our ``Afghan allies.''  Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Calvert for calling this Special  Order in honor of our former colleague, Jerry Lewis.   As fellow Californians, we were his friends and know what a loss it  is to us that he is now looking down on us. Maybe that is what is  needed. That is the plus.   Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues from California--again, thanking  Mr. Calvert--to honor a fierce and fearless champion of the Golden  State, our late cherished colleague, Congressman Jerry Lewis.   Jerry Lewis lived a life dedicated to California, from serving on the  San Bernardino City School Board to his decade in the California  Assembly to his 34 years representing Inland Empire communities in the  U.S. Congress.   It was when he was in the assembly that I got to know him over 40  years ago. I was the chair of the Northern California Democratic Party,  and he was on the committee of jurisdiction that was viewing  legislation of concern to voter participation in our State.   He always had that smile. He was always very inviting of ideas, very  welcoming. I was brand new in the political arena, had hardly been  involved in California politics, and so his warm welcome then is  something I always remember. When we served together in Congress, we  both remembered it well. Jerry and I were friends, again, for a long  time.   Then, in Congress, we served on the Appropriations Committee, where  he took great pride in being chair of the full committee. How could it  be that he was the first chair of the committee from California? He  described it as a milestone beyond his wildest dreams.   Mr. Aguilar, who is here for bipartisan remembrances of Jerry, is  part of the Appropriations Committee, and we had our own culture and  bipartisanship there over the years.   Jerry took great pride in running the committee because he knew of  its power to make a difference in the lives of the people he  represented. It was always important to him to reach across the aisle  because, in his words: ``The more we can talk to each other as  individuals and human beings, the better off the institution is going  to be and the more responsive it is going to be.''   When we look around California, we see Jerry's legacy. We see it in  the cancer research center he established at Loma Linda University  Medical Center; in San Bernardino National Forest, which he helped to  protect; and the Lewis Center for Educational Research, exploring the  night sky. We see his monument in so many tributes that bear his name  throughout his community, from Redlands to Riverside, Highland to  Hesperia.   It is fitting that Californians were able to say good-bye to Jerry at  the University of Redlands Chapel, in the community he so loved.   Jerry's unique voice, core values, and belief in the promise of  America have made a difference for California and, indeed, for our  country.   May it be a comfort to Jerry's wife, Arlene; their children, Jenifer,  Jerry Jr., Jeff, and Dan; their grandchildren and great-grandchildren;  Jerry's brothers, Ray and John; and all of their loved ones, that so  many people mourn with and pray for them at this sad time.   We will always remember Jerry as a great American and a great  Californian.
