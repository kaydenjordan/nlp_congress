 Madam Speaker, with respect to the vote on H.R.  5377, I was unavoidably delayed. I was in the Speaker's lobby at the  time of the vote, and when I entered the Chamber, the vote had  concluded.   Had I been on the floor, Madam Speaker, I would have voted ``aye.''                            ____________________
