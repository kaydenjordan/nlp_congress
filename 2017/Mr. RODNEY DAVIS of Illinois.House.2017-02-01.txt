 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this  resolution providing for a congressional disapproval of the stream  buffer rule.   In my home State of Illinois, coal production employs roughly 5,000  workers and the industry contributes $2 billion a year to our State's  economy. In southern Illinois, these are some of the region's best- paying jobs.   Unfortunately, this rule was one of the final shots the Obama  administration fired in their war on coal. Unless reversed, this rule  is directly going to hurt our Illinois coal miners and those working at  coal power plants and, in the end, consumers--those who pay the utility  bills in this country.   The last administration refused to work in good faith with the States  when finalizing the rule, even after Congress told them to do so in the  2015 omnibus bill.   I include in the Record a letter from the Illinois Department of  Natural Resources in opposition to the rule.                                              Illinois Department of                                               Natural Resources,                                  Springfield, IL, January 30, 2017.      Re The Stream Protection Rule and The Congressional Review           Act.       Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Majority Leader McConnell: As the       regulatory authority for administering the federal Surface       Mining Control and Reclamation Act (``SMCRA'') in the State       of Illinois, the Department of Natural Resources       (``Department'') appeals Congress to use its power under the       Congressional Review Act to disapprove the ``Stream       Protection Rule'' (``Rule''), issued by the Office of Surface       Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (``OSM'') at 81 Fed. Reg.       93066 (Dec. 20, 2016).        The Rule's ``one size fits all'' approach to regulatory       performance standards fails to incorporate important regional       differences, such as local geology, hydrologic regime, and       climate, as required under SMCRA. For example, stream loss       has rarely been a problem in the State of Illinois given the       regional hydrogeology of the Illinois Basin. To universally       require long term upstream and downstream monitoring would       place an undue burden on the State to continually review such       data. The rule gives no discretion to state regulatory       authorities.        Despite the claims of OSM in its Regulatory Impact       Analysis, the Rule would place significant burdens and       additional costs on state regulatory programs. Compliance       with the rule would require the Department to revise and       restructure its entire coal mining program and add $600,000       to $800,000 per year in staffing and equipment costs.        OSM's failure to properly consult with the State of       Illinois and the other states has resulted in a burdensome       and unlawful Rule that usurps states' authority as primary       regulators of coal mining as intended by Congress under       SMCRA, and demands congressional action.        The Congressional Review Act provides Congress the       authority to take action to avoid the harm imposed by the       Rule. Accordingly, we respectfully request that you and your       colleagues in the Congress pass a joint resolution       disapproving the Final Stream Protection Rule under the       procedures of the Congressional Review Act, S U.S.C. 801 et       seq., so that it shall have no continuing force or effect.        Thank you for your careful consideration of this request.            Sincerely,                                                Wayne A. Rosenthal,                         Director, Department of Natural Resources.     In this letter, IDNR notes that the  Office of Surface Mining failed to properly consult with the State of  Illinois and the other States, resulting in a burdensome and unlawful  rule that usurps States' authority as primary regulators of coal mining  as intended by Congress and demands congressional action.   Mr. Speaker, rules like this are what the CRA is all about. I ask for  your support.
