 Mr. President, I would like to thank the ranking member  of the Agriculture Committee for joining us here on the floor today. I  appreciate her great bipartisan work on the Agriculture Committee.   I am pleased to be a member of that committee. It is truly one of  those committees where we set aside any political differences. We  actually work for the good of our Agricultural Committee, our ranchers,  and our farmers, regardless of the State they come from. We truly do  work together to feed and fuel a nation.   Thank you very much for joining us today, I say to the ranking  member.   I wish to thank my senior Senator from Iowa, as well.   I am rising today to join my colleague Senator Chuck Grassley and  others who have joined us on the floor to support the nomination of  Bill Northey as Under Secretary for Farm Production and Conservation at  the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or the USDA.   I have known Bill Northey for nearly a decade and, to be honest,  probably a little more than a decade. He is a great friend. He is a  great Iowan. Most importantly, he is a tenacious advocate and a true  voice for agriculture and our rural communities. He has worked in  agricultural policy at nearly every level of government.   At a time when we need to tackle many critical agricultural  priorities, including the farm bill, which the ranking member just  mentioned--that farm bill was last authorized 2 years ago, in late  2014--at a time when the President is rightly focusing on economic  development and strengthening rural America, and at a time when our  government is focused on streamlining and reducing the burdens of  environmental regulations, we must have leadership in this position--as  I mentioned, the Under Secretary for Farm Production and Conservation  at USDA. We must have leadership there that truly gets the real  underlying concerns and priorities of America's farmers and ranchers.  We need them addressed. Bill Northey is exactly the person to do that.   When I think about the importance of getting someone like Bill  Northey in this position, I reflect on the young farmer who is looking  to begin a farming operation in rural Iowa to feed his or her family,  grow a business, and cultivate a legacy in their own community, all  while low commodity prices have pinched margins and extreme weather has  decimated our crops. That young farmer needs Washington to get out of  the way and give them an opportunity to thrive.   Bill Northey is the right guy to work these issues. He knows his role  in Washington will not be to empower a faceless bureaucracy but to make  Washington work for its people and give the agriculture industry the  tools it needs to prosper. Bill Northey is that average, everyday Iowan  who cares about agriculture and its future.   Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Roberts and Ranking Member  Stabenow have made it abundantly clear that they have no objection to  Mr. Northey, as both indicated in a joint statement that said in part:  ``Bill Northey is a qualified and respected public servant who knows  agriculture firsthand, and he will serve rural America well at USDA.''   The ranking member joined us earlier, and she went a step further by  saying to Bill:         I know that you are a farmer. You understand these       challenges, and know that our farmers need leaders that will       speak up for them when their voices are not being heard.    He was voted out of the Ag Committee unanimously. Let me state that  again. He was voted out of the Ag Committee unanimously. If you didn't  hear that, let me say it a third time. He was voted out of the Ag  Committee unanimously.   Democrats and Republicans believe that Bill Northey is a leader, and  he is being held hostage over an unrelated issue. Bill Northey's  nomination has become entangled in an unrelated policy dispute. I am  very disappointed. Bill Northey is an upstanding man, someone we  desperately need to serve in our government. We truly want to drain the  swamp. Bill Northey is exactly who we need. He is that everyday  American fighting for agriculture. We need him desperately. We may not  be able to have him serve in our government because this policy dispute  has led to a hold on his nomination.   Bill Northey is extremely qualified. He has the experience and the  reputation. Most importantly, he has the voice and the heart for  American agriculture. I am asking for a quick vote and confirmation of  this well-respected, beloved Iowan so that we can get him in place and  work on matters that truly are important not just to Iowans and the  Midwest but to all of America.   Let's free Bill. Let's free Bill, folks. Let's confirm Bill Northey.   Thank you, Mr. President.
