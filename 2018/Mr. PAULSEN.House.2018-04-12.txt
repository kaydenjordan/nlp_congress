 Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize an important new law,  the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, or  FOSTA. This landmark anti-trafficking legislation that I helped  coauthor was just signed into law by the President this week, and it  ushers in a new era of combating the online exploitation of trafficking  victims.   Last month, half a dozen Minnesota men were rolled up in an online  underage trafficking sting. They had met what they believed were young  girls advertised for sex on backpage.com, one of the worst offenders  when it comes to exploiting trafficking victims. But when each of them  showed up to the designated meeting spot, instead of finding teenage  girls, they found law enforcement waiting for them.   Sadly, there are more who are able to buy sex on websites like  Backpage, but the new law will help us put a stop to  [[Page H3196]]  that. Now it ensures that websites that facilitate sex trafficking will  be held liable and held accountable for their actions.   Backpage.com has now been taken over by Federal authorities. It isn't  the only such site in existence, but it is a sign that their ability to  profit from trafficking without consequence has come to an end.                            ____________________
