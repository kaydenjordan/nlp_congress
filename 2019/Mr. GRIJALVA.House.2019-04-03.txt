 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, as we have heard over and over today, and  justifiably so, the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act  is critical for women across this country. This bill will ensure the  safety of women, especially Native American women.   My amendment will expand the definition of domestic violence to  include violence against or witnessed by a  [[Page H3038]]  child or elder, as defined by Tribal law. This important amendment will  allow Tribes to ensure that perpetrators acting violently toward or  near children or elders receive consequences for their actions.   The Tulalip Tribe is one of the first Tribes to implement the Special  Domestic Violence Criminal Jurisdiction from the 2013 Violence Against  Women Act reauthorization. They immediately experienced the  implications of not having this protection for children and elders in  their jurisdiction.   Of the 30 cases they received in Tribal court, 20 involved children  and/or elders. Although the violence impacted the child or the elder,  the Tribal court was not able to prosecute. When the jurisdiction moved  to the State, it did not prosecute the remaining 20 cases in State  court. Justice was not served for the children and/or the elders  experiencing violence.   In 2010, the Attorney General's report on American Indian and Alaska  Native children exposed to violence included the recommendation that  Congress should restore the inherent authority of American Indian and  Alaska Native Tribes to assert jurisdiction over persons who commit  crimes against American Indian and Alaska Native children.   This amendment is a step toward guaranteeing that Congress keeps  American Indian and Alaska Native children and elders safe. By passing  this amendment, Congress will restore the inherent authority for the  Tulalip Tribe and others to fully secure the safety of Tribal children  and elders throughout Indian Country.   I urge my colleagues to protect Native children and elders by  supporting this amendment.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have no other speakers, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment  be modified in the form that I have placed at the desk.    Madam Chair, the underlying bill will provide a  historic extension of Tribal jurisdiction and ensure that more Native  people receive the proper legal protections against people who commit  violence toward them.   Unfortunately, during the historic passage of the 2013 Violence  Against Women reauthorization, the Saginaw Chippewa Tribe quickly  realized the cost of implementing this important provision was pricey.  Cost concerns about implementing Tribal jurisdiction are generally  related to incarceration, healthcare, and jury selection.   Further, a National Congress of American Indians report found that  there are multiple implementation costs related to incarceration,  healthcare, code development, law enforcement, and prosecutors. This  hinders some Tribes from implementing the most important provisions  related to the Violence Against Women Act.   Unlike States, Tribes do not have the ability to tax for the costs  related to implementing these important provisions that protect its  people.   With the support of Representative Kildee, who represents the area of  the Saginaw Chippewa Tribe, the amendment I am offering will help  alleviate the costs Tribes will incur due to the expanded criminal  jurisdiction provision.   This amendment would authorize the Department of Justice to reimburse  Tribes that incur costs related to arrest, indigent defense services,  and rehabilitation services.   Further, this amendment provides language allowing DOJ to award  grants to improve their law enforcement, detention and correctional  facilities, culturally appropriate services, and criminal code  development.   I urge my colleagues to protect Indian Country from violence and  support this amendment that will ease the costs incurred by Tribes for  implementing this historic bill.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have no other speakers. I yield back the  balance of my time.                                time  1630
