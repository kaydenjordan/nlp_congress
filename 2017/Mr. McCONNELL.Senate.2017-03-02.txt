 Mr. President, I wish to start by taking a moment to  recognize our distinguished colleague who just marked an impressive  milestone in the history of the Senate. Last week, the senior Senator  from Mississippi became the 10th longest serving Senator in U.S.  history. With over 38 years of service in this body, Senator Thad  Cochran has proved himself to be a leader and a statesman.   When the Magnolia State sent Senator Cochran to the Senate, it was  the first time a Republican had won a statewide election in Mississippi  in over a century. When he decided to run, Senator Cochran didn't  falter in the face of long odds. He campaigned hard, and he won.  Because of his passionate and dedicated service, the people of  Mississippi have sent him back time and again.   Senator Cochran has come a long way from his first job as a carhop at  Gunn's Dairy Barn near Jackson, MS. Now, he proudly serves the people  of his State and helps craft legislation for the entire Nation.   Here in the Senate, we have all had the opportunity to work with  Senator Cochran. Whether on agricultural issues, responding to national  disasters, or negotiating appropriations bills, Senator Cochran has  played a crucial role on many pieces of legislation. As the chairman of  the Appropriations Committee, he has done important work as well.   I know that colleagues on both sides can agree that working with him  is always an enjoyable experience. Senator Cochran has accomplished a  great deal during his years in the Senate. With a conservative  philosophy and an affable personality that endears him to both sides of  the aisle, Senator Cochran has made an important impact.   A few years ago, Senator Cochran reached another important milestone  when he cast vote No. 12,000 here in the Senate. At that time, I  mentioned that Time Magazine included him on the list of America's  ``Top 10 Senators.'' They named him ``The Quiet Persuader.'' We all  know that Washington is filled with loud voices, but Senator Cochran's  manner has served our friend and this institution very, very well.   I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Senator Cochran, his  wife Kay, and his entire family on this notable occasion.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter entirely, I  appreciated the opportunity to visit with the President yesterday after  his impressive speech before Congress. We had a positive discussion  about the upcoming legislative agenda. One important item we discussed  was the way forward on repealing and replacing ObamaCare.   Just yesterday, our Members came together for a productive discussion  on the next steps toward protecting American families from the broken  promises of ObamaCare. Here in Congress, we remain committed to working  with the administration to repeal and replace this failed law.   President Trump, in his address to Congress, reaffirmed his own  commitment as well. He provided important direction on what the path  forward should look like as we transition away from ObamaCare toward  truly patient-centered care.   Now, look, we know this transition isn't going to be easy. Providing  relief from the disaster of ObamaCare is going to be a challenge.  However, the status quo is simply not sustainable. The American people  need help, and they need it right now.   That is why we started the process of repealing and replacing this  partisan law at the beginning of the year, and it is why we will keep  working to make  [[Page S1546]]  this right for American families. It is what the people who sent us  here have called for, and it remains among our top priorities here in  the Senate.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on yet another matter, the Senate has  been working to put the President's Cabinet in place with several  important agencies that serve the American people. I am pleased to  share that, by the end of the week, we will have confirmed even more  nominees, including Representative Zinke, whom we approved yesterday,  as well as Dr. Ben Carson and Gov. Rick Perry. Both Carson and Perry  received bipartisan support in committee, and I expect to see the same  when the Senate votes to confirm them. Once we do, Dr. Carson can begin  bringing much needed reforms to the Department of Housing and Urban  Development, while Governor Perry can begin leading on smarter policies  at the Energy Department.   I also look forward to confirming another important nomination before  the Senate. Judge Neil Gorsuch continues to earn praise from both sides  of the aisle, including many on the political left. President Obama's  legal mentor calls Gorsuch ``brilliant.''   His former Solicitor General praises Gorsuch for his ``fairness.''   Alan Dershowitz says Gorsuch is ``highly credentialed'' and ``hard to  oppose on the merits.''   Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg recently had praise for the judge, too,  complimenting his collegiality and excellent writing abilities.   Judge Gorsuch has received wide support in his local community as  well, with more than 200 Colorado lawyers from across the political  spectrum voicing their support for his nomination. Here is what they  said in a letter to Colorado's Senators just last week. They wrote:         We know Judge Gorsuch to be a person of utmost character.       He is fair, decent, and honest, both as a judge and a person.       His record shows that he believes strongly in the       independence of the judiciary. Judge Gorsuch has a well-      earned reputation as an excellent jurist. He voted with the       majority in 98 percent of the cases he heard on the Tenth       Circuit, a great portion of which were joined by judges       appointed by Democratic presidents.        We all agree that Judge Gorsuch is exceptionally well-      qualified to join the Supreme Court. He deserves an up or       down vote.    That is from 200 Colorado lawyers.   It is praise that has been reiterated by other Coloradans as well.  Here is how the Colorado Springs Gazette put it this week in an  editorial supporting the nomination. The paper said:         To vote against Judge Gorsuch would favor . . . party over       someone who clearly ranks among the top-qualified nominees in       the court's history.    The considerable praise we have heard regarding Judge Gorsuch is not  surprising when we consider the reputation he has earned across his  State, in the Federal judiciary, and among those who have worked with  him through the years. That includes Judge John Kane, a senior district  court judge in Colorado appointed by President Carter. He also shared  his view this week on what type of jurist Judge Gorsuch has been, and  will continue to be, if confirmed to the Supreme Court. Here is what he  had to say. This is a Carter appointee:         [Judge Gorsuch's] opinions, concurrences and dissents are       clear, cogent and mercifully to the point. I have been       affirmed and reversed by him and in each instance I thought       he was right and fair.    Let me repeat what Judge Kane, a Carter appointee, said:         I have been affirmed and reversed by him and in each       instance I thought he was right and fair.    Judge Kane added that Judge Gorsuch's ``writings indicate a strong  respect for tradition and precedent'' and, he said, ``I don't find his  decisions reflecting any sort of ideological bias.''   ``I am very comfortable with this nomination,'' Judge Kane concluded,  and ``I'm not sure we could expect better, or that better presently  exists.''   Let me say that again. This is a Carter appointee to Federal courts.  He said: ``I'm not sure we could expect better, or that better  presently exists.''   In other words, no one is better.   It is high acclaim from someone who not only has professional  experience with the nominee before us but also someone who, as a judge  himself, has a clear-eyed understanding of the standards a jurist must  uphold.   In the coming days, we can expect to see more examples of bipartisan  support for Judge Gorsuch. He is an outstanding nominee. He is both  well qualified and well respected, and he deserves fair consideration  and an up-or-down vote.    Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote on the  nomination, and I move to table the motion to reconsider.    Mr. President, I yield back the time.    Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote on the  nomination, and I move to table the motion to reconsider.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to H.J. Res. 37 and  ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 79, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 80, submitted earlier  today.    I further ask unanimous consent that the resolution be  agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 2 p.m., Monday,  March 6; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be  deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day,  and morning business be closed; further, that following leader remarks,  the Senate resume consideration of H.J. Res. 37; further, that the time  until 6 p.m. be equally divided in the usual form; finally, that all  debate time on H.J. Res. 37 expire at 6 p.m. Monday.    If there is no further business to come before the  Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned under the  previous  [[Page S1586]]  order, following the remarks of Senator Klobuchar.
