 Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  American Bar Association supporting passage of the Paycheck Fairness  Act.                                       American Bar Association,                                                     April 13, 2021.      Re ABA Urges Passage of the Paycheck Fairness Act.         Dear Representative: On behalf of the American Bar       Association (ABA), the largest voluntary association of       lawyers and legal professionals in the world. I am writing to       urge you to vote for passage of the Paycheck Fairness Act,       which would update the Equal Pay Act of 1963 enacted by       Congress almost 60 years ago to prohibit gender-based pay       inequality. This legislation, which is expected to come to       the floor this week, has the support of working men and women       across the country who want this nation to live up to its       expressed commitment to equal pay for equal work.        The Equal Pay Act of 1963 prohibits an employer from paying       unequal wages to male and female workers who perform jobs       under similar work conditions that require substantially       equal skill, effort, and responsibility unless there is a       legitimate reason for a pay differential.        The Paycheck Fairness Act does not alter the basic scheme       of this statute or impose unreasonable burdens on employers;       indeed, the majority of its proposed changes are borrowed       from other civil rights statutes that have proved more       effective in eradicating workplace discrimination.        We would like to respond to some persistent misperceptions       regarding this important legislation:        Enactment of this bill will not compel businesses to pay       their female workforce substantially more money to eliminate       the existing wage gap. The purpose of this bill is to update       the Equal Pay Act, which only applies in situations where       women or men are receiving unequal pay for equal work. It       does not create a new mandate. Employers already have a legal       obligation to pay men and women equal wages for equal work       unless there is a legitimate reason for the differential.        Enactment of this bill will not interject the government       into the pay decisions of businesses. The Paycheck Fairness       Act does not tell employers what factors to use to set pay;       it only requires that pay decisions are job- and business-      related.        Enactment of this bill will not make employers liable for       any and every wage differential. An employer will still have       four affirmative defenses and will not be guilty of wage       discrimination if a pay differential is based on (i)       seniority, (ii) merit, (iii) a system that measures quantity       or quality of production, or (iv) a ``factor other than       sex.'' 29 U.S.C. 206(d)(l). The only difference is that       Paycheck Fairness Act will resolve uncertainty in the law       over how to apply the fourth defense by redefining it as ``a       bona fide factor other than sex, such as education, training,       or experience.''        Enactment of a provision to clarify the ``factor other than       sex'' defense will not eviscerate legitimate use of the       defense. It is intended to prevent employers from asserting       that unequal pay was the result of market force-derived       excuses such as prior salaries or negotiation outcomes. A       bona fide factor other than sex must be job-related,       consistent with business necessity, and account for the       entire differential in compensation at issue. The only time       this defense would not apply would be in situations where an       alternative employment practice is available that would serve       the same business purpose without producing the wage       differential and the employer has refused to adopt it.        Enactment of this bill will not encourage more lawsuits and       jeopardize post-pandemic economic recovery. The bill is       designed resolve uncertainties in the law and increase       employer compliance with the Equal Pay Act, not to encourage       more lawsuits.        The bill's strengthened remedies, which align with those       available in other employment discrimination statutes, will       encourage employers to review their wage-setting practices       and rectify those that are based on invalid justifications.       Men and women who are paid fairly have no incentive to       jeopardize their jobs and subject themselves to costly, time-      consuming, and emotionally taxing lawsuits brought against       their employers.        The bill's clarification of the ``factor other than sex''       defense will not spawn new litigation. Instead, it will       provide guidance to the courts and resolve uncertainty in the       law. The standard, which is adapted from Title VII       discrimination cases and codified in the Civil Rights Act of       1991, is one with which courts already are familiar.        The bill will help strengthen the economy by improving the       present and future economic welfare of working women, who       comprise about one-half of the workforce and are the primary       breadwinner in more than 12 million American families.        We urge you to demonstrate your commitment to equal pay for       equal work by voting for the Paycheck Fairness Act.        Thank you for your consideration of our views.            Sincerely,                                                 Patricia Lee Refo.   [[Page H1809]]          Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to strongly support H.R. 7, the  Paycheck Fairness Act, a critically important bill.   As the first woman to chair the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity  Commission, I enforced the Equal Pay Act. I particularly appreciate  that H.R. 7 would bring long-awaited strength to the EPA.   I especially appreciate that Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, a great  champion for equal pay, has included my Pay Equity for All Act in H.R.  7, where I will focus today.   The Pay Equity for All Act would prohibit employers from asking job  applicants their salary history. Even though many employers may not  intentionally discriminate against applicants or employees based on  gender, race, or ethnicity, setting wages based on salary history is  routinely done in the workplace and can reinforce the wage gap.  Evidence clearly shows that members of historically disadvantaged  groups often start their careers with unfair and artificially low wages  compared to their White male counterparts, and these disparities are  compounded from job to job.   Job and salary offers should be based on an applicant's skill and  merit, not on salary history. This bill addresses this problem by  assessing penalties against employers who ask applicants for their  salary history during the interview process.
