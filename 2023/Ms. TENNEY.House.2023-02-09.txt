 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and celebrate the  bicentennial of Yates County, New York, named after New York State  Governor Joseph Yates, the seventh Governor of New York who  commissioned the county in 1823.   Yates County is home to rolling hills and spectacular lakeside views  of three of the Finger Lakes: Keuka, Seneca, and Canandaigua.   Comprised of nine townships, Yates County is home to just over 24,000  New Yorkers, only a small increase from the 20,000 people that called  Yates County home at the time of its founding in 1823.   Yates County has preserved its pristine beauty over these years and  played an important role in our State's history, including being home  to some of the State's oldest stone mills and the lovely town of  Branchport, which served as an important trade hub for steamboats along  the Finger Lakes.   It was my distinct honor to have as my guest at the State of the  Union, Yates County Sheriff Ron Spike, the longest serving sheriff in  the history of the State of New York.   It is an honor to represent Yates County in Congress, and I am proud  to celebrate Yates County on its bicentennial.                            ____________________
