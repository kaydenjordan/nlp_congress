 Mr. Speaker, there is a word for what we are witnessing  today, and that word is ``chutzpah.''   The majority is proposing a balanced budget amendment to the  Constitution of the United States just months after passing the Trump  tax scheme, which  [[Page H3173]]  the Congressional Budget Office warned would increase the deficit by  $1.6 trillion over 10 years. So having broken the bank and spent their  way into default, they now want a balanced budget amendment to protect  all the rest of us.                                time  1400    Like I said, chutzpah. One would think such devoted Reaganites might  have learned the lesson already.   The majority has once again asked the American people to stomach a  massive deficit increase on the hope and the prayer that tax decreases  will pay for themselves.   That is the same trickle-down narrative we heard in the Reagan years  and the Bush years, and it didn't work then, and it is not going to  work now.   The 1981 tax cuts were so disastrous, for example, for Federal  deficits, that Presidents Regan and Bush, Sr., had to enact legislation  to raise taxes to make up for the shortfall in 1982, 1983, 1984, 1987,  and 1990.   Other than that, yeah, tax cuts pay for themselves.   When President Obama took office, he inherited a deficit of more than  $1.5 trillion in the depths of the Great Recession that President Bush  gave him. That deficit was cut by more than two-thirds in President  Obama's tenure in office.   By this time next year, however, the Republican tax policy and  President Trump's policies will have doubled the deficit in just the  first 2 years.   This level of fiscal irresponsibility could rival that of the Bush  years, when we went from a surplus to a deficit, from a $128 billion  surplus to a deficit of $1.16 trillion.   Trickle-down theories don't work. They are a bad experiment for the  American people. I urge rejection on the grounds of intellectual  honesty and integrity of this balanced budget amendment.
