 Mr. Speaker, there was a time in Washington less than a  year ago when if the Speaker of the House of Representatives gave you  their word, it meant something.   That is no longer true.   Earlier this year, Speaker McCarthy stood in the Oval Office with the  President of the United States and negotiated a deal to raise the debt  limit and fund the government. Today, instead of keeping his end of the  deal, Speaker McCarthy is refusing to even allow bills to come to the  floor that would honor that promise and avert a government shutdown.   His failures mean that 1.3 million Active-Duty troops will have to  continue to work but not be paid for their service.   His failures mean that 7 million women and children will not receive  the nutrition assistance that they depend on.   His failures mean that every one of you can expect flight  disruptions, less border security, fewer food and rail safety  inspections.   There is an old saying, Mr. Speaker: Fool me once, shame on you; fool  me twice, shame on me. Shame on Speaker McCarthy for forcing the  American people to suffer all this foolishness.                            ____________________
