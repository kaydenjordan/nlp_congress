 Madam President, more than a year ago, a news website  by the name of ProPublica published stories that it claims are based on  ``a vast trove of Internal Revenue Service data on the tax returns of  thousands of the nation's wealthiest people, covering more than 15  years.'' Since then, ProPublica has continued to publish articles that  appear to use data leaked or hacked from the IRS.   Despite questions from Congress and immediate expressions of concern  from the Treasury Department, as well as the IRS, we don't know any  more today than we did a year ago. Even though these apparent leaks of  confidential taxpayer information appear to target the wealthy, not  just the wealthy but all taxpayers and anyone who cares about effective  tax administration should be very concerned. The fact is, until we get  answers, we don't know if anyone's tax return or other information  submitted to the IRS is actually secure.   At the end of the 2022 filing system, more than 145 million  individual income tax returns had been filed with the IRS. Right now,  we don't know if there is a current vulnerability to the IRS's systems  that makes this personal information accessible within the IRS or to  bad actors outside of the IRS. We do not know if a foreign nation with  hostile intentions is responsible for a leak or a hack of taxpayer  information or the full scope of the IRS's information that may be  involved. Just because ProPublica hasn't found it politically useful to  publicly disclose your private taxpayer information doesn't mean that  your tax information hasn't been compromised.   As I said earlier, in June of 2021, concern was immediately expressed  in the Congress and at the Treasury Department. Almost on that very  day, Commissioner Rettig appeared before the Finance Committee. In  fact, it was on that very day that the first story was published.   Commissioner Rettig said:         I think that trust and confidence in the Internal Revenue       Service is sort of the bedrock of asking people and requiring       people to provide financial information, and we have, as I       said, turned it over to the appropriate investigators,       external and internal.    Attorney General Garland was quoted as saying:         This is an extremely serious matter. People are entitled,       obviously, to great privacy with respect to their tax       returns.    With this level of concern expressed so quickly, now a year ago, you  would expect action to have been taken quickly. If you expected that,  you would be wrong. Despite several letters sent by this Senator and  other Members of Congress, we don't know any more today about what  happened than we did last year on June 8, when this situation began.   When testifying before the House Ways and Means Committee, Secretary  Yellen said:         I am as anxious as you are to find out what happened.    As a strong proponent of congressional oversight--as I am--of the  executive branch, I have always been frustrated when the executive  refuses to share relevant information that we need in Congress and are  entitled under the Constitution to have. Secretary Yellen's statement  suggests a more disturbing possibility where the executive branch  completely lacks the sought-after information. Now, consider how  shocking it is if the Secretary of the Treasury actually has no insight  or any knowledge into a possible massive leak or hack of taxpayer  information that occurred under her watch.   In order to determine if any action had been taken, I, along with  other Republican members of the Judiciary Committee, wrote to Attorney  General Garland and FBI Director Wray on June 24 of this year to ask  what the status was of any investigation. This was the second time we  tried to get this information.   I know the Department of Justice is capable of taking action quickly  when the Department of Justice wants to. I have written to the Attorney  General several times about the memo that he issued in response to a  letter from the National School Boards Association. That school board  letter compared parents to domestic terrorists. It took the Department  of Justice only 5 days,  [[Page S4530]]  which included a weekend, to inject Federal law enforcement into local  debates with concerned parents.    Clearly, the Attorney General is capable of taking action very  quickly, but that seems to only be when an administrative priority is  of concern. I hope the Biden administration and the Garland Department  of Justice would be as concerned about the protection of confidential  taxpayer information as they are about monitoring concerned parents who  testify before a school board.   If the Department of Justice and the FBI want to show that they take  the confidentiality of taxpayer information seriously, they can start  by fully and completely responding to my letter of June 24, which  hasn't yet been responded to. More than a full year, with a complete  filing season, is too much time to have gone by without having any  information on this leaking of taxpayer information being provided to  any extent.   Democrats constantly spoke of the need for fairness in the tax system  as they pushed through partisan tax-and-spending bills. Yet we have  heard barely a peep out of our Democratic colleagues on what may be the  largest unauthorized disclosure of taxpayer information in history.   While we continue to wait for answers, we have learned of another  massive breach of taxpayer information.   On the first Friday of September, we learned the IRS mistakenly  published on its website private information from about 120,000  taxpayers. According to Politico, the disclosure consisted of ``details  from business tax returns filed by tax-exempt organizations and  retirement accounts, included people's names, business contact  information and income produced by certain investments.''   Clearly, the ability of the IRS to safeguard taxpayer information is  still an ongoing issue.   This new revelation should light a very big fire underneath the FBI  to get at the bottom of the ProPublica leak or hack. Attorney General  Garland and FBI Director Wray must fully respond to my letter and help  all of us really understand if our tax system is safe and secure.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that James  Carmany, a detailee in my office, be granted floor privileges until  August 31, 2023, and that another detailee in my office, Dave Lewen, be  granted floor privileges until March 3, 2023.
