 Madam President, I want to thank my colleague and leader  on the Democratic side, Senator Schumer, for his specific, articulate,  and direct analysis of where we stand today in the Senate.   Faced with the worst public health crisis in 100 years, faced with  the worst economic crisis in 75 to 80 years, the message from the  Republican side of the aisle is ``Think small. Do as little as  possible. Let's see how this works out.''   At a time when we have unemployment figures breaking all records,  when we have 10 times the unemployment claims in Illinois that we did a  year ago--I might add, 10 times the unemployment claims in the  Commonwealth of Kentucky that they did a year ago--we, instead, are  hearing from the Republican side of the aisle that the problem with our  economy is not unemployment; it is the fact that the people who are  unemployed are being given too much money.   Right now we have a Federal benefit package worth $600 a week that  was enacted in the CARES Act on March 26. That expires in 3 days. It is  a $600-a-week Federal supplement over the State payment. What the  Republicans have suggested is to cut that $600 Federal supplement to  $200, and then they turn and say: Well, what we really want to do is to  compensate the workers with 70 percent of what they were earning when  they were laid off.   There is a real serious problem here that they are not disclosing to  the American people. Back in March, when we proposed a similar approach  or one that took into consideration the previous wages of an unemployed  worker, who told us to stop that consideration? President Trump's  Secretary of Labor. Secretary Scalia came to us, and I was at the  meeting when he said: You don't understand. You cannot make this kind  of change in the States because there are 50 different computer systems  in the employment security offices across each and every State in the  Union. They cannot make this adjustment. They cannot make this change.   The only way, they told us--Secretary Scalia told us in March--is a  flat dollar amount to each unemployed worker, which is exactly what we  did.   Now the Republicans come to us and ignore that advice, ignore that  guidance that led to $600 a week, and say: We will come up with an  elaborate formula of 70 percent of what you were paid before.   As Senator Schumer from New York said earlier, we surveyed a dozen  States, and they all told us: Impossible to 5 or 6 months before we are  ready to do something in that manner. And that means, for millions of  Americans currently unemployed, the possibility of only receiving $200  a week until someday in the future when the State unemployment systems  can possibly change. That is the Republican approach.   They have made a big point, as Senator McConnell did this morning on  the floor, of a $1,200 check, a cash payment such as we had back in  March. I am not opposed to that. The President is desperate for it  because he gets to sign the checks. He wants his signature on the  checks that are going out to these individuals.   Well, Mr. President, if that is what you want, be my guest if it is  going to help working families. But make no mistake--a $1,200 check to  a family who was receiving $600 a week, $2,400 a month, is cold  comfort, and it won't help them pay the bills they face every single  month.   I only wish that the Republicans who are calling for these dramatic  cuts in unemployment compensation for millions of Americans--30 million  Americans--I only wish they would go home to Kentucky and other States  and sit down for a meal with an unemployed family and let them tell  these Republicans what they are facing each and every month, trying to  get by, even with this unemployment check.   You see, there is an assumption that these people have a lot of money  in savings. It is not reality. In the real world, half of American  families have little or no savings to turn to--even before this current  economic downturn. Imagine what they are going through now and the  sacrifices they have to make.   Surely the Republican leaders have heard the stories or seen  firsthand, as I have, the families showing up at food banks and  pantries, looking for a helping hand to put something on the table to  feed their families, some of them with their eyes down to the ground,  tears in those eyes because they never dreamed they would be in this  position in life. And what is the alternative suggested from the  Republican side? Cut the unemployment compensation for millions of  Americans at this moment in history. Think small, Republicans say. We  can get through this by doing as little as possible.   That is not true. We have been told over and over again that if we  take our foot off the accelerator to try to move this economy out of  the ditch, it will crash even further, and we don't want that to  happen. We want people to get back to work and businesses to reopen and  schools to reopen, but we have to do the right thing in terms of  providing compensation to individuals.   I reject the premise that many Republicans bring to this conversation  that if you are not rich, you must be lazy in America. I don't think  unemployed people in this country are lazy people. I think they are  hard-working people who have been dealt a tough hand of cards. They are  trying to keep their families together until they can get back to work  and to a decent job. Cutting unemployment compensation at this moment  in history is cruel, inhumane, and insensitive to the realities these  families are facing every single day.   There is one provision that came out yesterday that I want to speak  to for a moment. For months, literally for months, Senator McConnell  has come to the floor and criticized Speaker Pelosi for her efforts to  pass the Heroes Act almost 10 weeks ago. Ten weeks ago, the House of  Representatives, under Speaker Pelosi, passed legislation to provide  COVID-19 relief that we knew was coming because we  [[Page S4519]]  knew the unemployment benefits were going to expire in just a few days.  She saw that coming and 10 weeks ago did what was the right thing to  do. She mustered her troops and provided a majority to vote for a  package that moves us forward, helps State and local governments face  the reality of this economy, helps hospitals, and helps individuals pay  for their health insurance--a good package and one that I could readily  support.   Senator McConnell came to the floor frequently, regularly, several  times a week, saying how bad that package was, how terrible it was,  while he did nothing, while the Republicans proposed no alternative. It  is just like the Affordable Care Act. They have done everything they  can 150 times to try to repeal it and never once proposed an  alternative. The same thing is true when it comes to this COVID-19  relief. In this circumstance we received finally, yesterday, this  proposal that was brought by Senator Cornyn on behalf of himself and  Senator McConnell to address the issue of the immunity of corporations  from lawsuits that have any relation to COVID-19--immunity for these  corporations so that they will not be held liable if, in fact, they are  not performing up to the standards necessary to protect employees and  customers.    It is 65 pages long. It is a big giveaway to the biggest corporations  in America. The Republican corporate immunity bill does nothing to  protect workers, improve safety standards, or give business incentives  to take proper precautions to reduce the spread of the coronavirus.   In fact, this bill does the opposite. It views workers and victims as  the problem, and it sets high hurdles that prevent meritorious COVID- related crimes from having their day in court. What the bill would do  is impose sweeping Federal preemption on the rights of workers and  victims to bring cases in State courts for COVID-related harm. It would  supplant State laws that require businesses to act with reasonable  care. Then it would say that businesses are shielded from liability in  Federal court if they merely make an effort to comply with the weakest  available mandatory safety standard that applies to them so long as  they are not grossly negligent.   So what are the kinds of safety standards that the bill would urge  businesses to follow? Well, it certainly wouldn't be the guidelines of  the Centers for Disease Control because those aren't mandatory. So,  amazingly, a business can get shielded from liability under this  Republican approach even if they make no effort to comply with the  Centers for Disease Control guidelines. How does that make us any  safer?   Not only that, but if workers or sick Americans want to try to bring  a meritorious COVID-related case in this bill, this bill puts them  through a gauntlet of tort reform obstacles that will make it nearly  impossible to prevail: a heightened burden of proof, heightened  pleading requirements, limits on discovery, damage caps, restrictions  on joint and several liability, and so much more. The Republican bill  also creates sweeping Federal preemption of medical malpractice cases,  including claims under medical malpractice not even related to COVID- 19. It would upend the medical liability laws of all 50 States for 5  years.   Instead of sending a strong, clear, and enforceable Federal safety  standard like an OSHA emergency temporary standard, the Republican bill  would actually shield businesses from regulatory enforcement  proceedings under OSHA, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Americans  with Disabilities Act, and more.   The liability immunity under this bill would last for 5 years, from  December 2019 to 2024. The fact that Republicans are proposing 5 years  of liability immunity for corporations while promising just a few  months of assistance for workers tells the whole story about priorities  and values.   Let's be clear. Republicans have not made the case for why we would  even consider Federal liability immunity for corporations. Remember,  under current State tort law, if a business has taken reasonable  precautions, it will not be held liable for negligence. State laws give  incentives for businesses to act reasonably, and most businesses do.  Also, time and again, I have heard Senator McConnell and Senator Cornyn  come to the floor and talk about the tsunami of lawsuits. This morning  Senator McConnell said ``an epidemic'' of frivolous lawsuits.   It so happens we keep track of lawsuits filed in the United States of  America, and we can look to the pleadings in those lawsuits to see how  many times they mention coronavirus or COVID-19. We know how many  lawsuits have been filed since the first of the year related to this  pandemic. We know that despite the fact that 4 million--at least 4  million--COVID-19 infections have been established in the United  States--4 million--do you know how many medical malpractice cases have  been filed by any of those 4 million Americans or anyone else against  doctors, nurses, hospitals, and providers? What is the epidemic number?  We have it. Here is the exact number of medical malpractice cases filed  in the United States in the last 6 months: six--six. An epidemic? A  tsunami?   How about personal injury lawsuits, Senator? How many have been filed  listing COVID-19 or coronavirus as one of the reasons for these  lawsuits? Fifteen. With 4 million infected Americans, there are 15  lawsuits, and the Republicans have come to us and want to turn upside  down the immunity and liability questions before the States and the  Nation.   How about unsafe workplace lawsuits? Now, that has to be a big  category. With 4 million infected Americans, how many workers have  brought lawsuits? Seventy-one. In the entire 50 States of America,  there are 71 lawsuits.   There is no flood of worker or victim lawsuits. It is a figment of  the imagination of Senator McConnell, Senator Cornyn, and K Street. But  we certainly shouldn't, at this moment in time, ignore the obvious.  Over 20 States have stepped forward and established their own standards  for lawsuits when it comes to the pandemic they face. This effort by  the Republicans would preempt that State action. There have been  hundreds and hundreds of COVID lawsuits that have been filed, business  to business, on questions like insurance liability. You don't hear the  Republicans wanting to stop businesses from filing lawsuits--no, just  workers and the people who get sick.   There is no need for the Federal Government to step in and override  50 States' liability laws, especially after the Federal Government has  been deferring to the States on every other aspect of this pandemic:  testing, PPE, masks, stay-at-home orders. Time and again, this  President has said to leave it to the Governors and leave it to the  mayors, except when it comes to protecting big corporations. If States  need to adjust their liability laws, they can do so, and 28 States have  already done it.   So here is the bottom line. The Republican immunity bill would upend  State laws, give businesses incentives to cut corners, jeopardize the  safety of workers and families, and risk further spread of this virus.  It is a big business giveaway, and that is not what America needs.   This is not a small challenge; it is a historic challenge. We  shouldn't take the Republican lead and play small ball. We ought to  address this head-on.   First, we need leadership from the top, which we have not had from  the President. He has deferred time and again to Governors and mayors  and other officials at the local levels, telling them: Find your own  masks. Establish your own testing regimes. Find your own way out of  this crisis.   When we needed Federal leadership from the President, we did not  receive it. America knows that. Why is it that this Nation, with 5  percent of the world's population, has 25 percent of the COVID  infection cases in the world? Why? What happened here? Why didn't we  follow the lead of other countries that stepped up with Presidential  leadership--countries that have found dramatically less infection,  dramatically fewer deaths. That is the reality of where we are today  with this pandemic.   The reality of our economy--we stepped in on March 26 and passed the  CARES Act. We have managed to keep some businesses going. We have  managed to keep millions of unemployed Americans together with their  families through the most difficult period in their lives. Now, at this  moment, the Republican leadership says: Think  [[Page S4520]]  small. This is all going to pass quickly. Don't worry about these  families who don't have enough to provide food and shelter and the  basics for their families. They will get by with a lot less--from $600  a week to $200 a week. They will do just fine, according to Republicans   I disagree. Our first obligation should be to these working families  who are going through the toughest period they could ever imagine.  Stick with them. Stand with them. Be prepared to put the money on the  table, which we know they will spend right back into the economy.   We will see more unemployment if we follow the Republican approach.  It is estimated that some 3 million jobs will be killed by the  Republican approach of cutting unemployment and the consequent downturn  in spending by these same families.   Let's stick with those families now. They need us.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy), the  Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey), and the Senator from Vermont  (Mr. Sanders) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy), the  Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey), and the Senator from Vermont  (Mr. Sanders) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy), the  Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey), and the Senator from Vermont  (Mr. Sanders) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy), the  Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey), and the Senator from Vermont  (Mr. Sanders) are necessarily absent.    Madam President, let me thank my colleague, the senior  Senator from the State of Georgia, for joining me in this bipartisan  effort. We now have some 36 sponsors and cosponsors of this  legislation.   Immigration can be a divisive issue, but this is an immigration  measure that is not divisive. It has unified us on a bipartisan basis,  as it should. We are talking about the Healthcare Workforce Resilience  Act. We are talking about men and women who, as we speak on the floor  of the Senate in the safety of this Chamber, are literally risking  their lives as healthcare professionals across the United States to  deal with this pandemic, which we fight every single day.    Last week, we sent a bipartisan letter urging congressional leaders  to make this bill part of any COVID-19 relief legislation. Currently  pending before the Senate is a negotiation with the White House, the  House, the Senate--Democrats and Republicans--to make sure that we  continue to move forward to fight this pandemic and to restore the  vibrancy of our own economy. The letter we sent was cosigned by  Senators Leahy, Young, and Coons, as well as Representatives Schneider,  Cole, Finkenauer, and Bacon, who were the lead sponsors of the House  version of the same bill. We are now up to, I understand, 37. They said  36 earlier. I am told we have 18 Republicans and 19 Democrats, and the  window is open for those who want to join us in this bipartisan effort.  They will not regret it.   Our bill is a temporary stopgap measure, but it is designed to  strengthen our healthcare workforce and improve healthcare access for  Americans in the midst of this crisis. Consider this reality when it  comes to fighting the COVID-19 virus: In the United States, 1 in 6  healthcare and social workers, 3.1 million--1 in 6--of the 18.7 million  are immigrants. Yet our broken immigration laws prevent many of these  immigrants from contributing more fully to the battle against this  pandemic.   Under current law, there are not enough immigrant visas, which we  also call green cards, available each year. As a result, immigrants are  stuck in crippling backlogs for many, many years. The green card  backlog, which I have debated with Senator Lee on the floor many  times--but this green card backlog includes thousands of medical  doctors currently working in our country on temporary visas. This  backlog puts them and their families at the risk of losing their  immigration status and being deported. It hinders their ability to  fight against COVID-19 because these doctors face many restrictions due  to their temporary status.   For example, many of these doctors cannot take shifts at hospitals in  COVID-19 hotspots where they are desperately needed. The Healthcare  Workforce Resilience Act, which we bring to the floor, would reallocate  25,000 unused immigrant visas for nurses and 15,000 unused immigrant  visas for doctors. These are visas Congress has previously authorized  but were never used.   It is important to note that our bill requires employers to attest  that immigrants overseas who receive these visas do not displace the  employment of any American workers. We want to ensure that the  beneficiaries of this bill complement, not replace, the American  healthcare workforce.   I am going to tell you the story of one of these doctors who is  practicing in downstate Illinois in the Quad Cities area in Moline. I  can tell you, as a downstater myself, there are many areas of downstate  that are rural, small town, and cannot bring in the specialists who are  needed. That is why these doctors become so important when they step in  and provide their services. Let me tell you about this doctor.   His name is Dr. Bhanu Vakkalanka. He sent me a letter and told me his  story, and he asked me to help work to pass this piece of legislation.  Dr. Vakkalanka and his wife, Dr. Sasi Royyuru--excuse me for  mispronouncing--Royyuru--are both physicians. They met in medical  school in India, and they came to the United States 15 years ago in  2005--15 years ago. At the time, their children--a young girl and boy-- were 5 and 3 years old.   Before they came to the United States, they had trained and worked  [[Page S4528]]  for 10 years in England. Both achieved great professional success, but  they were drawn to move to the United States. They were drawn to our  freedom, our equality, and the opportunity that really is our trademark  in the world.   This is what Dr. Vakkalanka told me about his family's move to the  United States, and I want to quote his words:         It was not an easy transition. We had to start all over       again as residents. It was challenging to take care of two       young children in the middle of our long working hours and       paltry salaries with no one to fall back on. . . . But we had       not come this far to give up on our dreams easily.    Dr. Vakkalanka now works as a medical oncologist for the UnityPoint  Health System in Moline, in my home State of Illinois, a well-respected  institution. Dr. Royyuru is a family physician in Bloomington, IL.  There is a long drive between the two, Moline and Bloomington. Here is  what Dr. Vakkalanka told me about his life in America:         Despite the initial hardship, we fell in love with the       United States soon after we came here. People were welcoming       and generous. We were made to feel like we were part of this       society from day one and we felt that this is where we       belonged. We felt blessed, happy and proud to be able to live       here, raise our children and call it our home.    Let me tell you, he tells me how fortunate he was. I believe we are  the fortunate ones--fortunate to have two exceptional physicians and  their children as residents of my home State.   Unfortunately, Dr. Vakkalanka and Dr. Royyuru, his wife, are two of  thousands of doctors who are stuck in a bureaucratic backlog called the  green card backlog. They have lived in the United States for 15 years.  Their green card petitions were approved nearly a decade ago. Yet, even  today, after more than 10 years, they are not lawful residents. Why?  Because the backlog of people seeking these green cards--these  immigration visas--is so large.   In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the temporary immigration  status of this family puts them at real risk. Why? If, God forbid, they  would contract COVID-19 and become disabled or die, their family will  instantly lose their immigration status and be forced to leave the  United States. For 15 years they have waited, and for 10 years they  have been on the actual queue, the waiting list for green cards, and if  one of them takes ill and cannot work, they could all be deported.   Now their children, who were 5 and 3 when they arrived in the United  States, are 20 years old and 18 years old. This is significant. They  grew up in this country, but they are at risk of aging out in this  bureaucratic system. If they reach the age of 21, these two children,  who have lived here virtually all of their teenage and adolescent  life--if they reach the age of 21 and have not been able to apply for a  green card, they are subject to deportation. Can you imagine how  devastating it would be for this doctor and his wife to think that  their children, after all these years, would be deported from the  United States? It is a very real risk.   Dr. Vakkalanka told me:         Our children waited for 15 years or longer along with us       for their turn. They laughed with us and cried with us for       all these years. It is not fair to kick them out of the line       for no fault of theirs. They have nowhere else to go. This       country is their only home!    Dr. Vakkalanka and Dr. Royyuru's family story makes clear why  Congress needs to include the Healthcare Workforce Resilience Act in  the next coronavirus relief legislation. Under our bill, these two good  doctors from India, and thousands of others like them, would finally  receive their green cards. They and their families would get the  permanent immigration status they deserve and be able to use their  skills to serve on the frontlines of the pandemic wherever they are  needed most.   Let's face it. This pandemic is testing us as a nation, testing us as  to whether we will have the endurance and the determination to get  through this pandemic but equally testing us as to whether we care for  one another. Certainly, we care for our families. We spend a lot of  time with them. We worry about not being able to be next to our  children or grandchildren because of fear of infection, and it is a  real test. But it is also a test of our values of who we are.   This man, after giving 15 years to the United States, practicing  medicine in areas where he is desperately needed, is simply asking for  a chance to become a legal, permanent resident of the United States. It  is not too much to ask. For all he has given us, and his wife as well,  we owe it to him and his family to give them the peace of mind that  they have a future in the United States. They have proved that they are  deserving.   I hope, even in these divided political times, we can come together  in Congress to quickly aid these immigrant health heroes.   I commend my colleague from Georgia. I thank him. He had to step away  from the floor at this moment, but I thank him for joining me in this  bipartisan effort.   Let's get this done. Let do the right thing for this doctor, for his  family, and for so many others                                    Racism    Mr. President, the great writer, James Baldwin, told us:         Not everything that is faced can be changed. But nothing       can be changed until it is faced.    The national discussion on race and racism in the wake of the death  of George Floyd in Minneapolis has really opened the eyes of many  Americans and people around the world. Many people are seeing more  clearly--some perhaps for the first time in their lives--the extent to  which injustice has embedded itself in parts of America.   We see how some of our laws and institutions don't match our stated  and professed belief that all men and women are created equal and  endowed with the same inalienable rights.   Later today, John Lewis will make his last departure from the U.S.  Capitol. He is going home after a long and noble life of service, a  life that has helped us to live up to our ideals. How often did we hear  John Lewis say: When young people tell me that nothing has changed, I  tell them to come walk in my shoes.   He was so right. America is different and America is better because  of the enormous sacrifice and courage of men like John Lewis, Reverend  C.T. Vivian, who passed away, as well, last week; Joseph Lowery; Mamie  Till; Martin Luther King; Coretta Scott King; Rosa Parks; Daisy Bates;  Julian Bond; Bayard Rustin; Elijah Cummings; and, of course, my friend  and the current House Democratic Whip,   James Clyburn, and so many  other leaders of our modern civil rights movement--just too many to  name.   We are a more perfect union today because so many ordinary men and  women and children whose names are mostly forgotten by history risked  their lives for dignity and democracy in little towns like Selma and  Birmingham, AL, and Chicago's Marquette Park neighborhood.   Thank goodness we are better, but the work of true justice and  equality is far from over. We know that. A month before he died, John  Lewis spoke out about how he was moved to see so many people from  different backgrounds marching together for racial justice and healing.  Most Americans today are appalled--almost incredulous--that only  decades ago young people like John Lewis and Diane Nash were accosted  by angry mobs simply for having the audacity--the audacity--to sit at a  Whites-only lunch counter or ride on a segregated bus.   We reject racism as individuals, but many of us are only beginning to  understand the existence of the corrosive consequences of the system of  racial injustice. This national reckoning on race in which we are now  engaged is helping us to see more clearly how old, discredited ideas  about race, which have been rejected by most, still linger in the minds  of many individuals, regardless of the laws that have been passed.   I believe that most Americans believe very deeply in fairness. It is  one of our defining values as a people. I also believe Maya Angelou was  right when she said:         Do the best you can until you know better. Then when you       know better, do better.    How can we do better to reduce systemic racial injustice and heal the  wounds and divisions that false notions of racial superiority have  caused in our Nation and our fellow citizens? As John Lewis told us  often, achieving great, genuine equality is the work of a lifetime. Let  me suggest briefly a few ways that this Senate can begin that work.  [[Page S4529]]    First--and this is so easy and obvious--let the Senate debate and  vote on the Justice in Policing Act. The President can send  unidentified Federal agents to as many cities as he likes, but the  calls for justice in our streets will not end until we make a clear  stand against policing tactics that killed George Floyd, Breonna  Taylor, Tamir Rice, Laquan McDonald, and too many other men, women, and  children of color in America.   Our Republican colleagues acknowledged the need for policing reforms  when they brought up the bill that included certain changes, but the  bill did not proceed, and it should. This Senate can--and must--do  better. This belief is shared by an overwhelming majority of civil  rights organizations in our Nation.   The Justice in Policing Act is sponsored by Senators Kamala Harris  and Cory Booker. It has passed the House of Representatives, and I am  proud to be a cosponsor.   The House, in passing its version with a bipartisan vote, gave us an  opportunity, I say to Senator McConnell, to debate the Justice in  Policing Act, which passed the House, and here in the Senate we should.   Second, let this Senate debate the Economic Justice Act that has been  offered by Senator Schumer.   Third, Martin Luther King called racial disparities in healthcare one  of the most shocking of all racial injustices. It was more than 50  years ago when he said. Yet the disparities persist to this day and may  be worse in many ways.   This pandemic has laid them bare for us to see. Black and Brown  Americans are three times more likely to become infected with  coronavirus than White Americans and twice as likely to die from COVID- 19.   The Affordable Care Act has done more to reduce racial disparities in  healthcare than almost any act since the creation of Medicaid. It is  hard to believe that there are many on the other side still trying to  kill the Affordable Care Act in the midst of a pandemic that has  already taken the lives of 145,000 Americans. Many more have been  sickened, and it is still burning out of control in large parts of our  Nation. Think about what it would be if we had no Affordable Care Act  and doubled the number of uninsured people in this country. How could  that bring us any consolation or confidence that we can continue to  fight this battle?   For the sake of African Americans, Latinx Americans, and all  Americans who rely on the affordable coverage and patient protections,  it is time to put an end to this endless assault on the Affordable Care  Act.   I hope my colleagues--especially my colleagues who speak passionately  about protecting mothers and babies--will join me in passing a bill I  have introduced to reduce the shocking high rate of maternal and infant  mortality among African-American women and their babies. It is  inexplicable that in the United States of America, we see so many Black  women dying in childbirth and so many babies dying as well. It is  unnecessary. It is time for us to focus the great resources, health  resources, of America on this issue.   In America, a woman of color is three to four times more likely than  a White woman to die as a result of pregnancy. Why? The answers are  very obvious. We need better, more focused, more understanding medical  care. I am sad to say that in Illinois, the situation--the numbers--are  that bad, if not even worse.   The United States is 1 of only 13 nations in the world in which the  maternal mortality rate is worse than it was 25 years ago. In the  United States of America, we are 1 of only 13 nations in which the  maternal death rate is worse today than what it was 25 years ago. How  in the world can we explain that?   I have introduced a bill called the MOMMA Act. My companion in this  effort is my Congresswoman from Chicago, Robin Kelly. Let's get that  debated, I say to Senator McConnell. It will not take long. I bet it  passes easily. We owe it to many across America to show the initiative  and to bring it to the floor.   Fourth, because our friends across the aisle could not agree among  themselves on what would be in the next coronavirus relief bill,  critical protections included in the CARES Act have now or will soon  expire without replacement.   These protections include payments for the jobless for tens of  millions of Americans who have lost their jobs in this pandemic--it  wasn't because they were lazy; it was bad luck--as well as the Federal  moratorium on evictions for families who have had difficulty paying  their rent because of economic devastation brought on by COVID-19.   Unless we extend this moratorium, as many as 28 million could lose  their homes in the next 3 months. I can't imagine the devastation that  would bring to a family--losing your home and perhaps having no place  to turn. For the sake of those families and for our ability to fight  this virus, we must extend the moratorium on evictions and help  families who are struggling to pay rent.   Senator Warren introduced a bill that I have cosponsored to extend  this critical moratorium through March. It is called the Protecting  Renters from Evictions and Fees Act.   I am proud to cosponsor a bill with Senator Brown that provides $100  billion in emergency rental assistance to help families and individuals  pay their rent. Let's keep these families in a safe, quality living  environment   The crisis of affordable housing didn't start with this pandemic. The  shortage of safe, affordable public housing has been building for  decades, and it disproportionately harms African-American families.   Senator Harris of California has introduced a bill, which I am proud  to cosponsor, called the Housing is Infrastructure Act. It would invest  $100 billion to repair our current stock of public housing and to build  new units of safe, affordable public housing.   I could just walk you through a map of the State of Illinois and the  public housing I have visited and witnessed that is in desperate need  of repair. It is time, you think, to call the landlord and say: What  are you going to do about this housing unit that you own that is  falling down? Except, it turns out, we are the landlords. The Federal  Government owns this property. The Federal Government has the  responsibility to fix it.   Last week, President Trump moved to repeal an Obama-era rule meant to  ban discriminatory housing and zoning laws and policies. It is not  pricing from this President, but it is wrong. We need to move forward  and not backward. The housing infrastructure needs to move in the right  direction.   Finally, once again, in the name of John Lewis, I believe that the  right to vote was ``almost sacred,'' in his words, and I share that  feeling, but that right is now threatened by a series of misguided  decisions in recent years by the Supreme Court and other courts.   The House passed a bill last year to restore the Voting Rights Act to  its original intent. That bill is being reintroduced in the Senate this  week by Senator Leahy and in the House by Congressman Clyburn. The  difference? They are naming it in honor of Congressman John Lewis.   John Lewis did not risk his life in Selma and so many other places so  people would praise him in speeches or name things after him. He did  not risk his life for the right to have a bridge named after him-- although it is a fitting tribute. He risked his life over and over  again to protect the right of every American to vote.   Americans' faith in our electoral system--the cornerstone of our  democracy--continues to be under attack by entities that wish us ill.   For those who gathered in the Rotunda yesterday to honor his memory  and to stand in silent respect for all the work of his life, I say to  my fellow Senators who were there: Let us pass the Voting Rights  Advancement Act in the name of Congressman John Lewis. Let us make it  clear that his life was worth this and so much more.   When you know better, you do better. Our eyes have been opened, and  now it is time for us to act.   It is my honor to serve in this Senate, but I am sorry to say that  when it comes to production of important, meaningful legislation, this  institution has fallen far behind.   We seldom take up bills of great importance and magnitude. We just  passed the Defense authorization bill--a very important piece of  legislation, which I believe has passed for 59 straight years in  Congress, and I am glad it passed again, but now you see an empty floor  and an empty Chamber  [[Page S4530]]  where we are not taking up the issues that we should.   There is one person who controls the agenda and the schedule of this  Chamber, and that is the Republican majority leader, Senator Mitch  McConnell of Kentucky. Let's not waste this opportunity to make America  a better place. Let's do things that make a difference.   America is counting on us in the midst of this massive health crisis  with COVID-19--perhaps the worst health crisis our Nation has faced in  over 100 years. With the state of our economy and so many--tens of  millions of people out of work, shouldn't we be acting together on a  bipartisan basis, as we did in March of this year, to pass legislation?   The reports we have is that the other side of the aisle is in  disarray. I might remind Senator McConnell that the best legislation  that passes here is bipartisan. And this measure, COVID relief, moving  forward, should be bipartisan as well. For it to be bipartisan, we need  people of both parties to sit down together and negotiate. That has to  continue, along with the participation of the White House, in order to  achieve these goals.   First and foremost, we need to restore unemployment assistance to the  millions of families who will see it end in just a few days. I cannot  imagine having lost your job, worried about whether there is another  one waiting or whether one will be available, and then having to worry  about whether you can make that rent payment, the mortgage payment, the  utility bills, food, health insurance--the basics--and to be told that  Congress just let unemployment assistance expire, which happens in just  3 days. What are these families going to do?   I sincerely hope that every Member of the Senate will reach out to  one of these unemployed families and listen quietly to their stories. I  have seen them as they come to the food pantries. I have seen them come  and ask for help, which they never dreamed they would have to do. It  must be heartbreaking to go through that experience. Let's stand by  them now. They need us now more than ever.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I thank my colleague from Oklahoma. I could not have said  it any better or more effectively than he just did.   Like Oklahoma, downstate Illinois has an area of smaller cities and  rural towns and smalltown communities. Many of them are lucky enough to  have great hospitals, and they love their hospitals. They are not only  important sources of medical care; they are a major part of the local  economy and really are a rallying point for communities. Auxiliaries,  volunteers, and so many people make these hospitals the focal point  when you visit these communities. They are so proud of them.   Of course, we are worried about what this current pandemic is going  to do. I have had conference calls with leaders from almost 120  hospitals across Illinois. I invited Members of Congress in, so we had  bipartisan exchanges about the current state of affairs. One hospital  CEO from Crawford County, downstate along the Indiana border, told me  that he used to pay 22 cents for a surgical gown, and now he pays  between $11 and $20 for each one. Hospitals are facing limited access  to reagents, swabs, and supplies that they need. The Heroes Act would  direct the administration to utilize the Defense Production Act to help  solve that problem, and I commend Senators Murphy and Baldwin for their  legislation, which I am joining, to do the same.   One of the most profound consequences of the pandemic is the impact  on the solvency of these hospitals. Across Illinois, rural hospitals  are the heart and soul of the community; otherwise, people drive  literally for hours to get medical care, sometimes in emergency  situations. They are important parts of the local economy. We think  downstate hospitals generate $5 billion into our State economy each  year, and I don't doubt that.   This pandemic has pushed them to the brink. Even prior to this  crisis, they were facing financial uncertainty. Half of rural hospitals  were operating in the red. One in four were at risk of closure. As the  Senator from Oklahoma mentioned, 120 have closed across the Nation in  the past decade.   We have fared a little better in Illinois, but we are worried about  the future. When a rural hospital closes, not only do doctors  disappear, but jobs disappear, and businesses struggle to stay.   The coronavirus pandemic has accelerated and compounded the strains  we face. We believe our Illinois hospitals are losing $1.4 billion each  month. Many, like those near nursing homes and meat processing plants,  have had to expand surge staffing to deal with COVID patients. All have  been forced to cancel outpatient and elective services. In Illinois, 70  percent of rural hospital revenues are from outpatient services. The  same is true in neighboring States like Kentucky.   Nationwide, rural hospitals have on average only 33 days of cash on  hand. There is an immediate need to stabilize, and that is why we have  come up with this bipartisan plan. Senator James Lankford and I have  introduced a bill called the Rural Hospital Closure Relief Act. It is  supported by the American Hospital Association and the National Rural  Health Association. It would update Medicare's ``critical access  hospital'' designation to provide flexibility around the 35-mile  distance requirement, so more rural hospitals would qualify for  additional payments from the Federal Government.   We project that six hospitals in Iowa and scores more in Illinois,  New York, and Kentucky would qualify for this financial lifeline,  securing their stability. We do it in a restrained, cost-effective  manner by focusing on the hospitals that have faced financial losses  and are located in areas with a shortage of healthcare providers. It is  common sense.   This bipartisan bill is a priority for us. We want to make it a  priority for the Senate, and we hope to do so. We know that we have  come to this discussion with a good, encouraging conversation with  Senator Grassley today in support of the Iowa Rural Health Association.  The CEO and leader of the Kentucky Rural Health Association projects  that more than 18 rural hospitals in that State are at high risk of  closure. We hope to make that point very clear to the majority leader.  Several of them would be helped by our legislation.   With a spike in COVID-19 cases across rural America, we have seen  hospitals reaching capacity, and we need to make sure that our  hospitals--the ones we are talking about in rural areas--survive. The  health and economic toll of this crises demands it. I hope that  Democrats and Republicans in the Senate include this in any bipartisan  package. The cost of inaction will be disastrous.   Senator Lankford and I were prepared to seek passage of this bill by  unanimous consent today, but we have been encouraged to continue  negotiating with our colleagues to see if we can make it part of the  package--a timely part of the package--in the near future. I hope that  is the case, and we will hold off from any unanimous consent request  because of that hope                            ____________________     Madam President, last month, in a landmark decision, the  Supreme Court rejected President Trump's effort to repeal deportation  protections for Dreamers. Those are the young immigrants who came to  the United States as children.   In an opinion by Chief Justice John Roberts, the Court held that  President Trump's attempt to rescind DACA, Deferred Action for  Childhood Arrivals, was ``arbitrary and capricious.''   Those were the words of the Court.   More than a month later, the Trump administration has refused to  restore the DACA Program despite the decision written by the Chief  Justice. The administration is now in open defiance of the Supreme  Court when it comes to the DACA Program. The stakes are too high, both  for the rule of law and the lives of these young Dreamers, for us to  ignore it. Republicans and Democrats in Congress need to come together  to compel the President to immediately comply with the Supreme Court  mandate.   On June 4, 2019, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 6. In 2019,  they  [[Page S4537]]  passed H.R. 6, the Dream and Promise Act. This legislation would give  Dreamers a path to citizenship, and it passed on a strong bipartisan  vote. The Dream and Promise Act has been pending in the Senate on the  desk of Senator McConnell for more than a year.   Last month, I sent a letter signed by all 47 Democratic Senators,  calling on Majority Leader McConnell to immediately schedule a vote on  the Dream and Promise Act. As of today, Senator McConnell has not even  replied to this letter. Since Senator McConnell refuses to take any  action to address the plight of these Dreamers, I will ask unanimous  consent at this point for the Senate to pass the bipartisan Dream and  Promise Act.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to  the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 112, H.R. 6, the American  Dream and Promise Act; further, that the bill be considered read a  third time and passed; and that the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Madam President, I regret the fact that the Senator  objected. I am not surprised, but I understand his statement. I do hope  that he feels as I do that we should be working in a bipartisan fashion  to find an answer to this challenge.   I have been working on this Dream Act for a number of years. Over  780,000 young people have signed up for DACA, and many more are  currently eligible, and I would like to address their plight in just a  moment here on the floor. But I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for the  encouraging words to continue this effort. It is long past time for us  to find a bipartisan answer to this situation.   It was, in fact, 10 years ago when I joined with Senator Richard  Lugar, a Republican from Indiana, on a bipartisan basis to call on  President Obama to use his legal authority to protect Dreamers from  deportation. President Obama responded by creating the DACA Program.  DACA provides temporary protection from deportation of Dreamers if they  register with the government, pay a fee, and pass criminal and national  security background checks.   I got started on this 20 years ago. I know you have to be patient to  serve in the U.S. Senate, but I am losing my patience, not for my own  plight and situation but for these young people. We know their  circumstances. They were brought to this country as infants, toddlers,  and little kids. They grew up here thinking this was home. It was home.  They went to our schools. They pledged allegiance to our flag. They  counted themselves as just another American kid. Then, sometime when  they were teenagers, mom and dad sat down with them and said: We have a  serious matter to discuss with you. It turns out you are undocumented.  Technically, you are illegal in your presence in the United States, and  let us warn you that at any moment you could be stopped, arrested, and  deported. In fact, they might even drag many members of the family  along with you if that circumstance should apply.   Imagine growing up with that as a teenager, with all the things you  worry about in adolescence, worrying about a knock on the door and  deportation that might drag along other members of your family. That is  how these kids lived. That is how they grew up.   One of them came to my attention in Chicago. Her name is Tereza Lee.  Tereza came to the United States originally from Korea through Brazil.  She came to Chicago with her family on a visitor visa at the age of  2. Her family stayed. Most of them reached legal status, but they never  filed any papers for Tereza. She didn't discover until she was in high  school that she was an undocumented person in America.    She just happened to have an extraordinary talent as a musician. She  signed up for a program known as the MERIT Music Program. They taught  her how to play the piano, which she had already started learning. She  was found so phenomenal that by the end of her high school years, her  instructor said: Why don't you apply to the great music schools of  America--Juilliard or the Manhattan conservatory of music?   She started to fill out the application with her mom and came to the  section where it said ``citizenship,'' and she said: What are we  supposed to put there, Mom?   And her mom said: I don't know. We better call the office of Senator  Durbin.   They called us, and we learned for the first time of Tereza's  situation. Under the law of America, despite the fact that this 2-year- old girl who arrived in the United States and now is 18 years of age-- under the laws of the United States, she was compelled to leave the  United States for 10 years and apply to come back in.   How could you do that? She didn't choose to come to this country. She  didn't choose not to file for the right legal papers. She was the  victim of this situation. So, on her behalf, I introduced the DREAM  Act, and over the years, I have tried my level best in every way  imaginable to pass it and make it the law of the land so that young  people just like her can have a chance to earn their way to permanent  status in the United States and ultimately to citizenship.   I often fail to tell the end of this story, and I want to tell it  because many people say: What ever happened to Tereza Lee? Well, the  fact is, she was accepted by the Manhattan conservatory of music, and  these wonderful people in Chicago--including my dear friend Joan  Harris--said: We will pay for her education. She is so good.   They did it. She finished. She married an American Jazz musician and  [[Page S4538]]  became an American citizen by virtue of that decision. They now have  three children. She just emailed me last week. She just got her Ph.D.  in music. She has performed in Carnegie Hall. She is an amazing young  woman. She was the first Dreamer.   That is not a unique story. I have come to the floor over 100 times  and told stories just like that of young people brought to the United  States who are remarkable and who could really add so much to this  country.   There have been some 800,000 Dreamers who have come forward to sign  up for DACA, the program we discussed earlier. DACA, under President  Obama, by Executive order, unleashed the full potential of many of  these Dreamers for the first time. They could be public about their  status, go to college, and do things they dreamed of. Many of them  today are contributing to this country as soldiers and teachers and  owners of small businesses and healthcare workers.   More than 200,000 DACA recipients are essential, critical,  infrastructure workers. That is not my term; that is a term of the  Donald Trump Department of Homeland Security. That is how they are  classified: essential, critical infrastructure workers; 200,000--a  fourth of the DACA recipients. Among them are 41,700 DACA recipients in  the healthcare industry--doctors, intensive care nurses, paramedics,  respiratory therapists, and health professionals like the one I will  talk about in just a moment.   But on September 5, 2017, despite his assurances to me and so many  others that he would take special care of these young people, these  Dreamers, President Trump repealed DACA. Hundreds of thousands of  Dreamers faced losing their work permits and being deported out of the  United States to countries they didn't even remember.   Federal courts stepped in and ordered the Trump administration to  continue the DACA Program while they resolved in court whether the  President's actions were proper. However, Dreamers who have not  received DACA protection have been blocked from applying for this  protection now for almost 3 years. For example, children cannot apply  for DACA until they reach the age of 15. The Center for American  Progress estimates that approximately 300,000 Dreamers have been unable  to apply for this program since President Trump abolished it--or tried  to--on September 5, 2017. Fifty-five thousand of those young people  have turned 15 in that period of time.   Since the Supreme Court decision more than a month ago, the Trump  administration--the Trump administration--has failed to comply with  Chief Justice of the Supreme Court John Roberts' order rejecting the  repeal of DACA and requiring the Trump administration to reopen the  program. The Trump administration is knowingly avoiding and violating  the order of this Court.   Two weeks ago, I joined with Senator Kamala Harris in leading a  letter from 33 Senators to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security,  Chad Wolf. Our letter called on the Trump administration to immediately  comply with the Supreme Court decision and reopen DACA for those who  want to seek admission or at least protection under that program. So  far, of course, we have not received a response to our letter, but that  is not unusual with this administration.   Ten days ago, a Federal judge issued an order for the Trump  administration to follow the law and follow the order of the Supreme  Court and begin accepting new applications for DACA. So earlier today,  Acting Secretary Chad Wolf of the Department of Homeland Security  finally responded. Here is what he said: ``The Department of Homeland  Security will take action to thoughtfully consider the future of DACA  policy, including whether to fully rescind the program.'' He said: ``In  the interim, DHS will reject all initial requests for DACA.'' That is  in open defiance of the order of the Supreme Court in the decision  issued by Chief Justice John Roberts--open defiance by the President  and his administration. What on Earth is this supposed to mean?    If the Trump administration wants to repeal DACA again--and I pray  that they won't--they can certainly try, and they can see if that  action would be arbitrary, capricious, or would somehow withstand legal  scrutiny. But under our system of separation of powers, the executive  branch of government does not get to ``thoughtfully consider'' whether  to comply with a Supreme Court order for some undefined period of time.   Let's be clear. The Supreme Court rejected the repeal of DACA. That  means DACA returns to its original status, and the Trump administration  must reopen the program, and they must do it now. Instead, Mr. Wolf is  saying the DHS is going to turn away 300,000 Dreamers eligible for DACA  who have not had a chance to apply because the case has been in court.   Mr. Wolf claims the administration is following the law, but it is  notable that the Department of Homeland Security website still features  a statement from a DHS official saying the Supreme Court's decision  ``has no basis in law.''   After the Supreme Court decision, President Trump tweeted: ``I have  wanted to take care of DACA recipients better than the Do Nothing  Democrats, but for 2 years they have refused to negotiate.'' Well, here  is the reality, and it isn't the President's tweet. The President has  rejected numerous bipartisan deals to protect the Dreamers.   Take one example--February 15, 2018. The Senate considered bipartisan  legislation by Republican Senator Mike Rounds and Independent Senator  Angus King. The bill, which included a path to citizenship for  Dreamers, was supported by a bipartisan majority of Senators. It failed  to reach 60 votes that it needed to pass the Senate because President  Trump opposed it. Remember when he said that the Democrats were at  fault here, that there were no bipartisan measures to solve the  problem? Here was a bipartisan measure that he openly opposed. On the  same day, the Senate voted on the President's immigration proposal. The  Trump plan failed by a bipartisan majority of 39 to 60.   Over the years, I have come to the floor of the Senate many times to  tell the stories of Dreamers. These stories tell the whole story, as  far as I am concerned, as to what is at stake with the future of DACA  and the Dream Act.   Let me tell you the story today about this young man, Juan Alvarez-- 125th Dreamer--whom I have come to the floor to introduce to the Senate  and the people who are watching.   He came to the United States from Mexico at 3 years of age and grew  up in Compton, CA. A great student. From a young age, he wanted to get  involved in healthcare, but because of his immigration status-- undocumented--he was unable to attend medical or nursing school.  Instead, he went to the California State University in Long Beach,  where he completed a bachelor of science degree in nutrition and  dietetics. Today, thanks to DACA, Juan is working as a dietitian at an  acute care hospital in Los Angeles.   He sent me a letter, and here is what he said:         I never imagined that I would be able to work in the field       that I love and am passionate about--but thanks to DACA, that       was made possible. Simply said, DACA has opened doors for me       that I once thought were bolted shut and completely out of       reach.    Now, Juan Alvarez is on the frontline of the coronavirus pandemic. He  is part of this hospital's critical care team treating patients with  coronavirus. Juan's role is to ensure that patients receive adequate  nutrition during their hospital stay so they survive. Here is what he  said about this experience:         I am in constant fear of being infected and then infecting       my family. But as an essential healthcare worker, I continue       to show up to work and put myself at risk so that I can       continue to serve my patients. While I do it to continue to       help my patients and make sure that they are well nourished       and strong enough to fight off the virus, I cannot set aside       how worried I am myself.    I want to thank Juan Alvarez for his service. He is an immigrant  health hero. He is a DACA health hero. He is putting himself and his  family at risk to save the lives of other Americans. He shouldn't have  to worry about whether he is going to be deported.   Will America be a stronger country if we tell him to leave or if we  send him back to Mexico, which he doesn't even remember, or if we allow  him to become a citizen and to use his skills and education and  training to continue to help others? I think the answer is clear.   Juan and hundreds of thousands of other Dreamers are counting on  those  [[Page S4539]]  of us who serve in the Senate to solve this crisis that President Trump  has created.   I am sorry there was an objection to the Dream and Promise Act today.  So long as I am a U.S. Senator, I will continue to come to this floor  day after day, week after week, and month after month until the Senate  gives Juan Alvarez a chance to become part of America's future. It  would be an American tragedy to deport this wonderful and talented  young healthcare worker who is literally saving lives as we meet today  in the Senate.   We must ensure that Juan and hundreds of thousands of others in our  essential workforce are not forced to stop when the need for their  service has never been greater. We must give them the chance they  deserve to become part of the American family.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
