 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, yesterday, the Senate completed an  extremely productive day by confirming three members of President  Biden's Cabinet. Today, we are going to keep up the pace by moving the  ball forward on two more of the President's nominees.   First, the Senate will begin the process of bringing Xavier Becerra's  nomination to the floor to serve as HHS Secretary. This is a critical  position as we continue to battle the virus, and I am perplexed that  none of my Republican colleagues would vote for him. He is a capable  man, and he has worked hard to make sure that people get healthcare.  Some have said: Well, he is not a doctor. Neither was the previous  Trump nominee for HHS, who happened to be a pharmaceutical company  executive. Whom would Americans prefer?   Second, the Senate will move forward with another very historic  nominee who makes us so proud, Representative Deb Haaland of New  Mexico, to serve as the next Secretary of the Interior. She will be  confirmed on Monday. Representative Haaland was elected to the Congress  in 2018. She was the first Native American woman, along with  Representative Sharice Davids of Kansas, to ever serve in the people's  House. If confirmed, Representative Haaland will not only become the  first Native American to lead the Department of the Interior, but she  will be the first Native American to serve in any Cabinet position in  American history. We have had a Vice President with Native American  roots but never a Cabinet official.   Given the long and troubled relationship between the Federal  Government and Tribal nations, the ascension of Representative Haaland  to the top of the Interior Department is a profoundly important moment  for America as we advance on the long road--still not fully traveled at  all--toward equality. For too long, Tribal nations have been denied a  seat at the table where decisions were made that impacted their lives  and their land. Not only will Secretary Haaland ensure that they get a  seat, she will bring her own lived experiences to the table alongside  them.   Under President Trump, the Department of the Interior became one of  the most scandal-ridden Agencies in the history of the Federal  Government. It gave oil and mining companies carte blanche to drill in  wildlife reserves. It rolled back environmental protections and greatly  undermined trust in the Federal Government and Tribal lands.   Representative Haaland will move the Department in a dramatically  different direction. One of her most important responsibilities will be  to restore and uphold the Federal Government's obligations to sovereign  Tribal nations. I cannot think of a better candidate to take on this  job than Representative Haaland, and I greatly look forward to  confirming her. It will be historic.   Now, in general, Madam President, the Senate is making great progress  in installing President Biden's highly qualified nominees. So far, we  have already confirmed 16 Cabinet-level appointments. We are set to  increase that number to 18 after Secretaries Haaland and Becerra are  approved. Every single one of the President's nominees has been  confirmed with a bipartisan vote here on the Senate floor. President  Biden deserves to have his team in place, and the Senate is moving  quickly to get the job done.                            ____________________     Now, Madam President, on the American Rescue Plan,  [[Page S1478]]  which finally cleared the hurdle in Congress yesterday by passing the  House, it is now only a Presidential signature away from becoming law.  Soon--very soon--the most sweeping recovery effort in recent history  will get underway.   Direct checks will be delivered to American families from coast to  coast--roughly, 85 percent of all households. The American people can  expect those $1,400 checks for each person in the family to be  delivered by the end of March, and we are making amazingly good  progress on vaccines. Vaccines will be available far more quickly to  far more people.   Just this morning, the Biden administration announced an expansion of  the vaccine program, and I was able to announce that more than 100  community health centers in my home State of New York will be eligible  to get their own, dedicated supply of vaccines. There is a brand new  vaccine supercharge for New York and for some of the rest of the Nation  as well--the crux: more vaccines and more sites to administer them.  Over 100 sites will be set up across New York State to administer a  massive influx of new shot supplies.   There is light at the end of this COVID tunnel, which has always been  centered on access to a free vaccine for all New Yorkers. More access  and more shots mean a quicker recovery, and that is what we want, and  that is becoming available for my home State of New York and for the  entire Nation.   The CHC sites, or community health center sites, will be federally  funded and organized by the Department of Health and Human Services--a  huge expansion. We have all heard numerous stories of people having to  travel too far to get the vaccine, hampering our ability to recover and  return to normal. With this announcement of more vaccines and more New  York sites to administer them, New Yorkers have something to celebrate,  and I thank the President for working with us to make this effort real  and to bring it to every State in the Nation. Other things are  happening, too.   Our schools will receive critical assistance to update their  infrastructure, hire more teachers and tutors, and prepare to reopen as  fast and as safely as possible.   There is going to be money for broadband. There are going to be  dollars for rural hospitals. There are going to be dollars to help our  Tribal nations--all who are suffering. The new RESTAURANTS Act, which  is so important to so many of our States, is becoming law. More money  for Save our Stages to help our arts institutions is coming.   Perhaps the thing that we are the most proud of--although there are  so many in this bill--is helping people with their pensions and making  sure those who are laid off still get healthcare by funding COBRA  fully.   There are so many good things for average working families, but maybe  the most important of all--who knows? There are so many good things in  this bill--is the child tax credit, which will cut childhood poverty in  half. When a child is born into poverty at no fault of his or her own,  they don't get adequate nutrition. They don't get adequate healthcare.  They don't get adequate housing. They don't get adequate education.  Then, when they get to young adulthood, they have nowhere to go, and  then they get blamed for their plight. The better, smarter, more  effective thing to do is to help them get out of poverty early so they  can lead good, productive lives as citizens and as taxpayers. We are  doing that for the first time here, and I hope it is something that we  can continue.   Simply put, the American Rescue Plan is one of the most significant  pieces of legislation to pass the Congress in recent history.   Yesterday, I started describing in more detail some of the lesser  known aspects of the plan. Everyone knows that vaccines are coming,  that $1,400 checks are coming, that money for schools is coming, and  now people know of the child tax credit, but there are lots of other  things in this bill. Today, I want to continue by talking about another  unheralded provision: assistance to Native communities. It is a topic  very much on theme today given the nomination of Secretary Haaland.   One of the most tragic features of the COVID-19 pandemic is how  destructive it has been for America's Tribal nations. Native Americans  have faced the highest risk of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths  due to COVID-19--bar none, the highest. Early in the crisis, the Navajo  Nation, to take one example, saw more cases per capita than any other  State in the country. Decades of an unraveling social safety net,  declining economic opportunity, an overburdened health system, and the  failure of the Federal Government to honor its trust obligations to  American Tribes left Native communities unequipped to handle the  crisis. But in the American Rescue Plan, the Democrats will deliver the  single largest investment in Native communities in our Nation's  history. We are very proud of that. It is historic--the single largest  investment in Native communities in our Nation's history. More than  $31.2 billion in direct funding will go to Tribes and communities to  defeat this pandemic and rebuild their communities; $20 billion  directly to Tribal governments so they can stabilize essential  services; $6 billion to the Indian Health Service, not just for  vaccines and testing and tracing but to improve and restore these  rural, long-neglected hospitals; hundreds of millions more for Native  education; $10 million will go to just making sure communities can  access clean water.   Listen to the items I just mentioned: clean water, keeping hospitals  running, connecting kids to broadband. These are absolute necessities,  and the American Rescue Plan is going to dedicate resources to all of  them for Indian Country.   I want to thank a whole bunch of my colleagues. So many contributed,  but the chair of the Indian Affairs Committee, Senator Schatz, and  Senators Tester and Cantwell and Smith and Kelly and Ben Ray Lujan and  Heinrich are very, very important. Senator Heinrich particularly pushed  for broadband. So it was a team effort, and I am proud of my  colleagues.   The American Rescue Plan takes us a giant step closer to fulfilling  our trust responsibilities to all Native Americans, Alaska Natives, and  Native Hawaiians. This is just one example, an important one, as to how  the rescue plan will dramatically improve the lives of millions of  people in this great country of ours.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 26.
