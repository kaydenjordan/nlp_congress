 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I first want to commend Chairman Goodlatte  and Congressman King and others who worked on H.R. 1215, the Protecting  Access to Care Act, which aims to address the real problem of junk  lawsuits in the context of medical care.   Seventy-five percent of the doctors will face a malpractice lawsuit  over the course of their careers, and many of these claims are  frivolous, which drives up the cost of healthcare, encourages defensive  medicine, and contributes to the Nation's severe shortage of doctors  and nurses, especially in high-risk areas such as obstetrics,  neurosurgery, and emergency medicine.   We need to enact sensible medical malpractice reform, and given the  clear Federal interest in reducing taxpayer costs wherever Federal  policy affects the distribution of healthcare, I support H.R. 1215.   However, H.R. 1215 does not go far enough to discourage the practice  of defensive medicine, the provision of health services, tests, and  procedures designed to shield the provider from legal liability but  which may not be medically necessary or in the best interests of the  patient.   Defensive medicine is a major driver of healthcare costs and also  reduces the quality of patient care.                                time  1615    In that spirit, I offer this amendment, which would expand upon the  reforms in H.R. 1215, to protect physicians from frivolous lawsuits,  while promoting the practice of evidence-based medicine to lower costs  and improve healthcare quality.   My amendment offers a legal safe harbor in the form of an affirmative  defense for defendants who can show that they adhered to clinical  practice guidelines in their area of medical practice. Rather than  Washington-based care, the guidelines would be developed by the  physician community-based on the best available scientific evidence.  This allows doctors to focus on practicing medicine and improves  healthcare quality by encouraging the practice of evidence-based, not  defensive medicine.   A New England Journal of Medicine study on clinical practice  guidelines and tort reform stated that ``Safe harbor rules hold promise  for realigning legal incentives with good medical practice and  promoting fast uptake of proven modes of care.'' By promoting adherence  to clinical practice guidelines that are already maintained by medical  specialty groups, this amendment would encourage physicians to provide  higher quality care, while reducing medical errors and waste.   Several States have already adopted safe harbor legislation and have  significantly lowered the length and costs associated with medical  malpractice cases. My amendment would build on the success of State  safe harbor laws by expanding it to a national level, while not  infringing on States' ability to implement additional tort reform.   Americans deserve healthcare reform that will help lower the cost of  care and protect the sacred doctor-patient relationship. The current  reforms within H.R. 1215 are an important first step to reducing the  high costs of medical malpractice claims. My amendment will further  strengthen this legislation to promote affordable evidence-based  patient care, reduce defensive medicine, and allow health professionals  to focus on patients' actual needs.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, in brief response to my friend from  Tennessee, the safe harbor legislation would not supplant the standard  of care, but it would allow for evidence-based medicine to improve  healthcare quality. Those standards would be developed by local doctors  participating in their medical societies.   Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King), my  friend.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for those comments.   Mr. Chairman, the clinical practice guideline safe harbor policies  have been supported by the American for Tax Reform, American College of  Radiology, Healthcare Leadership Council, American Academy of  Orthopedic Surgeons, American Society of Anesthesiologists, American  Academy of Neurology, American Urological Association, American College  of Surgeons, American Health Care Association, American College of  Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American Association of Neurological  Surgeons, Alliance of Specialty Medicine, Third Way, American College  of Physicians, American College of Emergency Physicians, American  Osteopathic Association, American College of Cardiologists, and the  American Academy of Ophthalmology.   As originally drafted, the amendment set forth the procedure in  detail.   Nevertheless, the process by which clinical practice guidelines are  proved and published is well established and well known. The text of  the amendment clearly references that existing and well-defined process  that provides for guidelines to be proposed, submitted, approved, and  published through the National Guideline Clearinghouse under the Agency  for Healthcare Research and Quality. This is a process that ensures the  integrity and quality of the applicable guidelines.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
