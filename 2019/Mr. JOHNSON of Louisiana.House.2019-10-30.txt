 Mr. Chairman, I appreciate my colleague's  presentation here. It is clear and concise, and he raises important  points.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 2181, the Chaco Cultural  Heritage Area Protection Act, as well.   Mr. Chairman, this is a flawed bill. It is simply another attempt by  our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to prevent our country  from taking the next steps in this era of American energy dominance.   What is important here is that American energy dominance is a great  strategy. It is a strategy that helps all Americans, those in this  immediate area and around the country.   The legislation before us will, of course, permanently restrict oil  and gas development in the area immediately surrounding the Chaco  Culture National Historical Park.   Now, bear in mind, of course, as has been pointed out here,  exploration is already restricted within the park; and, of course, that  is rightfully so. But it is bad policy to create an arbitrary buffer  zone for a prohibition on development in the area around the park.   In this Congress, our friends on the other side of the aisle have  made their priorities crystal clear regarding the management of our  country's resources. So far, they have placed moratoriums on oil and  gas production in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, in the Pacific and  Atlantic planning areas, and in ANWR. Apparently, that is not enough.  What we are hearing today is that now we need to ban production in the  New Mexico areas, as well.   Mr. Chairman, at what point do we say enough is enough?   The evidence shows, time and again, that placing restrictions on  energy development only increases prices for American consumers. And  make no mistake, these increases have the largest impact on our most  vulnerable communities.                                time  1500    I said this on the floor in September--many of us have--and I will  say it again today, the United States is blessed because our land is  filled with an abundance of natural resources. My own congressional  district back in Louisiana is home of one of the largest natural gas  reserves in the country.   We believe, we insist that we have the means and the responsibility  to use those God-given resources to create jobs, foster economic  growth, and pave the way to an era of American energy dominance.  Oppressive policies like the ones before us today have been our own  worst enemy.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill.
