Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include any extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from Florida?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, as I stand here tonight before you, in my  hometown of Orlando, thousands of people are gathered at Lake Eola Park  like they were 1 year ago to mourn, honor, and pay tribute to the 49  lives we lost on January 12, 2016. We were with them earlier today. We  would love to be with them tonight, as we were last year, but we are  here doing the job we were elected to do.   I am joined tonight by my colleague--I am absolutely honored to serve  with him--Representative Darren Soto. We stand here tonight on the  floor of the House of Representatives together so the world will not  forget the lives we lost in the Pulse nightclub shooting.   It was supposed to be like any other Saturday night for the men and  women inside the Pulse nightclub. I can only imagine the excitement  they shared that evening as they celebrated birthdays and friendships.  Mr. Speaker, they were out for what my bishop likes to call late-night  fellowship.   Then, at 2:20 a.m., when everyone was closing their tabs for the  night and about to head home, it was then that an ISIS-inspired gunman,  motivated by hate, walked into the club and opened fire. Within a  matter of minutes, he was able to kill 49 people and wound so many  others. The innocent men and women in the club didn't stand a chance  against him that night.   We lost 49 lives. Their full potential will never be known, and we  will always wonder, when we think about their lives, what could have  been. Many others continue to recover from their visible and invisible  wounds.   In the days and weeks following the Nation's deadliest mass shooting,  we saw our community come together in beautiful ways. We mourned with  those who lost their loved ones. We came out in droves to donate blood  for the survivors who needed it. We showed support and gratitude for  our law enforcement officers, our first responders, and the nurses and  doctors who acted with courage and bravery in the face of unimaginable  tragedy.   We embraced and celebrated the diversity that makes Orlando ``The  City Beautiful.'' We showed the world that we are a city who defeats  hate with love.   One year after the shooting, the wounds are still fresh and the scars  are still not fully healed, but our community is resilient and united  in the face of this tragedy.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague from Florida, (Mr. Soto).    I want to thank my colleague from Florida (Mr. Soto)  for that very beautiful and inspiring poem that really captures not  only the tragedy that occurred in Orlando at the Pulse Nightclub that  night, but the heroic acts, how our community came together, and really  provides the hope that our community needs in moving forward.   Mr. Speaker, no one can tell the story better than the family members  who lost their loved ones that night, the survivors who were within the  club that night. At this time, we would like to share some of the  letters from family members and survivors.   The first letter that I would like to share comes from a mother who,  if you were watching at all during the early hours of this tragic  incident, this particular mother was going around asking anyone who she  could about her son, trying to find him, trying to get word of him. I  would like to share a mother's story from Christine Leinonen.   ``My son was one of the 49 people killed at Pulse Nightclub on June  12 of 2016. Those were 49 humans who collectively could have lived  another 2,500 years. That is longer than we have had civilization. They  were moms, dads, siblings, kids, straight, gay, Latino, Asian,  Caucasian. They were your constituents. They deserved better than to  die in a flurry of bullets.   ``My son Chris was a happy, quirky, goofy young man and had been from  baby on. He was every mother's dream to hit the kid lottery. He was an  only child, and I never married. I couldn't have loved him more.   ``He became a licensed mental health therapist. He loved his work and  his personal life.   ``Chris had many friends. Chris and his boyfriend, Juan, were one of  at least three couples to die together that night: another Juan and two  Luises. Chris was one of two Christophers to die that night and at  least six Christophers who died or survived. The magnitude of the  killing is that there were so many names repeated.   ``My son was a loving and giving person. He was someone who was going  to be my right-hand man as I became old and incapacitated. Now I have  no one.   ``Chris lived his life with love and kindness. He was a walking,  talking United Nations, inclusive of all; not by design, but because he  cared about character, not race, gender, sexuality, or ethnicity. He  lived a life of inclusion. You would have loved him if you knew him,  whether he was your child or friend or cousin or coworker. The world  has a little less joy without him in it.   ``Hugs and kisses, Christopher's mom.''   And at this time, I would like to yield to my colleague from Florida  (Mr. Soto), who will continue to share.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Soto for his  remarks.   I would like to continue to share letters from the survivors of  Pulse. The next letter that I will share comes from Brandon Wolf.   ``It is hard to believe it has been a year. That Saturday night was  like any other: loud music, skinny jeans, cheap drinks. Alongside my  best friends, Drew Leinonen and Juan Guerrero, I was as free as ever.  Standing outside on the patio, in his typical way, Drew tossed his arm  around my shoulders and spoke his last words to me: `You know what we  never say enough? That we love each other.' ''   Those were the last words that Drew spoke that evening.   `` . . . I learned a lesson from Orlando's recovery: that equality  and unity aren't trophies, and the journey we are on isn't over. We  can't take our eyes off the prize or forget what lies ahead.   ``We have to disarm hate. Silence it. Snuff it out. Replace it with  the same message Drew had for me: love.   ``Brandon Wolf.''   At this time, I yield to my colleague from Florida (Mr. Soto) to  share another letter regarding this tragic incident.    Mr. Speaker, at this time, I would like to share a  survivor's letter by the name of Joshua McGill.   ``My name is Joshua McGill, and I was there the night of the Pulse  shooting a year ago.   ``Although nothing will ever take away that tragic night for me and  the fellow LGBTQ community, not only for Orlando, but for all people  around the world that were affected by this form of hate towards our  community, I must say that we have not let hate win thus far, and  continue to spread love and prayers for one another and for the other  families and victims that were either there that night, or affected in  some way.   ``It has been a true honor in seeing how close everyone has come  together. It shows our strength as a whole and the love that we can all  provide for one another in a time of need.   ``The continuance of all of this gives me hope for my future in the  community and in the world. May God bless you and everyone out there.   ``I've become a stronger person since then, and if my strength can  help others, I want to.   ``Thank you for hearing my words.   ``Joshua McGill.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield again to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Soto),  my colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to share this last survival  letter for tonight. It is from Eric Borrero. It says:   ``Dear Congress,   ``It is to me how fast one year has gone by. The horrifying emotions  and feeling of that night have not fleeted. Instead, they lay dormant  in the recesses of my mind, bubbling up like lava in a moment's notice  from unforeseen triggers.   ``It is like living on a roller coaster: having great moments over  the past year, making things feel absolutely normal; and extreme lows,  feeling as if I will never come out of the darkness.   ``Even through the disturbing images of the past, I am optimistic  about the future I have ahead of me. I can fully grasp that life will  never go back to the normal that I once knew, but this experience has  helped me focus on what is needed in the world. That is love and  inclusion for all people.   ``Over the past year, I have had the most amazing support system of  friends and family, who have been there for me as I have cried and  battled the demons that lay with me when I sleep.   ``These feelings have not changed since that night, but I remain  positive and stand with my LGBTQ and Latinx brothers and sisters for a  better future for everyone.   ``Regards,   ``Eric Borrero.''   Mr. Speaker, I would like to share that, today, Representative Soto,  Representative Stephanie Murphy, and I introduced a resolution to  recognize and mark one year since the Pulse tragedy. We were joined by  143 Members of Congress, Democrats and Republicans, who are standing to  show the community of Orlando that we stand with them in support; that  Congress will not forget the victims, the survivors, the first  responders, and the communities that are shattered by the hands of  domestic terrorists; and that we will do everything we can to prevent  future mass shootings, and take care of the people who are left  standing in the wake of these tragedies.    Mr. Speaker, our community declared June 12, 2017, Orlando United  Day, a day of love and kindness. All across our community, people are  coming together to honor the victims by volunteering and attending  vigils and memorials.   We are a community that will never forget. We won't forget those 49  innocent men and women who were sons, daughters, mothers, husbands,  wives, students, teachers, entrepreneurs, and dreamers, who had a lot  of life left to live. We are a community that will continue to honor  these men and women, not through our words, but through our actions.   Mr. Speaker, I thank God for Representative Soto, for his service to  our community. I am honored to serve with him in the United States  Congress. I appreciate the work that he has done for the last several  years throughout our community. I was honored to share this Special  Order with him.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Soto).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
