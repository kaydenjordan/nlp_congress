 Madam Speaker, by providing more than $12 billion in  disaster relief to various Federal departments and agencies, we can  ensure that communities have the resources and funds that they need to  rebuild. H.R. 268 confirms our commitment to communities like my  district and my State that are often hardest hit by natural disasters.   This rule funds crucial infrastructure projects that will better  equip our hurricane centers in tracking, predicting, and forecasting  large storms. It increases nutrition assistance programs, including  $600 million for Puerto Rico. In addition, over $1 billion will be  available to cover crop losses in many parts of the country.   But critical to implementing this bill is an amendment to reopen the  government. Without the government open, Federal agencies, States, and  communities are having difficulty accessing disaster aid. Anyone who  cares about disaster relief should be voting for this bill, which will  end the shutdown, open the government, and help people across this  country who have been victims of national disasters.
