 Madam Speaker, on behalf of the people of  Nevada's Third District, I rise today for the 288,000 Nevadans with  Medicaid, thanks to the Affordable Care Act;   For the thousands of young Nevadans under the age of 26 who can stay  on their parent's health plan, thanks to the Affordable Care Act;   For the nearly 350,000 Nevada seniors on Medicare part D who are now  paying less for their prescription drugs, thanks to the Affordable Care  Act;   For the 20 million Americans who are scared right now of losing the  healthcare they have finally received, thanks to the Affordable Care  Act; and   For the 1.2 million Nevadans and 130 million Americans with asthma,  high blood pressure, ALS, cancer, cystic fibrosis, depression, HIV, and  other diseases, for their preexisting conditions that will not be  protected if the Affordable Care Act is dismantled.   Look, it is pretty simple. If the lower court decision in Texas v.  United States lawsuit stands, millions could lose their health  insurance. I stand for every one of those Americans, and we should all  stand for them.                            ____________________
