 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize our Nation's  public servants and to thank them for their important contributions to  our country.   In every community across America, Federal employees work to make  sure our government is effective and keeps us safe. Their daily  contributions to their fellow citizens, and to the cause of freedom,  are simply immeasurable. In America's First District, there are many  hardworking and dedicated patriots who serve the people of this Nation  every day.   As we celebrate Public Service Recognition Week, which started on  Sunday, May 6, and ends on Saturday, May 12, I want to express my  utmost gratitude to the country's Federal employees, as well as our  dedicated State, county, and local public servants for their tireless  service. I am proud to represent the tens of thousands of Federal  employees, retirees, and local and State government officials who live  in the First District of Virginia.   The Federal workforce is full of dedicated and committed citizens who  exemplify patriotism in everything they do. I hope my colleagues will  join me in honoring them for their service to ensure the security of  our Nation.                            ____________________
