 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember and  honor Coach Jack Miller of Tybee Island, Georgia, who passed away on  June 23 at the age of 91.   Jack dedicated his life to mentoring and inspiring young athletes in  the community. Jack's head coaching career started at Vidalia High  School in 1961 and would span 53 years at 11 different schools. He  recorded over 700 wins during his career.   Jack was defined by his work ethic, which he passed along to his  players. As a lifetime coach, mentor, and motivator, Jack earned  numerous awards throughout his career, including the Nike Coach of the  Year Lifetime Achievement Award and the John F. Hodges Oasis Award for  his outstanding achievement in sports in Savannah.   The only thing he loved more than coaching was his loving family and  friends.   Jack's positive impact on his players went well beyond his athletic  fields, and I know his legacy will remain. My thoughts and prayers are  with his family, friends, and all those who knew him during this most  difficult time.                            ____________________
