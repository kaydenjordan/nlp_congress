 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Judge  David Taunton, who passed away peacefully at the age of 80 on November  8.   As the longest serving judge in Gulf County, Florida, Judge Taunton  will be remembered by many for his unending dedication to children and  providing them with a second chance.   Judge Taunton and his wife, Abigail, dedicated their lives to opening  a shelter for homeless children. In 1978, the Taunton Family Children's  Home welcomed its first child, and since then, over 400 children have  called the Taunton Family Children's Home their own. Abigail and the  judge made sure that each child was raised as if they were their own  child.   Judge Taunton has impacted so many lives through his optimism,  unconditional love, and mentorship. In addition to serving as a judge  for 20 years, David Taunton served as a logger, a school principal, a  church pastor, and an editor of his newspaper.   Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring the legacy and life of  Judge David Taunton. He will be missed by many.                            ____________________
