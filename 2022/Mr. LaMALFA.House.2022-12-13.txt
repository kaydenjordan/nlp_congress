 Mr. Speaker, first, I want to congratulate northern  California's Orland High School. Their boys' football team just won the  California State championship with a grueling 20-7 win, on a very muddy  field at Orland Stadium, over Shafter High School.   Indeed, the muddy field affects both teams equally, and Orland was  able to dig it out with a great running effort--159 yards by the  quarterback in order to pull the victory off. He scored all three  touchdowns.   It was, indeed, the first in many years of a State championship for  Orland as they pulled this off in an amazing fashion after a lot of  rain in northern California.   Congratulations to Orland High School boys for a great effort, going  15 and 0, and winning the CIF championship for all of California.                          California's Water Supply     Mr. Speaker, this is a topic I have spent a lot of time  on here on this floor talking about. It is where our food supply comes  from in this Nation. With the shortsighted efforts we have had by our  regulators at the Federal and State levels, food is shorter in this  country than it ever has been in quite a few years, and for no good  reason.   As I point out on this chart here, my home State of California, many  of our food products are grown in California that the U.S. relies upon.  These products you see here, over 90 percent, some of them 100 percent,  come from California.   If they weren't grown in California, they would have to come from  somewhere else. We would have to import them. We would have to do  without. We would have to switch to some other type of food product  that we didn't like as well, or just have less choice.   Why is this happening? In part because the water supply for these  farms has been around for decades and, indeed, the water systems in  California, the Central Valley Project, which is Federal, the State  water project, which is State level, were developed with harnessing the  water that we have so plentiful in the north and using it throughout  the State.   Indeed, in drought periods, these systems were designed to hold us  through drought for up to 5 years when the dam was full beforehand in  order to do what people need to farm their crops and take care of the  needs of the cities, manufacturing, et cetera.   In California, of the 100 percent water pie, 50 percent goes for  environmental needs. Fifty percent goes to keep fish colder and wetter,  to let water run out to the Pacific, to keep the saltwater intrusion in  the delta at bay, so to speak. Forty percent, traditionally, has gone  to agriculture, and 10 percent is what has gone to urban and domestic  use.   That 40 percent that agriculture has received has had a big bite  taken out of it. Hundreds of thousands of acres have been idled in  California, just in my area, in the north. At least 250,000 acres of  rice crops alone, as well as other water supply that goes toward  almonds, walnuts, prunes, and many other crops, has been taken away.   We want to blame the drought. Yes, we have had some level of drought.  But in 2021, I would also remind you, we had a huge amount of rainfall  in October and a vast snowpack in December 2021.   This year, we are enjoying a good amount of rainfall already in  November and December, which will help replenish our lakes.   But what are the water managers, so to speak, in the Federal and  State governments doing? Are they indeed keeping the water in the lakes  so that we would have the ability to draw upon that water and continue  farming crops in California?   Again, this isn't just for California farmers, for the California  economy. This is something all Americans rely upon for these food  products that are more numerous than I can even list on this chart  here.   What is happening in my northern part of the State, the Klamath Basin  that I also share on the Oregon side with my good colleague, Mr. Bentz?   The last few years they have taken the water supply from the farmers  up  [[Page H9699]]  there in that basin, in the Klamath Basin project--this is a project  that was built over 100 years ago to make more water available solely  for agriculture from the Klamath Lake. That is the original lake with  an additional supply.   Yet, the Bureau of Reclamation and environmental organizations and  agencies believe that is their water to take and try to mitigate fish  issues in the Klamath River. This kind of attitude has shifted all the  way through the Klamath, on down to the Sacramento River.   The Bureau of Reclamation needs to get its act together and be  reminded, again and again, that the Klamath project was developed for  agriculture, not to help mitigate fish issues that, truly, probably  can't really be solved.    On top of that, another thing the people of Klamath and the Siskiyou  and northern California area are suffering is that they want to remove  the dams that make hydroelectric power on the Klamath River by making a  regulatory scheme that is almost impossible for them to renew the  licenses.   That is how government does it. They make it too costly, too  impossible to continue to stay in business via the permit process.   So, hydroelectric power is going to be less in California, which is  already a tough thing on our power grid.   What is the big thing against the people of Klamath Basin? I don't  understand. We need food. We need electricity.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, from the beginning, our Nation's founding  was based upon the idea of defending our borders and defending our  people within it.   Yet, in a complete 180 from the original purpose, our top government  officials want our tax dollars to fund irreversible gender reassignment  surgery for children.   Chemical castrations, mastectomies, and hysterectomies for sex  reassignment on minors are life-altering decisions that are permanent  and should not be taken lightly. Moreover, the government has no  business paying for them with our tax dollars. It is not only  irresponsible but also flat-out dangerous and encourages irreversible  and sterilizing procedures on young people.   Mr. Speaker, 80 percent of young people who experience gender  dysphoria move on from that when they become adults.   Some doctors and teachers--sometimes even parents--pressure  vulnerable children into these invasive surgeries to keep in line with  their woke agenda. Adults have no business forcing these decisions upon  young people or making them themselves. Indeed, we have run legislation  here saying that this should not be a discussion for minors, they must  be at least 18 years old if they want to go through these procedures.   It is unacceptable the way adults, media, and government are putting  children entrusted in their care in these situations directly in harm's  way with irreversible, life-changing, and even suicide-inducing  decisions.                            ____________________
