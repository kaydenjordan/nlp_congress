 Mr. President, I rise today to highlight the heroes of my  home State of Maryland who are working on the frontlines to fight  COVID-19.   On January 21, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  announced the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the United States.  Since then, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States  has ballooned to over 1.2 million cases and over 72,000 Americans have  died.   The CDC has designated the Baltimore-Washington corridor as a  hotspot, as cases continue to rise in the region. As of May 6, there  have been 28,163 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 1,290 confirmed deaths  in the State of Maryland. These are trying, unprecedented times for all  communities in America, and Maryland is no different in this regard.   Fred Rogers once said that in times of crisis, times like these, we  should ``look for the helpers.'' I would like to take this time to  recognize some of the heroes who are helping communities in Maryland.   I am very proud of our State's hospitals, distilleries,  manufacturers, and biomedical and pharmaceutical companies that have  come together to perform their own testing, manufactured personal  protective equipment and hand sanitizers, and are at the forefront of  developing a vaccine.   Maryland is home to some of the world's premier academic medical  systems, including the University of Maryland Medical System and Johns  Hopkins University, which have been critical in preparing our State for  the pandemic.   I am particularly proud of Johns Hopkins' coronavirus tracking  system, which public health officials worldwide have come to rely on  for up-to-date, accurate information. I applaud Johns  [[Page S2314]]  Hopkins officials and staff creating the vital public health tool,  which has already proven itself critical to fighting this disease.   Lord Kelvin stated so long ago:         When you can measure what you are speaking about, and       express it in numbers, you know something about it; but when       you cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers,       your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind.    In the early days of the pandemic in Maryland, our State officials,  like officials in most States, were desperately searching for ways to  increase testing capacity. Johns Hopkins developed its own coronavirus  test to help meet demand.   The university has been especially helpful in Maryland's effort to  combat the virus in nursing homes. Johns Hopkins has closely  collaborated with local nursing homes to train their employees and test  residents to protect our most vulnerable populations.   I commend Johns Hopkins' ingenuity, which has been critical to  efforts to identify those afflicted with COVID-19 and to prevent the  spread of the virus.   The University of Maryland Medical System has stepped up to lead  efforts to address the devastating impact of COVID-19 in our State's  minority communities, which is likely due to the underlying healthcare  disparities. The university has assembled a team of public health  experts to execute the proposed Maryland Health Equity COVID-19  Consortium. The consortium will be critical to the developing of  strategies that inform our State's response efforts to protect our  communities of color, who are more susceptible to COVID-19.   Despite the immense burden Maryland's small businesses are facing,  they have stepped up to help local hospitals, nursing homes, and other  frontline workers.   Sagamore Spirits Distillery in Baltimore is one such small business.  Sagamore has completely converted its operation to distill corn ethanol  to produce hand sanitizers. The distillery is sourcing its corn from  Maryland farmers.   Hardwire, an armor company on the Eastern Shore in Pocomoke City, now  produces sustainable face shields that can last up to 6 months. By the  end of this week, Hardwire will have shipped out 1 million face shields  to healthcare workers, first responders, and others on the frontline in  the fight against COVID-19. The demand for Hardwire's face shield is so  great that it has hired 115 new employees, providing much needed  economic relief to communities on the Eastern Shore.   In addition, Maryland's world-leading biomedical and pharmaceutical  companies are working tirelessly to find a vaccine for COVID-19.   AstraZeneca, a pharmaceutical and life sciences company with research  and development facilities in Gaithersburg and Frederick, has partnered  with the University of Oxford on a potential vaccine that has already  entered phase 1 clinical trials.   Emergent BioSolutions in Rockville is collaborating with Johnson &  Johnson on its lead COVID-19 vaccine candidate. Emergent BioSolutions  will be providing contract development and manufacturing services in  Maryland to support Johnson & Johnson's recently announced commitment  to supply 1 billion vaccines worldwide.   I would be remiss if I did not also thank Maryland's frontline  healthcare workers who risk their lives every day to care for those  with COVID-19. These physicians, physician assistants, nurses, lab  technicians, EMT personnel, and many others go to work day after day  facing the unimaginable strain of caring for patients who are fighting  this deadly virus and comforting their families.   These examples are by no means exhaustive. There are countless other  healthcare providers, law enforcement agencies, nonprofits, small  businesses, higher education institutions, and individual Marylanders  pitching in to defeat COVID-19.   Marylanders are stocking grocery shelves, driving buses, delivering  groceries to elderly neighbors, hosting virtual events to keep families  and young children entertained as they continue to practice social  distancing, and they are making homemade face coverings for those who  need them. I have seen my neighbors come together to make lunch packs  for families in need.   The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., said, ``Everybody can be  great because anybody can serve.'' The COVID-19 pandemic is not testing  our character; it is revealing it. I am so proud to represent all the  great Marylanders who are serving on the frontlines, and I will  continue working as hard as I can to ensure that we in Congress are  doing everything we can to support them as they lead the fight against  COVID-19   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I rise to commemorate World Press  Freedom Day, which was this past Sunday, and to celebrate the brave  journalists all over the world who safeguard the values of truth,  democracy, transparency, and justice through their work. Every year, we  set aside this day to reaffirm our commitment to the free press. This  year, however, is a little bit different. This year, we are in the  midst of a brutal global public health crisis. One of the reasons that  the COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked so much havoc--taking hundreds of  thousands of lives and devastating the economy--is that people with  power have propagated misinformation about the virus. In the words of  the World Health Organization, we are witnessing an ``info-demic.''  Now, more than ever, it is vital that the public receives the truth,  and that means protecting the  [[Page S2319]]  free press. We are relying on the press to bring us crucial, often  life-saving, information about testing sites, shelter-in-place orders,  school closures, government aid, and how to keep ourselves and our  loved ones safe. That is why many States, Maryland among them, have  designated local news outlets as ``essential businesses'' that are  allowed to keep operating despite social distancing policies.   In a noble effort to keep the public informed, many local media  outlets have removed their paywalls for COVID-19-related news,  forfeiting desperately needed revenue. Meanwhile, COVID-19 continues to  place immense economic pressure on local news outlets and jeopardize  their ability to function at all. Dozens of local publications have had  to furlough reporters, reduce their publication frequency, or drop  their print editions completely. This financial nightmare comes on the  heels of more than a decade of hardship for local news.   Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic is not the only threat facing  journalists today. All around the globe, reporters face harassment and  persecution for their attempts to spread the truth and hold leaders  accountable. Reporters Without Borders has determined that at least 229  journalists worldwide currently are imprisoned for their work.  According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 25  journalists were killed around the world in 2019, and at least six  journalists and media professionals have been killed in the first 4  months of 2020 alone. Corrupt and powerful governments and individuals  understand that free expression is a mighty tool against injustice, so  they go to horrible lengths to stifle it.   One courageous reporter who was murdered for pursuing the truth was  Washington Post journalist and U.S. resident Jamal Khashoggi. The  Central Intelligence Agency concluded with high confidence and the  Senate unanimously approved a resolution stating that Saudi Government  officials executed and dismembered Mr. Khashoggi in 2018 at the behest  of Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammed bin Salman. To this day,  however, justice for this crime remains elusive. The Global Magnitsky  Act, which I authored with the late Senator John McCain to combat human  rights violations like this one, requires the U.S. administration to  declassify its findings regarding who was responsible for Mr.  Khashoggi's death and to impose additional sanctions on the culpable  parties. President Trump has refused to do so.   This failure to stand up for an American journalist an authoritarian  regime silenced is just one example of how the Trump administration has  turned its back on the freedom of the press. The President and his  supporters have continuously tried to demonize and delegitimize news  outlets whose reporting upsets them, to the point of labeling the media  an ``enemy of the American people.'' As the illustrious journalist  Edward R. Murrow so famously noted 66 years ago in responding to then- Senator Joe McCarthy's vile smear tactics and intimidation:         We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We must       remember always that accusation is not proof and that       conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law. We       will not walk in fear, one of another. We will not be driven       by fear into an age of unreason, if we dig deep in our       history and our doctrine, and remember that we are not       descended from fearful men--not from men who feared to write,       to speak, to associate, and to defend causes that were, for       the moment, unpopular.    When the leader of the United States, a country devoted to principles  of liberty and democracy, flouts the truth in this way, it reverberates  all across the world to the detriment of free expression everywhere.  Between 2016 and 2019, the number of journalists imprisoned on spurious  charges of disseminating so-called fake news more than tripled  globally.   We Americans feel the impact of this vilification of the press much  closer to home, too. I will never forget learning about the fatal  shooting at the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, MD, almost 2 years ago.  In the most deadly newsroom shooting in American history, a man who was  angry that the newspaper accurately and merely reported his guilty plea  in a criminal harassment case stormed into the Gazette office with a  gun and killed five people. Those individuals--Gerald Fishman, Rob  Hiaasen, John McNamara, Rebecca Smith, and Wendi Winters--died  defending one of the most sacred institutions in our country. They died  protecting every American's right to know the truth. But they and  hundreds of other journalists worldwide should not have to die in the  line of duty.   For the sake of our democracy and global human rights, we must do  everything we can to eliminate the violence and repression news media  face. The United States can help lead this effort by loudly voicing our  support for the free press as a key component of an informed civil  society and a government accountable to its people. That is why I am  proud to cosponsor Senator Menendez's resolution in honor of World  Press Freedom Day declaring the need for a truly free press and  condemning threats to the freedom of expression around the world. The  resolution applauds the bravery of journalists and media workers and  remembers those who have lost their lives in the course of their  duties.   We can also demonstrate our commitment to a free press by remembering  those journalists and media professionals who have lost their lives in  the course of their duties. To that end, Senator Portman and I have  introduced a bill, S. 1969, to authorize a national memorial to fallen  journalists. The National Capital Region has numerous monuments and  memorials to honor those individuals who have helped make our country  stronger since its founding days. Currently missing from that honor  roll is a memorial to reporters and other journalists, such as those at  the Capital Gazette, who have sacrificed everything to protect the  free, open, and transparent society that all people deserve. My hope is  that Congress will pass the Fallen Journalists Memorial Act soon. Once  we establish this memorial, we will have a visible reminder to pay  tribute to these heroes not just once a year, but every day.                            ____________________     Mr. President, while the Senate was out of session, the  American people celebrated the 50th anniversary of Earth Day. I would  like to take a moment to acknowledge that historic anniversary.   We first celebrated Earth Day in 1970 when then-Senator Gaylord  Nelson brought more than 20 million Americans together to mobilize in  defense of our planet. In the half-century since, our Nation has  benefitted from a passionate environmental movement that has pushed  lawmakers, businesses, and communities to foster a healthier Earth.  While this movement has yielded significant progress, we nonetheless  must do more to address the gravest threat to our environment: climate  change.   I recognize that, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, it might be  difficult to wrap our heads around a second crisis, but we have an  important opportunity here to learn from one global emergency about how  to navigate another.   The first lesson from the COVID-19 pandemic: We must listen to  experts. Public health experts have long forecast the risk of a viral  pandemic. Still, our leaders failed to prepare for COVID-19 and even  denied the magnitude of the threat we faced when it was at our  doorstep. The novel coronavirus has now claimed over 72,000 lives in  the United States, a death toll higher than any other country.   We are witnessing a parallel problem with climate change. For  decades, experts have warned that human-caused climate change is  heating the Earth. Ninety-seven percent of the world's scientists agree  on this. Scientists are no longer just predicting the future  implications of this crisis; they are pointing out the very real  consequences of climate change that have already arrived.   These include the rise in extreme weather events like floods,  hurricanes, and wildfires that we have experienced across the United  States in recent years. In Maryland, we have seen communities like  Ellicott City devastated by flash flooding from increased rainfall. Our  State's many miles of low-lying coast make us particularly vulnerable  to high tide flooding and storm surge. The longer we wait to address  climate change, the more natural disasters we will face.  [[Page S2320]]    Nevertheless, many of our Nation's leaders continue to ignore and  deny the science of climate change. President Trump has nominated  several individuals to oversee environmental regulations, despite their  alarming lack of expertise. Federal agencies like the U.S. Fish and  Wildlife Service and U.S. Department of Agriculture have suppressed  climate science while carrying out crucial environmental research. And  the Trump administration has advanced a policy agenda that unravels  critical environmental protections.   Right now, we need to be doing everything possible to protect our  planet, not make it more vulnerable.   Experts tell us that we have a short and critical window for action  before the climate crisis becomes far more dire. According to the  United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, we have 10  years to reduce global carbon emissions by 45 percent, or the Earth's  ecosystems will likely begin to collapse. That will mean even greater  sea-level rise, more high tide flooding, more devastating hurricanes,  more and faster-spreading wildfires, and more global infectious  diseases.   It is vital that we listen to experts and take steps to curb the  development of climate change before it is too late.   The second lesson: We must work with the international community to  tackle this crisis. Much of President Trump's foreign policy seems to  rest on the assumption that the United States can become stronger  through isolation. But the spread of COVID-19 makes it painfully clear  that we are part of a global community and that there are certain  threats that we will either overcome together or succumb to together.   Climate change is one such threat. The United States is the second- largest emitter of greenhouse gas. Our failure to improve our  environmental practices will have enormous impact on the rest of the  world. Likewise, America's long-term security depends on other  countries' efforts to protect the environment.   For example, as climate change continues, the number and severity of  natural disasters in the United States will increase, which will take a  substantial toll on our economy. A report that I requested from the  Government Accountability Office shows that the 14 climate disasters in  2018 cost the U.S. at least $91 billion in damage. And today, taxpayer  spending on Federal disaster relief in the U.S. is almost ten times  what it was three decades ago.   We need help from our friends around the world in order to avoid  these repercussions of climate change. And if we ask for help, we had  better be prepared to do our part, too.   It is, therefore, extremely disappointing that President Trump is  finalizing the withdrawal of the United States from the Paris  Agreement, which we joined alongside more than 190 other countries in  2016. Parties to the agreement committed to lowering carbon emissions  with investment in clean and renewable energy sources, placing them at  the forefront of the fight against climate change. Our Nation's retreat  from this agreement undermines our global credibility and leadership  and threatens devastating environmental consequences.   I led the U.S. congressional delegation to the conference where the  parties originally adopted the Paris Agreement; therefore, I could not  stand by and watch that important work be undone. So I introduced a  bipartisan resolution expressing support for the agreement and calling  on the U.S. to continue working with the global community to address  the causes and effects of climate change. It will be up to leaders at  the local, State, and national level to ensure that the United States  pulls our weight in this worldwide effort.   The third lesson: Meaningful progress is within reach if Americans  commit to urgent and bold action. Though it pains me to see the  suffering that the COVID-19 pandemic is causing, I have been proud to  watch communities across the country make the adjustments required to  slow the spread of the virus and keep each other safe. People are  staying home, teleworking, helping their kids learn remotely, and  isolating from friends and family. Health workers, first responders,  and other essential employees are inspiring us with their bravery and  dedication. And in Congress, we are working in a bipartisan fashion to  pass major legislation that will help us weather this storm.   The resilience of the American people in the face of this public  health emergency gives me faith that we can similarly pull together to  combat climate change if we recognize it for the life-threatening  emergency that it is. After all, the World Health Organization predicts  that climate change will kill an additional 241,000 people per year by  2030, and the World Bank estimates that, by 2050, it will force more  than 140 million people out of their homes.   The good news is that, unlike with COVID-19, the adaptations that  will help us tackle climate change will also create jobs and stimulate  our economy. The U.S. clean energy economy employs more than 3.3  million workers, a number that has been on the rise for the last 5  years. Furthermore, producing renewable energy is cheaper in the long  run than continuing to rely on coal. By 2025, almost every existing  coal plant in the country will cost more to operate than building  replacement wind and solar plants nearby. And crucially, energy  efficient infrastructure will strengthen communities by lowering the  cost of utilities, improving residents' health, and increasing economic  development.   For my part, I will keep working as a member of the Senate  Environment and Public Works Committee to advocate for laws that  protect Americans by protecting our planet. This Congress, I was able  to get the first ever climate title included in the surface  transportation reauthorization bill in order to reduce vehicular  emissions, the single largest source of U.S. carbon pollution. I have  also cosponsored bills that will lessen our dependence on fossil fuels  and increase the development of renewable energy technologies by  supporting the wind and solar industries.   As always, I will continue to defend the vital wetlands and marshes  of the Chesapeake Bay. As climate change causes severe weather patterns  to increase, these ecosystems will act as pollution filters and buffers  from storm surge and flooding, minimizing the damage to Marylanders'  homes and businesses. The Chesapeake Bay restoration program is a model  for the local, State, and Federal cooperation that we need to reach our  environmental goals. I am confident that we can address the climate  crisis as a whole in an equally collaborative manner.   Now is the time for an ``all hands on deck'' approach. Just as we  have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic, Americans must urgently work  together, on Earth Day and every day, to slow the causes and  consequences of climate change. If we do things right, then perhaps on  the 100th anniversary of Earth Day, someone will be standing here,  thanking her predecessors for protecting the Earth and looking forward  to many more golden anniversaries on our beautiful home planet.                            ____________________
