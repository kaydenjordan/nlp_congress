 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, as Puerto Rico struggles to recover from the historic  damage of Hurricane Maria, this legislation shortchanges the island's  long-struggling healthcare system at exactly the time that Puerto Rico  most needs our help.   This legislation provides a measly sum of Puerto Rico's Medicaid  system. Even before Hurricane Maria made landfall, Speaker Ryan had  committed to help resolve Puerto Rico's looming Medicaid crisis, yet  this bill provides just $1 billion. We have no assurance or guarantee  that the next emergency supplemental will provide appropriate funds to  address this problem.   The fact is that our fellow citizens have been shortchanged by the  disparity in Medicaid funding. This forced the government of Puerto  Rico to borrow money to provide healthcare. So if you wonder where  Puerto Rico's financial crisis stems from, you can look right here at  the U.S. Congress. Yet the amount included in this bill is far from  sufficient to address even this year's shortfall. For the Puerto Rican  people who have already suffered so much, this funding level amounts to  an insult.   If ever there were a time to channel aid to the island's healthcare  system and fix the systemic problems that we sought in the system  underfunding, this is it.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Collins of Georgia). The time of the  gentlewoman has expired.    Mr. Speaker, there are a litany of reasons to oppose  this bill, but let's make it clear: one of them is that it will not do  enough for the people of Puerto Rico. These are U.S. citizens. They  have fought, shed blood, and died in every major conflict. Now they  need our help, and this bill does not supply it. Reject this bill. Vote  ``no.''
