 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to the order of the House of July  13, 2023, I call up the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 68) relating to a  national emergency declared by the President on October 27, 2006, and  ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H.J. Res. 68.    Mr. Speaker, Mr. Speaker I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I rise in opposition to H.J. Res. 68 and all of this afternoon's  privileged resolutions on this matter.   The International Emergency Economic Powers Act created a process by  which the President could declare a national emergency, create  sanctions authorities for that emergency, and impose those sanctions on  the malign actors that are causing the emergency in the first place.   While I agree with my colleagues about the need for congressional  oversight and modernization of Presidential emergency powers, I  strongly disagree with the process by which they are trying to force  change.   The national emergencies we are discussing today provide the legal  basis for critical sanctions programs targeting some of the most evil  people on Earth. Although some of these authorities were enacted years  ago, many of these sanctioned individuals continue to pose a clear and  present danger to U.S. national security interests today.   These ill-thought-out joint resolutions, by terminating these  national emergencies, would immediately eliminate these sanctions  programs without allowing adequate time for Congress or the executive  branch to establish an alternative sanctioning authority. It would also  unfreeze sanctioned individuals' assets, immediately putting millions  of dollars into the hands of some of the world's most dangerous  criminals.   Even if a new authority were created, these monsters would not be  automatically resanctioned. Each of the hundreds of sanctions  designations at issue today was built on strong evidence compiled over  months or even years. It is not a switch that can be flipped on or off.  More time and a lot more taxpayer money would need to go into redoing  the work that has already taken place to renew these sanctions.   Another reason why this is a horrendous idea is that fines collected  from violating terrorist-related sanctions largely go toward the  Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund, which provides critical  compensation for American victims of state-sponsored terrorist attacks.  Since the fund was established, it has paid out over $3 billion to  eligible claimants, and by law, 50 percent of these distributions must  be paid to 9/11-related claimants. 9/11 was the deadliest terrorist  attack worldwide, and the attack has had a huge  [[Page H3660]]  impact on the New York community, in particular. Today, we still have  cops, firefighters, and first responders, suffering from 9/11-related  illnesses. The worst thing that we can do is take money away from 9/11  families and give it right back to terrorists.   Again, while I understand my colleagues' desire to reform the  national emergency process, empowering terrorists, corrupt officials,  and war criminals is not the answer, and draining the fund that assists  victims of terrorist attacks should be a crime in and of itself.   We should address these issues directly through regular order, rather  than arbitrarily removing sanctions authorities that are essential to  our national security. I urge President Biden to engage with Congress  on this, instead of blatantly avoiding the topic.   Now, for the specific matter at hand. I strictly oppose H.J. Res. 68,  which would terminate the National Emergency with respect to the  Democratic Republic of the Congo.   The forced termination of that emergency would lead to the rescission  of sanctions and immediate release of millions of dollars to more than  60 currently sanctioned malicious foreign actors, including notorious  arms dealer Viktor Bout, Russia's ``Merchant of Death,'' whose freedom  Vladimir Putin demanded in exchange for American hostage Brittney  Griner. This is the man you would be helping by passing this joint  resolution, someone who was convicted of conspiracy to kill American  citizens and officials, delivery of antiaircraft missiles, and  providing aid to a terrorist organization. It would empower this  horrific individual and embolden the Kremlin even further.   Revoking this emergency would also impact our ability to fight the  Islamic State affiliate in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Africa  already represents the largest growth area of terrorism in the world,  and Islamic State and al-Qaida affiliates fuel these groups' global  networks.                                time  1400    This resolution would make it easier for ISIS to use proxies in  Africa to finance its terror operations.   Further revoking the national emergency would release currently  frozen money to individuals and groups that have perpetrated and  profited from the ongoing deadly strife in the eastern Democratic  Republic of the Congo, groups like the M23 group, the armed militia  primarily responsible for that bloody conflict.   In recent months, international pressure on all parties has resulted  in less offensive military action and violence in the eastern  Democratic Republic of the Congo. This resolution could free up funds  that groups like M23 would immediately use to purchase advanced  weaponry, worsening the humanitarian situation and destabilizing the  region.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to oppose this reckless  resolution, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the right to close, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to reiterate, again, that I appreciate the  engagement from my colleagues on these matters, and I would be happy to  work with them on ways to modernize IEEPA or increase oversight of the  President's authorities, but this is not the way to do it.   Passing this joint resolution would seriously hinder our ability to  fight terrorism in Africa and allow criminals like Mr. Bout to operate  more efficiently. That absolutely should not be the message that  Congress sends.   I hear often from my colleagues about the need for regular order. We  had a whole discussion on it as a conference in our rules: regular  order. This should be going through the Foreign Affairs Committee to  have regular order. By introducing a privileged resolution, this is  bypassing regular order. It is bypassing the work that all of us  collectively as 435 Members of Congress have to do.   Now, I would remind my colleagues that these declarations are renewed  every year by the President, including President Trump, who did it four  times. Annual reports come to Congress every year. They come to the  Foreign Affairs Committee of which I am a member.   There are no additional spending authorities tied to these national  emergency declarations. They cost about $300,000 a year to administer.   I would remind my colleagues that we cannot sanction American  citizens. It is unconstitutional. We are sanctioning foreigners. We can  only freeze assets within our jurisdiction. That is the intent of this.   So while I do agree that we need to modernize IEEPA and we need to  evaluate any of these declarations, Congress already has the tools to  do it through regular order. So let's actually follow the rules that  many of my colleagues who are introducing these resolutions demanded,  and let's do it the proper way.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to the order of the House of July  13, 2023, I call up the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 70) relating to a  national emergency declared by the President on February 25, 2011, and  ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this resolution.   H.J. Res. 70 would terminate Executive Order No. 13566, which  established a state of emergency in Libya due to Qadhafi's attacks on  his own people, a deterioration of security in Libya, and prolonged  violence that caused serious destabilization.   This executive order was enacted during the first Libyan civil war,  was kept in place throughout the second Libyan civil war, and remains  critical now as Libya has yet to make a transition to stable governing.   On each annual renewal of the emergency, President Obama, President  Trump, and now President Biden have carefully reviewed the  circumstances in Libya and each time determined that we need to  maintain associated sanctions. It is simple to see the issues in Libya  are ongoing, and it is not partisan to know sanctions are a key  element.   One of the most critical sanctions that would be removed if Congress  passed this joint resolution is against Saif Qadhafi, one of Qadhafi's  sons, who has well-known links to the Wagner Group and is wanted for  murdering Libyan civilians. Sanctions related to Libya are still, to  this day, critical to our national security.   In the last 2 years alone, our Libya sanctions have blocked  approximately $18 million from reaching hostile foreign actors. The  forced termination of the national emergency regarding Libya would lead  to the immediate release of millions of dollars for wanted war  criminals backed by the Kremlin, like Saif Al Islam Qadhafi. Again,  this money would empower Putin's regime and secure Russia's interests  in Libya, a strategically important country along NATO's southern  flank.   I also, again, want to mention the importance of the U.S. state- sponsored terrorism fund. There is no question that this money is  better served by helping 9/11 families than quite literally financing  terrorists. Like most Americans, I remember exactly where I was when I  heard the news. I was in my first week of classes as a freshman at  Suffern High School.   September 11 had a profound impact on our Nation, but particularly  impacted the residents of New York. Thousands of families have faced  the repercussions of that day, especially the families of those who  worked tirelessly on the pile, trying to find survivors and helping  others find closure.   Every September 11, I attend numerous 9/11 ceremonies with the  families and our first responders who sacrificed so much, and still  today we are adding names to the various monuments of 9/11 first  responders who are losing their lives to 9/11-related illnesses. These  sanctioned moneys are used to help them and their families.   We will never forget that tragedy, and it is abhorrent that any of  these resolutions are coming before us today in this manner.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous materials on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Unfortunately, the alarm bells being raised by some proponents of  these measures are demonstrably wrong and misleading.   The national emergencies at issue today rely on IEEPA, the  International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which does not provide the  President with any domestic statutory powers like testing chemical  weapons or seizing radio stations unless the President issues another  executive order specifically invoking those emergency powers.   If the President were to do so, which no President has ever done, the  National Emergencies Act gives Congress the expedited privileged right  to disapprove that power, which we undoubtedly would do.   Furthermore, there is no power to draft Americans into Active Duty.  That was terminated in 1978. In contrast, let me remind this body, the  legal certainty we are facing is that terminating these emergencies  would immediately hand many millions of dollars to terrorists and war  criminals and would eliminate an important source of compensation to  American victims of terrorism.   Now, I remind my colleagues, with respect to Muammar Qadhafi's  continued inclusion, if Muammar Qadhafi was delisted, all of his assets  would be bequeathed to his children. While he has been dead for over a  decade, as everyone knows, you can't take your money with you when you  go, so we are preventing that money from going toward funding  terrorism.                                time  1445    While I appreciate this dialogue, it is abundantly clear that the  consequences of passing this resolution as well as the others are  extensive. Amidst Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the Wagner Group's  continued war crimes across the globe, and the ongoing instability in  Libya, we must keep this state of emergency and associated sanctions in  place.   I again reiterate the point that with regular order, this should be  going through the Foreign Affairs Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
