 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage Members to support  this commonsense bill, H.R. 1917, the Blocking Regulatory Interference  from Closing Kilns Act, H.R. 1917, also known as the BRICK Act, which  includes provisions that will provide a compromise approach to delaying  a regulation on manufacturers of wood heaters.   Wood heaters are frequently used by households in rural America.  EPA's rushed 2020 deadline would raise the price of a new wood heater  on those least able to afford it. It would also restrict consumer  choice, as many currently available models may not be able to meet the  2020 deadline. H.R. 1917 will not remove any regulations. It would  simply extend the deadline to 2023.   Frank Moore of Hardy Manufacturing, located in my district, testified  before the Environment Subcommittee in September that he and other  manufacturers are working to meet the 2020 step 2 standards, but that a  lack of technology is making compliance nearly impossible. In that  hearing, Mr. Moore said: `` . . . we provide jobs for about 50 people  with payrolls exceeding $2 million,'' and that ``even if a product can  meet the step 2 requirements, I believe it would not be consumer  friendly, durable, or affordable.''    Again, extension of this effective date doesn't remove any  regulations. Extension simply provides more time for manufacturers to  come into compliance with much stricter requirements. It is best for  the consumers; it is best for the businesses; and it will not undo the  regulations that are requested.   I hope that Members will agree that this bipartisan legislation is a  compromise solution that helps small businesses and our constituents. I  encourage Members to support H.R. 1917.
