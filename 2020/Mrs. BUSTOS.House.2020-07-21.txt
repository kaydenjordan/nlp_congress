 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of the HEROES Act.   The messages I receive paint a stark picture.  [[Page H3609]]    Steve, in Rockford, Illinois, prays the unemployment benefits that  have saved his home will be extended beyond next week.   Sharon, in Moline, Illinois, worries that her beloved niece may be  out of work for another 6 months.   John, in Sterling, Illinois, is concerned the outlook for small towns  like his will only worsen.   But perhaps the most touching letter that I have received is from a  young boy from the town of Orion, who just wants to go back to school  safely.   As conversations ramp up across the Nation about whether classes  should return, one thing is certain: Our cities, our towns, and our  schools do not have the resources that they need.   Whether it is funding to increase testing or funding for personal  protective equipment or expanded broadband to make sure that distance  learning is an option, we cannot expect schools to return or our Nation  to rebuild without support.   America has waited for months. It is past time to pass the HEROES  Act.                            ____________________
