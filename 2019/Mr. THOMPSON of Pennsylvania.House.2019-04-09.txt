 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  celebration of National Library Week, which began on Sunday and runs  through Saturday, April 13.   This year's theme is ``Libraries = Strong Communities,'' and Melinda  Gates is the honorary chair.   In the last 20 years, the Gates Foundation's Global Libraries  initiative has been dedicated to enhancing libraries and empowering  local communities.   National Library Week is an annual celebration highlighting the  valuable role libraries, librarians, and library workers play in  transforming lives and strengthening our communities.   Mr. Speaker, libraries have always been great equalizers in our  society. Nearly 1.3 billion people visit public libraries every year,  according to the Institute of Museum and Library Services.   They are at the heart of our cities, towns, schools and campuses,  providing critical resources, programs, and expertise. Libraries  provide a public space where all community members--regardless of age,  culture, or income level--can come together to connect and learn.   First sponsored in 1958, National Library Week is an observance  sponsored by the American Library Association and libraries across the  country each April.   It is a time to celebrate the contributions of our Nation's libraries  and librarians and to promote library use and support. All types of  libraries, including schools--public, academic, and special-- participate.   There are several celebrations throughout the week, including today,  which is National Library Workers Day. It is a time to show  appreciation for the staff, administrators, and Friends groups, and  recognize the valuable contributions made by all library employees.   Tomorrow is National Bookmobile Day, which is celebrated today to  recognize contributions of our Nation's bookmobiles and dedicated  professionals who make outreach possible and books accessible in our  rural communities.   Mr. Speaker, from the largest library in the world, the Library of  Congress, to the smallest local libraries around, I hope Americans will  support their local libraries this week with a visit.                            ____________________
