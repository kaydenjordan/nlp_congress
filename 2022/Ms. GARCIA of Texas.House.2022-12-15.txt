 Madam Speaker, I rise to celebrate Galena Park  Independent School District's very own North Shore High School football  team for their second trip in a row to the Texas State Championship.   Located in my district, the North Shore Senior High School is home to  a group of standout athletes and students, both academically and  athletically.   Through their hard work and preservation, our local stars will now  play against Duncanville High School for a chance to defend their State  championship.   I am truly so proud of all their accomplishments both on and off the  field. They embody Texas' spirit of excellence and go-get-'em spirit.   Stay focused and play strong, Mustangs, because all of Galena Park in  the Houston region is rooting for you this Saturday.   Best wishes and God bless.                            ____________________
