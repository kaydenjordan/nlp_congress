 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.    Mr. President, we receive a lot of letters in our  offices, and primarily we pay attention to those that come from our own  home States. People expect me as their Senator to read the letter and  to at least consider their point of view. Some of these letters are  kind of routine, almost form letters. Some emails come in at a volume  we can hardly keep up with. In Illinois, I receive 10,000 emails a  week--a week. That is a lot.   There was a time when I was a college kid working here on Capitol  Hill, and the Senator from Illinois signed every letter that went out  of the office--sat at the desk and signed the letters. It is  inconceivable now that we can respond to all the letters each day. We  try to keep up with them, we try to be timely, and we pick those  letters out that are personal and important enough that the staff  thinks I should read them personally, and I make a point of doing it.   Sometimes the stories they tell give me an insight into the issues we  debate on the floor of the Senate.   Most of the time the American people look at us puzzled, asking: What  are they talking about, and why does this mean anything to my family  and my future?   Let me give you an example of a couple of letters I received that  relate to a vote we are going to take this week. The first letter was  from Richard and Mary Laidman, from Naperville, IL, which is west of  the city of Chicago, in DuPage County.   Richard and Mary wrote: ``Our 13-year-old son Sam was diagnosed with  leukemia one day after the `no pre-existing conditions exclusions for  kids' protection went into effect.''   They went on to say to me: ``Obviously, we are feeling dependent on  all the clauses of the [ACA] right now--including [the] no pre-existing  conditions exclusions.''   The bottom line, the Laidmans say, is ``junk insurance plans,'' the  ones that are so cheap they don't cover anything important. ``Junk  insurance plans'' wouldn't cover their son. It would leave him and the  family to fend for themselves in the individual market.   Do you know what it is like to go into the individual market as a  mother and father and try to find health insurance for a 13-year-old  son who has been diagnosed with leukemia? Maybe you can't find any, but  if you could, it would be so expensive that you might not be able to  afford it. The Affordable Care Act changed that, and it said: If you  are going to offer health insurance plans in this country, you cannot  discriminate against Americans with preexisting conditions. You have to  cover everybody--bring them all in.   We do that in Medicare. We say when you reach Medicare eligibility:  All aboard. Everybody is invited in.   But for the longest time, private health insurance companies wanted  to pick and choose. They wanted healthy people who can pay premiums.  They would rather not pay these bills so they excluded a lot of people  with preexisting conditions.   Sam, age 13 and diagnosed with leukemia, would be one of the victims  of that old-time approach. The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society recently  stated:         People diagnosed with cancer on a short term plan soon       discover these plans fail to cover even lifesaving cancer       treatments. If patients on short term plans can get access to       cancer therapies at all, they will often be left with       hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical bills.    Tammy Baldwin is a Senator from the State of Wisconsin. She is going  to offer to the Senate tomorrow a chance to vote against President  Trump's plan that would eliminate protection for preexisting  conditions. We will get a chance to be on record here. I think it is  long overdue.   None of us knows what tomorrow will bring. We don't know if tomorrow  will bring an accident or a diagnosis, and, all of a sudden, your  happy, healthy family has a challenge you never dreamed of. It has  happened to my family. I will bet it has happened to most of yours.   The question is, Are we going to demand of health insurance companies  that they cover those with preexisting conditions or are we just going  to tell those families: Fend for yourself. See what happens. See how  much it costs.   Another letter is from Watseka, IL, from the McTaggart family.  Watseka is south of Chicago, in Iroquois County, a rural county, with  big towns like Watseka and Milford. It is a great little place.   Here is a letter from Christine McTaggart. She was originally  diagnosed with stage III inflammatory breast cancer. Given this type of  aggressive cancer, her prognosis was not  [[Page S6710]]  good. She went through 16 cycles of chemo, a bilateral mastectomy, 33  radiation treatments, failed reconstruction and chronic tissue issues,  and a thyroid cancer diagnosis. After all that, she learned the breast  cancer was back. This time she was stage IV. In her letter to me,  Christine said:         When the ACA became law, I had no idea that my life would       come to depend on policies such as pre-existing conditions       not excluding you from coverage.    She ends with this quote:         I thank you for your tireless advocacy on this issue. . . .       My life, literally, depends on it.    We pass a lot of resolutions here for ``National Pickle Week'' and  saluting the flag. All of that is part of my job. Occasionally, an  issue comes to the floor of the Senate that is really going to affect  life-and-death issues for Americans all across our Nation. This is one  of them. This is the No. 1 issue in this election.   You might think our debate last week about a Supreme Court Justice  was important, but you ask families back in Illinois: What do you  really care about?   They say: Senator, that was an important debate. I care about my  family. I care about my health insurance. I want to make sure of two  things. I want to make sure I can afford it, and I want to make sure  that when I buy it, it is worth owning and it is there when I need it.   The Republican view on this is this: Buyer beware. Go out in the  marketplace. Shop around. Buy yourself something cheap, like a junk  insurance plan. It may not be there when you need it, but boy, the  premiums will be low.   That is not much confidence in insurance, if that is the case, and  that is why, when Tammy Baldwin, Senator of Wisconsin, offers us a  chance to vote--I think, as soon as tomorrow--on this Trump rule, I  hope we will get at least two Republicans who cross the aisle and join  us. If they are listening at home, they will, because if they are  listening at home, they know that families really care about this issue  of preexisting conditions. It is so important for us.   You look at the groups that have come out in opposition to President  Trump's junk insurance plans. They are the most important groups that  you could think of. The American Cancer Society stated that President  Trump's junk plan rule would ``leave older and sicker Americans in the  individual market with few, if any, affordable health coverage  choices'' and that ``patients living with serious conditions will be  left paying more for the coverage they need, if they can afford  coverage at all.   In recent months, I have heard a lot of congressional Republicans  proclaim to care about people with preexisting conditions, especially  those up for reelection. These are the same ones who have eagerly voted  to repeal the Affordable Care Act in the middle of the night.   I have been in the Senate for a few years. That was one vote I will  never forget. John McCain walked through those doors in the middle of  the night, stood at that table, and with his arms still restricted  because of the torture he went through as a veteran in the Vietnam war,  he could barely lift his right arm with his thumb pointed down, saying  no. That ``no'' vote, together with two other Republicans, saved health  insurance coverage for millions of Americans.   But the Trump administration isn't finished. They found new ways to  reduce coverage for American families and to raise costs. That is what  the Trump plan is all about, and that is what we get a chance to vote  on.   The Senate is broken out in 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats. If all  of the Democrats vote for Tammy Baldwin, and I think they will, we  still need two Republicans. Let's see if they will come over and vote  not only against the Trump plan but vote for the millions of families  like those who I have read about today on the floor who are counting on  quality health insurance to be there when they need it, who believe  that no one should discriminate against someone because of a  preexisting health condition. That, to me, seems fundamentally fair.   I have raised a child with a serious problem. We face this time and  again. Nobody should have to face it. A vote for Tammy Baldwin's  resolution of disapproval on the Trump plan tomorrow will put America  on the right course for families that need health insurance they can  count on.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker)  is necessarily absent.
