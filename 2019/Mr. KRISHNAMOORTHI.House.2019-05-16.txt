 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of  amendment No. 18 to H.R. 987.   I want to thank Congressman Brown for his partnership on this  amendment, which will ensure that we conduct thorough outreach to  inform consumers in areas with high health disparities about their  insurance options.   The underlying legislation restores assistance to help Americans  enroll in affordable, high-quality health insurance, and this amendment  makes sure those efforts include a particular focus on low-income areas  most in need not only of health insurance, but also of improved health  outcomes.   In addition to reversing the Trump administration's sabotage of the  Affordable Care Act, this bill is a huge step forward in our efforts to  lower the cost of prescription drugs.   For families in my district and across the country, the high cost of  prescription drugs is more than a health issue; it is an economic  issue. Increasing competition and improving access to safe, lower cost  generics can save American families thousands of dollars each year at  the pharmacy counter.   Mr. Chair, working families are counting on this body to help  strengthen access to high-quality health insurance. For this reason,  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
