 Thank you, Mr. President.   Mr. President and colleagues, today the Republican Party officially  turns its back on America's middle class. Our constituents believe  Congress must require multinational corporations to pay their fair  share, ensure that the middle class has the chance to truly get ahead,  and protect Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Instead,  Republicans are doling out new giveaways to the multinational  corporations, raising taxes on the middle class after a brief sugar  high, and taking away the Medicare and Social Security guarantees for  the future.   It takes hard work to muscle a tax plan this unpopular and  destructive  [[Page S8090]]  through the Congress. Writing it is the easy part, especially when you  are just checking off the far-right tax policy wish list. Normally, the  hard part is sticking to your baseless talking points, ignoring the  public outcry, and turning a blind eye to the loads of evidence that  your plan is designed to fail.   This process has certainly been as far from normal as it can get. The  bill comes at an enormous cost and represents a huge missed  opportunity. For some perspective, the $1.5 trillion Republicans plan  to borrow for their tax bill would fund the Children's Health Insurance  Program for 915 years--915 years of a lifeline for families who are  walking on an economic tightrope with CHIP. That is what you could get  for the $1.5 trillion Republicans are borrowing to pay for their tax  bill. Spent on infrastructure, it would build towering, new monuments  in the tradition of the Hoover Dam, the Golden Gate Bridge, and the  Interstate Highway System. Aimed permanently at helping the middle  class, it would give long-struggling Americans a meaningful chance to  get ahead.   But this isn't real tax reform or a serious solution to the major  policy challenges of our time; this is a stimulus plan for shareholder  goodies and executive compensation. Today, Republicans are ignoring  decades of evidence that trickle-down economics is a fantasy.  Republicans have cut taxes bit by bit for multinational corporations  and high-flyers, but we have seen wages stay flat. The benefits of  those previous tax cuts never trickle down.   In this debate, Republicans seized on a talking point about workers  getting a $4,000 average raise if the bill becomes law, but that figure  is based on a made-up, revenue-neutral plan that was never on paper. It  is fake math, plain and simple.   I want to issue a warning to the public today. Passing this bill  guarantees years and years of instability in our Tax Code and painful,  drawn-out battles over tax policy here in the Congress. Because of the  pure partisanship and the recklessness of the process that went into  drafting this legislation, the bill is already full of mistakes that  are going to have drastic, unintended consequences.   Down on K Street, they are already working overtime to exploit new  special interest loopholes. The giant passthrough tax loophole, which  has been widely covered in the business pages, is just the beginning.  There are going to be big new incentives for multinational corporations  to ship jobs overseas, and with that, more factory towns and mill towns  are going to go dark. Fewer Americans will have the kinds of reliable  manufacturing jobs that support a family. There are going to be  extraordinary new pressures on State and local finances, and that is  going to hamper their ability to build new roads and bridges and  schools. There are going to be new and annual fights over the stop-and- go tax policies. Around here, they are called tax extenders. And what  they do is ensure a lack of the predictability and certainty we need  for innovation and growth.   All the evidence says that many of the policies in this bill are  going to be a nightmare to administer. This means that with this bill,  tax cheats get a holiday gift and have the opportunity to create new  rip-offs. What this means for the typical family who just wants to file  and get a refund on time is that there are going to be more hassles  because the government is going to have to devote more time to trying  to catch the cheats.    The defining economic challenge of our time is guaranteeing that the  middle class and those who strive to be middle class have a chance to  get ahead. Our country is home to the world's most powerful economic  engine, and it generates levels of prosperity that have never been seen  before, but working families and the middle class have been on the  outside of the winner's circle for generations. The Republican plan  isn't an answer to that challenge. In fact, it almost certainly makes  the problem worse.   At a time when the middle class needs fundamental, permanent reforms  to give them a chance to get ahead, the best--the best the Republican  plan offers is a sugar high. The fact is, it will not be long before  the sugar high wears off and tens of millions of hard-working Americans  will find themselves paying higher taxes--higher taxes--as a result of  this bill. Corporations, on the other hand, reap the benefits of  permanent tax breaks and a loophole-ridden system that, in my view,  just begs to be gamed.   The trail of broken promises that Republicans have left behind in  this process is long and unforgettable. The President said his tax bill  would not benefit his family or people like him. That is untrue. The  Treasury Secretary said there would be no tax cut for the upper class.  He was happy to have that called the Mnuchin rule. That is untrue.  Republicans in Congress said the principal feature, the main feature of  their plan, would center on a middle-class tax cut. That is untrue.  Republicans said their bill would make the system dramatically simpler.  That is untrue. Republicans said their bill would allow families to  file their taxes on a postcard. That is untrue. Republicans said their  plan would pay for itself. That, too, is untrue.   Even many of the promises Republican leaders made to their own  colleagues have been broken, but there is one that they are not trying  to hide. The deficit hawks have flown back to town, and they are  already stirring up a battle over entitlement reform, and they are  going to look at a variety of health programs and programs that are a  lifeline to millions of Americans.   Our people are not thrown off by the Washington lingo. They know that  when Republicans say they are coming after entitlement reform, they  have the knives out for Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, anti- hunger programs, education funding, and more.   Our distinguished colleague from Wyoming, Chairman Enzi, was talking  about how dynamic scoring would take care of things and that it was  just off base to be concerned about these deficits because dynamic  scoring would make everything turn out fine. The reality is that all of  the independent analyses have shown that this bill comes up way short  in terms of projected revenue. The Tax Foundation, for example--which  is not exactly a leftwing operation--says the Republicans were hundreds  of billions of dollars short. What the Joint Committee on Taxation said  is that the Republican plan was $1 trillion short.   Let's put it in context. Remember that Steve Mnuchin said that this  plan would not only pay for itself but that it would leave $1 trillion  left over. Yet both the Tax Foundation and the Joint Committee on  Taxation said that this bill comes light years away from paying for  itself.   I say to my colleagues, it didn't have to be this way.   I see the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee on the  floor.   As I have indicated, Democrats believe that the Tax Code is a rotting  mess and has to be fixed. For years, there has been bipartisan interest  in getting tax reform done right. Seventeen Democratic Senators came  together, even in a last-ditch effort to try to bring some  bipartisanship into the process, and laid out ideas for some common  ground. I commend that group, led by our colleague from West Virginia,  Senator Manchin, and our colleague from Virginia, Senator Kaine. I have  written two comprehensive, bipartisan tax reform bills, first with  Senator Judd Gregg and then with a member of the President's Cabinet,  Dan Coats. The majority leader always likes to talk about how nobody on  this side is interested in bipartisanship. When Democrats laid out  their principles, the first thing we said was how important it ought to  be that we focus on bipartisanship. That letter was shared with the  Republican leadership. Then you have the group of moderates. Then you  have the actual bills that were written. So this idea advanced by the  Republican leadership that there was no interest in bipartisanship does  not resemble reality.   By the way, a lot of Senators here know that we have a pretty current  example--the 2015 tax bill. It is kind of a model of what you can do.  Both sides had good ideas. Bipartisanship is not about taking each  other's dumb ideas; anybody can do that. But in the 2015 bill, my  colleagues on this side said that the earned-income tax credit ought to  be expanded, and we wanted the child tax credit and the American  opportunity tax credit.    The Republicans, led by my distinguished colleague, Senator Hatch,  had  [[Page S8091]]  some pretty good ideas too. They wanted to make the research and  development credit permanent and the expensing provisions, which are so  important for farmers and rural communities, and they had some ideas on  business incentives. So we said: We are going to find some common  ground here. We are going to take good ideas from both sides.   The tragedy of this bill is that Republicans wouldn't build on the  good work of the 2015 tax legislation, where good ideas were accepted  from both sides. This time around, there was zero outreach from  Republicans on this issue. There was not one moment when Republicans  actually shared even a piece of paper or a document about ideas that  might bring both sides together. In fact, we can go all the way back to  November 2016. They were still putting the voting machines back into  storage when the first whispers began about tax reform happening  through a completely partisan process.   Now, in coffee shops across America, most folks are not talking about  budget reconciliation. Budget reconciliation is Washington lingo for  saying: We aren't going to do this right; we are just going to make it  our way, partisan, with no effort to try to bring people together. And  after those whispers in November of 2016, within days, Chairman Enzi,  the chairman of the Budget Committee, and my good friend, Senator  Hatch, the chairman of the Finance Committee, and everybody is on  board.   Then, the majority leader, in December of 2016, made it official: We  weren't going to build on the history of successful tax reform, which  required bringing both sides together; the majority leader said that we  are going with reconciliation and partisanship. Reconciliation is a  full-on rejection of the history of successful tax reform, and it is a  full-on rejection of bipartisanship. It is the majority saying to the  minority, as was the case: We just don't want your ideas because we  don't need your votes. When you look at the way this debate played out,  it is obvious that has been exactly the approach my Republican  colleagues have taken.   The administration's first tax outline, which was shorter than your  typical drugstore receipt, didn't contain an ounce of Democratic input.  Then, what we had with the Republicans were the closed-door meetings of  what they called the Big 6, a Republican-only group who turned their  outline into a framework for a bill. The framework they released, which  was roughly the same size as your typical drugstore receipt, still  reflected no Democratic ideas.   Everybody knew that if we did it this kind of way, the public was  going to catch on. They were going to see this as a con job and they  were going to catch on that this is going to give the middle class the  shaft, so they decided that they just have to move at the speed of  light. That is what the House did.   Here in the Senate, the Republicans dropped their plan late at night,  just before the Veterans Day weekend, and the Finance Committee was  supposed to start the process of voting on it a few days later.   There was a whole new bill introduced in the middle of our markup  that turned the tax bill into a healthcare bill--a healthcare bill-- with a fresh attack on the Affordable Care Act. There was another set  of last-second changes introduced literally minutes before the final  committee votes happened. The bill makes $10 trillion in tax policy  changes, and there was never a single hearing on the specifics of the  legislation.   Let me just repeat that. I want the public to know that. There was  never a single hearing--not one--on the specifics of this legislation.   We are going to hear on all points a push by my colleagues on the  other side to say that there were 70 hearings. Well, sure, there were  people who would come in from time to time and talk about issues. There  wasn't one hearing--not one--on the specifics of the legislation.   On the Senate floor, the Republicans played hide the ball for days  until they dropped the final version of their bill late at night on a  Friday. Two full days of debate had already passed, and the final bill  was a mystery.   I stood here hour after hour asking where the bill was--an economy- transforming bill, a tax hike on tens of millions of middle-class  Americans. Yet Republicans kept it hidden until the very last second.  When it was revealed to the public, we saw my colleague, Senator Durbin  from Illinois, holding it up with illegible notes scrawled in margins.  It wasn't anywhere near enough time for any Member of this body to read  the bill and grasp each of its provisions.   Even the conference committee was an exercise in reckless  partisanship. News reports said that Republicans had agreed to a final  bill, but they were empty-handed at the only official conference  meeting. So what was going on at this so-called conference meeting?  This was, I guess, a reality show version of a conference committee.  The conferees were supposed to ask questions about out-of-date plans  from the other body, in the Senate, when the actual, final bill was  still locked behind closed doors.   The chairman didn't allow any motions or any amendments. Just like  every other step in the process, this was a sham debate, and now the  bill is a few hours away from passage.   I close with this: This bill has the power to reshape the American  economy in far-reaching and unforeseen ways. It has the power to send  families into economic hardship. It has the power to threaten this  country's ability to uphold the special promises of Medicare, Medicaid,  and Social Security. And this bill was written in the shadows, written  in the dark, with billions and billions of dollars' worth of changes  tumbling out at the last second, the result of special interest  influence and hushed conversations in back rooms.   There were no public hearings on the specifics of this legislation,  and people wonder why the American people oppose it. Republicans have  chosen to ignore them. They have chosen to ignore them. What is  happening is un-Democratic. It is wrong. I am here to say that this  vote will not be forgotten.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Strange). The Senator from Utah.    Mr. President, I thank Senator Sanders.   I want to pick up for a moment on his eloquent points and then pose a  question to him about what we will be doing here in a few minutes.   Senator Sanders has eloquently spoken to the needs of the American  people, our veterans, the Dreamers, the disasters. Those are bipartisan  efforts. Mr. Crapo and I want to fix the broken system of fighting  fires.   Senator Sanders mentioned children's health insurance. This bill  borrows $1.5 trillion and is going to end up borrowing a lot of it from  foreign interests. That would fund the Children's Health Insurance  Program for 915 years. So what the Senator from Vermont is doing is  saying: Look at all the constructive areas where we can really meet the  needs of the people, and, instead, we are working on a tax bill that is  going to betray the middle class. It is going to betray the middle  class, and in my view, as the distinguished Senator from Vermont and I  have discussed, this bill--this tax bill--is a textbook case of writing  legislation in an undemocratic way, in a secret way, with provisions  that were airdropped for lobbyists into this legislation in the middle  of the night.   Senator Sanders and I were part of the so-called conference committee  last week where we didn't even have the relevant bill in front of us.  We were asking questions about bills that really didn't exist.    $10 trillion.    $10 trillion.    $10 trillion.    $10 trillion.    $10 trillion.    $10 trillion.    $10 trillion.    $10 trillion.    $10 trillion.    $10 trillion.    $10 trillion.    There was not one single hearing to discuss the specifics  of the legislation before us today. The legislation before us today  involves $10 trillion worth of changes in tax policy.   Our colleagues on the other side trumpet this idea that there were 70  hearings. I think what they are talking about is that over the years,  people would come in and talk about this idea or that.    Right, that is correct. But there was not one single  hearing with respect to the specifics of the bill.   I would like to turn, if I could, to this work that my colleague--and  I am happy to have partnered with him--has played such an important  role in; that is, the consequences of all this reckless haste and  secretive process, which he and I have been working on. In my view, it  is really is legislative malpractice. We have a bill that is full of  mistakes that are going to have unintended consequences, opening many  new loopholes for the wealthy and crafty accountants and lawyers.  [[Page S8101]]    The Senator and I have been working to try to weed out of this  legislation violations of what is called the Byrd rule, which, in  English, basically means you can't stuff provisions into a bill that  really don't deal with tax and spending. By my count, the Senator and I  have already pushed that there are more than 20 Byrd rule violations  that had to be corrected.   Before I ask my question, I just want to give people a little bit of  the idea of the work the Senator and I have been doing over the last  few days. Late Friday night, we were able to remove a particularly  offensive provision that would have turned some churches in America  into partisan, political organizations. Specifically, there was an  effort here to overturn what is called the Johnson amendment, named  after Lyndon Johnson, that barred churches from endorsing partisan  political activity with political candidates. The way that the bill was  written--and the Senator and I fought to get it struck and were  successful--it would have turned churches and sham charities into  political machines where they could be conduits for billions and  billions of dollars in dark money.    Absolutely. I think we need to tell America about this  because we have won this round, but the Senator and I are going to be  back at this fight with our colleagues again. In effect, this would  have been Citizens United 2.0. This would have been another version of  the push to have unaccountable, dark money--billions of dollars poured  into elections through churches and sham charities.   Turning to the question now of this evening, it looks to me as though  we have now found several other Byrd rule violations that would seem to  me to be further indications of rash and reckless legislating that does  not serve the American people well.   So I would wrap up by asking my colleague from Vermont--and I want to  tell him it has been a pleasure to work in partnership with him on  this--aren't these Byrd rule violations that we have been going after  and that you are going to discuss again tonight, aren't these just a  textbook case of what happens when you legislate with reckless haste?    Will my colleague yield?  [[Page S8122]]         Will my colleague yield?  [[Page S8122]]         Will my colleague yield?  [[Page S8122]]         My colleague is making a very important point, and I think  it would be great if he would repeat those figures, because all night  we have had Republican Senators come to this floor and say: Hey, middle  class, just wait until February. Wait until February, and your  paychecks are going to be bulging.   From what my friend from Pennsylvania has just said, using this new  data that we just got from the Joint Committee on Taxation, what we  have picked up--and my friend from Pennsylvania has clearly done his  homework--is that something like 60 million taxpayers with an annual  income of $200,000 or less will get practically nothing--maybe $100 a  year in tax relief or a tax increase. So I think what my colleague is  talking about--I would like him to walk me through the numbers he  used--is that it directly contradicts what we have been hearing last  night, where one Republican Senator after another was saying: It is  just going to be good times come February because your paycheck is  going to bulge.   Would my colleague just repeat what he found?    Mr. President, the issue with the Cruz amendment is  straightforward. The Byrd rule states that the primary purpose of a  budget bill is to address spending and taxes. If, on the other hand,  you are debating a major policy change and the budget impact is merely  incidental, the provision just doesn't comply with the Byrd rule. That  is the case here.   The Cruz amendment has a modest budget impact, but the impact is  vastly outweighed by the profound impact, as a matter of social and  education policy, of providing Federal support for homeschooling for  the first time. In fact, last week, the Senator from Texas called his  section 529 homeschooling provision ``the most far-reaching Federal  school choice legislation bill ever passed.'' I agree with the  Senator's assessment of his amendment. The issue of Federal support for  homeschooling is, in fact, major policy. There is no question that  there are parents who want to homeschool their kids. I am certain that  many of them are very conscientious. Yet this is the first time the  Federal Government would provide Federal support for homeschooling.  That is why the Parliamentarian ruled against Senator Cruz.   I urge my colleagues to vote against the Enzi motion to waive the  Byrd rule point of order, which we will vote on shortly.   I also want to close for the Finance Democrats on this tax issue with  some brief remarks. My colleague from Texas once again has been saying,  as many Republicans have done tonight: Middle-class folks, wait until  February. Your paychecks are going to be bulging.   Here are the facts. We just got them from the Joint Committee on  Taxation--a specific table that shows that 60 million taxpayers with an  annual income of $200,000 or less will get $100 a year in tax relief or  a tax increase. That looks to me like a third of all taxpayers are not  exactly going to have bulging paychecks the way we have heard from our  colleagues on the other side of the aisle.   The fact is that some of the rhetoric we have heard from Republican  colleagues tonight didn't sound half bad, so it is a real shame that  the rhetoric doesn't resemble the plan on paper.   As I indicated, this bill is not centered on a middle-class tax cut.  The  [[Page S8140]]  fleeting sugar high the bill provides offers some middle-class families  a modest amount of help, but it is basically a distraction from the  giveaways to the multinational corporations and powerful donors.   One of our Republican colleagues tonight repeated that if passed, the  deficit is going to drop when the bill is enacted. I just have to say  that fantasy is over. Even independent conservatives are saying that  there is no third alternate reality in which Republican tax bills  perform magic.   I want to close tonight by saying to the public that I would really  like to wrap this up with a warning: The American people should know  that the far-right architects of this tax plan are going to be coming  for your Social Security and Medicare before you take your Christmas  tree down. That is the end game. That is what Americans need to know is  coming next. And on this side of the aisle, we want the American people  to know that we are going to be on their side.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.
