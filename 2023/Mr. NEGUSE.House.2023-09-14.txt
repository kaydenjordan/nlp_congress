 Mr. Speaker, 16 days, that is how much time we have left  until the government runs out of funding.   Six weeks ago, Mr. Speaker, I stood here on the floor of the House  with my colleagues as House Republicans gaveled the House out of  session for a 45-day recess.   Now, you may recall, Mr. Speaker, the priority that House Republicans  were pursuing on that day, as we gaveled out of session. I can assure  you it was not to fund the government. It was, instead, a bill  targeting the lesser prairie chicken and the long-eared bat, literally.  This came on the heels of a summer spent on Republican bills to protect  gas stoves.   Six weeks later, we are back in Washington. Republicans have gaveled  the Congress back into session. Here we are on the House floor yet  again. What are we spending our time doing? Perhaps a bill to fund the  government? No. A bill to ensure that members of our armed  [[Page H4315]]  forces are paid, that the operations of our government remain up and  running? No. Instead, House Republicans choose to spend the time of  this body debating a bill attacking electric vehicles.   Electric vehicles, gas stoves, the long-eared bat, and the lesser  prairie chicken. Those are the priorities of the House Republican  caucus. Sixteen days away from a government shutdown, and this is how  House Republicans choose to spend our time.   The priorities that House Republicans are pursuing are grossly out of  step with the priorities of the American people.   You are in charge, Mr. Speaker. You could choose today to put bills  on the floor to build safer communities or lower costs or grow the  middle class. Instead, we are left with political games, and, oh, that  is right, a baseless impeachment inquiry that the Speaker announced 48  hours ago. Maybe we can get back to the basic job of the U.S. House of  governing, of passing a budget.   Mr. Speaker, there is a good place to start. The Fiscal  Responsibility Act that this body passed a mere 4 months ago set out  negotiated spending levels. I don't know if the Speaker voted for it,  but 149 of your colleagues did in the Republican caucus. The ranking  member, my friend from Texas, voted for it.   Now, months later, the Republican caucus, the Speaker, they have  abandoned, they have revoked, reneged on that deal. Why? Because the  far-right members of their caucus have demanded it. Here we are, 16  days away from a government shutdown that many members of the  Republican Conference seem fixated on creating.   We had a Rules Committee hearing, which the distinguished gentlewoman  joined me in, just a few days ago, where one of our colleagues on the  other side of the aisle was unabashed, who said: Let's shut it down.   Of course, for those Americans watching, they know that we have been  here before. They have seen this movie. They have seen how it ends.                                time  1315     Mr. Speaker, they know that if Republicans are in control  of the House, there is one thing they can count on, and that is that  Republicans will shut the government down as they did in the 1990s  under Speaker Newt Gingrich, as they did in 2013 under Speaker Boehner,  as they did in 2018 under Speaker Ryan.   I implore my colleagues to get back to the basics of governing. Work  with us in good faith. Honor the agreement that you all voted for 4  months ago. Let's fund the government, Mr. Speaker.
