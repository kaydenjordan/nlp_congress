 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate July as Transit Bus  Month for the Federal Transit Administration.   Every day, Americans use buses to travel around their communities.  Thanks to the Biden administration, now they will be cleaner and more  efficient.   The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes $1.7 billion to improve  bus transit across the country, and it will fund 1,800 zero-emission  buses to increase efficiency and decrease pollution.   In July, the FTA is highlighting examples of how this law is helping  Americans. One example is the $47 million grant I helped secure for New  Jersey Transit. This grant will install charging equipment for electric  buses and modernize the Hilton Bus Garage in Maplewood, New Jersey. It  will help New Jersey Transit use 100 new electric buses more  efficiently throughout my district. This is part of my commitment to  help New Jersey achieve a zero-emissions bus fleet by 2040 and reduce  pollution for safer communities across the State.                            ____________________
