 Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to recognize  Martha Ruthven for her service for the Second Congressional District of  South Carolina. Martha has been an invaluable team member for nearly 9  years, dedicated to constituent service.   Moving from North Carolina after her nuclear physicist stepfather  accepted a position at the Savannah River Site, Martha began her love  of the Palmetto State.   Working in the Congressional Aiken/Barnwell office, Martha quickly  became embedded in the community, attending events, meetings, and  advancing constituent services. As deputy district director, Martha has  long been a trusted adviser to the many thousands she has assisted.   I appreciate she will remain in Aiken. In fact, she will be heading  to Savannah River Nuclear Solutions to continue community relations. I  wish the best to Martha and her husband, K.T., a respected Realtor and  president of Aiken Republican Club.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years, as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America.   Our prayers for the courageous people of Ukraine resisting war  criminal Putin, who is sacrificing young Russians for Putin's oil,  money, and power.                            ____________________
