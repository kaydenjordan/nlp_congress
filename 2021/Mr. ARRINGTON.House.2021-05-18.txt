 Madam Speaker, it is an honor to congratulate my  friend, Eddie McBride, on 23 outstanding years at the Lubbock Chamber  of Commerce.   Eddie has served as the president and CEO of the Lubbock Chamber  since 1999. Under his leadership, the Lubbock Chamber has received  countless awards, including the best chamber in the Nation and numerous  star accreditations.   Again, my dear friend is an exceptional leader, even though he  attended Texas A&M University. Then he served his Nation in the United  States Air Force for 20 years.   Upon moving to Lubbock in 1976, Eddie immersed himself into our  community, served on numerous boards, including the Texas Association  of Business, Workforce Solutions South Plains, and Covenant Health for  decades. Eddie has served with excellence and integrity, always putting  our community's interests above his own.   I congratulate Eddie on an outstanding career, and I thank him from  the bottom of our hearts for his service and contributions to Lubbock  and to west Texas.   We wish the very best for you and your wife, Debbie; your children,  Chelsea and Patrick; and the entire McBride family.   God bless you. And go west Texas.                     RECOGNIZING SERGEANT JERROD BURTNETT     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Sergeant  Jerrod Burtnett, a true west Texas hero.   On December 27, 2019, vast fog surrounded Sergeant Burtnett as he  investigated a series of crashes due to zero visibility in Lubbock  County. After checking on a bystander along the side of the road, a  fast-moving tractor-trailer lost control, hitting a number of vehicles,  as well as Sergeant Burtnett, causing him serious injury.   Sergeant Burtnett won the Purple Heart for his actions that day, and  his experience is a reminder to us all how dangerous the job of being  in law enforcement is.   It is an honor to recognize Sergeant Burtnett for his bravery and his  steadfastness to enter a dangerous situation to help the people of  Texas.   On that cold, foggy day, Sergeant Burtnett exerted the valor,  courage, and selflessness that epitomized the men and women in blue.   May God bless Sergeant Burtnett and his family, and all those in  uniform who risk their lives to protect ours.                        Sanctuary City for the Unborn     Mr. Speaker, I believe life is a gift from God, begins  at conception, and that unborn children have the same right to life,  liberty, and the pursuit of happiness as you and I do.   Nothing gives me more joy or sense of purpose than being a champion  for the unborn. I know the vast majority of west Texans believe, as I  do, that all life is sacred, God-given, and should be protected at all  stages.   The Lubbock community recently stood together against the stain of  abortion on the fabric of our country by voting to become a sanctuary  city for the unborn. Now, whether or not this ordinance is upheld in  the courts, I am immensely proud that my hometown has made a statement,  not only to Texas, but to the whole country, that as for us, the people  of west Texas, we stand for life.   Mr. Speaker, west Texans firmly believe, as I do, that we ought to  promote a culture of life and that life at every stage is equally  valuable, equally precious, not only in light of the Constitution, but  in the eyes of God.   Like the citizens of Lubbock, I will continue to fight for the  voiceless, vulnerable, unborn Americans and their constitutionally  protected right to life.   God bless America. God bless the unborn. And go west Texas.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my fellow Texan, Representative  Fallon, for the opportunity to speak.   To my colleague, Judy Chu, I have enjoyed working with her and  serving with her on the Ways and Means Committee, and I have respect  for her.   Let me be clear, Madam Speaker, the Atlanta shootings were  heartbreaking and absolutely unconscionable. I condemn, as I imagine  all of my colleagues do, all hate and all violence against any person  for any reason. I mourn for all Americans who have lost their lives to  any senseless act of violence.    Today, my colleagues have brought forth a resolution that I believe  is laced with political jabs and unsubstantiated assertions about  labeling a virus by its geographical origin.   To say that the term ``Wuhan virus'' drove this individual to commit  unthinkable crimes is both premature and illogical, and it needlessly  politicizes this horrible tragedy. It is inappropriate, and I believe  it is unwise, for Congress to presume a motive in the middle of an  ongoing investigation.   For the sake of our country, we must stop politicizing heinous acts  of violence committed by sick, evil individuals. We must stop making  claims that supersede and ignore personal responsibility. When an  individual commits a crime, they are responsible for that crime, and  our judicial system is there to ensure that the individual is held  accountable and brought to swift and certain justice.   Again, I mourn for the lives lost in Georgia, but today's resolution  does not strike me as simply and only a sincere attempt to highlight  injustice or to condemn hate crimes. It reeks, Madam Speaker, of  scoring political points. That is my read.   It seems to be a veiled criticism of President Trump. It is needless  and more divisive identity politics. We definitely don't need more of  that in this country. I think it is political opportunism. So I  encourage my Democrat colleagues and my Republican colleagues to reject  this and to vote ``no'' for those reasons.
