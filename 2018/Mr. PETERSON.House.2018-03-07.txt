 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the BRICK Act,  particularly section 3, which includes language from my bill to bring  much-needed regulatory relief to wood heater manufacturers that are in  my district and also across the Nation.   Section 3 delays the second phase of Federal emission regulations for  wood heaters by 3 years. It is important to note that, since 2007,  manufacturers have voluntarily invested in technology to reduce the  emissions to comply with the first phase of the regulations.   I had one situation in the north part of my district where they spent  I don't know how many hundreds of thousands of dollars coming up with  this 90 percent reduction; and 6 months after they accomplished it,  they came in with these new regulations to do another 90 percent, which  can't be done, and it is going to put them out of business.   So these businessowners in my district and around the country have  approached me and said, as I said, that they will go out of business if  this second phase is not delayed. Some of them have already begun  laying people off in towns like Greenbush, Minnesota, in my area. And  in these small communities, these layoffs are devastating.   These companies already produce some of the cleanest wood heaters in  the Nation, and they are telling me that the EPA has just gone too far.  So I wrote this language to help these businesses, these workers, these  communities that depend on the production of these important  appliances, and I urge my colleagues to support the BRICK Act.
