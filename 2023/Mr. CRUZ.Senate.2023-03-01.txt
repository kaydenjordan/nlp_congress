 Mr. President, tomorrow is Texas Independence Day. On that  day 187 years ago, the Texians declared our independence from Mexico  and fired a shot for liberty.   In the fight for independence from Mexico, many would go on to give  their lives for liberty at the Alamo, including William Barret Travis,  Jim Bowie, and Davy Crockett. But shortly afterwards, after losing  battle after battle after battle, the Texians won a decisive victory at  the Battle of San Jacinto and formed the Republic of Texas. The rest is  history.   After 9 years as a republic, our own nation, Texas officially became  part of the United States in February of 1846.   Sam Houston, the founding father of the Lone Star State, was also  born 230 years ago tomorrow. Tomorrow is Sam Houston's birthday.   Happy birthday.   Sam Houston was an extraordinary American. He was born in Virginia,  spent many years in Tennessee, where he served in the U.S. House of  Representatives and then became Governor of Tennessee. In Texas, he  served as commander in chief of the Texian Army. He led the Texas Army  to victory in the war for Texas independence. When Texas became an  independent nation, Sam Houston served in the Texas House of  Representatives and then as President of the Republic of Texas. When  Texas joined the United States, he served in the U.S. Senate and  finally as Governor of Texas.   I have always been a bit jealous that my colleague Senator Cornyn  happens to occupy the seat that once was held by Sam Houston.   Sam Houston was a tireless, talented leader and a great statesman who  believed passionately in freedom. His words, ``Govern wisely and as  little as possible,'' remain true today, and the Lone Star State still  follows that principle.   These great heroes, these great Texians, risked everything for  freedom to make freedom a reality for generations of Texans. And  tomorrow, we celebrate and honor their sacrifices.   Many years in the past, I have stood on the floor of the Senate and  read Travis's letter from the Alamo to honor Texas Independence Day.  This year, my colleague Senator Cornyn will read it since I read it  last year.    Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask  unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of S.  Res. 86, which is at the desk.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution  be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I rise today to honor the memory of  Oswaldo Paya, who would have celebrated his 71st birthday this week.  His memory and his story have been an inspiration to dissidents across  the world, and I would like to briefly retell it here today.   Oswaldo Paya was a dissident and a democracy activist in Cuba with  unrelenting passion and dedication. He was someone who stood up against  the Castro regime at very direct risk to his own life. He had  incredible courage. He spoke up for human rights. He spoke up for free  speech. He spoke up for democracy.   Eleven years ago, Oswaldo Paya was murdered. On July 22, 2012, Paya  left his house with three other people to go visit friends. From the  start of their journey, their car was followed. On the way, the Cuban  police drove Paya's car off the road and killed him. The crash is  widely believed to have been orchestrated by the Castro regime.   Paya had long been a thorn in the side of the Castros, even from a  young age. He was the only person at his school who had refused to join  the Communist Youth. As a teenager, he publicly opposed the communist  crackdown on protesters in Czechoslovakia who were fighting for  freedom, and he was punished with 3 years in prison.   Paya went on to found the Varela Project, which sought a referendum  on Cuba's communist system. Their demands were simple: democratic  government, religious liberty, freedom of expression, and the freedom  to start businesses. Paya managed to get 11,000 signatures to petition  the government to hold a referendum, and eventually 20,000 people  supported the referendum. Twenty thousand people risked their lives by  standing with Oswaldo Paya for freedom. But the Cuban Government  refused to hold a referendum.   Paya's fight for freedom made him a target repeatedly of the  Communist Party in Cuba. They harassed him, tried to intimidate him,  and arrested him numerous times. And in 2012, they killed him.   Paya's friend and the driver of the car said that when he awoke after  the crash, he was confronted at the hospital by a government operative,  and the hospital was flooded with uniformed military personnel. Under  extreme duress, drugged, and threatened with death by government  officials, he signed a confession that directly contradicted what he  knew to be true--that the communist regime had just murdered Oswaldo  Paya.   I have met multiple times with Oswaldo Paya's daughter, Rosa Maria,  who is an incredible, courageous, powerful leader in her own right, and  we have discussed ways we can continue her father's fight for justice  in Cuba. One of the things I have done is I have filed legislation to  rename the street in front of the Cuban Embassy in Washington, DC,  ``Oswaldo Paya Way.'' Renaming the street in front of the Cuban Embassy  would send a powerful message to the communist regime.   During the Cold War, President Reagan followed this very same  strategy. He renamed the street in front of the Soviet Embassy  ``Sakharov Plaza'' after the famed human rights dissident in the Soviet  Union. It was part of a broader strategy to call out the evil regime.  My strategy is the same here.   Some people may think a street name is not that big a deal, but think  about it for a moment. If you change the street name, it means anyone  who wants to write to the Cuban Embassy will have to write Oswaldo  Paya's name. If you need to go there, you will have to look up the  address and see the same. Tyranny exists in darkness. Oppressive  regimes are terrified by dissidents. Members of the Cuban Government  who deal with the Embassy will have to acknowledge that Paya existed  and that this hero who was wrongfully murdered was real. They will have  to say his name. There is power in saying his name.   I want to tell you another story that illustrates just how powerful  this renaming strategy can be. Several years ago, I introduced  legislation to rename the street in front of the Chinese Embassy in  Washington, DC, ``Liu Xiaobo Plaza.'' Liu Xiaobo was a Noble Peace  laureate and democracy activist in China who was wrongfully imprisoned  there. My bill ended up passing the U.S. Senate 100 to nothing. Every  Senator, Republican and Democrat, agreed with that bill. Sadly, even  though it was a Democrat Senate at the time, the Republican House  failed to take up the bill, so it didn't pass into law.   But here is an epilogue to that story. At the beginning of the Trump  administration in 2017, I was having breakfast with Rex Tillerson, the  new Secretary of State. We were at Foggy Bottom at the State  Department. We were talking about China at one point, and he said he  had just had a meeting with his counterpart, the Foreign Minister of  China. He said the Foreign Minister came out and said the Chinese  Communist Government has three top priorities in foreign policy, and  Rex kind of shook his head.   He said: Ted, it is the damnedest thing. One of their top three  priorities is to prevent your bill to rename the  [[Page S614]]  street in front of their Embassy from passing.   I will tell you what I told Rex that morning. At the time, Liu Xiaobo  had passed away. He had never collected the over $1 million that he was  entitled to for winning the Noble Peace Prize. But his widow, Liu Xia,  was still in China. China would not let her go.   I told Rex: You go back to China, and you tell them the following. If  they release Liu Xia, if they let her go, I will stop pressing to pass  this bill. But if they don't, I will continue pressing to pass it, and  we will succeed. I have already passed it 100 to nothing in the U.S.  Senate, and the next time, we are going to get it passed in the House  as well and get it passed into law.   Just a few weeks later, communist China released Liu Xia. She was  able to receive the prize money for the Noble Peace Prize and escape  the oppression of communist China.   This story speaks volumes about the weakness of a tyrannical regime,  just how vulnerable they are to sunshine, to truth, to transparency, to  being called out.   Renaming the street in front of the Cuban Embassy after Oswaldo Paya  would shine a light and would highlight the truth about the communist  regime in Cuba. It would be a powerful tool in bringing down the  machinery of oppression there.   We saw not long ago thousands of Cubans taking to the street,  fighting for liberty. The Cuban people should know the American people  stand with them against tyranny and against the communist oppression,  the poverty, the misery, the death under which they live every day, and  it would be a powerful tool to bringing down the machinery of  oppression in Cuba in the nonviolent way that Oswaldo Paya so  powerfully championed.   This Congress, I am very hopeful that my bill to rename the street in  front of the Cuban Embassy ``Oswaldo Paya Way'' will be passed by both  Chambers.   Oswaldo Paya fought for a free Cuba--Cuba libre--built on human  decency, on human rights, where citizens are heard, not murdered by  their government. Let's come together, Democrats and Republicans, to  honor Oswaldo Paya. Let's come together and force the communist regime  to say his name.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
