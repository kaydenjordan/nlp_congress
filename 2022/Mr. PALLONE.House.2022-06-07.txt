Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 7667.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Food and Drug  Amendments of 2022, a bill that recently passed out of the Energy and  Commerce Committee with unanimous support. This bill will provide the  FDA the funding it needs to ensure drugs and devices are safe and  effective. It also promotes development of new medical products to  treat every American, reduces the cost of prescription drugs, and  strengthens program integrity at the agency.   Primarily, the user fee reauthorization's main purpose is to give the  agency funding to conduct product reviews, facilitate the development  of new products to treat rare diseases, inspect facilities to ensure  they are compliant, and monitor medical products on the market for  continued safety and effectiveness.   It is essential that the House pass this legislation today because  funding that comes from these user fees expires in September. At  hearings earlier this year, senior FDA officials told us that failure  to pass this legislation well before the September deadline could be  catastrophic to the agency's operations and, more importantly, could  limit our ability to get patients the medical products that they and  their doctors rely on.   Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased that in addition to coming together to  reauthorize this funding, we have worked across the aisle to come to  agreement on a wide-ranging package of programs to improve biomedical  research and development, give FDA more tools to conduct quality  inspections, improve the medical product supply chain, improve generic  drug competition and access, and bring greater transparency and program  integrity to FDA's operations.   While I do not have time to discuss all the provisions in the Food  and Drug Amendments of 2022, I want to highlight a few.   First, the bill includes reforms to the accelerated approval program,  which I first introduced in Congress earlier this year. Under the  accelerated approval pathway, drugs may be approved based on a  surrogate endpoint, such as an improved lab measurement or  visualization on an MRI, even though additional evidence is still  needed to show a clear clinical benefit for the patient. If a drug is  approved under this pathway, the sponsor must conduct studies after the  product is on the market to show that the drug actually provides a  benefit to patients. This approval pathway has led to patients having  access to groundbreaking treatments for cancer, HIV, and other  illnesses faster than they otherwise would have.   However, in recent years, it has become clear that some drug sponsors  have failed to conduct their post-approval studies in a timely manner,  while others have conducted studies that indicate that the drug is not  effective but are able to keep the product on the market for years  afterwards.   Patients deserve to know the drugs they are taking are safe and  effective. Food and Drug Amendments of 2022 ensures that the products  patients are taking are providing a benefit by allowing FDA to require  that sponsors begin adequate and well-controlled post-approval studies  before the drug goes on the market. The legislation will provide  greater transparency in drug labeling, and it streamlines the process  for FDA to remove products from the market when the sponsors have  failed to act with due diligence to conduct studies or where studies  have failed to show a benefit to patients.   The second thing is, this legislation ensures that clinical trials  for drugs and medical devices are representative of the people who will  use the products. The lack of diversity in clinical trials is an urgent  problem. It compromises our ability to understand how drugs and  diseases affect populations differently, compounds health disparities,  and can hinder innovation and add cost burdens into the health system.   Food and Drug Amendments of 2022 for the first time will require drug  and device sponsors to develop a clinical trial diversity action plan  early in the development process and submit the plan to FDA. This will  help improve our understanding of these products and lead to better  outcomes for all Americans.   Food and Drug Amendments of 2022 will also help lower drug costs by  making it easier for generic products to come to market. Under current  law, generic drug sponsors sometimes need to play a guessing game of  the ingredients in brand drugs, and this can add months on to the  generic drug development process. Under Food and Drug Amendments of  2022, we are making it easier for FDA to communicate this information  to drug sponsors, thereby speeding up development times for generics.  The bill will also make it easier for generics to come to market when a  brand drug changes its label at the last second in an attempt to limit  competition. Together, these provisions will produce millions of  dollars in savings for American families and the overall healthcare  system.   This legislation also takes concrete action to address the infant  formula crisis American families are currently facing, and which we are  so concerned about, and will prevent future problems related to food  safety and supply, so it's not just about infant formula, but about  food safety in general.   Currently, FDA is operating its food safety and other divisions with  one  [[Page H5320]]  hand tied behind its back when it comes to hiring and retaining highly  qualified scientific and regulatory staff. Today, FDA can hire  technical staff in its drug and medical device centers under  streamlined processes and compete with the private sector in terms of  salary, but those same flexibilities do not extend to other centers,  including those overseeing food at the FDA. Our bill would extend these  to the oversight of food, tobacco, and other products regulated by the  agency. While we must do more in this area, I am pleased that we are  able to move forward on a bipartisan basis here today. I think it is  going to make a difference, Mr. Speaker, not only with infant formula  but with so many other food products.    Lastly, Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce  Committee for their cooperation and bipartisan work on this package. As  I said, it passed unanimously out of the committee last month, thanks  to the leadership of Health Subcommittee Chairwoman Eshoo, Ranking  Member Guthrie, and the full committee Ranking Member Rodgers.   When you bring a bill to the floor on suspension and it is  bipartisan, and it was voted out of committee unanimously, it might  kind of belie the amount of work that the staff who are here with me  today and others put into this. This was a lot of work. It wasn't easy  to get it done in a timely fashion, even though it has unanimous  support. I hope today everyone will vote for it; I do not want anyone  to get the impression that this was not an easy thing to accomplish  because it certainly was.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Members to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers at this time.  I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I couldn't agree more with what Ranking Member Guthrie  said, and also our full committee ranking member, Mrs. Rodgers. This is  a product of a lot of hard work on behalf of members, as well as the  staff that are here, and others. It is really great that we are able to  do it in a timely fashion because we want the FDA to be able to  operate, not to have to put out pink slips because the authorization  expires in September.   This is really a reauthorization that does a lot more than just  reauthorize the current programs. It really is going to make a  difference in terms of our ability to innovate and also affect access  to generic drugs.   Madam Speaker, I encourage all Members to support the bill. We are  going to work hard to get this passed in the Senate in a timely  fashion.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
