 Madam Speaker, last Friday a student brought a  gun into Olathe East High School. By noon, three people, an assistant  principal, a school resource officer, and a student were on their way  to the Overland Park Regional Medical Center with gunshot wounds.   Students hid in classrooms sending texts that every parent dreads  receiving: Someone is shooting inside the school. Thanks to the actions  of Officer Erik Clark and the assistant principal Kaleb Stoppel, those  parents were able to reunite with their students safely on Friday  afternoon.   We are all grateful and hoping for their full recovery. I know I am  not alone in thinking that things could have been much worse were it  not for their intervention.   I would also like to commend the Olathe Police Department, fire  department, and Johnson County MED-ACT for their exemplary response.  Thank you for helping keep our community safe. These are the headlines  that every American is tired of reading, that everyone fears will come  to their doorstep.   We must step up mental health support in schools--not just in the  aftermath of trauma, but permanently. I stand with every parent,  educator, student, and Kansan who has come together to call for  commonsense gun safety. We have to be brave enough to put our kids'  lives first.
