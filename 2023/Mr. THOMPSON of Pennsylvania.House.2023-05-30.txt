 Mr. Speaker, in light of Memorial Day,  I rise today to recognize three Falls Creek natives, which are  Jefferson and Clearfield Counties, for founding the first of its kind  tea company with a focus on giving back to veteran and first responder  organizations.   Mike, Chris, and Joey Britton founded Artillery Tea Co. with veterans  and first responders in mind. The youngest brother, Joey, is a 9-year  Army veteran, giving the brothers firsthand access to these  organizations.   The company launched on July Fourth last year and is now spreading  the word and their mission to ``be able to support vets the best we  can.''   One of the groups they donate to is Gold Star Families. This group  supports families of fallen soldiers. They also work with Project  Lakeview, a group out of Delaware focused on supporting families of  fallen first responders.   Mr. Speaker, the brothers work with a partner in Pennsylvania to  manufacture the product, allowing them to keep everything as local as  possible. Tea can be ordered from artilleryteaco.com and can be shipped  anywhere.   On Memorial Day and every day, we should remember the great sacrifice  our men and women make to protect our freedoms and keep us safe.  Artillery Tea Co. focuses on continuing to support the families of  those whose loved ones paid the ultimate sacrifice.                            ____________________
