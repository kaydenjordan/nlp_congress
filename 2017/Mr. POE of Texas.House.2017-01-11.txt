 Mr. Speaker, human trafficking victims are slaves  living in fear, totally losing their identity.   On this National Human Trafficking Awareness Day, it is time to  publicly expose the traffickers. As a former judge in Texas, I used  public punishment to keep criminals from returning to my courtroom and  to discourage other criminals from committing more crimes.   This form of public shaming can be successful in combating human  trafficking. That is why, today, I introduced the SHAME Act. This bill  will give Federal judges the ability to publish the names and  photographs of both convicted human traffickers and the buyers of  trafficked victims. Buyers will no longer be able to hide in plain  sight under a cloak of anonymity.   My hope is that the SHAME Act strikes fear in those who think about  purchasing young women for sex. Perhaps the thought of having their  face on a billboard will make the scoundrels think twice about  participating in the modern-day slave trade. It is time to shame these  horrible humans out of business.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
