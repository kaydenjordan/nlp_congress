 Mr. Speaker, as a legislator, I know to look  at a bill's definitions. As House Republicans talk about rejecting  socialism in all its forms, it is important to understand just exactly  what my Republican colleagues are talking about.   Surely, it is not Social Security and Medicare, public schools,  public libraries, public safety, and roads and bridges? The bill  doesn't say. There is not a single definition of ``socialism'' or all  its forms.  [[Page H638]]    My colleague, Congressman Takano, gave my Republican colleagues an  opportunity to clarify. He offered an amendment stating that programs  like Social Security and Medicare are not socialism. Republicans  refused that amendment.   That makes me wonder if what Republicans are really doing here is  trying to reject things like bedrock social programs that so many of  our seniors and constituents rely on.   I support our Nation's market-based economy, and if my Republican  colleagues truly did the same, they would be using this time for  legislation that creates jobs and lowers costs for all American  families. This bill does neither.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my Republican colleagues to focus their time on  the issues that will help all of our constituents achieve the promise  of America.
