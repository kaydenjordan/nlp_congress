 Mr. President, to my good friend--we work together on  so many things in agriculture--let me first say we all saw the  devastation caused by the storm across the Midwest last year. That is  why we have a strong crop insurance program in our bipartisan farm bill  that quickly responds when disasters strike.   Iowa producers have already received nearly $600 million in crop  insurance indemnities for damages in 2020. If crop insurance can't meet  the need, the other opportunity is to consider something in  appropriations.   It should not be here. I urge a ``no'' vote because it would take  away, in this amendment, critical funds to repair our broken food  supply chain; support our farmers, our food banks, our frontline  workers, and our families in need.   We know the supply chain is broken. This provision is going to help  fix that, and I would urge a ``no'' vote. Don't take money away from  here, which is so critically needed for farmers and ranchers.   Thank you.                          Vote on Amendment No. 902     Mr. President, I rise today in support of provisions in  this bill that support socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers.   One-fifth of all rural Americans--10.5 million people--are people of  color. For Black, Native American, Hispanic and Latinx, and Asian  American farm families, their experience in the agricultural economy is  markedly different than their White counterparts. This has been  particularly true when it comes to the interactions between farmers of  color and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. This history of  longstanding systemic discrimination against farmers of color is well  documented. Congress has long recognized this discrimination against  farmers of color by USDA and, through various mechanisms, has sought to  remedy and alleviate systemic barriers that prevented socially  disadvantaged farmers and ranchers from fully participating in the  American farm economy. However, those efforts have fallen short, and  Congress is now providing additional assistance.   Various factors have contributed to the historic loss of farmland  owned and operated by farmers of color. According to the Economic  Research Service, a century ago, Black farmers owned more than 15  million acres of agricultural land and operated almost 1 million farms.  A century later, data from the 2017 Census of Agriculture indicated  that Black farmers own fewer than 2.9 million acres, less than a fifth  of what they owned in 1920. A Tufts University analysis estimated the  value of that lost farmland at more than $120 billion in lost  opportunities. According to a 2019 article in the Atlantic, ``The Great  Land Robbery,'' in the recovery from the Great Depression, the New Deal  Farm Security Administration at the U.S. Department of Agriculture  denied loans to poor Black farmers that were available to their White  neighbors.   In 1830, the Indian Removal Act formalized Native American removal as  a federally sanctioned practice, removing tens of thousands of original  inhabitants from their traditional lands within existing State borders  to land west of the Mississippi River. The removal disrupted land  ownership and tenure and reoriented traditional farm production  techniques. The Homestead Act, enacted in 1862, allowed settlers to  claim 160 acres of surveyed government land. Records in the National  Archive show that land had been inhabited by Native Americans, but  Native Americans were not eligible to participate in the program.   The California Alien Land Laws of 1913 and 1920 denied Asian  immigrants the opportunity to purchase farmland or enter into long-term  lease contracts until a 1952 court decision held the law to be  unconstitutional. During World War II, tens of thousands of first and  second generation Japanese American families were forced off their  farms and into internment camps. For perspective, an estimated half of  Japanese Americans living in California at the time were involved in  agriculture according to a February 12, 2021, article in ``Civil  Eats.''   Hispanic farmers have faced a particularly difficult time with  discrimination at the U.S. Department of Agriculture because  demographic information about Hispanic farmers wasn't even collected  separately by the Census of Agriculture until 1974. According to USDA,  the Census of Agriculture started collecting demographic information  about minority farmers in 1900 and published the first record of  minority farmers in 1920 but neglected to include Hispanic farmers.  This lack of historical documentation has resulted in many Hispanic  farmers being left out of critical farm programs and has made it  difficult to resolve issues of discrimination and civil rights. A 2001  article in the Natural Resources Journal entitled ``Livestock Racism  and Traditional  [[Page S1263]]  Culture in Northern New Mexico'' noted additional struggles Hispanic  farmers and ranchers have had with grazing issues and Federal land  management, including USDA programs.   American institutions both public and private have thoroughly  documented this discrimination. Numerous reports issued since the Civil  Rights Era in the 1960s have shown a consistent pattern of  discrimination, in particular by USDA, against Black, Indigenous, and  other farmers of color. Much of the following history was laid out by  House Agriculture Committee Chairman David Scott during his floor  statement in support of the American Rescue Plan provisions on February  26, 2021.         A 1965 report by the United States Commission on Civil       Rights found that Federal, state, and local officials       discriminated against Black farmers in agricultural programs       and that this discrimination actively contributed to the       decline in the Black ownership of farmland.   In 1968, a follow up report from the United States Commission on  Civil Rights found that Black farmers continued to face discrimination  when seeking farm loans and other forms of assistance.        In 1970, the United States Commission on Civil Rights again       found that discrimination continued in USDA program       administration. The 1970 report indicated that prior to 1968,       no Black farmer had ever been elected to any former       Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service committee       at the county level in the South. In 1970, two out of more       than 4,100 committee members in the South were Black farmers,       even though there were 58 counties in the South, where Black       farmers comprised a majority of the farm operator population.       It is hard to view as coincidence then that half a million       Black-owned farms in the U.S. failed between 1950 and 1975.        In 1982, the United States Commission on Civil Rights       issued another report on the rapid decline of Black-operated       farms. The report noted that between 1970 and 1980, the Black       farm population declined 65 percent, compared to a 22 percent       decline in the white farm population. The report also       documented numerous discrimination complaints filed against       USDA field offices regarding the administration of farm loan       programs and noted that for many of these complaints, USDA's       Office of Equal Opportunity investigated and found equal       opportunity violations at those field offices. The report       concluded that racial discrimination was continuing within       the USDA, at USDA headquarters, and in the network of field       offices that implement USDA programs. Instead of responding       to recommendations of the report, President Ronald Reagan and       Agriculture Secretary John Block closed the Office in 1983,       and it would remain closed for another 13 years until       reopened under President Bill Clinton and Secretary Dan       Glickman in 1996.        A 1995 U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) report       found that socially disadvantaged producers were       significantly underrepresented on the county and community       committees of the former Agricultural Stabilization and       Conservation Service. Specifically, the report found that       while minority producers accounted for nearly 5 percent of       the producers eligible to vote for committee members,       minority producers only represented 2.1 percent of county       committee members in the United States.        In 1997, the USDA formed a Civil Rights Action Team to hold       nationwide listening sessions to hear from socially       disadvantaged and minority farmers. A report published after       the listening sessions documented Black, Hispanic, Asian-      American, and American Indian farmers who told stories of       USDA hurting minority farmers more than helping them.       Minority farmers described how their discrimination       complaints were caught in the backlog of appeals or if       successfully appealed, were given findings of discrimination       that were not enforced. The report acknowledged that       discrimination in USDA program delivery continued to exist to       a large degree unabated.        Also in 1997, the USDA Office of the Inspector General       (OIG) issued a report to the USDA Secretary that noted ``a       climate of disorder within the civil rights staff at the Farm       Service Agency.'' It was difficult for the OIG to even       determine the number and status of civil rights complaints at       the agency and department because of that climate.        A 1998 OIG report noted the OIG had issued 44 recent       recommendations to USDA to improve its civil rights       complaints and improve relations with minority farmers and       stated that several of those recommendations had yet to be       implemented.        In 1998, the USDA National Commission on Small Farms       further described and documented the longstanding       discrimination of USDA towards socially disadvantaged       producers. And, it observed that ``discrimination has been a       contributing factor in the decline of Black farmers over the       last several decades.'' The Commission's report also notes       the ``history of under-allocation of resources to       institutions that have served minority farmers,'' the       ``disgraceful'' ``failure to elect minority farmers to       positions on Farm Service Agency County Committees,'' and       more.        During the period between 1997 and 2000, Black farmers,       Native American farmers, and Hispanic farmers filed lawsuits       alleging USDA discriminated against them on the basis of race       in processing their farm program applications and that USDA       failed to investigate their complaints of discrimination.        In 2001, a report by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights       documented the continued discriminatory lending practices       against minority farmers. The Commission found that Black       farmers waited four times longer than white farmers for USDA       farm loans. The Commission recommended that USDA resolve the       backlog of civil rights complaints and document and alleviate       discriminatory lending practices. However, USDA continued to       struggle with resolving its backlog of civil rights       complaints.        In a 2005 audit the OIG stated in a report, ``it took 12       days longer to complete minority applications, delinquencies       were higher for minority borrowers than non-minority       borrowers, and minority borrowers were reluctant to enter       into Farm Service Agency offices to apply for loans.''        In 2008, GAO reported that USDA's difficulties in resolving       discrimination complaints persisted and that the USDA had not       achieved its goal of preventing future backlogs of       discrimination complaints.        The 2010 Jackson Lewis report provided over 200       recommendations to USDA on civil rights issues, including       recommendations related to civil rights issues in USDA's farm       lending program and minority farmer access to other USDA       programs.        Recent studies and reports continue to document the       challenges and barriers faced by farmers of color due to race       or ethnic discrimination or the legacy of such       discrimination. A September 20, 2017, study in the       Agriculture and Human Values journal described the challenges       faced by Latinx farmers due to failure of agricultural       agencies to engage in appropriate outreach or account for       language barriers.        Most recently in 2019, a GAO report observed that despite       specific preference, socially disadvantaged farmers and       ranchers had proportionately fewer Farm Service Agency direct       and guaranteed loans than non-socially disadvantaged farmers       and ranchers. This report found that farmers and ranchers of       color continued to face more difficulties in obtaining farm       loans and highlighted the historic, systemic discrimination       against such farmers.    The record of discriminatory conduct at USDA, as well as the library  of studies and reports chronicling that discrimination is indeed long  and details many of the barriers between farmers of color and the  Department that prevent these farm families from accessing the same  programs and experiencing the same success as their White counterparts.   To address long and well-documented history of systemic  discrimination, successive Congresses have worked in a bicameral and  bipartisan manner over the years to authorize and oversee  implementation of programs at USDA.   During the agriculture credit crisis in the 1980s, Congress addressed  this well-documented systemic discrimination at USDA and began to  target assistance at the U.S. Department of Agriculture to ``socially  disadvantaged farmers or ranchers,'' a farmer or rancher who has been  subjected to racial or ethnic prejudice because of their identity as a  member of a socially disadvantaged group without regard to their  individual qualities. Congress provided support that targeted and  prioritizes USDA resources to ensure farmers of color have the same  opportunities as White farmers. Today, this support has grown to  include a broad range of set-asides, special programs, and incentives  for socially disadvantaged farmers.   In 1987, Congress passed the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987. Section  617 of this bill required the USDA to establish annual target  participation rates, on a countywide basis, that would ensure that  members of socially disadvantaged groups receive direct or guaranteed  farm ownership loans. Congress amended this requirement in 1996 to  ensure that USDA's implementation was consistent with the holding of  the Supreme Court in Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Federico Pena,  Secretary of Transportation, 515 U.S. 200 (1995), which held that race- based actions by the government is within constitutional constraints  when it is necessary to further a compelling interest such as the  ``unhappy persistence of both the practice and lingering effects of  racial discrimination against minority groups.''    In the 1990 farm bill, Congress took additional steps to recognize  socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers and created a landmark new  program, the 2501 Socially Disadvantaged Farmer and Rancher Outreach  program,  [[Page S1264]]  which is designed specifically to improve outreach and technical  assistance to farmers of color.   In section 741 of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug  Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1999 (7 U.S.C.  2279 note), Congress took the extraordinary step of suspending the  application of the then-2-year statute of limitations regarding Equal  Credit Opportunity Claims. This allowed claimants in discrimination  suits against USDA, including Black farmers in Pigford v. Glickman and  Native American farmers in Keepseagle v. Veneman, to cite at times  decades-old instances of discrimination to qualify for payments under  the respective settlements.   In the 2002 farm bill, Congress created the Office of the Assistant  Secretary for Civil Rights, with statutory authority to ensure  compliance of all civil rights laws and incorporation of civil rights  activities into the strategic planning of the U.S. Department of  Agriculture.   A sense of Congress in the 2008 farm bill stated that claims and  class actions brought against USDA by socially disadvantaged farmers or  ranchers, including Native American, Hispanic, and female farmers or  ranchers, on racial, ethnic, or gender discrimination in farm program  participation should be quickly and fairly resolved. Congress reacted  to USDA's discriminatory history and provided $100 million to help  settle the Pigford discrimination claims and established a moratorium  on acceleration and foreclosure proceedings by USDA against any farmer  or rancher who filed a discrimination claim. To further support  Pigford, Congress provided an additional $1.15 billion in funding in  the Claims Resolution Act of 2010 to settle the additional claims in  the Pigford II class action lawsuit.   The 2014 farm bill created a permanent Office of Tribal Relations  under the Secretary of Agriculture.   Because of the continuing and systemic nature of these concerns, the  2018 farm bill permanently funded the section 2501 Socially  Disadvantaged Farmer and Rancher Outreach Program and provided new  support to address longstanding heirs property and farmland ownership  issues. Additionally, because Congress recognized that discrimination  is both pervasive and ongoing, the 2018 farm bill also required the  production of several reports by GAO on how both latent and overt  discrimination manifest in agriculture programs, including a report  specifically on bias-related to loan credit issues for farmers of color  within the socially disadvantaged designation to inform Congress for  future legislation. As important as Congress's actions have been, the  remedies are still not enough as there is still ongoing and pervasive  discrimination leaving socially disadvantaged farmers significantly  behind.   Settlements resulting from the Pigford and Keepseagle lawsuits, along  with Garcia v. Vilsack that focused on discrimination against Hispanic  and Latinx farmers, have not provided the relief necessary for these  farmers of color to participate fully in the American agricultural  economy. For example, the Los Angeles Times reported in 2012 that  payments made to Black farmers under the Pigford settlements were  significantly eroded by State taxes, as well as tax debt related to  forgiven USDA farm loans. In Keepseagle only a very small percentage of  potential claimants even applied. This was largely due to the older age  of many potential claimants and because they were difficult to contact.  Claims adjudication simply was not effective and did not adequately  remedy the discrimination.   Specifically in the area of farm lending, as recently as 2 years ago,  two GAO reports showed that socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers  have more difficulty getting loans and credit from USDA. These loans  can help beginning farmers break into the business and help existing  farmers continue running their operations. One of the GAO reports  focused on the specific barriers of Tribal farmers accessing credit and  the other GAO report highlights the systemic discrimination that has  hindered farmers of color for generations continue today.   Similarly, a 2019 report from the National Young Farmers Coalition on  the structural challenges facing farmers in California shows that while  White respondents reported that they had no gaps in access to resources  like business entity choice, credit lending, land access and lease  development, marketing, policy advocacy, and regulatory navigation;  non-White respondents reported significantly impaired access to those  same resources, and Native American respondents reported receiving none  of the listed resources.   The Farm Bill Law Enterprise reported that 99.4 percent of USDA's  Market Facilitation Program payments went to White farmers. Similarly,  the Environmental Working Group reported that nonminority farmers  received nearly 97 percent of the $9.2 billion provided through USDA's  first Coronavirus Food Assistance Program in 2020.   The diminished relationships between socially disadvantaged farmers  and USDA as a result of both latent barriers and historic  discrimination limits access of socially disadvantaged farmers to  USDA's program, making it more difficult or impossible for socially  disadvantaged farmers to participate in USDA programs. The statistics  continue to bear this out: 73 percent of Black farmers, when surveyed  by the Federation of Southern Cooperatives/Land Assistance Fund, an  association of Black farmers and landowners, were not even aware of the  agricultural aid provisions of the coronavirus rescue programs at USDA.   Congress recognizes the longstanding systemic discrimination against  farmers of color by USDA. Despite multiple congressional efforts to  address this discrimination, these efforts, taken mostly on a case-by  case basis, have still not remedied the discrimination. Congress is now  continuing to address this longstanding, widespread, and well- documented discrimination against socially disadvantaged farmers and  ranchers, including systemic barriers preventing socially disadvantaged  farmers and ranchers from fully participating in the American farm  economy, in recognition that our mostly case-by-case efforts thus far  have not done enough. Because of discrimination in USDA's programs,  particularly loan programs, at USDA, socially disadvantaged farmers and  ranchers are less likely to have the same access to adequate loan  servicing and face other barriers in USDA programs, as their White  counterparts. As a result, their loans are more likely to be in default  or in a precarious situation.   Sections 1005 and 1006 of the American Rescue Plan contain narrowly  tailored provisions to address the discrimination in credit and other  programs at USDA, the effects of which have been magnified by the  pandemic, as well as programmatic changes to support socially  disadvantaged farmers and ranchers. The sections provide funding for  payments on existing USDA direct and guaranteed loans held by socially  disadvantaged farmers and ranchers. In addition, this legislation is  providing tools and funding for programs and systemic reforms at USDA  to undo the systemic racism that has prevented socially disadvantaged  farmers and ranchers from getting access to critical agricultural  credit.   The public recognition of longstanding discrimination against  socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers and the accompanying broad  support for this work along the food and agriculture supply chain is  overwhelming and represents every corner of American food and farming.  More than 600 farm, food, and rural organizations, businesses, equity  advocates, and legal scholars have sent letters, documents and issued  statements of support. Notably, each of these letters includes both  acknowledgment that these ongoing barriers exist, and a great many cite  staggering examples of the disadvantages many farmers of color  experience, as well as why the provisions contained in sections 1005  and 1006 of the American Rescue Plan are an appropriate remedy for  these important producers.   While earlier versions of this legislation included specific  references to the longstanding discrimination within the Department of  Agriculture, as noted in Chairman Scott's February 26, 2021, statement  for the record, the manager's amendment in the House Rules Committee  was purely to ensure that these sections would meet the requirements of  section 313 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 for consideration  in the U.S. Senate. Congress includes these measures to address the  [[Page S1265]]  longstanding and widespread systemic discrimination within the USDA,  particularly within the loan programs, against socially disadvantaged  farmers and ranchers.
