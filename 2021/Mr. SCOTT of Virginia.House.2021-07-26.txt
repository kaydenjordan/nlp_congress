 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (S. 848) to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 in  order to improve the service obligation verification process for TEACH  Grant recipients, and for other purposes.

Upon receipt of such a request, the       Secretary shall reconsider the determination in accordance       with this paragraph not later than 90 days after the date       that such request was received.        ``(B) Reconsideration.--If, in reconsidering an initial       determination under subparagraph (A) (including       reconsideration related to a TEACH Grant that was converted       to a loan prior to the date of enactment of the Consider       Teachers Act of 2021 and including cases where such loans       were fully or partially paid), the Secretary determines that       the reason for such determination was the recipient's failure       to timely submit a certification required under subsection       (b)(1)(D) (as in effect on the day before the date of       enactment of the Consider Teachers Act of 2021), an error or       processing delay by the Secretary, a change to the fields       considered eligible for fulfillment of the service obligation       (as described in subsection (b)(1)(C)), a recipient having       previously requested to have the TEACH Grant converted to a       loan, or another valid reason determined by the Secretary,       and that the recipient has, as of the date of the       reconsideration, demonstrated that the recipient did meet, or       is meeting the service obligation in the agreement under       subsection (b), the Secretary shall--        ``(i) discharge the Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford       Loan under part D, and reinstate the recipient's grant under       this subpart;        ``(ii) discharge any interest or fees that may have       accumulated during the period that the grant was converted to       a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan under part D;        ``(iii) if the recipient has other loans under part D,       apply any payments made for the Federal Direct Unsubsidized       Stafford Loan under part D during such period to those other       loans under part D;        ``(iv) if the recipient does not have other loans under       part D, reimburse the recipient for any amounts paid on the       Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan under part D during       such period;        ``(v) request that consumer reporting agencies remove any       negative credit reporting due to the conversion of the TEACH       Grant to a loan; and        ``(vi) use the additional information provided under       subparagraph (A) to determine the progress the recipient has       made in meeting the service obligation.        ``(C) Extension of time to complete service obligation.--In       the case of a recipient whose TEACH Grant was reinstated in       accordance with subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall, upon       such reinstatement--        ``(i) extend the time remaining for the recipient to       fulfill the service obligation described in subsection (b)(1)       to a period of time equal to--         ``(I) 8 years; minus        ``(II) the number of full academic years of teaching that       the recipient completed prior to the reconversion of the loan       to a TEACH Grant under subparagraph (B), including any years       of qualifying teaching completed during the period when the       TEACH Grant was in loan status; and         ``(ii) treat any full academic years of teaching described       in clause (i)(II) as years that count toward the individual's       service obligation (regardless of whether the TEACH Grant       funds were in grant or loan status) if that time otherwise       meets the requirements of this section.''; and        (3) in subsection (d), by adding at the end the following:        ``(3) Communication with recipients.--The Secretary shall       notify TEACH grant recipients not less than once per calendar       year regarding how to submit the employment certification       under subsection (b)(1)(D) and the recommendations and       requirements for submitting that certification under       subsection (d)(5).        ``(4) Qualifying schools and high-need fields.--The       Secretary shall maintain and annually update a list of       qualifying schools as described in subsection (b)(1)(B), and       a list of high-need fields as described in subsection       (b)(1)(C) and shall make such lists publicly available on the       Department's website in a sortable and searchable format.''.       SEC. 3. SUBMISSION OF EMPLOYMENT CERTIFICATION.         Section 420N(d) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20       U.S.C. 1070g-2(d)), as amended by section 2, is further       amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(5) Submission of employment certification.--        ``(A) Recommended submissions.--The Secretary shall notify       TEACH Grant recipients that the Department recommends that       TEACH Grant recipients submit the employment certification       described in subsection (b)(1)(D) as soon as practicable       after the completion of each year of service.        ``(B) Required submission.--A TEACH Grant recipient shall       be required to submit to the Department employment       certification within the timeframe that would allow that       individual to complete their service obligation before the       end of the service obligation window.        ``(C) Notification.--The Secretary shall notify TEACH Grant       recipients of the required submission deadlines described in       this paragraph.        ``(D) Adjustment of deadline.--The Secretary shall adjust       the submission deadline described in subparagraph (B) to       account for a service obligation window extension.        ``(E) Alternative to certification.--The Secretary shall       provide an alternative to the certification of employment       described in subsection (b)(1)(D) for recipients who cannot       obtain such required certification of employment from the       chief administrative officer of the school because the       recipient can demonstrate the school is no longer in       existence or the school refuses to cooperate.''.       SEC. 4. EXTENSION OF TIME TO FULFILL SERVICE OBLIGATION DUE                     TO COVID-19.         (a) Section 3519(a) of the CARES Act (Public Law 116-136;       20 U.S.C. 1001 note) is amended--        (1) in the matter preceding paragraph (1), by striking       ``For the purpose of section 420N of the Higher Education Act       of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070g-2), during a qualifying emergency,''       and inserting ``Notwithstanding any provision of subpart 9 of       part A of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20       U.S.C. 1070g et seq.),'';        (2) in paragraph (1), by striking ``and'' after the       semicolon;        (3) in paragraph (2), by striking ``such section 420N.''       and inserting ``section 420N of such Act; and''; and        (4) by adding at the end the following:        ``(3) shall extend the service obligation window (as       described in section 420N(b)(1)(A) of such Act) for a period       of not more than 3 years, in addition to any extensions       provided in accordance with subpart 9 of part A of title IV       of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070g et       seq.), in the case of a grant recipient whose service       obligation window begins during, or includes--        ``(A) the qualifying emergency period; or        ``(B) a period of recession or economic downturn related to       the qualifying emergency period, as determined by the       Secretary in consultation with the Secretary of Labor.''.

(c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section       shall take effect as if included in the enactment of the       CARES Act (Public Law 116-136).       SEC. 5. IMPLEMENTATION.         In carrying out this Act and any amendments made by this       Act, or any regulations promulgated under this Act or under       such amendments, the Secretary of Education may waive the       application of--        (1) subchapter I of chapter 35 of title 44, United States       Code (commonly known as the ``Paperwork Reduction Act'');        (2) the master calendar requirements under section 482 of       the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1089);        (3) negotiated rulemaking under section 492 of the Higher       Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1098a); and        (4) the requirement to publish the notices related to the       system of records of the agency before implementation       required under paragraphs (4) and (11) of section 552a(e) of       title 5, United States Code (commonly known as the ``Privacy       Act of 1974''), except that the notices shall be published       not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this       Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on S. 848, the Consider Teachers Act of  2021.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 848, the Consider Teachers  Act, introduced by Senators Braun and Sinema in the Senate, and led by  Delegate Holmes Norton and Representative Spartz in the House.   High quality teachers are the backbone of our Nation's education  system. Yet, since even before the COVID-19 pandemic, communities  across the country, particularly low-income communities, have faced a  growing shortage of educators.                                time  1415    To address this shortage, the Teacher Education Assistance for  College and Higher Education grant program, or the TEACH grant program,  offers upfront grant aid to incentivize individuals to pursue teaching  and serve in low-income communities.   Since 2007 these grants have helped people across the country become  high-quality teachers in the communities where they are needed most.  However, administrative issues with the program have inadvertently  converted thousands of these grants into loans which must be paid back  with interest. According to an investigative report in 2016, upwards of  63 percent of TEACH grants had been converted to loans, leaving badly  needed teachers with burdensome debt.   The bipartisan bill we are considering today addresses these issues  in two key ways: First, it implements a reconsideration process to  ensure TEACH grant recipients do not see their grants converted into  loans by mistake; and, second, the bill creates flexibility so that  teachers can still fulfill the grant's requirements in light of school  closures and disruptions caused by the pandemic.   Simply put, the Consider Teachers Act is a bipartisan legislative fix  which will ensure TEACH grants can continue to strengthen and expand  our Nation's teacher workforce.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may  consume to the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to reiterate again my thanks to Representative  Spartz and Delegate Norton for working across the aisle on this  bipartisan priority in the House.   As my colleagues have reiterated, the TEACH grant program is supposed  to  [[Page H3854]]  help prepare high quality and diverse educators for our Nation's  underserved students. Today it is critical that the TEACH grant program  actually works as intended as we recover from a global health emergency  that cost education jobs, exacerbated achievement gaps, and worsened  the teacher shortage in many States and districts. That is why we must  ensure that Federal initiatives to strengthen the teacher workforce  make it easier, not harder, for individuals to enter the teaching  profession.   The Consider Teaching Act would help achieve this goal by ensuring  that TEACH grants do not have the unintended effect of leaving  educators with burdensome loans. This simple yet urgent step will allow  prospective teachers across the country to continue accessing the  resources they need to pursue careers in teaching.   Importantly, this bill is an opportunity to demonstrate that  regardless of party affiliation, each of us in Congress shares a  commitment to improving the quality of education by investing in well- prepared teachers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues, again, to support the bill and  vote for the Consider Teachers Act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
