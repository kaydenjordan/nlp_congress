 Thank you, Mr. President.   When President Trump took office, he said that job No. 1 this year  was getting the economy growing again. As a business guy--I am going to  speak very quickly because I think the majority leader is on the way  down to the floor--he said the first thing we had to do to get the  economy going were three things: No. 1, pull back on the onerous  regulations. Well, so far this year 860 rules and regulations have been  reversed. No. 2, he said we have to unleash our God-given energy  potential. So far, Keystone Pipeline, the Clean Power Plan, and ANWR  are underway.   Finally, we have to change the Tax Code, and that is what we are here  debating this week. I am very optimistic that this plan will absolutely  put people back to work, put money back in their pockets, and make our  American economy and the people who participate in it competitive with  the rest of the world.   With that, I notice that the majority leader is on the floor, and I  yield back.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.                            ____________________
