 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the fiscal year 2017  budget resolution.   The need for this process can best be explained by a story I have  been telling my colleagues.   A little over 6 years ago, I lived in a pretty decent house. One day  I heard a knock on the door, and before I knew  [[Page H496]]  it, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle had let a goat loose  in my house. Now, for 6 years that goat has been messing in and  destroying my house. I want to renovate my house, but before I can, I  have to get the goat out of the house before it does any more damage.  It makes no sense to start fixing up my house until I can get the goat  out. Voting for the fiscal year `17 budget resolution gets this goat  out of my house.   Mr. Chairman, make no mistake: we must renovate our house; we must  undo the Affordable Care Act. We can no longer as a nation hold on to  policies that rob us of our freedom of choice, that destroy family  finances, that rob people of their jobs, and leave the most vulnerable  with substandard care.   Now is the time for a 21st century healthcare system that puts  patients and doctors first and sends government regulators and  rulemakers to the back row. No more 32 percent increase in Georgia  premiums; no more having your doctor pulled away from you; and no more  government mandates.   This is not a return to the pre-ObamaCare status quo, but is a new  approach to putting consumers in the driver's seat. The first step in  this process is to gut ObamaCare with this resolution, and I am honored  to support it.
