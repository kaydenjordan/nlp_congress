 Mr. President, it is good to see the Senate taking up a  genuinely bipartisan bill this week. A group of Members from both  parties have spent weeks developing this legislation, and we saw the  result of their work in the bipartisan support for proceeding to this  bill.   Now, we need to let that bipartisan process continue. We need to give  Members who weren't a part of the bipartisan group a chance to weigh  in, and that means making sure that we have a robust amendment process.   I know the majority leader is eager to get through this legislation  and on to the Democrats' next piece of what is partisan legislation,  and that is a $3\1/2\ trillion tax-and-spending spree, but  [[Page S5539]]  that is not a good reason for rushing this infrastructure bill through  the Senate.   This is an enormous bill. It is more than 2,700 pages long, and the  legislative text was just released last night. To start with, Members  need time to digest this legislation, and then Members need the  opportunity to offer amendments.   The bill before us today is a genuinely bipartisan bill, and I am  very grateful for the tireless efforts of the Members who put in so  many long days and nights--and weekends, I might add--to get us to this  point.   Like a lot of our colleagues, I spent the weekend here in Washington  as the bipartisan group worked through many final drafting issues, and  I appreciate the fact that the members of the group took the time to  get the bill as right as possible before introducing it.   But this legislation was still put together by only a handful of  Senators. And unlike traditional highway bills, there are major pieces  of this legislation that haven't been through the rigor of a committee  process.   So all Members deserve the chance to weigh in. A number of Senators  have raised legitimate concerns about this legislation, such as whether  the proposed pay-fors are sufficient to keep this legislation  from driving up our debt, and they deserve to have the chance to air  those concerns and offer possible solutions.    Infrastructure legislation is some of the most essential legislation  that we consider. Commerce in this country depends on the strength of  our infrastructure, from up-to-date electric grids to well-maintained  airports and train tracks, ports and waterways, and roads and bridges.   We need to get this legislation right, and that means giving Members  ample time to examine the details of the bill, and it means giving  Members the chance to address any problems in the bill through a  meaningful amendment process. We shouldn't sacrifice adequate time on  this bill merely because the Democratic leader would like to spend next  week jamming a 100-percent partisan piece of legislation through the  U.S. Senate.   Let's honor the bipartisan process that has gotten us this far by  finishing this infrastructure bill with a robust, bipartisan amendment  process.   I yield the floor.

In order to reap the benefits of 5G, we must have a skilled workforce  in place to deploy the infrastructure necessary to support this new  technology.   Importantly, 5G technology will require not just traditional cell  phone towers, but small antennas called small cells that can often be  attached to existing infrastructure, like utility poles or buildings.  Wireless providers will need to install roughly 800,000 small cells  around the Nation to support this nationwide 5G network. And some  estimates suggest we will need an additional 20,000 tower climbers  alone for installation of this wireless infrastructure.   In addition, after installation, every one of these small cells will  have to be monitored and maintained, which will require a substantial  increase in the telecommunications workforce.   This amendment will help identify ways in which we can expand the  number of workers enrolled in 5G training programs and identify ways to  grow the telecommunications workforce well into the future.   This amendment received unanimous support by the Commerce Committee  earlier this year, and I would encourage my colleagues here to do the  same.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
