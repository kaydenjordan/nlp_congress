 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, the chairwoman of  the full committee, for yielding.   I have to say, when he cites that our Founders never envisioned a  large government, that is true--there were 13 colonies that became 13  States.   I will remind my friend from Kentucky, neither did they ever envision  the State of Kentucky. As a matter of fact, what is now Kentucky was  claimed and owned by my home State, Virginia. So there are a lot of  things that weren't envisioned back in the 1780s that we have to deal  with in the 21st century. That is what we are doing here today.   Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to discuss and advocate  for the Preventing Patronage System Act, H.R. 302.   Our Federal workforce--the crown jewel of our Federal Government,  especially during a pandemic--is comprised of roughly 2 million Federal  employees hired on the basis of their acumen, their skill, and their  dedication. They work each day for the American people--serving in  myriad capacities to improve the Nation and America's posture abroad.   These impartial civil servants deliver mail; provide medical care to  veterans; help families in the wake of hurricanes and deadly fires;  design websites that facilitate access to lifesaving payments like  Social Security, unemployment insurance, and tax returns; and they  build telescopes that make us rethink what is possible and what kind of  universe there is to be explored.   This bill, H.R. 302, would ensure that Congress controls when and how  to change the very nature of our invaluable civil service. It simply  returns power to the legislative branch.    The Preventing Patronage System Act would protect merit-system  principles in our civil service by limiting Federal employee  reclassifications to the five excepted service schedules in use prior  to fiscal year 2021. It doesn't preclude a President from requesting  authorization from Congress to create a new one, but it requires it. It  restores the balance.   Since the creation of the civil service in 1883, administrations have  established an excepted service schedule only five times. These  excepted service categories are created for positions that require  unique hiring or operating rules, such as positions of a short-term  political nature or positions in remote areas, or in instances in which  there is a critical hiring need.   On October 21, 2020, then-President Trump signed Executive Order No.  13957 unilaterally attempting to create a new one, schedule F, in the  excepted service. This executive order, according to a coalition of  good government groups--I have got 34 of them endorsing this bill-- could expose Federal employees to politically partisan motivated hiring  and firing.   As drafted by that former President, schedule F would require agency  heads to reclassify policy-determining, policymaking, or policy- advocating positions to a newly created schedule F. This action removes  the due process rights and civil service protections of employees moved  into that schedule.   Despite President Biden's rescinding of the schedule F, Axios  recently reported that former President Trump continues to develop a  unilateral plan to seize the reins of Federal Government and reclassify  up to 50,000 Federal civil servants, who are now part of the civil  service, and they would lose their protection and their merit-based  promotion.   Blind loyalty and ideological purity tests should never determine who  we trust with securing our Nation's borders, fortifying Federal IT  systems, caring for seniors and veterans, fighting public health  threats, or responding to natural disasters.   As one former Federal human resource expert said: Do we really think  a government of political hacks and sycophants is in the best interests  of the American people? Do we think making government more partisan  will make it more trusted by the people?   The non-partisan Partnership for Public Service stated: ``Endangering  the skilled employees at the core of our  [[Page H7850]]  government . . . would harm the delivery of crucial services to the  American people.''   Schedule F is a national security issue--and an issue that affects  delivery of essential services and resources to every family and every  business in this country.   H.R. 302 reinforces the legislative prerogative. It requires any  attempt to create a new excepted service to have explicit congressional  authorization.   It is bipartisan and it has 16 cosponsors, including three of my  friends on the other side of the aisle.   Changing the nature and operations of the civil service is rare,  important, and should require express congressional participation  through legislation.    Mr. Speaker, President Trump's schedule F would send  our Nation back to 1881 when President Garfield was shot by a man who  believed the support of the President should have earned him a  political partisan position in the Federal Government. Congress passed  the Pendleton Act in 1883, 2 years later, to a move away from that  patronage system, and it has been in place ever since.   As President Theodore Roosevelt said, ``The worst enemies of the  Republic are the demagogue and corruptionist. The spoils-monger and  spoils-seeker invariably breed the bribe-taker and the bribes-giver,  the embezzler of public funds and the corrupter of voters.'' A good  Republican President.   Acumen, not political fealty, must define our civil service.   Mr. Speaker, I have so many groups that have endorsed this bill and  many, many Members that have, as well.

Ms. Cheryl L. Johnson,      Clerk of the House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Ms. Johnson: Below is a list of Members of Congress       who would have cosponsored H.R. 302 had they been able to be       added prior to the House Committee on Oversight and Reform       discharging the bill:        Madeleine Dean (PA)        Brad Sherman (CA)        Rashida Tlaib (MI)        Mike Quigley (IL)        David Trone (MD)        Jamie Raskin (MD)        Henry C. ``Hank'' Johnson, Jr. (GA)        Rick Larsen (WA)        Norma J. Torres (CA)        Paul D. Tonko            Sincerely,      Gerald E. Connolly,        Chairman, Subcommittee on Government Operations, House       Committee on Oversight and Reform.     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record two articles: an  editorial in the Washington Post endorsing this bill and delineating  the issue, and an article in Newsweek doing the same.                 [From the Washington Post, Aug. 29, 2022]   Opinion: Congress Must Prevent Another Trumpian Attempt To Purge the                                 Government                          (By the Editorial Board)         It might sound like an innocuous change to the structure of       the federal workforce: creating a category of employee, known       as ``Schedule F,'' for positions related to ``policy-      determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating.'' Yet, this       change threatens to politicize the underappreciated ranks of       those who keep the country's government running--the nation's       professional civil service.        President Donald Trump created the Schedule F designation       by executive order near the end of his term, just ahead of       the 2020 election. The order would have removed long-held       protections from tens of thousands of career bureaucrats,       making them easier to dismiss. That would give the president       vast powers to reshape the federal government at will--and       could politicize positions long treated as nonpartisan and       merit-based.        The Trump administration attempted unsuccessfully to rush       through the change before the end of its term, and, upon       taking office, President Biden immediately rescinded the       order. But, according to a troubling recent report from       Axios's Jonathan Swan, Mr. Trump and his associates plan to       quickly reinstate Schedule F if he is elected in 2024, using       it to fire career employees and replace them with loyalists.       Other potential GOP presidential hopefuls have also indicated       they would consider targeting the federal workforce.        The federal bureaucracy is a behemoth that includes       approximately 2 million employees in myriad roles, working to       keep the government operating. In 2020, the Trump       administration justified its Schedule F executive order by       suggesting that it would make it easier for supervisors to       remove poor performers. No doubt there are ways to reform       evaluation and dismissal processes so they are more nimble       and responsive.        But much of our government's expertise rests with civil       servants. A system that sees more people enter and leave       federal agencies with the political churn would be less       knowledgeable and efficient. It would also eliminate one of       the major appeals of federal jobs: the understanding that       there will be some measure of stability even when there are       changes in administrations. If potential employees feel like       they could be fired with little cause or recourse, fewer       capable people will seek out these positions. That would only       harm the wide range of government services on which Americans       rely.        Democrats have introduced legislation that would forestall       such a possibility. The Preventing a Patronage System Act,       sponsored by Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.), would block       positions from being classified outside the existing system       unless Congress consents to it. Mr. Connolly subsequently       sponsored this as an amendment to the National Defense       Authorization Act, and it passed the House last month. Six       Democratic senators, led by Sen. Tim Kaine (Va.), have       introduced companion legislation that would do the same       thing. These measures would uphold protections for federal       workers and reduce opportunities for patronage-based hiring       in the future.        Populist politicians point to the ``deep state'' as the       root of America's ills. In fact, what they cast as a threat--      a professional, merit-based, experienced civil service--is       one of the country's greatest assets.  [[Page H7851]]                                          ____                     [From Newsweek, Sept. 13, 2022]    House Bill Would Block Trump Plan To Make It Easier to Fire Federal                                  Workers                           (By Alex J. Rouhandeh)         The House will vote on a measure this week that would       ensure the job security of thousands of federal employees who       previously faced uncertainty around their employment security       following an executive order issued by former President       Donald Trump.        Trump issued an order in October 2020, the month before the       presidential election, which established a new employment       category for federal workers called ``Schedule F.'' Under       this category, individuals working in jobs tied to ``policy-      determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating'' would lose       protections, including due process rights, which prevent them       from being easily fired when a new administration takes       office.        That order effectively eliminated civil service employment       protection for federal employees that had been in place for       more than 135 years.        While President Joe Biden revoked the order not long after       entering the White House, there is no law in place preventing       a future president from executing such an order again.        And Trump has made it clear that if he is reelected in       2024, he plans to do just that.        During a March rally, Trump told supporters that if he were       again to serve as president he would introduce ``reforms       making every executive branch employee fireable,''       subsequently justifying this action by saying, ``the deep       state must and will be brought to heel.''        ``(This would) allow a Trump to put political people in       those jobs,'' Democratic Congressman Gerry Connolly of       Virginia, who has introduced a bill to prevent this executive       order from being reintroduced, told Newsweek.        Axios' Jonathan Swan reported in July that if Trump were to       retake office, he plans to reintroduce the effort, putting an       estimated 50,000 jobs at risk.        Connolly explained the effect on decision-making in the       federal government that Schedule F would have.        ``All of a sudden now, because the people making decisions       are avowedly political, owing their allegiance not to the       Constitution but to the president who appointed them, and       they serve at his pleasure or her pleasure.'' he said. ``They       can also now look at everything through a partisan political       lens, and that can affect services provided by the federal       government.''        Connolly represents Virginia's 11th Congressional District,       an area near the Washington metro area, which houses a large       number of federal employees. He said he interacts with these       people regularly, and sees them largely as civil servants       rather than members of a ``deep state'' that must be       dismantled.        ``This right-wing mythology that they've created that       there's this deep state that is attempting to thwart the       political will of our elected political leadership is       completely false--there is zero evidence of that,'' Connolly       said. ``It's all a myth created in order to expand their       partisan political power over the civil service.''        Under the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, i       became unlawful to fire or demote employees for political       reasons, ushering in today's standard, in which positions in       the federal government are awarded based on merit rather than       their political affiliation. Today, the National Archives       writes that the act ``applies to most of the 2.9 million''       federal jobs.        Connelly's proposed Preventing a Patronage System Act,       which he first introduced in January of 2021, would prevent a       president from placing employees under a new schedule without       the approval of Congress.        In addition to Connolly, the bill has 16 co-sponsors. Three       are Republicans, including Representative Brian Fitzpatrick       of Pennsylvania, who served as Connelly's original partner on       the effort.        The passage of this bill could represent a significant       victory for Connolly, as he looks to make a case for why he       should fill the Democratic party's top spot on the Oversight       and Reform Committee once current chair Carolyn Maloney       leaves Congress at the end of this year.        If Republicans take control of the House, the Oversight       Committee could become an avenue through which the party       launches investigations into President Biden and his       administration's top officials, as Minority Leader Kevin       McCarthy has expressed interest in doing. Connolly would       stand at the frontlines in opposing this agenda.        The Virginia Democrat has been a staunch critic of the       Trump agenda and the former president's role in altering the       functioning of federal institutions. Connolly served as a       prominent voice during the 2020 election when Democrats       raised concerns regarding Trump's choice for Postmaster       General Louis Dejoy's running of the United States Postal       Service.        In wake of a federal judge calling DeJoy's actions a       potential ``politically motivated attack on the efficiency of       the Postal Service,'' Connolly worked as an original       cosponsor to help pass the bipartisan Postal Service Reform       Act of 2022. In the time since, Connolly has continued to go       after DeJoy, introducing legislation to stop him from       replacing the postal fleet with gas-powered trucks instead of       electric ones.        He likens his work on the DeJoy appointment to his current       work on Schedule F. He said both were issues that had not       drawn public attention. And, as with Schedule F, the DeJoy       appointment sparked questions regarding the politicization of       federal government positions long viewed as apolitical.        ``A career civil servant, (former Postmaster General)       Meghan Brennan retires, and she is replaced by a Republican       political donor.'' Connolly said.        ``What we learned during the Trump years was that so much       of our democracy is based on respecting the norms and       precedent,'' Connolly added. ``When you get an individual       like Trump, who couldn't care less about any of that and is       not going to respect it, you now have to look at codifying       into law behavior that previously was assumed, and Schedule       F, this patronage bill, is a good example of that.''     Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the chairwoman of the  committee, for yielding.   I must say, the innuendos, the negative characterization, the smears,  if not slanders, launched against Federal employees in general on the  floor today would come as news, unwelcome news, to the almost quarter  of a million Federal employees in Kentucky, Georgia, and Texas. Almost  10 percent of the entire Federal workforce live in those three States.   The amendment just offered is a direct assault on our Federal  workforce and would completely gut the bill in front of us. It grew  from the Trump administration's efforts to turn our expert civil  service into a collection of cronies. This amendment invites the crony  clown car into the Federal Government.   My concern is not hypothetical. In September of 2019, then-President  Trump circled areas of Alabama with a Sharpie that he claimed were  dangerously in the path of a hurricane, Hurricane Dorian. That  prognostication was contrary to what expert civil servants, not swamp  creatures, at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  found. Luckily, the civil servants in NOAA's Birmingham, Alabama,  office tweeted out Mr. Trump's error.    While ``#Sharpiegate'' made a funny hashtag on Twitter, the aftermath  could have been catastrophic and cost lives.   What if FEMA deployed in the wrong region? What if millions of  taxpayer dollars had been wasted, sending Federal help where it was not  needed? What if families in the storm's path were left stranded because  our Federal workforce kowtowed to the permanent marker whims of the  then-President.   I am not the only one sounding this alarm. Thirty-four professional  associations, good government organizations, think tanks, and  nonprofits, have endorsed this bill.   From the International Federation of Professional and Technical  Engineers, hardly a politicized group:         The impact of schedule F and any similar effort to inject       political patronage, cronyism, and corruption into the       Federal Government would not only be felt by Federal       employees; it would harm working people, our economy, the       public interest, and the legitimacy of our democracy.    From the National Association of United States Attorneys:         If a President can unilaterally reclassify employees and       strip them of their protections, there is no longer a       safeguard against political interference. This is not the       system of justice our Nation should support.    From the National Federation of Federal Employees:         Political operatives or ordinary criminals will be able to       threaten the careers of Federal workers with impunity,       jeopardizing the collective mission of the United States.       This includes employees in Federal law enforcement, national       security, and national defense, among others.    Hardly swamp creatures.   From the Nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service:         Endangering the skilled employees at the core of our       government would not only further erode the critically low       levels of trust  [[Page H7856]]       in government but would harm the delivery of crucial services       to the American people, especially in a pandemic.
