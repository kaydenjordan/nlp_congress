 Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to stand with my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle, as well as those on our  side, in recognition of a life well done; that is, the passing of our  colleague Louise Slaughter. To me, tonight, it is something we should  take a moment to reflect upon and recognize: her life, her commitment  to this body.   Having served with her on the Rules Committee, I can personally  attest, being a fellow New Yorker, that we shared a commitment to our  home areas; that we always brought the passion of our beliefs, both on  the left and the right, into the room; but at the end of the day,  Louise Slaughter represented us well, in the sense of how she  represented and carried herself in this Chamber as she represented her  people, her folks back home in Rochester, New York.   And I am proud to call her and remember her this evening as a Member  of this body and her service to all of us. She was a Southern lady at  heart, had a good wit, and she will be missed by many Members, if not  all Members, on both sides of the aisle.                            ____________________
