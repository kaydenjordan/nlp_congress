 Mr. President, this week marks the 250th anniversary  of the first blow struck in the American Colonies' struggle for  independence from the British Crown. I come to the Senate floor every  year to commemorate this moment because it took place in Rhode Island  at the hands of some brave and bold Rhode Islanders.   Before recounting the tale of those bold Rhode Islanders, I would  like to acknowledge a special guest with us in the Gallery today:  Michael Tatham, Deputy Head of Mission for the British Embassy here in  Washington. A lot has happened over the last 250 years, and Great  Britain is now America's closest ally and great, great friend. It is an  honor to have the Deputy Ambassador here today.   So it was 1772, and the Royal Navy's revenue cutter, the HMS Gaspee,  patrolled Narragansett Bay in the wake of the Seven Years War, where  Great Britain had emerged the victor. The Crown owed, by some  estimates, between 74 and 133 million pounds. That was a colossal  burden on the empire's finances. The Gaspee's mission was to collect  taxes from the Colonies to help repay British debt.   I will concede that part of the Gaspee's mission was righteous. Rhode  Island's rum distilleries formed a corner of the so-called triangle  trade, with enslaved people from Africa and sugar from the Caribbean  forming the other legs of this foul business. Rum-running to support  the slave trade was repugnant and a worthy target of British  authorities.   But Britain's heavy hand reached far beyond that. British customs  agents seized Colonial vessels and cargo at whim, leaving rightful  owners with no recourse to reclaim their property. One such owner was  John Hancock, whose signature would soon become famous. Authorities  even pressed Colonial sailors into service on His Majesty's vessels  against their will.   The Gaspee and her captain, Lieutenant William Dudingston, drew  particular ire. One of Dudingston's first acts was to stop the merchant  ship Fortune. Dudingston and his crew roughed up the Fortune's  commander, Rufus Greene, condemned the ship and her cargo, and sent the  Fortune to Boston for the admiralty to sell.   This did not please the Fortune's owner, Rhode Island's Nathanael  Greene, who would go on to become General Washington's aide-de-camp and  wartime administrator and then command the southern campaign of the  Revolutionary War, which he did so effectively that British General  Cornwallis would write:         That damned Greene is more dangerous than Washington.    Dudingston's reputation only worsened from there. British law awarded  revenue cutter commanders a share of the cargo they seized. Dudingston  seized so much cargo that he was able to nearly double his salary, and  he earned, along with that bounty, a well-deserved reputation for  arrogance. Soon Rhode Islanders were protesting his conduct formally,  but those protests yielded no accommodation.   On June 9, 1772, simmering anger at Dudingston and the Gaspee boiled  over. Dudingston spotted a small trading ship, the Hannah, bound for  Providence. The Gaspee gave chase, and Dudingston hailed the Hannah's  captain, Benjamin Lindsey, and ordered the Hannah to submit to a  search. Captain Lindsey declined that invitation and ignored the  Gaspee's warning shots and sailed on toward Providence.   Now, the Hannah was smaller and lighter than the Gaspee, and Captain  Lindsey was more familiar than Dudingston with the waters between  Newport and Providence. Lindsey steered his Hannah across the shallow  waters outside Namquid Point. The Hannah could sail over the shallows,  but the heavier Gaspee could not. Dudingston and his crew ran aground  on a sandbar off Pawtuxet Cove, stranded, as the Sun was setting in a  falling tide. The Gaspee would need to wait for the next day's high  tides to lift it free.   When the Hannah arrived in Providence, Captain Lindsey summoned local  patriots to Sabin's Tavern for refreshments and for planning. The  result of the plan was that under the leadership of John Brown, later  to be famous for Brown University, and Abraham Whipple, a group of men  boarded a half dozen longboats to row from Providence down to Pawtuxet.  Through the dark night, with oars muffled, the Rhode Islanders  descended on the Gaspee. Whipple reputedly called out to Dudingston-- and I hope the young pages will forgive my language, but this is  apparently the language used in that moment:         I am the sheriff of the county of Kent, God damn you. I       have got a warrant to apprehend you, God damn you; so       surrender, God damn you.    I believe I mentioned that the Rhode Islanders had fortified  themselves at Sabin's Tavern, which might explain some of the language.  In any event, Lieutenant Dudingston refused that invitation so a brief,  sharp battle ensued.   At this moment those 250 years ago, Rhode Islanders drew the first  blood of what would become our revolutionary struggle when a musket  ball struck Lieutenant Dudingston. The Rhode Island patriots boarded  the Gaspee. In the melee, Dudingston cried out:         Lord, have mercy upon me--I am done for.    But he was not. The British sailors soon gave up the fight. The Rhode  Islanders took the crew prisoner and ferried the captives to shore. A  marker still stands at the place where the captive crew was brought  ashore. And there, Dudingston received the care of a doctor and,  ultimately, recovered from his wounds. Indeed, Dudingston would not  only heal, but go on to live a long life. He commanded other vessels.  He moved back to his native Scotland and married and raised four  children in a coastal town called Elie overlooking the Firth of Fife  and the North Sea, but he never patrolled Narragansett Bay again.   A quick side story. A few years ago, a couple from Scotland, Angela  and Roddy Innes, visited Pawtuxet during Gaspee Days, our annual  celebration of the Gaspee raid, coming up this weekend. The Inneses are  connected through  [[Page S2811]]  marriage to the Dudingstons, and Angela wanted to see what the  Dudingston-Gaspee was all about.   In Pawtuxet, Rhode Islanders welcomed Angela and Roddy with open  arms. Local historian Dr. John Concannon invited them to stay. ``It was  an amazing experience,'' Angela said. ``The people there are incredibly  friendly.'' The trip also helped them grasp the significance of the  Gaspee raid on America's road to revolution. And this year, Angela  Innes will mark the 250th Gaspee anniversary with a Gaspee Day party of  her own in Scotland.   Well, that left the dreaded Gaspee. With the prisoners ashore, the  Gaspee raiders returned to the stranded ship and set her afire. When  the fire reached her powder magazine, she blew apart, and her remains  were lost to time and tides. Rhode Island was rid of the dreaded  Gaspee.   New efforts are underway now to find the charred remains of the  Gaspee using advanced sonar technology. Dr. Kathy Abbass of the Rhode  Island Marine Archaeology Project is on the case. Dr. Abbass is  accomplished in her field. Indeed, she may have located Captain Cook's  ship, the Endeavor, sunk in Newport Harbor. If anyone can find the  Gaspee or what is left of her, it is Dr. Abbass.   I should offer special thanks to Peter Abbott, the British Consul  General in Boston who, along with representatives of the Royal Navy,  came to Rhode Island last month for the announcement that funds had  been raised to find the Gaspee. Abbott said:         Being a British consul in New England means you must have       broad shoulders. I get invited to events that celebrate the       Boston Massacre and Evacuation Day. But what takes the       biscuit is commemorating the burning of a British ship!    The Deputy Ambassador should know that if, in fact, we do find the  Gaspee, Rhode Island, a colony no more, intends to courteously seize  the vessel for further research.   The Gaspee raid represents Rhode Island's spirit of independence,  which has lived in us since Rhode Island's founding as a refuge of  religious tolerance from the Massachusetts Colony's harsh theocracy.  Our celebration of the Gaspee Affair represents Rhode Islanders' pride  in that spirit, which we share willingly, even with a Dudingston  descendant.   Oh, and by the way, this episode where Rhode Islanders rode down  through the night to a British ship that had been stranded by Rhode  Island wilds and sacked her and took her crew and set her afire and  blew her up, that all took place more than a year before Massachusetts  colonists boarded a British ship to push tea bales into Boston Harbor.  They pushed tea bales off the ship; more than a year earlier, Rhode  Islanders blew the ship up. I am just saying, Mr. President.   So here is to another 250 years of celebrating the Gaspee raiders and  to more people learning about Rhode Island's role as a spark of  revolution.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
