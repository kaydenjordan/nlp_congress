 Mr. Speaker, I have a parliamentary inquiry.    Mr. Speaker, it is my understanding that the Rules Committee  has posted a Rules Committee print of the Defense appropriations bill  and that this committee version does not include the language added  during the Defense appropriations markup on a bipartisan basis in  committee that would repeal the 2001 authorization to use force and  give 8 months for Congress to do what our Constitution requires, and  that is to debate and to come up with a new vote and to decide what we  are going to do on behalf of our country.   Further inquiry. Members don't really quite understand this. I can't  explain to Members how in the heck this body can prevent this amendment  from being undemocratically stripped from this bill.   Can the Chair explain that, please.
