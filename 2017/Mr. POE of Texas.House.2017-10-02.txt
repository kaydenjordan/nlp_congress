 Mr. Speaker, as the band played the latest country  western song, gunfire erupted from the 32nd floor window across the  street.   Twenty minutes later, when the shots stopped and the smoke cleared,  59 people were murdered and over 520 were wounded.   The SWAT team quickly found the hiding place of the evil villain, and  as they approached, the outlaw shot himself. Thus, he avoided a date  with the hangman. Justice occurred.   The casualties would have been much worse but for quick action by  members of the crowd. People, including former military and off-duty  police officers, helped hide and cover others while endangering their  own lives.   The first responders, police, doctors, emergency medical technicians  quickly tended to the wounded. These unnamed quick responders, both  civilian and law enforcement, and medical, without regard to their own  life, saved others.   The band had stopped playing music, but the cries of the wounded and  the tears of the mourning continue, Mr. Speaker. We must have prayers  for Las Vegas, and God bless them one and all.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
