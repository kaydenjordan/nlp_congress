 Mr. Speaker, I consider it one of the great honors in  Congress to serve on the Defense Appropriations Committee with some  real champions for national security: guys like Rodney Frelinghuysen,  the overall chairman; Chairwoman Kay Granger from the Defense  Subcommittee; my friend Pete Visclosky, the ranking member. These are  all people that have a heart and a soul for what we are trying to do  here today, and that is to provide for the common defense. It is our  constitutional duty. And guys like Mac Thornberry, the chairman of the  House Armed Services Committee. A lot of champions here that believe in  a strong national defense.   Mr. Speaker, not only does this bill rebuild readiness by giving our  troops the equipment they need, but it also reverses Obama-era cuts to  the developing defense platforms, stops troop drawdowns, and perhaps  most importantly, gives our warfighters a much-deserved pay raise.   As a 30-year veteran of the Arkansas Army National Guard, I am  particularly pleased that this bill provides the funding necessary to  ensure the National Guard remains a fully operational force.   It is a good bill, Mr. Speaker, and with a willing partner in the  White House and a pledge to rebuild our military, it marks the first  step, an important first step our Congress has to take to complete our  business from last year; and it gives our defenders what they need and  deserve, and that is certainty.   Threats are growing. America must project strength. That starts with  creating a military so strong that we never send our men and women  downrange in a fair fight.   I call on my colleagues to stand strong against our enemies. Take  this first step today in projecting power with our financial  commitment.   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the bill.
