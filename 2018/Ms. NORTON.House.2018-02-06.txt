 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank both sides for the  bipartisan way in which this bill has proceeded.   Today, the House is doing no more than bringing itself in line with  what we have long required of the public sector and Federal agencies.   When I became chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in  the late 1970s, sexual harassment was not even recognized as a form of  employment discrimination.   We remedied that with sexual harassment guidelines, later ratified by  the Supreme Court. In drawing the sexual harassment guidelines, it  never occurred to us that Congress would adopt special procedures for  themselves, preferential to Members and prejudicial to employees.   The antidiscrimination statutes typically require some kind of  conciliation before moving forward to avoid excessive litigation, but  the current process creates multiple steps and time frames that exhaust  complainants and deter resolution.  [[Page H808]]    It takes courage to file a sexual harassment complaint because most  are unwitnessed and they are difficult to corroborate.   The most important provisions of this bill, I believe, are the  provisions for legal assistance to complainants, which Members have  long had, and personal liability for sexual harassment lying with the  Member, not the taxpayers.   This bill marks the Congress holding itself accountable to the  public. However, it is another focus on high-profile workplaces.   I ask the House to move next to the workplaces of America where the  average woman and man works--hospitality, factories, offices, retail,  and the like. Increasingly, we find sexual harassment is still  widespread.   Therefore, I hope the House will pass my bill to create a national  commission to hear from ordinary workers so that the average worker  gets our equal attention and equal time.   Mr. Speaker, again, I thank the sponsors of this bill and for this  bipartisan effort.
