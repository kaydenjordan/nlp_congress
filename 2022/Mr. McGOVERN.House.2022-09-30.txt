 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules,  I call up House Resolution 1404 and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 1404         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to take from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R.       6833) to amend title XXVII of the Public Health Service Act,       the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and the Employee       Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to establish       requirements with respect to cost-sharing for certain insulin       products, and for other purposes, with the Senate amendment       thereto, and to consider in the House, without intervention       of any point of order, a motion offered by the chair of the       Committee on Appropriations or her designee that the House       concur in the Senate amendment. The Senate amendment and the       motion shall be considered as read. The motion shall be       debatable for one hour equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Appropriations or their respective designees. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the motion to its       adoption without intervening motion.        Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 8987) to amend       the Justice for United States Victims of State Sponsored       Terrorism Act to authorize appropriations for catch-up       payments from the United States Victims of State Sponsored       Terrorism Fund. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived. An amendment in the nature of a       substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print       117-68 shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as amended,       shall be considered as read. All points of order against       provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill, as       amended, and on any further amendment thereto, to final       passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of       debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary or       their respective designees; and (2) one motion to recommit.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                general leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, yesterday the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 1404, making in order a motion  offered by the chair of the Committee on Appropriations, or her  designee, to concur in the Senate amendment to H.R. 6833. The rule  provides 1 hour of debate on the motion equally divided and controlled  by the chair and ranking member of the Committee on Appropriations.   The rule further provides for consideration of H.R. 8987, the  Fairness for 9/11 Families Act, under a closed rule. The rule provides  1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and  ranking member of the Committee on the Judiciary, and provides one  motion to recommit.   Madam Speaker, I am sure we will have a spirited debate on this rule,  but before we do, I want to begin by expressing my heartfelt sympathy  for the people of Florida. The catastrophic devastation left behind by  Hurricane Ian is unlike anything we have seen in quite some time.   Our hearts are with those whose lives have been lost and their loved  ones, and we pray for those who are missing that they will be located  safely and soon. If there is one thing we know, it is that the people  of Florida are strong. This is not their first hurricane. They will  recover and they will come back stronger than ever.   I want to thank all of the first responders who have sprung into  action to save lives: from local police, fire, and EMS, all the way up  to our Federal response at FEMA. The people of Florida ought to know  that America stands with them. Part of standing with the people of  Florida is passing this important legislation to keep the government  open during this critical moment.   Madam Speaker, with less than 24 hours until the end of the fiscal  year, today we are here to do our job. We, in Congress, have a  responsibility to the American people to keep the lights on. In  addition to preventing the furlough of thousands of Federal employees,  averting a shutdown will also ensure that our constituents can continue  to receive the vital government services that they need.   The last shutdown, when the Republicans were in charge of the House  and the Senate and the White House, was the longest shutdown in our  history. It cost our economy an astounding $11 billion.   In contrast, Democrats are doing our job. We are keeping the  government open as we finish up bipartisan, bicameral negotiations on a  longer-term fiscal year 2023 appropriations package.   This CR also provides Ukraine with the security, economic, and  humanitarian assistance that they need to fight back against Russia's  brutal invasion. With Russia holding fake elections to annex parts of  Ukraine, the Ukrainian people urgently need our support to protect  their families and defend global democracy.   Finally, Madam Speaker, I mentioned earlier the devastating hurricane  in Florida. We also just had an awful hurricane in Puerto Rico. The  people of Puerto Rico are still reeling from the damage of Hurricane  Fiona. Also, the people of Alaska are recovering from a terrible  typhoon.   This bill contains money to support communities across the United  States as they recover from natural disasters.   Madam Speaker, we are talking about hurricane relief for God's sake.  I am begging my Republican friends, can we please at least come  together on providing relief to communities devastated by hurricanes?   Can we all agree that we ought not shut the government down in the  middle of a major natural disaster response?   The funding in this bill will help families and small businesses get  back on their feet and rebuilt from extreme weather events while  repairing damage to critical infrastructure.   This is a bipartisan bill, Madam Speaker. It earned 72 votes in the  Senate. I don't think you can get 72 votes in the Senate on what to  have for lunch, let alone on government funding legislation.   Madam Speaker, I am going to again plead with my colleagues, do not  vote against additional funding to help people recover from hurricane  damage, please, especially my Republican friends from Florida. A vote  against this CR is a vote against funding for help with hurricane  recovery in your own State.   I just hope that we are not at the point where we have become so  partisan and so polarized that we can't even agree on this.   Madam Speaker, this rule also includes H.R. 8987, the Fairness for 9/ 11 Families Act. This bill will ensure thousands of 9/11 families and  victims who received some but not all of the compensation that they  deserve are made whole.   Both of these measures deserve broad support today. Americans are  depending on us to get this done.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I appreciate my friend from Pennsylvania reciting the Republican  Congressional Campaign Committee's greatest hits, but let me remind  people who are watching why we are here today.   We are here today to move two important pieces of legislation  forward; one that would help 9/11 families, which I hope we all can  agree is worth supporting; and the second is to make sure that the  government doesn't shut down; that we continue to provide funding that  will help aid some of the natural disasters that we are seeing happen  all over this country.   While it is too early to have a damage assessment from Hurricane Ian  and actually know what the true cost of all this is going to be, make  no mistake, this CR will help. There is money for 2022 disasters and  community development block grants for disaster recovery above the OMB  request.   More importantly, we included language to give FEMA a full year's  worth of funding up front, not just for the 2\1/2\-month CR period; and  more help will come for Florida, as we find out what is needed.   Communities across America are currently dealing with record-breaking  numbers of storms. According to The Washington Post this morning,  ``Since 2017, an unprecedented number of storms rated Category 4  or stronger have lashed the U.S. shoreline: Harvey, Irma, Maria,  Michael, Laura, Ida, and now Ian. They all qualify as `rapid  intensification events,' when a storm's wind speeds increase by at  least 35 miles within 24 hours.''    People should read The Washington Post about what is happening as a  result of these storms.   We have an obligation to help all of these communities. But you know  what won't help? A government shutdown in the midst of a natural  disaster of this magnitude.   Again, I would point out to my colleagues here, we think it is  unacceptable to ever shut down the Federal Government. My Republican  friends obviously have a different point of view because when they were  in charge, when they controlled the House, the Senate, and the White  House, they shut the government down, the longest government shutdown  in our history, and it was costly. To even contemplate doing that in  the face of these natural disasters is unbelievable.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I appreciate the gentlewoman's comments, and I hope that she will  vote for the rule because if the rule doesn't pass, we can't bring this  bill up for a vote. I agree with her; this is incredibly important. So  I hope all my colleagues will vote for the rule, not just to help 9/11  families, but also to keep the government open during this really  critical time.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I am embarrassed for my friends on the other side of the aisle. I  just saw the bill. I am looking at the bill, and all it does is ask for  more reports, more paperwork. I don't know. I kind of think it is silly  that that is going to fight crime, asking for more reports and more  paperwork. Give me a break.   We are here today, Madam Speaker, to try to bring two important bills  to the floor, one to help 9/11 families and the other, Madam Speaker,  to keep the government open because if it shuts down amidst all of  these natural disasters, things are going to be incredibly worse for  everybody who right now is suffering. And this is what they come to the  floor with? This is what they want to talk about?   If you want to talk about what they are about, let's look at their  poorly named ``Commitment to America,'' which I guess is a rip-off on  Contract with America, which basically would gut Social Security and  Medicare. They want to ban abortion nationwide, and they want to make  it easier for people to overturn the will of the American people in  elections.   I mean, that is the radical agenda they are all pushing here.   Here we are, at this moment, trying to make sure that essential  funding is there to help deal with these natural disasters, and this is  what we get? This is like we hear the greatest hits from the National  Republican Congressional Campaign Committee. They use Russian B-roll in  their rollout of their Commitment to America. Come on.   At this moment, right now, we have two bills that, quite frankly,  should enjoy huge bipartisan support. We ought to move forward to help  the 9/11 families, and at the same time, we ought to keep this  government open. Then, that gives us time to work out a longer term  bill, which we can vote on after the election.   But turn on the news. Look at what is happening in Florida right now.  Look at what happened in Puerto Rico. Look at what is happening in  Alaska. People need help. We have a responsibility.   Look at what is happening in Ukraine. Do we support helping preserve  democracy in Ukraine or not? That is what is at stake here.   So, we can try to cut a political ad on the House floor here. Fine.  But let's not kind of make-believe that what my friends are trying to  do is somehow real or will make any kind of a difference. It is a sound  bite, plain and simple.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   My friend can yell all that she wants, but what I took exception to  is the fact that a proposal that essentially does nothing more than  call for more reports to be sent to the Committee on the Judiciary is  somehow fighting crime.   I would also tell my friends, let's not talk about defunding the  police when my friends on the other side of the aisle have Members that  are now selling T-shirts to defund the FBI and law enforcement or the  fact that many of them voted against bills last week that actually  provided more funding to the police.   Come on. Reports somehow are going to fight crime? I mean, if that is  your crime-fighting solution, well, America is in trouble.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Let me say this again: a reporting requirement. I mean, all of us are  against violent crime, and we are against all the things that the  gentleman listed. That is why we brought a group of bills to the floor  last week to try to deal with some of these challenges. Again, many of  my Republican colleagues voted against it.   I am not questioning why my friends bring these items to the floor. I  know why they do it. It is politics 101. But I do have to say that I do  have a problem when they come to the floor and say that they are making  a proposal that will somehow do something. A reporting requirement,  more paperwork to the Committee on the Judiciary, oh, boy, that is  really going to stop carjackings, that is going to stop murder. Give me  a break.   If you want to come up with something that actually does something,  we are all willing to work with you. But to come to the floor to say,  oh, a reporting requirement, more paperwork going to the Committee on  the Judiciary is somehow going to do something to prevent crime, I  mean, I don't know anybody who believes that.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I have great respect for the gentleman  from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), but I will take exception with his  characterization of us passing messaging bills.   Let me just go through a few items here that we did pass and that  have been signed into law:   The Honoring our PACT Act for our veterans.   The Inflation Reduction Act.   The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act.   The Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment  Act.   The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the biggest investment in  infrastructure ever in this country. A bill, by the way, that some of  my colleagues on the other side of the aisle voted against, but they  were at the announcement of moneys to rebuild bridges and roads in  their district even though they voted against it.   The Postal Service Reform Act.   Protecting Medicare and American Farmers from Sequester Cuts Act.   The American Rescue Plan Act.   I could go on and on and on. These aren't messaging bills. These are  major investments in our country that will have an impact for  generations, that will help our children, that will help our senior  citizens, that will help our veterans.    This is what we are supposed to be doing, helping uplift the American  people, investing in our country. So that is not messaging. That is  real work.   Today's bills aren't messaging bills, either. I mean, helping 9/11  families. That is not a messaging bill. That is real. It is something  we should do. We ought to be together on that.   This continuing resolution, this is important, especially in light of  all the natural disasters that are happening in this country right now.   Madam Speaker, this should be simple. We have an obligation to fund  the government. We have a bipartisan bill, again, that had 72 votes in  the Senate. We have a bipartisan bill that not only will keep the  lights on but will provide critical funding to help communities  devastated by recent natural disasters.   Now, House Republicans have made it clear that they would rather brag  about their dangerous, extreme, unpopular agenda than do real work. All  I can say to that is that Democrats are committed to putting people  over politics.   The Republicans' radical agenda bans abortion, and we want to protect  Americans' right to affordable, accessible healthcare and safeguard  America's right to reproductive care.   We are here to defend Americans' right to vote. They want to make it  easier to overturn elections.   We want to protect Social Security. You saw the agenda that the  Republican leaders in the Senate unveiled. They gut Social Security.   There is a contrast here. But today, we are here to advance relief  for communities hit by natural disasters, pass overdue benefits for 9/ 11 families, and keep the government running.   What does putting people over politics mean?   It means that we come together to make sure that the people of  Florida have what they need to get through this terrible disaster.   It means that we are there for the people of Puerto Rico and that we  are there for the people of Alaska, that we are there for people  anywhere in this country, whether it is a red State or blue State, who  are dealing with these natural catastrophes.   That is what this is about. If this went down and we shut the  government down, the pain that people are already dealing with would  only increase. Shame on us for doing that.   Now, I get it, Madam Speaker. There are some people here who don't  really care about whether the government stays open or shuts down.  [[Page H8329]]    I remind you again, when my friends were in charge, when the  Republicans controlled the House, when they controlled the Senate, when  they controlled the White House, they shut the government down. They  walked away. The longest shutdown in history. Billions and billions and  billions of dollars it cost our economy.   We had to clean up their mess when we took over. Today, we are doing  what is right for the American people, for all people. This is not  about politics. This is about putting people over politics. I urge a  ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous question.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Cole is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 1404         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 7967) to amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe       Streets Act to direct district attorney and prosecutors       offices to report to the Attorney General, and for other       purposes. All points of order against consideration of the       bill are waived. The bill shall be considered as read. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       bill and on any amendment thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary; and (2) one motion       to recommit.        Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 7967.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.
