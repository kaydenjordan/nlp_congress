 Madam President, I rise today to celebrate and  recognize the Hulman-George family for their accomplishments and  success in business and their stewardship of the Indianapolis Motor  Speedway for the last 75 years.   On November 4, 2019, principals of Hulman & Company announced the  sale of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, among other assets of the  [[Page S6666]]  Hulman-George family, to a newly formed entity to be led by industry  legend Roger Penske. This announcement marks the end of one glorious  era, and the start of another for so many Hoosiers and racing fans  around the world who recognize Indianapolis Motor Speedway as the  racing capital of the world. Beloved as the famous track at 16th and  Georgetown in Indianapolis is today, it is nearly impossible to imagine  our capital city without it, which was nearly the case.   Shortly after World War II, an era in which the track sat dormant  from 1941 through 1945 and fell almost into complete disrepair, a  businessman from Terre Haute stepped up to purchase the facility with  the goal of continuing and building upon the legacy of the already  famous Indianapolis 500. That businessman, Anton ``Tony'' Hulman, Jr.,  saved the speedway from either becoming a housing development or a  private automobile testing facility.   For the last 75 years, Indianapolis Motor Speedway has been  controlled by Hulman & Company, an entity with a deep portfolio but  nothing as visible and recognizable worldwide as the famed racecourse.  From the initial days of owning the facility and preparing it to run  the 1946 race to the celebration of centennial era and beyond, the  Hulman-George family has been the steadfast caretaker and promoter of  this iconic venue.   The Indianapolis Motor Speedway has served as the front door to  Indianapolis, the State of Indiana, and the entire Midwest for those  across the world who travel each year to personally watch the world's  largest single day sporting event, the Indianapolis 500, which attracts  approximately 350,000 spectators, the NASCAR Brickyard 400, and the  IndyCar Grand Prix of Indianapolis. The Speedway has also recently  hosted the Formula One United States Grand Prix, Red Bull Air Races,  and even a Rolling Stones concert. The economic impact of the  Indianapolis Motor Speedway to central Indiana in the 75 years that the  Hulman-George family has owned the property is incalculable. The  personal impact the speedway has had on tens of thousands of families  who use the facility as an anchor for what becomes weekend-long  reunions is inspiring, as one need not search far on Memorial Day  weekend in May to find a family who has been attending the Indy 500 as  a group for as long as can be remembered.   The facility which started as a testing ground for Indiana's growing  automotive industry in 1909 became a testing ground of speed,  endurance, strength, and the will to win over the last 110 years.  Without the Hulman-George family, that story would have likely ended in  the 1940s.   Madam President, I want to personally thank the Hulman-George family  for their amazing commitment and contributions to the State of Indiana  and the Unites States of America. Both are better because of this  family.                            ____________________
