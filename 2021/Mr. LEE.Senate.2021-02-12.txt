 Mr. President.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.    I send a question to the desk.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah, Mr. Lee, sends a  question on behalf of himself, Senator Hawley, Senator Crapo, Senator  Blackburn, and Senator Portman, and the question is for the counsel for  the former President.   The clerk will read the question.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         Multiple State constitutions enacted prior to 1787--namely,       the constitutions of Delaware, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and       Vermont--specifically provided for the impeachment of a       former officer. Given that the Framers of the U.S.       Constitution would have been aware of these provisions, does       their decision to omit language specifically authorizing the       impeachment of former officials indicate that they did not       intend for our Constitution to allow for the impeachment of       former officials?    Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. Good question, and the answer is yes, of  course they left it out. The Framers were very smart men, and they went  over draft after draft after draft on that document, and they reviewed  all the other drafts of all of the State constitutions, all of them.  They picked and chose what they wanted, and they discarded what they  did not. What they discarded was the option for all of you to impeach a  former elected official.   I hope that is answering your question. Thank you.
