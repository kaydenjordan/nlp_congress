 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come to the floor to call for the  confirmation of a highly qualified nominee to the Department of  Education.   Over the past year and a half, we all know that this pandemic has  made life harder for so many Americans but especially students across  the country, disrupting their classrooms and their learning,  challenging their mental health, and deepening inequities.   And while we have made significant progress, our work to get everyone  through this pandemic is far from over, to say nothing of the  challenges in our education system that predate the pandemic. For  example, rooting out systemic racism at every level, ensuring students  have safe modern schools and infrastructure, addressing the student  debt crisis and high cost of higher education, and ending the epidemic  of campus sexual violence, just to name a few.   In light of all of these challenges, we need a fully staffed  education department to help see our schools through this pandemic and  to help us build back stronger and fairer, which is why I have come to  the floor today to call for the Senate to confirm Lisa Brown, the  nominee to be general counsel for the Department of Education.   I won't recite her significant experience, but suffice it to say she  has great public service credentials in the executive branch of our  government over many years. Lisa Brown proved herself well--I should  say, proved herself well prepared for the work ahead when we had our  Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee hearing with her and  she was passed out of the committee on a bipartisan voice vote. I will  say that again--a bipartisan voice vote.   She is a highly qualified nominee and should not be a controversial  one. Students, parents, and educators deserve to have her confirmed so  she can get to work for our communities. I urge all my colleagues to  join me in supporting her.

Thank you, Mr. President.
