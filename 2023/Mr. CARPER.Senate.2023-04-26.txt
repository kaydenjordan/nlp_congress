 Mr. President, I rise today in strong opposition to S.J.  Res. 11, the Congressional Review Act resolution to disapprove of the  Biden administration's clean air standards for heavy-duty trucks.   If enacted, this resolution would wipe away EPA's most recent final  rule that addresses smog- and soot-forming pollution from our largest  trucks and engines. The resolution could also prevent the Agency from  ever issuing similar standards in the future.   This Congressional Review Act resolution is bad for public health. It  is bad for our economy.   As many of us know, the transportation sector is one of our Nation's  largest sources of nitrogen oxides, also known as NOX  emissions. Heavy-duty vehicles--such as our schoolbuses and long-haul  trucks--make up a third of mobile source NOX emissions.   Nitrogen oxide pollution is one of the main contributors to ozone  pollution, or smog, and also contributes to soot pollution. These  harmful air pollutants are linked to increased risks of asthma attacks,  respiratory disease, and, sadly, in some cases, premature death.   In December 2022, I joined clean air advocates, labor leaders, and  EPA Administrator Regan as he signed the final rule to reduce this  pollution from new heavy-duty vehicles starting with model year 2027.  This was the first time in more than 20 years that EPA had updated the  heavy-duty vehicle NOX requirements. It should not be  confused with EPA's recently proposed greenhouse gas emissions  standards for vehicles.   During the event, Administrator Regan told attendees that this rule  would result in 48 percent reduction in NOX by 2045--48  percent reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions by 2045. These reductions  will improve air quality nationwide, especially in areas overburdened  by air pollution and diesel emissions.   Reducing vehicle pollution nationwide is especially personal for us  in Delaware, where more than 90 percent of our air pollution comes from  outside of our State.   The Heavy-Duty Vehicle NOX Rule is good for our health and  good for our economy. With that, I want to give my colleagues three  reasons why they should vote against Senator Fischer's CRA resolution.   First, the Heavy-Duty NOX Rule enables States to better  meet EPA's health-based ozone air quality standards. Without the rule,  States would have to make costly decisions and find more expensive ways  to further reduce NOX emissions to meet ozone attainment.  That is why many States and local air quality directors, including  those in Arizona, Ohio, and Nevada, petitioned EPA in 2016 to take  action on NOX emissions from heavy-duty vehicles.   In the same vein, I would like to ask unanimous consent to submit for  the Record a letter opposing S.J. Res. 11 from the National Association  of Clean Air Agencies, which is an association that represents the  State's clean air offices.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                             National Association of                                              Clean Air Agencies,                                     Washington, DC, April 25, 2023.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Tom Carper,      Chair, Committee on Environment & Public Works, U.S. Senate,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Senate Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Shelley Moore Capito,      Ranking Member, Committee on Environment & Public Works, U.S.           Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Senators Schumer, McConnell, Carper, and Capito: We       write to you today on behalf of the National Association of       Clean Air Agencies (NACAA) regarding S.J. Res. 11, introduced       in the U.S. Senate on February 9, 2023, under which the U.S.       Congress would disapprove the U.S. Environmental Protection       Agency's (EPA) final rule, ``Control of Air Pollution from       New Motor Vehicles: Heavy-Duty Engine and Vehicle       Standards,'' published in the Federal Register on January 24,       2023 (88 Fed. Reg. 4296). NACAA is the national, nonpartisan,       non-profit association of 157 state and local air pollution       control agencies in 40 states, the District of Columbia and       five territories. The views expressed in these comments do       not represent the positions of every state and local air       pollution control agency in the country.        On May 16, 2022, NACAA submitted written comments to EPA on       the agency's proposed rule to set cleaner standards for       nitrogen oxide (NOX) emissions from heavy-duty (HD) trucks.       These comments emphasize the importance of EPA's final HD       truck NOX rule to state and local efforts across the nation       to protect people's health, achieve and maintain clean air,       and advance environmental justice goals.        Americans in every part of the country urgently need       improvements in NOX emissions from onroad HD vehicles. Among       our comments to EPA, NACAA included specific examples from       state and local air agencies of the array of circumstances       necessitating NOX reductions. Below, we highlight some of the       other key points made in our comments.        During the nearly eight years before EPA promulgated this       final rule NACAA urged the agency on multiple occasions to       set more protective HD truck NOX standards. Prior to the 2023       rule, EPA last set federal HD truck NOX emission standards in       2001. Given the interstate nature of trucking--both cross-      border operations and downwind atmospheric transport--federal       standards are necessary to achieve the broad NOX reductions       needed across the nation. Over the past two decades,       technological advances to reduce HD truck NOX emissions have       grown significantly as has the potential for even further       advances. At the same time, emission limits for most other       major NOX sources, such as power plants, generators, and       industrial facilities, have repeatedly become more       restrictive. Unless EPA took this federal action, HD trucks       were on course to remain one of the largest contributors to       the national mobile source NOX inventory in 2028.        There is a looming crisis facing many state and local clean       air agencies across the nation. Currently, more than one-      third of the U.S. population lives in an area that does not       meet the health- and welfare-based National Ambient Air       Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone, particulate matter (PM)       or both. Many of these areas are over-burdened communities       whose citizens are exposed to a disproportionate share of       harmful environmental conditions. The excessive emissions       from HD trucks are a primary cause, contributing substantial       emissions of NOX--which are linked with a large number of       adverse impacts on the respiratory system. In addition, NOX       is the key pollutant contributing to the formation of ozone       and PM2.5 and exposure to elevated levels of ozone       and PM2.5 are associated with significant       respiratory and cardiovascular impacts, including premature       death.        While state and local air agencies have made great strides       in reducing emissions from stationary sources. However, many       state and local air agencies lack the authority to regulate       mobile sources and never have the authority to regulate       mobile sources upwind of or outside their borders. The       regulation of mobile sources is an authority that lies almost       entirely within the purview of the federal government. While       some states and localities may be able to pursue       ``California'' standards under Clean Air Act sections 209 and       177, most are precluded by state policies or legislation from       adopting standards more stringent than those of the federal       government.        Unfortunately, emission standards for this highway heavy-      duty ``federal source'' did not keep pace with standards for       the light-duty motor vehicle sector or stationary sources,       and fell far short of what is needed to meet clean air,       public health protection and environmental justice goals. As       large swaths of the country slip deeper into nonattainment,       or teeter on the cusp of it, many state and local air       agencies are left with few remaining mechanisms to achieve       the emission reductions the Clean Air Act demands. Areas that       miss their attainment deadlines face the threat of ``bump-      up'' to a more demanding classification of nonattainment--if       they are not already classified as Extreme--and statutorily       required economic sanctions if they fail to meet their       attainment deadlines. On October 7, 2022, EPA bumped up over       25 areas in nonattainment of the 2008 and 2015 ozone NAAQS,       meaning the citizens of these areas continue to suffer the       detrimental impacts of unhealthful air.        Our nation is in need of a strong, sustainable       transportation strategy with top priority placed on new       federal programs to continue to protect people's health and       reduce  [[Page S1364]]       emissions from the mobile source sector. As this strategy is       developed, the need for meaningful reductions in criteria       pollutant emissions, especially NOX and PM, cannot be       overlooked. Regarding attainment and maintenance of the ozone       NAAQS, most areas of the country are ``NOX-limited,'' meaning       that reducing NOX emissions is the key to success. In       addition, research shows that in some areas of the country,       such as much of the East Coast, NOX reductions are now       ``supercharged,'' meaning that a one-pound reduction in NOX       emissions equals more than one pound of ozone reduction.       Failure to adequately address transportation-related NOX       sources will have a direct and consequential impact on state       and local air agencies' abilities to protect the health of       the public they serve and their ability to fulfill their       statutory obligations to attain and maintain federal health-      based air quality standards by mandated deadlines and achieve       their environmental justice goals.        EPA has now taken essential federal action that will result       in significant NOX reductions from HD trucks. Cleaning up       this sector is imperative to putting our nation on a path to       attaining and maintaining the health-based NAAQS and       protecting our nation's most vulnerable communities. Without       this rule, many areas will be forced to adopt severe limits       on stationary sources, for which they have authority to       control, at ever-increasing costs to businesses. Even with       these severe limits, there may not be enough NOX reductions       available to protect people's health and meet federal air       quality standards.        We thank you for considering the information provided in       this letter and NACAA's May 16, 2022, comments to EPA on the       HD truck NOX rule. If you have any questions or would like       further information please do not hesitate to contact us or       Miles Keogh, Executive Director of NACAA.            Sincerely,      Tracy R. Babbidge,        Connecticut, State Co-Chair, NACAA Mobile Sources and Fuels       Committee.      Erik C. White,        Placer County, California, Local Co-Chair, NACAA Mobile       Sources and Fuels Committee.     Second, these standards are achievable, and they provide  predictability for industry, which the blunt tool of the CRA would  undercut.   Companies such as Cummins and others in the heavy-duty vehicle  industry support the Heavy-Duty NOX Rule. The CRA would  reinstate a decades-old standard based on outdated air pollution  control technology, while potentially blocking EPA from ever--from  ever--adopting stronger standards.   Finally, if enacted, this CRA would negate the cumulative $200  billion in net benefits that the rule would generate between 2027 and  2045. These are the annual health and economic benefits that, by 2045,  include: up to--listen to this--up to 2,900 fewer premature deaths--in  1 year--in 1 year; also, in 1 year, 6,700 fewer hospital admissions and  emergency room visits; also, in 1 year, 18,000 fewer cases of childhood  asthma; and, finally, in 1 year, 3.1 million fewer cases of asthma.   These improvements will be especially beneficial for the 72 million  people living near truck freight routes, where many historically  disadvantaged and underserved communities are disproportionately  exposed to harmful ozone pollution.   Let me conclude by saying that the Heavy-Duty NOX Vehicle  Rule protects public health and benefits our economy. That is a good  combination. These protective and achievable Clean Air Act standards  reduce dangerous smog and soot pollution and provides certainty for our  Nation's heavy-duty vehicle manufacturers and for our State.   Walking away from all the benefits generated by this rule doesn't  make sense. That is why I call on my colleagues to join me in opposing  S.J. Res. 11.   With that, I yield the floor.
