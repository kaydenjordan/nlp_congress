 Mr. President, I certainly appreciate the kind comments  from my friend and fellow Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Manchin, who  has been a champion of this issue. It has been a pleasure to work  together and to have it all work out. We have worked closely together  for the past several years to advance a permanent solution for the  retirement benefits of thousands of miners in our State and across the  Nation. I appreciate Senator Manchin's hard work and leadership on  this; I really do.   I would be happy to discuss what I believe is our shared  understanding of the intent behind miners' healthcare language in the  omnibus bill that originated in the Miners Protection Act.    I wholly share Senator Manchin's understanding of this  key provision of the legislation.   By adopting the language from the Miners Protection Act that is  included in the Omnibus appropriations bill, we intended to cover any  miners, survivors, and dependents who would have received or continued  to receive Federal retiree healthcare benefits from one of these  bankrupt employers had it not gone through the bankruptcy process,  without regard to the 1993 plan's usual eligibility rules.   I understand that these individuals are eligible under the rules as  applied by the Patriot VEBA, and I expect that these rules will  continue to be applied in the same manner by the 1993 plan.    There is nothing like seeing the faces of our miners as  we did in our offices the other day and I have seen in my office  throughout this time--or when it was at the 100-degree rally out on the  lawn last fall--to realize the human faces behind what we are talking  about.   Senator Manchin is right. It is a bipartisan issue, and it is the  right and fair thing to do.   It has been a pleasure to work with Senator Manchin and with the UMWA  and our other colleagues to see this legislation through.    I thank my colleagues.
