 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, this is an easy amendment to argue because it makes so  much sense.   I am going to ask to strike section 6 of the bill. Let me read that  section: ``No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to  carry out the requirements of this Act and the amendments made by this  Act. Such requirements shall be carried out using amounts otherwise  authorized.''   In other words, they are going to be carried out without any funds.   Mr. Chairman, I am going to move forward here and make the statement  that the administration and House Republicans continue to add to the  EPA's workload while cutting funding and hampering State and local  agencies from providing the resources needed to protect public health.                                time  1615    This is surely unreasonable. In the case of H.R. 806, it will  continue to obstruct the EPA's ability to advance and improve our  Nation's air and water quality. My congressional district has extremely  poor air quality, which has caused a variety of health issues for my  constituents.   This bill does weaken the Clean Air Act. Specifically, it targets the  implementation and enforcement of air pollution health standards. It  also negatively impacts the budget for programs necessary to ensure  that Americans can breathe clean air.   This bill is in stark opposition to the public's overwhelming support  of the Clean Air Act. According to the Center for American Progress,  the Trump administration's EPA budget, which cuts more than $2 billion  from the Agency's budget, shifts the cost of implementing clean air  standards to the States. All of these cuts would be harmful to the  649,000 children and more than 2 million adults with asthma living in  California.   Every State agency that testified before the Energy and Commerce  Subcommittee on the Environment stated  [[Page H5960]]  that more, not less, money is needed and that the Clean Air Act was  working to protect the public's health and safety.   I represent one of the worst air quality regions in the Nation, the  San Joaquin Valley, and yet the San Joaquin Valley air district has  been a leader in utilizing EPA grants and expertise to achieve  emissions reductions from mobile sources, showing that this funding is  beneficial. The valley continues to set emission levels to record lows  and has reduced air pollution by over 80 percent. This data proves that  the Clean Air Act works and creates a better standard of living for all  Americans.   The American Lung Association issued a State of the Air report for  2017 in the State of California. Most of its 28 counties received an F  for air quality. We should be striving for better air quality.   Grants like the EPA's Targeted Air Shed Grants and Diesel Emission  Reductions Act help thousands of agriculture, trucking, and other  businesses acquire low-emitting tractors, trucks, and other equipment.  This funding generates jobs and manufacturing here in the United  States. These Federal funds have a great track record of benefiting our  region, and it is a good investment.   EPA estimates that for every dollar spent on DERA, more than $20 in  health benefits are generated. That is $20 of health benefits for every  dollar invested. All 50 States have these programs.   I also want to highlight how this bill, combined with other efforts  by the Trump administration, will continue to negatively impact air  quality and public health.   Our States have made tremendous progress and a significant investment  toward addressing climate change and public health. However, the Ozone  Standards Implementation Act would take a step backward, destroying  much of the progress, leading to a greater harm to public health and  our economy.   I urge a ``yes'' vote on this amendment, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chair, how much time is remaining?    Mr. Chair, I appreciate my colleague and friend from  Texas pointing out that we have counties in San Joaquin Valley that  have extreme ozone problems, but to ask to do more with less is not  reasonable. It is the DERA grants given to the counties from the EPA's  budget that have allowed the agencies to have the 80 percent reduction  in air pollution.   So taking that money away is not going to help. It is going to make  matters worse. Our agencies aren't going to be able to do the things  that they have been able to do, and they are not going to be able to  continue those things. So I think saying that we can't put more money  into air pollution reduction is not the answer. We need to be able to  spend money to do this.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, H.R. 806 does have a couple of provisions that would be  helpful to the air district in my region to avoid economic sanctions  for failing to meet certain standards when very specific criteria are  met. However, the underlying bill, as a whole, is completely  unacceptable and has been called the most irresponsible attack on the  Clean Air Act health standards ever introduced.   The Clean Air Act works. It saves lives. It has improved the  environment. I am privileged to represent a portion of the San Joaquin  Valley which, as was pointed out in the prior amendment, has extreme  ozone problems.   We produce more than half of the Nation's fruits, nuts, and  vegetables. Unfortunately, the valley has recently been rebounding from  an economic downturn and is continually hurt by poor air quality.  Action is needed.   This amendment seeks to address the serious health issues that are a  direct result of the poor air quality in the San Joaquin Valley and  other regions that are most at risk. The amendment provides a grant  program for areas that are in nonattainment of PM 2.5, extreme  nonattainment of ambient air quality standards, and those with high  rates of asthma and unemployment. It requires a dollar-for-dollar  matching from the districts receiving the grant.   California has 7 of the top 10 most polluted metropolitan areas and  11 of the worst 25 nationwide. There are millions of people at risk in  the valley and south coast due to high levels of PM 2.5 and ozone,  including children, seniors, and those with chronic illnesses. San  Joaquin Valley counties received F grades for their air quality by the  American Lung Association.   Our kids deserve to be healthy, attend school, and live in a clean  air environment. Studies have shown that high-quality air standards  would prevent thousands of premature deaths in the valley and that it  would work to prevent heart attacks, emergency room visits, and missed  school- and workdays.   One study estimated that in the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Glendale area,  about 2.9 million people missed work or schooldays and were otherwise  negatively affected from conducting normal activities due to poor air  quality.   Valley children miss hundreds of thousands of days of school each  year, and about one in five living in the valley has asthma. Illnesses  related to poor air quality cost the valley billions, annually.   H.R. 806 will be a step backward. That is why I have offered this  substitute amendment that would allow the EPA to target and work with  our Nation's most affected regions, like those in the valley and the  south coast. This is about addressing our environment, the air we  breathe, and helping those most at risk.   At the same time, California has been cleaning the air. Its economy  has continued to grow. In 2016, California's nonfarm employment  increased by 2.6 percent, compared to 1.7 percent nationwide. In 2009,  California's clean energy industry created $2.7 billion and employed  123,000 people. By 2020, we expect it to grow to over $140 billion with  345,000 employed. California's success is proof that H.R. 806 is  unnecessary.   I urge adoption of my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, how much time is remaining?    Mr. Chair, clearly everybody wants clean air, and I  don't doubt that for a second, and I appreciate the effort that is  being made to streamline the implementation of clean air. But my  questions are: Is this going to be a message bill? Or is this something  we are actually going to get signed into law?   And my answer rhetorically is that if you want to get something  signed into law, you really have to work on both sides of the aisle.   Now, there are a couple provisions in the bill that I think are  completely objectionable. There may be room for compromise. The 10-year  extension seems out of bounds to me. Technology moves much faster than  10 years. The idea that technical achievability can be taken into  account really does lose sight of the important aspect of the Clean Air  Act, which is that we want to protect people's health.   So among other things, if you want to actually get something done, if  you want to actually work across the aisle and get something that we  may get signed into law, work with us. Otherwise, I am going to have to  put forward this amendment that replaces the ozone 805 and replaces it  with something that actually works.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
