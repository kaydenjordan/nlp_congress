 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Leoncio  Vega Correa, son of Luis Correa Sotelo and Magdalena Correa. He passed  away November 24, surrounded by his loved ones.   Leo was the hardworking child of immigrants. He was born in Watts,  California, on April 24, 1926, but his family spent much of his  childhood living in Zacatecas, Mexico.   Leo lived a hard life but an honest life. The devastation of the  Great Depression followed him and his family from the United States to  Mexico.   He never received a formal education. He worked as a migrant  farmworker across the country, following harvests.   Despite all his hardships, Leo was a gentle giant and never met a  stranger. He was always ready to give a hug, a smile, a dollar, a meal,  or even the shirt off of his back. He would always tell me: ``Good  deeds always come back to you.'' And he was known by his saying, ``pura  vida.''   Leo lived a hard, great life. We celebrate his life today, and he  will be missed by the community and his family.                            ____________________
