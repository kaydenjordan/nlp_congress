 Madam Speaker, Putin continues  threatening military aggression against Ukraine, now over 100,000  troops, which would only enrich Putin cronies and oligarchs, and which  would be catastrophic for the people of Russia. A Putin invasion would  result in needless and horrific loss of both Ukrainian and Russian  lives.   Having returned from a recent delegation to Kyiv, I saw firsthand the  courage of the people of Ukraine for independence.   Putin should know that both parties in America are united in support  of the Ukrainian people. NATO is also unified as Chancellor Olaf Scholz  promised today.  [[Page H998]]    I am grateful that Biden has changed course to reinforce the Trump  policies of sending defensive weapons to Ukraine.   Putin aggression against Ukraine must be deterred for the benefit of  the people of Russia and the people of Ukraine.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years, as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from a safe haven in Afghanistan to America.                            ____________________
