 Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from Iowa for her  leadership on so many issues, including this one. Obviously, through  her work on the Judiciary Committee, where we both serve and from where  this important piece of legislation emanated, this has been a long  journey. Unfortunately, the politics of the day seem to have slowed  almost everything up that we are trying to do.   In particular, I also want to recognize the good work of the Senator  from Iowa on the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. I  am a proud cosponsor of the legislation she is leading on. My hope is  that after the fever breaks, sometime after the first of the year--I  keep hoping for that moment--we will get back to the nonpartisan  reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. In the meantime, I  am happy to join the Senator on the floor and to talk about the  importance of the Debbie Smith Act and to celebrate its imminent  passage.   Since 2004, the Debbie Smith Act has been the guiding force behind  our Nation's effort to eliminate the rape kit backlog. Just so  everybody understands, at one point there was a report that there were  as many as 400,000 of these forensic kits, which are used to collect  DNA evidence following sexual assault, sitting in evidence lockers and  police stations or in labs and which remained untested.   Once we are reminded of the importance of this evidence and how  powerful it is to enable law enforcement officials to identify an  attacker with almost complete precision and accuracy, the importance of  making sure these kits were tested becomes all that more obvious.   Since 2011, the Debbie Smith Act has helped Texas--my State alone-- reduce its backlog of unsubmitted rape kits by approximately 90  percent.   The benefits don't stop there, though. The primary goal of this  program is to reduce the rape kit backlog and identify attackers-- people who commit sexual assaults.   Processing this evidence can also assist investigations in other  unrelated crimes because perpetrators do leave their DNA in other  places other than just in the crime of sexual assault.   Once this evidence is tested, it is uploaded into the FBI's DNA  database called CODIS. This is similar to a criminal fingerprint  database and can help identify and convict people who commit other  crimes as well.   For the civil libertarians among us--and I would like to consider  myself one of them--this evidence is also very powerful in discounting  or disqualifying potential perpetrators from suspicion because if, in  fact, DNA of some other person is identified, it obviously is by  exclusion of the other person who may be suspected but who will thereby  be exonerated.   According to the National Institute of Justice, 72 percent of the  hits in the FBI database system are the direct result of Debbie Smith  Act funding. The benefits of this law cannot be overstated, and it is  time once again--past time, really--to reauthorize this critical  program. The Debbie Smith Act of  [[Page S7084]]  2019 will reauthorize important funding that supports testing this DNA  evidence so we can continue to reduce and eliminate the rape kit  backlog and ensure that it will not grow again in the future.   This legislation also supports important training for law  enforcement, correctional personnel, forensic nurses, who are the ones  who actually collect the DNA evidence using these forensic kits, as  well as other professionals who assist victims of sexual assault.   The process of getting this legislation through both Chambers of the  Congress has not been easy. I have to say I appreciate all of the  advocates who fought tirelessly with us every step of the way to bring  us to this moment on the precipice of passing this reauthorization. I  want to particularly recognize the folks at RAINN who are consistently  remaining above the political fray and always putting survivors first.   This legislation would not have been possible without its namesake,  Debbie Smith, and the countless other survivors--people like Lavinia  Masters, Carol Bart, and others--who continue to lend their voices to  this fight. It is not easy for a woman to come forward and say: I was a  victim of sexual assault, and I don't know who my attacker was, but I  will go through this intrusive examination in order to assist law  enforcement in making an identification and prosecuting the case. The  fact is, if we don't catch these predators, they will commit further  acts of sexual violence over and over again until they are finally  caught and kept behind bars.   If you have not had the chance to meet survivors and hear their  stories, you must because the survivors I have met and worked with over  the years in Texas are truly inspiring. I am glad we can finally get  this bill passed on their behalf.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the  immediate consideration of H.R. 777, which was received from the House.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be  considered read a third time and passed and that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I have further remarks, but I understand  the leader is on his way here to file some important documents and help  us progress with our work this week.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I understand the majority leader will be  here soon, and when he does come, I will be glad to yield to him. In  the meantime, I want to talk about last week's report from the  inspector general of the Department of Justice on the FBI's  counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign and its  contacts with Russia in 2016.   This is a very long report. It is more than 400 pages long, and it  outlines a series of errors--17, all counted--made by the FBI under the  leadership of Director James Comey.   It is important for people to realize that all these mistakes were  made in a previous administration and not under the leadership of FBI  Director Chris Wray, and they don't reflect, in my view, the actions of  the rank-and-file FBI agents. But it is a serious matter, and we need  to get to the bottom of it, and we need to take corrective action.   The report details a pattern of concerning behavior by those who were  charged with protecting and defending the United States, and it raises  a lot of red flags.   Last week, the inspector general testified before the Judiciary  Committee. I told him at that time--and I think it bears repeating-- that as an ardent supporter of law enforcement and our intelligence  community, I worry that the mistakes and the intentionally misleading  conduct undertaken by some leaders in the FBI under the previous  administration will undermine the public's confidence in what is a very  sensitive but important area, like foreign intelligence surveillance.   We rely on the men and women of the FBI to identify and counter  threats to our national security, all the while protecting incredibly  sensitive information and the privacy of American citizens. It requires  a tremendous amount of trust from the American people, and I am afraid  that some of the information that surfaced in this report puts that  trust in jeopardy.    The inspector general detailed a number of truly disturbing and  alarming facts about how this investigation was conducted, especially  when it comes to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, otherwise  known as FISA.   FISA is a means whereby FBI agents can go to the Foreign Intelligence  Surveillance Court and show probable cause that an American citizen is  an agent of a foreign power. Obviously, these are very, very sensitive  investigations, and the sort of authority that is given to the FBI  under these circumstances is very intrusive. In my view, it is entirely  justified and necessary when, in fact, you are protecting the United  States from very real counterintelligence matters. But the inspector  general identified 7 mistakes in the initial Carter Page foreign  intelligence surveillance application and 10 additional ones in 3  renewals. These were not typos or misspelled words; these were  misrepresentations meant to deceive the court so they would issue a  foreign intelligence surveillance warrant.   To make matters worse, even as new exculpatory information came to  light on Carter Page, this information was not shared with the Foreign  Intelligence Surveillance Court--information that they would have found  relevant in considering whether the FBI and the U.S. Government had met  their required showing.   I asked the inspector general whether he believed that if the court  knew what we know now, would the court have ever issued the FISA  warrant in the first place? He perhaps wisely said he was not in a  position to predict what the judges may or may not do, but he said he  knew they wouldn't sign a warrant if they were told that all of the  information was not included and certainly not if they were lied to, as  occurred here in the Carter Page foreign intelligence surveillance  warrant. As a former judge myself, I think that is absolutely accurate.   But that begs the question, What is the FISA Court going to do about  this? We know what we need to do because already the FBI Director has  indicated that there are a number of areas where he believes this whole  process needs to be reformed in order to restore public trust in the  integrity of this process.   I was interested to see a report in the New York Times that is dated  today at 4:55 p.m. entitled ``Court Orders FBI to Fix National Security  Wiretaps After Damning Report.''   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my remarks,  this article be printed in the Record.   Take a step back from this scenario and think more broadly about how  this type of behavior may play out in a criminal proceeding. For  example, imagine you are a judge and you find out that you were lied to  by the prosecution, that you were presented with information that was  not only incorrect but intentionally fabricated to help build their  case. What would you do? Well, depending on the scenario, the court may  hold that individual in contempt of court. The judge may decide to  throw out some of the evidence or the entire case and possibly-- probably--refer that lawyer to disciplinary proceedings, where that  lawyer would be in jeopardy of losing his or her law license. These are  remedies that exist if these sorts of actions happen during ordinary  court proceedings, and I believe they are probably available to the  [[Page S7085]]  Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court should the court decide to take  that kind of action.   I note that in this article I have attached and I referred to  earlier, the court has now given the FBI a January 10 deadline to come  up with a response to what the court is asking about.   Of course, the court, I am sure, had to be troubled by what it saw as  not only the sloppy work but the intentional misrepresentation and  outright lies used by the FBI in this instance to get this foreign  intelligence surveillance warrant against Carter Page--as well they  should be concerned.   But the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court is different from  ordinary courts. It handles cases that are critical to our national  security, full of highly sensitive, largely classified information, and  these same sorts of remedies that you might use in an ordinary court  may or may not apply.   The way I see it, if we don't take corrective action--if the FBI  doesn't take corrective action, if Congress doesn't undertake a review  of this whole FISA process--we will be in danger of losing this ability  to investigate or to collect intelligence to keep our country safe. The  only way that happens currently is if the public trusts Congress and  the FISA Court to enforce the laws and rules to make sure that privacy  interests of American citizens are adequately protected, and only based  upon an extraordinary showing--an evidentiary showing by the Government  that a FISA warrant is warranted should that be ordered by the court.   All of that is at risk unless, I believe, reform is undertaken and  the court takes corrective action in whatever means it thinks  appropriate to punish those who misled it in issuing these four FISA  warrants for Carter Page.   This whole episode, I believe, sets a very dangerous precedent. If  these agents and lawyers are able to break every rule to investigate a  political campaign of an American President and are facing no  consequences, what is to stop others from doing that in the future? If  they can use the awesome power of the Federal Government to investigate  a Presidential campaign and someone who later became President, what  chance do ordinary Americans have of making sure that the rules will be  applied to them and that their privacy will be respected?   We have to have accountability for these errors and these  intentionally deceptive representations. We can't have people like that  working at the FBI who are charged with supporting our national  security. We can't allow that to continue or to happen again.   We need to see that adequate disciplinary measures are undertaken by  the FBI, perhaps by the court itself, while Congress looks at what we  can do to reform this whole FISA procedure to make sure things like  this do not happen in the future.   I was glad to see, in his report, the inspector general said that his  office has initiated a full audit to look into the FBI's compliance  with FISA procedures across the board.   He also noted that the FBI's National Security Division Assistant  Attorney General had sent a letter to the FISA Court in July of 2018,  outlining some of the errors made in the Carter Page FISA applications  and saying that DOJ lawyers will be supplementing that information  based on the inspector general report that the inspector general  testified on last week.   As we look for ways to prevent this type of abuse from happening in  the future, we need to hear from the FISA Court what it believes is  appropriate discipline and appropriate measures it needs to take to  protect the integrity of their proceedings and to stop things like this  from happening in the future. All of this would be critical not only to  find what went wrong but also what Congress does or does not need to do  to protect the integrity of this process.   FISA--the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act--is absolutely  critical to our national security, and we must not only protect the  integrity of the process but restore the American people's trust in it.   I know this isn't something that can be solved overnight, but I am  committed to working with all of our colleagues here in Congress, as  well as the Justice Department and the Foreign Intelligence  Surveillance Court, to try to do what we need to do to prevent these  failures from ever happening again.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From The New York Times, Dec. 17, 2019]    Court Orders F.B.I. to Fix National Security Wiretaps After Damning                                   Report                            (By Charlie Savage)         In a rare public order, the secretive Foreign Intelligence       Surveillance Court responded to problems with the       eavesdropping on a former Trump campaign aide uncovered by an       inspector general.        A secretive federal court accused the F.B.I. on Tuesday of       misleading it about the factual basis for wiretapping a       former Trump campaign adviser and ordered the bureau to       propose changes in how investigators seek permission for some       national security surveillance.        In an extraordinary public order, the presiding judge on       the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, Rosemary M.       Collyer, gave the F.B.I. a Jan. 10 deadline to come up with a       proposal. It was the first public response from the court to       the scathing findings released last week by the Justice       Department's independent inspector general about the       wiretapping of the former Trump adviser, Carter Page, as part       of the Russia investigation.        ``The frequency with which representations made by F.B.I.       personnel turned out to be unsupported or contradicted by       information in their possession, and with which they withheld       information detrimental to their case, calls into question       whether information contained in other F.B.I. applications is       reliable,'' Judge Collyer wrote.        The court ``expects the government to provide complete and       accurate information in every filing,'' she added.        While the inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, debunked       the claims by President Trump and his allies that senior       F.B.I. officials were part of a political conspiracy, his       investigation also exposed a litany of errors and       inaccuracies by which case agents cherry-picked the evidence       about Mr. Page as they sought permission to eavesdrop on his       calls and emails.        The order specifies no particular reforms for the bureau's       policies for seeking permission to wiretap people under the       Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA. But it       indicated that the court will weigh in on whether the       F.B.I.'s proposals are sufficient.        At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing last week about the       report's findings, the chairman of the panel, Senator Lindsey       Graham, Republican of South Carolina, addressed the FISA       court directly, telling the judges that they needed to take       steps to preserve political support for the national security       surveillance system.        ``The FISA system, to survive, has to be reformed;'' Mr.       Graham said. ``To the FISA court: We're looking to you to       take corrective action. If you take corrective action, that       will give us some confidence that you should stick around. If       you don't, it's going to be hurtful to the future of the       court, and I think all of us are now thinking differently       about checks and balances in that regard.''        Mr. Horowitz is scheduled to testify about the report again       on Wednesday at a hearing before the Senate Homeland Security       and Governmental Affairs Committee.        Mr. Horowitz suggested several changes. He recommended that       the F.B.I. overhaul the forms used to ask the Justice       Department to submit a FISA request or renewal to ensure they       identify any information that cuts against suspicions about a       target; surface any reasons to be skeptical about an       informant whose information is included; and require agents       and supervisors to reverify factual assertions repeated from       prior applications when they seek renewals.        In a statement issued when the report was released, the       F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray, said he accepted Mr.       Horowitz's findings and embraced the need to make changes. He       said he was ordering ``concrete changes'' to ensure that that       FISA process was ``more stringent and less susceptible to       mistake or inaccuracy.''        Among the other ideas floated by reform proponents,       including the American Civil Liberties Union: appointing a       third party to critique the government's cases for       wiretapping people, at least in sensitive investigations, or       allowing defense lawyers with security clearances to see the       government's evidence presented to the FISA court on those       rare occasions when it is used to prosecute a suspect.        Mr. Horowitz has already begun an audit of other, unrelated       FISA applications to see whether there is a broader pattern       of problems in how the F.B.I. is portraying the evidence       about suspects. Another possibility for reform is that going       forward, the bureau's general counsel could oversee recurring       audits of a random sampling of FISA applications, so that       case agents will always have to take into account that       someone may later second-guess their work.        In his report, Mr. Horowitz scrutinized the four       applications that the Justice Department submitted between       October 2016 and June 2017 to wiretap Mr. Page, whom F.B.I.       agents suspected might be a conduit between the Trump       campaign and Russia during its covert operation to manipulate       the 2016 presidential election.        The review uncovered a deeply dysfunctional and flawed       process riddled with inaccuracies and material omissions.       Investigators highlighted facts that made Mr. Page look       suspicious while failing to mention potentially exculpatory       ones, and when they  [[Page S7086]]       sought to renew the wiretap, they failed to correct earlier       statements whose credibility had since come under serious       question, the report found.        Justice Department lawyers who deal directly with the FISA       court passed that misleading portrait onto the judges. While       Mr. Horowitz's findings placed most of the direct blame on a       handful of case agents and their supervisors who worked       directly with the raw evidence, his report also blamed senior       officials for permitting a culture in which such actions       could happen.        The report said Mr. Horowitz's investigators had found no       evidence that political bias against Mr. Trump was behind the       problems--as opposed to apolitical confirmation bias, gross       incompetence or negligence. But the inspector general said       the explanation the F.B.I. offered--that the agents had been       busy with other aspects of the Russia investigation, and the       Page FISA was a minor part of those responsibilities--was       unsatisfactory.        Congress enacted FISA in 1978 to regulate the government's       use of domestic surveillance for national-security       investigations--those aimed at monitoring suspected spies and       terrorists--as opposed to ordinary criminal cases. The law       sets up a special court, made up of 11 sitting district court       judges who are selected to serve staggered terms by the chief       justice of the Supreme Court, and decide whether the evidence       shows a target is probably a foreign agent.        In 2018, government records show, the court only fully       denied one of 1,080 final applications submitted under FISA       to conduct electronic surveillance. However, the court also       demanded unspecified modifications to 119 of those       applications before approving them. There were 1,833 targets       of FISA orders, including 232 Americans, that year.        National-security wiretaps are more secretive than ordinary       criminal ones. When criminal wiretap orders end, their       targets are usually notified that their privacy has been       invaded. But the targets of FISA orders are usually not told       that their phone calls and emails have been monitored, or       that their homes or businesses have been searched.        And when people are prosecuted for crimes based on evidence       derived from ordinary criminal wiretaps, the defendants and       their lawyers are usually allowed to see what the government       told judges about them to win approval for that surveillance,       giving them the opportunity to argue that investigators made       mistakes and the evidence should be suppressed.        But defense lawyers, even those with security clearances,       are not shown FISA applications for their clients. As a       result, there is no prospect of second-guessing in an       adversarial court setting to keep F.B.I. agents scrupulous       about how they portray the evidence when seeking to persuade       FISA judges to sign off on putting a target under       surveillance.        In the absence of that disciplining factor, the Justice       Department and F.B.I. have developed internal procedures that       are supposed to make sure that the evidence presented in FISA       applications is accurate and includes any facts that might       undercut the government's case. But that system failed in the       Page wiretaps, Mr. Horowitz's report showed.        At the Senate hearing, one of the rare areas of agreement       between Republicans and Democrats was the need for change to       the FISA system. Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of       Connecticut, who has unsuccessfully proposed legislation to       tighten restrictions on national-security surveillance in the       past, said he welcomed the moment.        ``I hope my Republican colleagues who have been so vocal       and vehement about the dangers of potential FISA abuses will       join me in looking forward and reform of that court,'' Mr.       Blumenthal said, adding: ``I hope that we can come together       on a bipartisan basis to reform the FISA process.''                            ____________________     Mr. President, I know this year is rapidly coming to a  close, and we are all anxious to join our families for the holidays.   The impeachment frenzy, though, has almost completely engulfed the  Capitol, particularly on the House side, for the past few months and  has made it very difficult, if not impossible, for Congress to get much  of its work done; hence, the last-minute rush to get things done that  we should have done weeks and perhaps months earlier.   One of the victims of this impeachment mania has been the National  Defense Authorization Act, and I am glad we finally were able to pass  that today.   For the last 58 years, the NDAA--the national defense act--has passed  with broad bipartisan support. But this year, things took a little  different turn. While we maintained historical norms here in the Senate  and passed the bill by a vote of 86 to 8, our House Democratic  colleagues took a completely different route. They managed to come up  with a bill that was so partisan that not a single Republican voted for  it in the House.   A party-line vote in the House may not be newsworthy, but a party- line vote on the national defense authorization bill is.   Fortunately, after months of negotiations, Senator Inhofe, chairman  of the Armed Services Committee, and Senator Reed, the ranking member,  were able to work with their House counterparts to reach a compromise  on the bill, as I said, that passed earlier today.   This legislation is vitally important because it will give our  commanders the predictability they need, as well as the troops the  resources they have earned.   It also authorizes $400 million for military construction projects in  places like Texas and 90 new F-35 Joint Strike Fighters that are made  in Fort Worth.   Overall, the NDAA will strengthen our national security, and it will  benefit all of our servicemembers and their families and our military  bases, including those in Texas.   So I just want to say that I appreciate the hard work of Chairman  Inhofe and Senator Reed, the ranking member, and all of our colleagues  on the Armed Services Committee on both sides of the Capitol and look  forward to it being signed by the President, hopefully, without further  delay.   This was a critical step to strengthen our Nation's military, but it  is only part of our duty to provide our troops with the resources and  training and the equipment they need to succeed. Now we need to take  care of the defense appropriations bill, which has now been passed by  the House and which will be coming over here to the Senate soon and  which I expect we will act on by Thursday.   Sadly, though, this has also fallen to the wayside while our  Democratic colleagues in the House have worked tirelessly to try to  remove the President from office. We are in the posture of having to do  that this week only because the agreement that was made last August on  spending caps was walked away from by our Democratic colleagues in the  Senate, and it has taken us all this time to get back to where we  thought we were in the August timeframe.   Despite the deal reached over the summer to keep the appropriations  process free from poison pill riders, our friends across the aisle have  tried to force liberal wish list items into the bill.   Thanks to Senator Inhofe, that has largely been avoided. I must also  thank Mac Thornberry, the ranking member on the House side.   We have also managed to avoid a government shutdown, but the process  has certainly not been pretty. We have been forced to pass two short- term funding bills, which have kept the trains running but failed to  provide the predictability we thought we were going to get into the  future once the 2-year budget deal was agreed upon last August.   So I am happy in one sense that the deal was finally reached to avoid  a government shutdown, and I am in the process of reviewing these huge  funding packages that total about $1.4 trillion.   Let me just say that I also appreciate the hard work of our friend  from Alabama, Chairman Shelby, and our colleagues on the appropriations  committees for their work to keep the doors open and to keep our  commitments to our men and women in uniform.   I am hopeful we will be able to act before this funding expires this  Friday.   I yield the floor.
