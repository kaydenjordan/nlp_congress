 Madam President, I am going to be talking about a bill  of mine that is, I think, very appropriate and very timely, the Protect  Our Heroes Act, which will federalize certain violent crimes against  public safety officers across the country, like the police and first  responders, in order to deter these kinds of crimes and show the men  and women in our law enforcement community that we have their backs.   Before I get into the details of my bill, I want to talk a little bit  about a very moving event.   I was back home last week in Alaska. I was at the American Legion  Post No. 15 in Palmer, AK, and it was on the commemoration of September  11. It was a wonderful remembrance dinner. There were tons of veterans,  patriots. My State is blessed with more vets per capita than any State  in the country.   But it was focused on law enforcement. We had the Palmer police chief  there. We had members of the police department from Anchorage there  because we were focused on so many things that came out of that day--9/ 11.   But honoring our first responders is something that I think America  learned--that we need to respect the men and women epitomized by the  police and firemen who went up the Tower. Many of them knew they were  going to die, and they did that. They did that to protect us, and there  was this newfound respect for our first responders that came out of the  tragedy of 9/11.   Now, in my remarks to my fellow veterans in Palmer at the American  Legion post last Friday, I did mention that one of the elements of what  is happening in our country, unfortunately, is that these memories are  fading. They are fading, and in some ways the respect for the police is  not just fading. It is being reversed.   You see these movements, these national movements of defunding our  police--a horrible idea, in my view. My State needs more law  enforcement, not less. We have seen on our TV screens and our social  media channels that there are people--criminals--who are focused on  harming the police, killing the police, attacking the police, and even  taking glee in the killing and the violence against law enforcement.   So we have all seen in the past few years a dramatic increase in  killings, in ambushes. In Iowa, New York, Massachusetts, Texas,  California, Colorado, Pennsylvania, and Georgia this has been  happening. It certainly hit home in my State.   In Anchorage, in 2016, we had a brave police officer, Arn Salao, who  was the victim of a cowardly ambush in 2016. Thankfully, he survived,  barely. What was the result of the arrest of the individual who tried  to kill him? He ended up being a serial killer, killing five others in  Anchorage. But this brave police officer found him, stopped him, and  almost lost his life.   Unfortunately, another officer in a shooting in Alaska the same year,  2016, in Fairbanks, wasn't so fortunate. On October 16, 2016, Sergeant  Allen Brandt, an 11-year veteran of the Fairbanks Police Department,  pulled over a suspect to question him, and he was shot five times. He  eventually succumbed to the complications related to his injuries.   I went to the memorial service. There were hundreds of Alaskans. He  had a young family, a young wife. It was brutal to watch this.   These are selfless men and women in my State, who are every day  getting up to risk their lives and to wear the uniform in the line of  duty.   All of this inspired me to put together my Protect Our Heroes Act,  which will enhance Federal penalties for the killing or assaulting of  public safety officers and first responders, especially increasing  penalties for criminals who ambush or lure law enforcement officers for  the purpose of committing crimes against them--dramatically enhancing  penalties.   This is something that I think the vast majority of us in the Senate  agree with.   Now, I take the opportunity to go running most days, whether I am  here or back home. And when I go running on Capitol Hill, what I see  every morning--and I saw it this morning--are police officers. No  matter the time of day, Capitol Police are sitting in their vehicles or  on patrol. Their sole purpose is to protect this institution and the  Members.   This morning, as I usually do when I run past them sitting in their  car, I just gave them a thumbs-up. Thank you. Thank you. We respect  you, and we certainly have your back.   So that is why I am offering this legislation today. I hope my Senate  colleagues can come together to support this. I think it would be  inconceivable to vote against this bill, especially now when we are  seeing these kinds of heinous activities like we saw in Compton, CA.  But we also want to send a message to our first responders and law  enforcement: We are watching. We are going to pass laws to  disincentivize this kind of heinous action against you, and we have  your back and the back of your family members, who are probably worried  when you go out on your duty every day.   Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  that the Judiciary Committee be discharged from further consideration  of S. 1135 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration;  further, that the Sullivan substitute amendment at the desk be  considered and agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be considered read  a third time and passed; and that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from  Pennsylvania. I know he and I both share a passion on this issue. I  think the vast majority of the Senators share a passion on this issue-- that we should be standing here in the U.S. Senate to make sure our law  enforcement knows that we have their backs.   As Senator Toomey just mentioned, this is happening all across the  country. The men and women who put on the uniform to protect us are  being targeted simply because they wear the uniform to protect us. If  this is not an issue that cries out for some kind of action, some kind  of discussion to prevent this and tell these brave men and women,  whether in Alaska or Pennsylvania or New Mexico, that we have their  backs, I don't know what that topic is--I don't know what that issue  is.   Unfortunately, Senator Toomey tried to move his legislation the last  couple of days, and it was thwarted. Now my legislation to send the  message that we are not going to let criminals get away with these  kinds of heinous crimes, that the Senate is watching, and that we have  the backs of law enforcement and their families--that is a really  important message to send right now.   I am disappointed in my colleague for objecting. We will continue to  work on this issue and, as Senator Toomey mentioned, the violence  issue, which is a hugely important issue in my State for my  constituents. But right now, I think we should be acting on the issue  we are seeing, and that issue is, there is a movement across the  country that is really focused on perpetrating violence against the men  and women who are sworn to protect us. I can't believe anyone here  thinks that is a good movement, but it is happening in America right  now. We need to send a message that it is unacceptable and that we are  going to do everything in our power to stop it.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, it is Thursday, and as you know, it is  one of my favorite times of the week.   The Presiding Officer has the good fortune of listening to a number  of the ``Alaskan of the Week'' speeches when I get to come down to the  floor--typically every Thursday--to talk about a person or group of  people who are doing great things for my State. As I said, so many of  my colleagues here--even some of the reporters--know this is the person  we call our Alaskan of the Week, but sometimes we call them our  Alaskans of the Week.   This week, we are going plural in a big way. This week, we are  recognizing an entire community for how this community--the whole  community--banded together to literally help save a young child who was  sick and needed medical attention.   Before I get into the story, let me say that, in Alaska, community is  everything. Living in one of the most magnificent places in the world  is not without its challenges. We depend on each other. Communities  often come together to help each other. Typically, in our rural  communities, traditional knowledge is critical and so is hard-won  ingenuity and determination to overcome many of the challenges in  living in the great State of Alaska.   I would like to transport you to one of those communities. It is the  village of Igiugig in Southwest Alaska. Rich in Native traditions,  Igiugig is home to around 70 year-round residents, growing to over 200  in the summer months.   The name ``Igiugig'' originated from a Yupik word meaning ``like a  throat that swallows water,'' referring to the village's location where  the Kvichak River meets Iliamna.   Going all the way back to the purchase of Alaska from Russia over 150  years ago, Igiugig has maintained a commercial fishing and subsistence- based economy. They have been incredibly innovative with alternative  energy there--wind and hydro--and most importantly, this community has  maintained a strong sense of connection with each other, which is so  important for communities like this. This is evidenced by what happened  just a few weeks ago when a young girl needed to be airlifted out of  the community to Anchorage--some 250 miles away--for medical help, and  nearly every member of the community pitched in to help.   What happened? Here is what happened. On the night of August 28--so  about 3 or 4 weeks ago--around 11:30 a.m., the Tribal administrator and  village council vice president Karl Hill was sitting at home when he  saw the LifeMed Alaska flight, which he knew was coming in to help this  young girl, circling above the small runway.   Over 200 of our communities aren't connected by roads. They aren't  connected by roads, so a lot of them have very small airports and  landing strips.   Karl got this phone call when the pilot was above circling. There was  a problem with the runway lights; they weren't working. He ran out to  the airport to try to turn the lights on manually. That didn't work, so  he got into his plane--he was one of only two pilots in the village  with a plane. He got on the plane just to talk to the pilot, who was  circling above, over the headset. That pilot who was on the medevac  flight told him he was getting low on fuel. He wouldn't be able to  circle much longer, and he couldn't land. But this young girl needed  help as soon as possible.   In so many of our Native communities and rural communities, there is  no hospital. There is barely even a medical clinic sometimes. So she  needed to be medevacked.   While Karl communicated with the pilot over his headset, other  community members began calling people in the community asking for  help. Ida Nelson made calls and jumped on her four-wheeler and headed  to the airport. Community leader Christina Salmon, whose sister is  Alexanna Salmon--who was our Alaskan of the Week in 2017, by the way-- made around 32 phone calls. Health aide Amanda Bybee, Jeff Bringhurst,  and so many others started calling and rallying this community, and  they all came out. They all came out in any kind of vehicle with lights  that they had--trucks, cars, ATVs, kids on four-wheelers, many still in  their pajamas. This was in the middle of the night. They arrived to  provide enough light on the runway for the pilot to see the landing  strip. They staggered the vehicles facing east and running the whole  length of the runway, lighting the medevac pilot's way.   They waited intensely. Ida Nelson told a reporter:         I was anxious and nervous. . . . I was like, ``so what if       that was my baby (waiting for that) plane?'' What if it was       my young girl who needed lifesaving help?    They waited for the plane to touch down, for the girl to be  transferred, and for the plane to take off again. All of this happened  with the lights provided by the community in a makeshift lighting of  the runway.   By this time, it was around a little past 1:30, closer to 2 o'clock,  but when the plane took off, the community, of course, was in a  celebratory mood.   ``We were pumped up,'' Karl Hill said. ``It was really an amazing  feat that we were able to pull together so quickly'' in the middle of  the night. He added, ``It was really a nice evening.''   That young girl who needed to be medevacked and airlifted in  Anchorage is now back in the community, and she has recovered, thank  God.   LifeMed Alaska, which provided the medevac, posted a photo on social  media with the following caption: ``What appears to be a blurry, dark  photo is actually a view of what an amazing community can do with a lot  of determination,'' lighting a runway, saving a life. Indeed.   We are so proud to be a State full of such tight-knit communities  that work together every day to make Alaska so special. We are  particularly proud as we recount the events of August 28 in Igiugig and  so grateful to everyone in the community who came out in the middle of  the night, some in their pajamas, to make sure that young girl could  get the medical help she needed.   Thank you to Igiugig for being such an amazing community with great  determination, great heart, and great innovation. Congratulations to  all of you for being our Alaskans of the Week.
