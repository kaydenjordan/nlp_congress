 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on  the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order  that a quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, congratulations to  President-elect Ivan Duque on being elected the new president of  Colombia on Sunday, achieving 10 million votes, with one of the largest  voter turnouts in the history of Colombia.   At 41, President-elect Duque will be one of the youngest presidents  in the country's history. The father of three is married to Maria  Juliana Ruiz.   I know firsthand of the talented people of Colombia, as former co- chairman of the Partners of Americas program, hosting students from  Colombia with two of my sons as exchange students to Colombia.  [[Page H5231]]    The South Carolina National Guard, headed by General Bob Livingston,  is grateful to be training with Colombia's military and the State  Partnership Program.   This election was the first to be held since a peace deal was reached  that ended the murderous, leftist insurgency in Colombia.   I am grateful that President-elect Ivan Duque plans to work closely  with the United States in the tradition of former President Alvaro  Uribe. He will be successful in creating jobs, increasing security for  the population, and leading Colombia to a more prosperous future.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. We will remember  Otto Warmbier on the anniversary of his death.                            ____________________
