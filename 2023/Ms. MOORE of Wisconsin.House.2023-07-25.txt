 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the  heinous attack on LGBTQ+ servicemembers and veterans, including in the  fiscal year Military Construction, Veterans Affairs and Related  Agencies appropriations bill.   While it is no surprise that Republicans continue their consistent  attempts to dehumanize, discriminate, and devalue LGBTQ+ people, it is  shameful that they have chosen to carry this distasteful political  attack into this body's appropriations process. Why?   This is a voluntary military, Mr. Speaker. There are 1 million gay  and lesbian veterans, and more than 130,000 of them identify as  transgender. On top of that, 65,000 Active Duty members currently  serving in our military identify as LGBTQ+.   In their bill, which we will debate later on this week, Republicans  argue that we should turn our backs on these volunteers who have  dedicated their lives to serving our country. Saying that they do not  deserve access to lifesaving healthcare services based on their  identity is ridiculous.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to stick with our LGBTQ+  veterans.                            ____________________
