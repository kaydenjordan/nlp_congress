 Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose H.R. 803, the western  wildfire bill.   Make no mistake, while some seek preservation, what we need is  management. It always seems like those who seek to preserve, they go to  the places that are most well managed. These places now will suffer as  a result of that.   But I want to emphasize three things that all Americans are going to  lose with this bill.   Job security: We have already seen 11,000 jobs jeopardized by the  abrogation of a contract by President Biden in regard to the Keystone  XL pipeline.   Economic security: Lumber prices continue to rise. Taking timber off  the marketplace is not going to make the cost of building a home any  cheaper. You want to get kids out of their parents' basement? You are  not going to do it this way, by raising the price of being able to  build a home.   National security: We have become an energy-independent country here  over the last 10 years, and it has gotten us out of the forever wars in  the Middle East. This jeopardizes those achievements.   Job security, economic security, national security are all at stake  here with this bill.
