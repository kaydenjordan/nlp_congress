 Mr. President, with my fellow Members of Idaho's  congressional delegation Senator Jim Risch and Representatives  Mike  Simpson and Russ Fulcher, we recognize June as Alzheimer's and Brain  Awareness Month. According to the Alzheimer's Association, 27,000  people aged 65 and older are living with Alzheimer's in Idaho, while  65,000 family caregivers bear the burden of the disease. In honor of  these Idaho families and the millions of other Americans and their  loved ones impacted by Alzheimer's, we continue the fight to stop  harmful policies delaying access to treatment for Alzheimer's patients.   The Food and Drug Administration's, FDA, accelerated approval pathway  has provided a lifeline for countless Americans suffering from  Alzheimer's disease by advancing access to safe and effective medicines  years before these treatments could otherwise come to market. Numerous  studies show that drugs that have gone through the accelerated approval  pathway reach patients an average of more than 3 years before they  would otherwise.   Unfortunately, the current administration has taken unprecedented  steps to erode this pathway, deterring lifesaving innovation and  delaying access to care by restricting Medicare coverage for an entire  class of potential Alzheimer's therapies. This harmful coverage  decision carries grave implications for Alzheimer's patients. Every day  without access to FDA-approved drugs, more than 2,000 people transition  to a more advanced stage of Alzheimer's where they are no longer  eligible for treatment, reports the Alzheimer's Association. The  administration must reverse course and provide access to these  lifesaving pathways as quickly as possible.  [[Page S2048]]    We are grateful to leaders from communities across Idaho and our  country who are pivotal in advancing Alzheimer's and dementia research  and other important efforts that are making progress in fighting this  disease and supporting families dealing with this dreaded disease. The  advocates' personal experiences with the disease's effects in their own  families often fuel and inform their engagement. Their perspectives are  deeply valuable as we continue to work to improve drug access and  affordability. This includes working to ensure Federal policies enable,  not discourage, innovators to quickly bring their life-saving  discoveries to market.   Time and again, American ingenuity has proven it can meet the  challenges we face, if the Federal Government gets out of the way. This  Alzheimer's and Brain Awareness Month is a reminder of the pressing  need to better empower patients and doctors to decide the treatments  right for them. Throughout this month, as Americans wear purple and  participate in other awareness and educational activities and in the  years ahead, let's do all we can to alleviate the burden on families  across our country by easing access to innovative treatment for  Alzheimer's.                            ____________________
