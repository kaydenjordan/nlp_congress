 Madam Speaker, we could talk forever about this Build  Back Better bill, but I am going to shine a light on an underpublicized  provision in there.   I believe in the last month, for the first time, we hit $29 trillion  in debt. So one would figure on any spending bill that goes through  this House, we should be really conservative when it comes to spending  more money.   AmeriCorps is a program that right now we spend about $1 billion a  year on. In this bill, we are going from $1 billion a year to $4  billion a year. We are quadrupling the amount of money spent on a  program that is fraught with fraud, people taking large amounts of  money out of the program. Also, people are falsifying timesheets to get  benefits they aren't entitled to. Meanwhile, the inspector general  cannot do an appropriate job of investigating fraud because they aren't  even turning over records from the past.   If there is one program that ought to be looked at carefully, it  would be this. Instead of paying more attention to fraud in the  program, we are quadrupling the size of the program, not to mention it  is hurting people.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   As was just said, the United States today is one of only seven  countries around the world with such extreme pro-abortion laws. It is a  little bit unusual, of all countries, this country, which John Adams  said was formed only for moral and religious people, would have somehow  gotten all turned around and wrapped around the axle so that we have  now become, along with countries like Red China or North Korea,  countries known around the world for barbarity, as a country that is  that extreme.   In the United States, the vast majority of people lived in areas in  which abortion was illegal since before the Civil War. We had a  decision, Roe v. Wade, typical of the extreme decisions of people who,  I guess, spent too much time learning in law school, who felt that in  our Constitution we found something that virtually every church at the  time would have considered barbaric.                                time  1745    By the way, abortion was illegal before the days of the ultrasound.  Now, with the ultrasound it is so obvious that we have got something  precious, created by God that we are destroying. But even before the  ultrasound, the average American understood how barbaric this was, and  virtually every State barred abortion.   We can only hope that the arguments across the street are the  beginning of the march back of the United States towards the God- fearing Nation it was intended to be.
