 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of my bill, H.R.  5916, the Wounded Warrior Access Act.   When veterans file claims to the VA, they are given what is called a  c-file. My office has heard from countless numbers of veterans who have  had trouble accessing these c-files through the VA's outdated and  antiquated system. Our veterans need these files in order to access  benefits that they have earned or appeal the VA's decisions about their  claims.   That is why, Mr. Speaker, this legislation is so important. The  veterans in the Inland Empire and across this country need an easy way  to access  [[Page H7796]]  their information without jumping through these hoops. My bill is a  commonsense solution that updates an antiquated system.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Takano and members of the House  Veterans' Affairs Committee for their leadership in bringing this bill  to the floor, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting ``aye'' on  H.R. 5916.                            ____________________
