 Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the gentlewoman on her  chairmanship and I look forward to working with her.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation. It is high time  to stop the Biden administration from continuing to provide China with  oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.   Under the current administration we have only seen a war against  domestic energy production. As a Band-Aid to cover up the consequences  of Biden's policies, resulting in unprecedented high energy prices, it  chooses to draw down the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a critical  national security asset. Drawing down these reserves to cover up failed  policies is wrong but doing it and then selling that oil to China, our  chief adversary, is un-American, in my opinion.
