 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2825.  This critical piece of legislation is a chance for Congress to fulfill  its duty to oversee the missions, programs, and functions of the  Department of Homeland Security and its component agencies.   As chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation and Protective  Security, I am particularly pleased to support the important provisions  of this bill relating to the Transportation Security Administration and  the Secret Service.   This bill will make measurable and lasting improvements to the way in  which we protect the traveling public on both aviation and surface  transportation systems. It also provides much-needed leadership and  continuity to TSA by establishing a 5-year term for its administrator.   Specifically, the bill provides important streamlining of TSA  functions and offices; improves the vetting of aviation workers;  enhances emergency preparedness at airports to protect against  terrorist attacks and active shooters; and bolsters the Department's  focus on aviation cybersecurity issues.   Passing this legislation will ensure that TSA is prioritizing the  development and procurement of new passenger screening technologies and  ramping of deployment of explosives detection canines for both aviation  and surface transportation sectors.
