 Mr. Chairman, I just want to say to my colleague from  Michigan: Hundreds of thousands of people are going to lose their  insurance under a plan that was agreed to by the Republican Governor,  and I will send you the numbers in your district.   Mr. Chairman, the Republican effort to repeal the ACA, causing 30  million Americans to lose their health insurance, is built on a  foundation of misrepresentations and falsehoods. Yesterday, the Speaker  said the Affordable Care Act is collapsing. It is not. Nationwide,  enrollment is higher than it is has ever been, and the percentage of  Americans without health insurance is at the lowest level on record.   What is collapsing is the time for Republicans to move beyond their  rhetoric and come up with a plan. They say they will produce a  comprehensive replacement, but they have been saying that for 7 years.   Mr. Neal is here. Seven years, Mr. Neal, we have been hearing that.   Those files on the Republican desk--I wish you would raise them  again--aren't a plan. They are a ploy.   Republicans say repealing the Affordable Care Act will help people,  and there is at least a sliver of truth to that claim. The GOP repeal  bill will help millionaires, providing them an average tax cut of over  $50,000 a year. At the same time, it will actually raise taxes on  millions of moderate and middle-income families who will lose tax  credits for purchasing health insurance.
