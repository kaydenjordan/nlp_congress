 Mr. President, first of all, I wish to thank my friend  the Senator from Michigan for her comments and her views on this  nominee.   I rise today to add my voice to those expressing concern about the  nomination of Betsy DeVos to serve as U.S. Secretary of Education. The  chorus of concerns not only comes from those colleagues who have  already come to the floor last week or earlier today or throughout the  evening and into tomorrow morning, but it also comes from literally  tens of thousands of my constituents who have contacted me about Mrs.  DeVos. I have been flooded with phone calls, emails, and social media  messages from Virginians all across the Commonwealth, in many ways, in  numbers that I haven't seen since the debate about the ACA. These  Virginians worry about Mrs. DeVos's confirmation. They worry about what  it would mean for our children, our students, and for progress toward  improving and providing every child with a quality public education  regardless of their ZIP Code.   Like many of my colleagues, I bring to the debate some direct  experience as both a State and local elected official. I had the great  honor of serving as Governor of Virginia. I was responsible in that job  for how we were preparing our students for success in college and in  the workforce. I took that responsibility very personally.   As somebody who attended good public schools all of my life, as  somebody who was lucky enough to be the first in my family to graduate  from college, I realized that I wouldn't have been able to have been  Governor or, for that matter, obviously, Senator without that  foundation I received from my education. Those public schools--and I  had the opportunity to go to public schools in three different States  growing up, and many of those public school teachers were the folks who  framed my views about government, about our system, about how we  actually get through in life.   I believe in many ways public schools and the whole notion of public  education really form the cornerstone of what is the social contract in  America--that getting that basic public education is the right of all  individuals. When I think back on everything I was able to accomplish  as Virginia's Governor, the validation I valued the most was that when  I left the Governor's office in 2006, Virginia was consistently  recognized by independent validators as the Nation's best State for a  lifetime of educational opportunity from pre-K to college and beyond.   So as someone who is committed to reforming and looking at how we can  make sure our public education can work for all, as someone who spent a  career before in business and tried working in a philanthropic sense on  how we could expand educational opportunities, I believe I bring some  experience to this debate. That is why I stand here today unable to  support the nomination of Betsy DeVos to serve as Secretary of  Education.   To put it simply, Mrs. DeVos's single-minded focus on charter  schools, on vouchers, and on converting Federal education dollars into  a different program is simply out of step with the education climate in  the Commonwealth of Virginia. Let me make clear that I have supported  public charter schools. I believe they are a tool that ought to be in  the toolkit. I have taken on those forces who stand for simply no  reform in education. But I am unconvinced that Mrs. DeVos's complete  setting of different priorities at the Federal level is in the best  interest of our students, our teachers, or our public schools. That is  exactly what I have been hearing from constituents all over the State,  and I would like to very briefly share some of those concerns I have  heard.   Laura from my hometown of Alexandria writes this:         While many of our . . . President's cabinet picks worry me,       none worry me more than Betsy DeVos for Secretary of       Education.    She says:         I come from rural Appalachia, where [I] worked my way       through public school in one of the poorest counties in the       country, but that didn't stop me from ending up here in       Northern Virginia working for the intelligence community.        In areas like my hometown, where public schools are the       only option, they become the lifeblood of a community. . . .       On limited resources, our high school had to get creative       about how to provide for the students, often partnering with       the local university. But shutting the school down in favor       of charters, or adding a for-profit alternative, definitely       wasn't an option in my low-income area.    Another letter from a school administrator from the Shenandoah Valley  says this:         At her confirmation hearing it was quite clear she had no       knowledge of instruction, curriculum, federal programs and--      most disturbing--had no understanding of the federal laws       that are in place to protect children with disabilities.        It is a serious business to educate children, and the       consequences are huge if we do it wrong.    Another comment--and again, these are just samples of thousands--is  from Olivia, a teacher in Williamsburg, who shared this:         I see so much potential in my students every day, and I       feel very energetic as a young teacher about the       opportunities that I know our public schools are providing       already--and are capable of providing in the future.    She said:         I am concerned for my LGBT students, low-income students,       and for the future of myself and my colleagues as public       school educators trying to do good for our students.    I have received thousands of similar heartfelt messages from every  corner of Virginia. I welcome this level of public attention and  citizen engagement.   Sometimes, as the President's nominees have come forward, I voted for  many of them, much to the consternation of some folks. But it is my job  to weigh, regardless of that public opinion, what I think is best for  students in Virginia and, for that matter, students across the country.   With this outpouring from teachers, parents, students,  administrators, civil rights groups, charter school proponents and  opponents, and from both sides of the political aisle, I believe it  does weigh. That is what I have done. I have listened to my  constituents, but more importantly, I have listened to Mrs. DeVos's own  words before the Senate HELP Committee, and let me say that I still  have a lot of unresolved questions after reviewing Mrs. DeVos's  testimony.   For starters, Mrs. DeVos did not demonstrate that she understood the  Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, IDEA. She didn't  understand that it is actually a Federal law passed by Congress and  signed by President George H.W. Bush, contrary to the impression Mrs.  DeVos seemed to have at her confirmation hearing, saying that somehow  complying with IDEA was simply a voluntary measure. That is not right,  it is not the law, and, boy oh boy, did that frighten a whole lot of  parents whose kids have special needs and without IDEA, would not have  those needs met. They are concerned that Mrs. DeVos's seeming lack of  familiarity with IDEA is indicative of how, if confirmed, her  Department of Education would fail to protect the rights of these  children--and every child--toward a free and appropriate public  education that allows even kids with special needs to flourish.   Another area under the Department of Education's jurisdiction where I  have concerns about Mrs. DeVos's commitment and level of understanding  is campus sexual assault compliance and enforcement. Since 2014, I have  been proud to support bipartisan legislation led by my colleagues,  Senator Gillibrand and Senator McCaskill, the Campus Accountability and  Safety Act. At the end of last Congress, this legislation had the  support of more than one-third of the U.S. Senate, as well as a broad  coalition of advocacy groups, law enforcement organizations, and many  of our leading colleges and universities. The Department of Education's  own Office of Civil Rights has also played a very important role in  initiating and in conducting title IX investigations. So you can  understand why so many folks, including myself, were concerned when  Mrs. DeVos did not demonstrate any depth of knowledge about the  difference of opinion surrounding particular policy issues related to  campus sexual assault.   Similarly, when asked about a basic principle of education policy  related to measuring student achievement, Mrs. DeVos was not able to  articulate an understanding of the difference between growth and  proficiency.  [[Page S710]]    In the same vein--and while this has become the subject of late night  comedy, I think it is a very serious matter--Mrs. DeVos was not able to  clearly express her understanding or her commitment to enforcing the  Gun-Free School Zones Act, which, again, is Federal legislation, also  signed by President Bush, where compliance is not optional.   These are fundamental tenets of Federal education policy, not some  obscure metrics, not small bills that languish in committee or small  compromises. These are the principles and cornerstones of Federal  education civil rights policy, and they cannot be more central to the  Secretary of Education's core responsibilities of safeguarding  students' civil rights and safety.   For all of those reasons and others, I am not able to support Mrs.  DeVos's nomination to be Secretary of Education.   I know the Presiding Officer has had to hear a number of these  comments. I hope that if she is not confirmed, the President will send  down an Education Secretary nominee who brings more mainstream views to  this very important issue. There are those of us, like me, who are all  for education reform, but it has to be led by someone who will always  put the needs of our kids first, and making sure they get a fair and  appropriate education is guaranteed.   With that, I yield the floor.    First of all, Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the  Senator from Vermont, for his statement, and remarkably, the events of  the last 24 hours, with Senator Warren's comments and now Senator  Sanders' comments and others, and the fact that it is now out there-- using social media, this letter has now reached this morning more than  5 million Americans. I know that Senator Sanders' comments this morning  continue to expand, reaching Americans. And out of every challenge  comes an opportunity--the opportunity to make sure more Americans hear  the very powerful words and her rationale against Senator Sessions I  think was very important, and so I thank him for his work.    Mr. President, I also rise today to voice my concerns  about Senator Jeff Sessions to serve as U.S. Attorney General. While I  respect Senator Sessions' public service, I cannot and will not support  his nomination.   I also rise to raise the concerns of thousands of my constituents who  have contacted me about Senator Sessions. These Virginians worry about  what his confirmation would mean for the rights of all Virginians and  all Americans.   Senator Sessions' long record of opposing bipartisan, commonsense  policies relating to voting rights, anti-discrimination, domestic  violence, and criminal justice reform leads me to conclude that he is  not the right person to serve as Attorney General.   I would like to take a couple of minutes--and I know I have my friend  the Senator from Minnesota coming after me--to talk about five areas of  concern I have with his nomination.   First, voting rights. In 2013, the Supreme Court ruled in Shelby  County v. Holder to gut a key section of the Voting Rights Act. Senator  Sessions applauded that decision which eroded voter access and  protection in several States once covered by the preclearance  provisions in the Voting Rights Act. Those States included the  Commonwealth of Virginia. Moreover, he has failed to support important  legislation that would restore those protections.   The bipartisan legislation, the Voting Rights Advancement Act, was  introduced last Congress and would serve to once again protect our  Nation's hard-fought equal access to the ballot. I was proud to  cosponsor this bill and remain committed to working with my colleagues  to put a fair process in place that ensures our elections are open to  all. Senator Sessions unfortunately opposed this legislation.   The second area is nondiscrimination. I also have concerns about  Senator Sessions' record on a broad range of anti-discrimination  provisions. He was one of only four Senators to oppose an amendment in  the Judiciary Committee that would have reaffirmed the principle that  the United States does not discriminate against immigrants on the basis  of religion--an issue that unfortunately has reared its head most  recently by the President's action.   He opposed the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which codifies  protection for LGBTQ Americans, and denies the reality that too many of  our LGBTQ neighbors still face down discrimination and hatred every  day.   While nearly two-thirds of the Senate voted for the Matthew Shepard  and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act in 2009, Senator  Sessions stated this instead: ``I'm not sure that women or people with  different sexual orientations face that kind of discrimination. I just  don't see it.''   From opposing the DREAM Act, to opposing the repeal of don't ask,  don't tell, Senator Sessions' views are well outside of the mainstream.   The third area is the Violence Against Women Act. In 2013, Senator  Sessions voted against reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act.  This landmark legislation, originally drafted in 1994, provides crucial  protections and resources for the investigation and prosecution of  violent crimes against women. The 2013 reauthorization bill updated  those programs within the Department of Justice and extended resources  and protections to additional populations, such as those in same-sex  relationships. That bill passed with the support of a large bipartisan  majority in the Senate, including a majority of the Republican caucus.  However, Senator Sessions opposed the entire bill due to concerns about  one provision in the legislation related to domestic violence against  Indians on tribal lands.   We in the Senate have all on occasion been faced with legislation  that contains one or more provisions that we have concerns about or  would not have included in the legislation. Yet my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle can attest that we very often strike compromises to  get important legislation over the finish line. Oftentimes the sign of  a good bill is when not one of us gets 100 percent of what we may have  wanted. Opposing a much broader, commonsense bipartisan bill meant to  reduce violence and protect domestic violence victims calls into  question Senator Sessions' commitment to administering these important  programs at the Department of Justice.   Fourth, various sentencing reforms. There is broad, bipartisan  recognition in the Senate that our broken criminal justice system is  badly in need of reform. Likewise, there is bipartisan support for  updating outdated statutes that tie judges' hands and often force them  to hand down overly punitive mandatory minimum sentences. Yet last year  Senator Sessions again was one of only five Republicans on the  Judiciary Committee to vote against this bipartisan criminal justice  reform legislation, of which I am a proud cosponsor, the Sentencing  Reform and Corrections Act.   There is overwhelming support both in this body and among the  American public for reforming a broken justice system and giving  thousands of Americans a second chance to be productive members of  society. I believe that Senator Sessions' views on criminal justice are  at odds with what the American people want and at odds with the basic  principles of fairness and equality under law that are supposed to be  the hallmark of our Nation's justice system.   Finally, on the question of independence, I am concerned that Senator  Sessions won't be sufficiently independent to execute the  responsibilities of Attorney General effectively. Doing this job the  way our Founding Fathers intended requires a certain level of  impartiality to fully and independently enforce our laws and protect  the rights of the disenfranchised. Senator Sessions has said achieving  this level of neutrality means saying no to the President sometimes.   This is one area in which I agree with my colleague and very much  want to  [[Page S918]]  take him at his word; however, given his vocal, partisan support for  President Donald Trump and his refusal to commit in his confirmation  hearing to fully enforce certain laws, I am not convinced that Senator  Sessions is fully prepared to faithfully execute this new set of  responsibilities with the amount of independence that the job demands.   Again, I stress that the main duties of serving as Attorney General  include enforcing our Nation's laws and by doing so, protecting the  civil rights of all Americans. That is the most basic tenet of being  Attorney General. Given Senator Sessions' long record of opposing many  of these fundamental laws that protect civil rights and equality for  all, I have grave concerns about him fulfilling and taking this  position.   For these reasons, I am unable to support Senator Sessions'  nomination to be Attorney General, and I encourage my colleagues to  take these concerns under consideration as we move toward a final vote  on this nomination.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
