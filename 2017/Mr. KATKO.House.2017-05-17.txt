 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 2169) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to enhance  information sharing in the Department of Homeland Security State,  Local, and Regional Fusion Center Initiative, and for other purposes,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2169         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Improving Fusion Centers'       Access to Information Act''.       SEC. 2. ENHANCED INFORMATION SHARING IN THE DEPARTMENT OF                     HOMELAND SECURITY STATE, LOCAL, AND REGIONAL                     FUSION CENTER INITIATIVE.         Subsection (b) of section 210A of the Homeland Security Act       of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 124h) is amended--        (1) in paragraph (2), by inserting before the semicolon at       the end the following: ``and conduct outreach to such fusion       centers to identify any gaps in information sharing and       consult with other Federal agencies to develop methods to       address such gaps, as appropriate'';        (2) by redesignating paragraphs (3) through (12) as       paragraphs (4) through (13), respectively; and        (3) by inserting after paragraph (2) the following new       paragraph:        ``(3) identify Federal databases and datasets, including       databases and datasets used, operated, or managed by       Department components, the Federal Bureau of Investigation,       and the Department of the Treasury, that are appropriate, in       accordance with Federal laws and policies, to address any       gaps identified pursuant to paragraph (2), for inclusion in       the information sharing environment and coordinate with the       appropriate Federal agency to deploy or access such databases       and datasets;''.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Katko) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Vela) each will  control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from New York?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from New York?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2169, the Improving Fusion  Centers' Access to Information Act.   In the years since 9/11, Congress and the executive branch have taken  many steps to address information shortfalls and information-sharing  shortfalls. However, we know that silos remain.   The purpose of H.R. 2169 is to ensure that the Department of Homeland  Security is truly serving as a State and local information-sharing  advocate, as originally intended by the Homeland Security Act.   This bill requires the DHS to regularly review information-sharing  efforts with the National Network of Fusion Centers and then work with  other Federal agencies to close any identified gaps.   State and local fusion centers have grown in maturity and number  during the last 16 years since 9/11. There are now 78 fusion centers  within the national network. As the network has matured, fusion centers  have established themselves as a critical conduit  [[Page H4270]]  for sharing terrorism, homeland security, and criminal information with  Federal, State, local, tribal, and territorial partners. As the threat  environment continues to evolve, it is vital they have access to the  tools and information systems to stay ahead of threats to the homeland.   Despite existing requirements for DHS to share intelligence and  information with State and local entities, I have found that the  Department does not regularly assess if fusion centers have access to  necessary information or databases held by other Federal agencies. H.R.  2169 addresses this deficiency by requiring the Secretary to conduct  outreach to the fusion centers to identify information-sharing gaps and  work with the appropriate Federal agencies to address these gaps.   Additionally, the Secretary is required to identify Federal databases  and datasets that should be included in the information-sharing  environment and coordinate with the appropriate Federal agency to  deploy such systems.   H.R. 2169 includes input from the fusion centers, Department of  Homeland Security, and other Federal agencies.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the National  Fusion Center Association, and I am pleased they have endorsed the  bill.                                                     National Fusion                                              Center Association,                                                     April 28, 2017.      Re Support for H.R. 2169--Improving Fusion Centers' Access to           Information Act.       Hon. John Katko,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Katko: On behalf of the National Fusion       Center Association (NFCA), I write in support of your       legislation--H.R. 2169--to enhance information sharing and       analysis among fusion centers and federal agencies by       encouraging appropriate fusion center access to federally       managed information systems. As you know, the National       Network of Fusion Centers (NNFC) is a focal point for       analytical collaboration and information sharing on threats       to public safety among federal, local, state, territorial,       and tribal public safety agencies.        The NFCA has worked closely with DHS, the FBI, and other       partners to develop strong information sharing pathways. We       have made significant strides to improve daily working       relationships with our federal partners. The flow of       information from state and local public safety agencies to       appropriate federal agencies continues to improve, and the       same is true with information coming from federal agencies to       local and state jurisdictions. We are also seeing enhanced       analytical collaboration.        Still, challenges remain that should be addressed. Your       legislation will provide important support in this effort by       encouraging improved access to data from federally managed       information systems that our analysts need to do their jobs       in the most effective manner possible. It is crucial for       Congress to consistently support a strong information sharing       environment, and this legislation would assist in that       effort.        We appreciate your dedication to effective information       sharing and analysis and look forward to working with you to       move your legislation forward and accomplish our shared       mission of protecting America.            Sincerely,                                                         Mike Sena,                                                         President.     Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to report that H.R. 2169 is  a very bipartisan bill that passed the Committee on Homeland Security  unanimously.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the measure, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2169.   Before I close, I want to note that I routinely engage in bipartisan  efforts on behalf of Homeland Security with Congressman Vela and  others. The committee works in a very bipartisan manner to do what is  best for this country to keep it safe, and this bill is one of those  bills that helps keep our country safe.   It is critical that we ensure the proper flow of information to all  law enforcement agencies, that they properly use that information, and  that they have access to it on a regular basis no matter whether they  are a local police officer who is working at a fusion center or whether  it is an FBI agent. Everyone should have access to that information  because we are all on the same team to keep this country safe.   I think our bipartisan efforts that we engage in with Homeland  Security on a regular basis are a good example of the good things that  happen in Congress. I am proud to be a part it, and I am proud to have  Mr. Vela as my colleague on that as well.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland  Security Committee, I rise in support of H.R. 2169. the ``Improving  Fusion Centers Access to Information Act of 2017,'' which would enhance  information sharing in the Department of Homeland Security State, Local  and Regional Fusion Center Initiative.   This bill requires outreach to be conducted to fusion centers in  order to identify gaps in information sharing and consultation with  other Federal agencies to develop methods to address such gaps.   Additionally, it requires the DHS Secretary to coordinate with the  heads of other federal departments and agencies to provide operational  and intelligence advice to fusion centers and support their efforts to  operate efficiently and effectively.   H.R. 2169 requires the Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis  (I&A) to ensure fusion centers have access to Homeland Security  information sharing centers and that DHS personnel are deployed to  support fusion centers in a manner consistent with the department's  mission and statutory limits.   Fusion centers provide the means to local, state, and tribal law  enforcement to bring together information from distributed federal and  private sector sources for the purpose of collection, retention,  analysis, and dissemination. The term fusion centers first coined by  the Department of Defense (DOD) refer to the fusing of information for  analysis purposes.   The Houston Regional Intelligence Service Center is a Fusion Center.   The mission of the Houston Regional Intelligence Service Center is to  provide security to the Houston area by gathering, developing and  sharing intelligence regarding the capabilities, intentions, and  actions of terrorist groups and individuals which pose threats.   Houston hosted the 51st Super Bowl earlier this year and the Houston  Regional Intelligence Service Center was on duty for this major  national event.   This year's Super Bowl had:   10,000--volunteers;   140,000--visitors; and   1 million--people who participated in at least one Super Bowl event.   The Super Bowl took place free of incidents, which is a testament to  the collaborative work of federal, state, and local law enforcement  through the Houston Fusion Center.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is not only good for our country, but it also  will greatly benefit the citizens of Houston, Texas.  [[Page H4271]]    If local law enforcement is given the proper resources, information,  and intelligence, they will know how to properly handle terrorism  threats.   H.R. 2169 will strengthen our economy while keeping our fellow  citizens safe.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in supporting H.R. 2169  because the safety of citizens from potential threats is critical to  the security of the homeland and strength of our economy.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Duncan of Tennessee). The question is on  the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) that the  House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2169, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 2281) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to reauthorize  the Border Enforcement Security Task Force program within the  Department of Homeland Security, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2281         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Border Enforcement Security       Task Force Reauthorization Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. MODIFIED INSTRUCTIONS.         (a) Updated Considerations for the Establishment of       Units.--Paragraph (2) of section 432(c) of the Homeland       Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 240(c)) is amended--        (1) in the matter preceding subparagraph (A), by striking       ``the Secretary shall consider'' and inserting ``the       Secretary shall apply risk-based criteria that takes into       consideration''; and        (2) in subparagraph (A), by inserting before the semicolon       the following: ``, including threats posed by transnational       criminal organizations'';        (3) in subparagraph (C), by striking ``and'' after the       semicolon;        (4) in subparagraph (D), by striking the period at the end       and inserting ``; and''; and        (5) by adding at the end the following new subparagraphs:        ``(E) the extent to which the BEST unit would advance the       Department's homeland and border security strategic       priorities and related objectives; and        ``(F) whether departmental Joint Task Force operations as       established pursuant to section 708 and other joint cross-      border initiatives would be enhanced, improved, or otherwise       assisted by the BEST unit to be established.''.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and  include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from New York?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and  include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from New York?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 2281, the Border  Enforcement Security Task Force Reauthorization Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, we are living in unprecedented times. A quick glance of  recent headlines shows that our Nation is suffering from the largest  heroin epidemic in the history of the United States. In fact, just last  week, Bloomberg Businessweek reported that heroin has become so  pervasive in our cities and so profitable for the cartels that supply  it that even our local law enforcement officers are disheartened and  admit that sporadic street-level arrests seem to have little to no  effect.   Recently, in my district and because of the hard work of our men and  women in law enforcement, we witnessed the dismantling of a large-scale  organization. News reports indicate 52 individuals are facing charges  for about 370 crimes, including operating as drug dealers and  traffickers.   Mr. Speaker, if these individuals had not been stopped, their  nefarious activities would have broken the dreams of children across  America, and their criminal enterprise would have caused millions in  economic loss through increased incarceration, rehab, and medical  expenses. If they had not been stopped, their actions would have  continued to introduce poison into our communities and shattered lives.   Even worse, a recent trend shows that the heroin hitting our streets  is becoming more lethal as drug cartels have now begun lacing heroin  with fentanyl, a synthetic opioid making doses more addictive and  cheaper to produce.   I might add parenthetically that, for 20 years as a Federal  prosecutor, I prosecuted every possible drug organization known to man.  I have never seen anything with the lethality that is heroin.   This epidemic is, in large part, due to the stream of illegal  narcotics that is flowing across our Nation's borders. However, there  are steps that can be taken to shut down these illicit pathways.  Thankfully, there is a Federal task force dedicated to this singular  purpose.   In 2005, in response to the increase in violence along the southwest  border of Mexico, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,  Homeland Security Investigations, in partnership with U.S. Customs and  Border Protection, as well as other Federal, State, local, and  international law enforcement officials, created what is known as BEST,  the Border Enforcement Security Task Force.   To date, a total of 44 BEST units have been deployed across 16 States  and in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. My home State of New York is  well served by three BEST teams, two of which are situated on the  northern border and one of which I helped stand up in Massena, New  York.   Nationwide, BEST teams comprise over 1,000 members who represent over  100 law enforcement agencies that have committed to jointly investigate  transnational criminal activity along the southwest and northern  borders and at our Nation's major seaports.   Since inception, their collective efforts have initiated more than  10,654 investigations which have resulted in almost 13,000 criminal  arrests, the seizure of 1.2 million pounds of narcotics, and more than  $130 million. The street value of 1.2 million pounds of narcotics is  astronomical.   This is an impressive feat by any measure; however, as we are  considering reauthorizing this important task force, it is important to  highlight where there is some room for improvement. Every Congress  looks at existing programs and makes adjustments when needed. That is  exactly what we are proposing to do here today.  [[Page H4272]]    Of the 44, total, BEST units, 20 of them are designated by Homeland  Security Investigations as having a maritime security focus. While the  Coast Guard provides critical support to Federal, State, and local  partners through a majority of the maritime BESTs, not every maritime  BEST is currently benefiting from Coast Guard participation.   This bill mandates the participation of both a Coast Guard  Investigative Service special agent and a uniformed Coast Guard  intelligence officer on every maritime BEST. By utilizing both  plainclothes investigators and uniformed intelligence officers, BEST  will be able to partner with the Coast Guard in ongoing criminal  investigations and the generation of actionable maritime intelligence.   The Coast Guard is the only agency within DHS that is also an  independent member of the intelligence community. This unique position,  coupled with the fact that the Coast Guard has unparalleled maritime  domain awareness through daily interaction with mariners and facility  operators, makes it imperative that they are included in all maritime  BESTS in a mandatory fashion.   As we find ourselves halfway through Police Week this week, I want to  take a second to pause and thank the men and women of law enforcement  throughout this great Nation--many of whom I have stood side by side  with for over 20 years--for all they do in keeping our country safe.   I would also like to thank the ranking member, Mr. Vela, for  introducing this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support the law  enforcement community and vote in favor of reauthorizing this important  task force.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.           House of Representatives, Committee on Transportation and             Infrastructure,                                      Washington, DC, May 15, 2017.      Hon. Michael T. McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul: I write concerning H.R. 2281, the       Border Enforcement Security Task Force Reauthorization Act of       2017. This legislation includes matters that I believe fall       within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on       Transportation and Infrastructure.        In order to expedite floor consideration of H.R. 2281, the       Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure agrees to       forgo action on this bill. However, this is conditional on       our mutual understanding that forgoing consideration of the       bill would not prejudice the Committee with respect to the       appointment of conferees or to any future jurisdictional       claim over the subject matters contained in the bill or       similar legislation that fall within the Committee's Rule X       jurisdiction. I request you urge the Speaker to name members       of the Committee to any conference committee named to       consider such provisions.        Please place a copy of this letter and your response       acknowledging our jurisdictional interest into the       Congressional Record during consideration of the measure on       the House floor.            Sincerely,                                                      Bill Shuster,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Homeland Security,                                       Washington, DC, May 15, 2017.      Hon. Bill Shuster,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Shuster: Thank you for your letter regarding       H R 2281, the ``Border Enforcement Security Task Force       Reauthorization Act of 2017''. I appreciate your support in       bringing this legislation before the House of       Representatives. I understand that the Committee on       Transportation and Infrastructure, will not seek a sequential       referral on the bill. We appreciate your cooperation in this       matter.        The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual       understanding that the decision not to seek a sequential       referral on this bill at this time does not prejudice any       claim the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure may       have on this legislation or similar legislation in the       future.        I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional       Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor.       I thank you for your cooperation in this matter.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael T. McCAUL,                          Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to adopt this  legislation.   I want to note that, back in the mid-nineties when I was starting out  my career as a Federal organized crime prosecutor, I was set on the  border in El Paso, Texas, and I had a frontline view, as I was going  after cartel-level drug traffickers back then, of just what a problem  the border is.   Many people think of the border's primary problem being illegal  aliens, but I can tell you firsthand--and I think my colleague from  Texas will agree with me--that drug trafficking remains a gigantic  issue, and the poison that is killing our kids is streaming across the  southwest border in particular.  [[Page H4273]]    It is imperative that bills like this continue. It is imperative that  Congressman Vela, Congresswoman McSally, and the others on their  subcommittee continue their great work identifying issues along the  border, both north and south, and that the BEST concept continues and,  indeed, hopefully, expands in the future. Targeted law enforcement that  involves people on both sides of the border and law enforcement is the  only way we are ever going to solve this problem. I commend them for  their work on this.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2281 the  ``Border Enforcement Security Task Force Reauthorization Act of 2017.''   As a Senior Member on the House Committee on Homeland Security; and  former Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Border and Maritime  Security, I know well the importance of protecting our nation's  borders.   I thank my colleague Congressman Vela for sponsoring this bipartisan  legislation, which reauthorizes the Border Enforcement Security Task  Force (BEST) program.   An escalation in drug trafficking and transnational criminal activity  along our nation's southern border has led to record levels of violence  and drug trafficking-related homicides.   Despite significant efforts to combat the drug trade, many  governments in the region suffer from overwhelmed criminal justice  systems and law enforcement agencies.   There must be a multi-pronged approach to solving the drug crisis in  the United States, it must include treatment upon demand; education;  increase resources for border interdiction and seizure of illicit drugs  and advanced technology to detect and track those who may be engaged in  illegal activity along the border.   The Border Enforcement Security Task Force is accomplishing the  important law enforcement component of border security.   The Border Enforcement Security Task Force achieves its goal of  border security enhancement by facilitating collaboration among  federal, state, local, tribal, and foreign law enforcement agencies to  execute coordinated activities in furtherance of border security and  homeland security; and enhancing information-sharing, including the  dissemination of homeland security information among such agencies.   The BEST program is currently administered by DHS, and involves  information sharing and law-enforcement operations between personnel  from federal, state, local, tribal, and foreign law-enforcement  agencies to combat criminal activity near the United States borders.   This program has established teams of law enforcement agents from  over 100 law enforcement agencies that form units to investigate  transnational criminal activity.   This approach supports better cooperation and collaboration among  federal, state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies when  investigating criminal activity along the southwest and northern  borders, as well as at the nation's major seaports.   Since their inception, BEST Units have collectively initiated more  than 10,654 cases.   These actions have resulted in more than:   2,718 criminal arrests   7,245 administrative arrests   110,711 pounds of cocaine   5,517 pounds of ecstasy   1,764 pounds of heroin   1,036,749 pounds of marijuana   6,325 pounds of methamphetamine   2,988,561 rounds of ammunition   4,657 vehicles   $130.2 million in U.S. currency   15,062 weapons   This bill instructs the Secretary of Homeland Security to also  consider:   The cross-border threats posed by transnational criminal  organizations;   The Department's homeland and border security strategic priorities;  and   The departmental Joint Task Forces and other multi-agency cross- border operations when establishing new BEST Units.   In addition, this bill would update the Secretary's existing  reporting requirement to provide an assessment of how BEST Units  enhance information-sharing among law enforcement partners, coordinate  with Departmental Joint Task Forces, and advance the Department's  homeland and border security strategic priorities.   This legislation will improve and update the information sharing  practices between our law enforcement agencies so they will operate in  a cohesive manner.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2281 the BEST  program because it had proven throughout the years to improve our  border security, along with improving how our law enforcement agencies  operate and share vital information.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 2281, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
