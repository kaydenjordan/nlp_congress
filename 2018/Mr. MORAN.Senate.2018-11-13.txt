 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise this evening to pay tribute to a  longtime member of my staff. Will Ruder has served Kansans for 11 years  and counting, including the last 2 years as legislative director in our  office here in Washington. It is always difficult to say goodbye to our  staff, but for many reasons, it will be uniquely difficult to replace  Will.   Will grew up in a small, Western Kansas town called Plainville. If  that sounds familiar to any of the folks back home, it is because  Plainville is my home town as well.   Eleven years ago, I weighed two strong applicants for an internship  opening in my office. As I recall, the first candidate had attended an  east coast private school and was recommended by multiple individuals.  The second was a young man from Plainville, whose parents ran a gas  station and who was immediately approachable, down-to-earth, and eager  to serve Kansans. Perhaps it goes without saying that in choosing Will  11 years ago, I made a right decision.   Will's Plainville roots and the values instilled by his family,  hometown neighbors, and friends kept him grounded during his service in  our Nation's Capital.   My ability to work on behalf of Kansans is greatly enhanced when  dedicated individuals who care about our home State are there by my  side.   I have often told my staff that I am an enabler. I enable them to do  more for our State. I can think of no staffer who better epitomizes and  articulates the reason I am here today as a U.S. Senator, working to  preserve the rural way of life and the American dream for the next  generation, than Will Ruder.   Just last week, this resonated with me in a powerful way. A short bus  ride north from Hays is Plainville. My staff and I were in Hays on our  staff retreat, and we made a surprise pit stop to Ruder Oil Company to  visit Will's parents, John and Karla. It was a special moment for our  staff to pay tribute to the Ruder family and to Will, the oldest of six  Ruder children.   As a light rain fell, Will shared what it meant to come full circle  back to his roots and why the work that we do in our Nation's Capital  is so important to ensuring that rural America remains alive and well,  particularly at a time when the American dream is seemingly becoming  harder and harder to achieve.   As a policy adviser and legislative director, Will has accomplished a  great deal on behalf of Kansans. A few weeks after I was sworn in as a  Senator, it was Will who drafted the resolution honoring Kansas's 150th  birthday.   In response to a devastating gas explosion in Hutchinson, KS, which  took the lives of two Kansans and destroyed half a block of downtown  businesses,  [[Page S6907]]  Will spent years working to pass legislation to allow Kansans to  restore safety inspections of underground gas storage facilities.   Will was intimately involved in numerous banking, energy and water  infrastructure victories for Kansans and almost always on a bipartisan  basis.   I always say that if I have to lose good staffers, I hope it is  because they are returning to Kansas. For Will, perhaps that was  inevitable, but for the past several months, Will has had the  unfortunate existence of working States away from his wife and kids,  who made the preemptive move to Overland Park, KS, when his wife Liz  received an exciting job opportunity.   I am happy for Will, and I know he is ecstatic to have a chance to  move home, spend time with Liz, and watch his two children, Miriam and  Leo, grow up.   Today I want to thank Will Ruder of Plainville, KS. Thank you, Will,  for spending 11 years of your life in our Nation's Capital, trying to  make things better, and for the way you have always conducted yourself  on my behalf and on behalf of Kansans back home.   Whether you believe it or not, you have left a significant mark on  this place, on our office, and on me, and your presence will be sorely  missed.                        Nomination of Michelle Bowman     Mr. President, tomorrow the Senate will consider Kansan  Michelle Bowman to serve on the Federal Board of Governors for the seat  reserved for a community banker or a community bank regulator. To  understand her qualifications, we should first look at the position for  which she has been nominated.   The original Federal Reserve Act requires appointments to the Board  to include a representative of the agriculture community. When Congress  further defined the Fed's representation, it created a specific seat  for someone with a community bank background, having either worked in  or supervised a community bank. Miki Bowman has done both.   Miki's experience as both Kansas State bank commissioner and her time  at Farmers and Drovers Bank in Council Grove, KS, satisfies both of  those statutory requirements, and she is even more qualified with her  impressive background in public service and the private sector. In  total, Miki Bowman has served as bank supervisor and regulator for  nearly 2 years and has been a community banker for 7 years.   Miki was nominated April 16, 2018, as a member of the Federal Reserve  Board of Governors as the Community Bank Representative for the  remainder of a 14-year term expiring January 31, 2020. If confirmed,  she will represent Region 8, the St. Louis region of Missouri, for the  Federal Reserve.   Miki will also be the first person nominated and confirmed by the  Senate to hold the seat specifically reserved for one member with  demonstrated primary experience working in or supervising community  banks. She would be one of seven members of the Board.   Miki's early years echo that of many Kansans. She attended the  University of Kansas to earn a bachelor's degree and then went on to  earn a law degree from Washburn University.   After graduation, Miki was called to public service where she served  in a variety of capacities, including as a staff member for Senator  Dole and counsel for several House committees, Director of  Congressional and Intergovernmental Affairs for FEMA, and a Deputy  Assistant Secretary and Policy Adviser at the Department of Homeland  Security Under Secretary Tom Ridge.   Following that, she and her husband moved to London, where Miki  consulted on government and public affairs.   Like many Kansans who love and appreciate our State, Miki made her  way back home. She returned to Council Grove to take the helm of the  family bank for the next 7 years. Far from London and Washington, DC,  Miki felt the need to return to her community to make a good life for  her children and to serve her community.   Once again called to public service, Miki was nominated by Kansas  Gov. Sam Brownback to serve as the Kansas bank commissioner, a position  she has held since February 2017 and still holds to this day.   Miki's experience as both Kansas State bank commissioner and her time  at Farmers and Drovers Bank in Council Grove satisfies both statutory  requirements with her impressive background in public service and the  private sector.   Community banks are an important part of communities and small cities  across the country. They extend credit for homes, small businesses, and  farm equipment, while also sponsoring Little League Baseball teams and  the school band.   In addition, Miki understands the role that relationships play in the  approach to business. In rural Kansas and across America, community  banks act as economic engines, leveraging relationships with local  community members that rely on trust and honesty.   Miki could tell story after story about the friendships and high  level of trust she has built with her customers. It is a different kind  of banking and one that will help make certain that rural America can  thrive well into the future.   I urge my colleagues to vote tomorrow in favor of Miki Bowman to  serve on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors so we can bring her  experience and unique perspectives to the Federal Reserve Board.   I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.
