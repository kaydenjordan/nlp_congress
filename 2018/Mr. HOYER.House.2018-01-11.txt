 Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.  McCarthy), my friend and the majority leader, for the purpose of  inquiring about the schedule for the week to come.   (Mr. McCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that information.   I presume the CR, or continuing resolution, is anticipated, as the  gentleman referenced. Is that accurate?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that.   Will that continuing resolution be clean, from the gentleman's  standpoint--that is to say, it will not include other items on it--or  does the gentleman have any anticipation that other items might be  included on that?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   Mr. Speaker, the gentleman and I had the opportunity to be at the  White House with the President earlier this week. He and I are  attempting to work on seeing if we can make sure that we protect our  DREAMers. I think we saw a unanimous opinion in the White House among  the 17 Republicans and 7 or 8 Democrats who were there that it ought to  be done. I was pleased the President said that it ought to be done, and  ought to be done quickly. I appreciate the gentleman's efforts on that  score.   Obviously, we also need to do something with the Children's Health  Insurance Program. We have talked about that before.   We need to do something with respect to the supplemental for Puerto  Rico and the Virgin Islands, as well as Florida and Texas. Obviously,  we passed a supplemental here, and it did not pass in the Senate.  Hopefully, the Senate will address that, and we can address it coming  back across the aisle.   In addition, we are going to have to, as the gentleman referred to,  establish caps. We still, at this late hour, late date, do not have a  figure for the Appropriations Committee to use in terms of what they  will mark their bills to. You mentioned it, but does the gentleman have  any update or degree of confidence that will be done within the next  few days?    Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   Mr. Speaker, nobody has any intention, of course, of holding the  military hostage.   Secretary Mattis and his predecessors have all believed that a CR is  damaging to the military's ability to move forward and plan. I would  suggest to my friend, the majority leader, Mr. Speaker, that it is  equally damaging to the nondefense side of the budget. Administrators  and secretaries cannot plan for what resources they will have a month  out, 2 months out, or until September 30 and the end of the fiscal  year. Reaching agreement is important on both sides of the budget.   In addition, I would respectfully hope that we can pursue the policy  and agreement that we made and on which Speaker Ryan was a principal on  your side of the aisle and Senator Murray was the principal on our side  of the aisle and reached agreement on the parity of increase--not  parity of expenditures, because we spend more on defense, but parity of  increase. Mr. Speaker, I would hope we could pursue that. It would  accelerate agreement on how we are going forward.   I know the gentleman is going to be working on both of those efforts.  I appreciate that and look forward to working with him.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
