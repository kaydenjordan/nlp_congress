 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to condemn this  abhorrent legislation that will rip away protections from millions of  Americans. I am a breast cancer survivor. President Trump and our  Republican colleagues promised Americans like me that we would not be  discriminated against based on our preexisting conditions.   I am not sure if any Republicans actually know what it is like to  live every single day of your life waiting for the other shoe to drop,  but with this bill, you yank that peace of mind that we have with the  Affordable Care Act out from under us.   This bill would allow States to segregate sick people into separate,  inferior coverage and leave individuals exposed to catastrophic health  costs, benefit exclusions, and waiting lists. High-risk pools spin sick  people into a death spiral. Premiums go ever higher and coverage is  spotty.   I can only hope that my colleagues come to their senses before  inevitably handing so many Americans a death sentence. Make no mistake,  people will die as a result of this bill.
