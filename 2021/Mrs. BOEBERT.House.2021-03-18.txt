 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life of a  western Colorado legend and my dear friend, Harry Talbott of Palisade.   At his 2018 induction into the Colorado Agriculture Hall of Fame,  Harry remarked:   The world may little remember nor long note what we have done here  tonight, but our contributions to Colorado agriculture will live long  after we are gone and make it easier for those who come after us.   I am honored and blessed to have known Harry, as is western Colorado.   As the founder of one of Colorado's largest and oldest orchards,  Talbott Farms, his contributions to agriculture in Colorado cannot be  overstated.   Grown with snowmelt from the Grand Mesa, the Talbott name is  synonymous with the best peaches many will ever have the pleasure of  experiencing.   Along the way, he employed and mentored countless Coloradans, many of  whom remain in agriculture today with farms of their own.   Without Harry and his grandiose vision for Palisade, the Western  Slope wouldn't be the place that it is today. He is the giant whose  shoulders the community now stands upon.   However, I would be remiss to confine any tribute merely to Harry's  business endeavors because they are but a small piece of the man he  was.   Harry was the quintessential renaissance man. Harry was a veteran,  having served honorably in the United States Army. Harry was a science  teacher who invested in the hearts and minds of the children in our  communities.   Harry was a pioneer and an icon of Colorado's Third District, a man  whose character has been integral to that of the Western Slope.   Harry leaves behind his wife, Bonnie; his children, Bruce, Nathan,  Charlie, Dave, and Kathy; as well as numerous grandchildren and great- grandchildren.  [[Page H1504]]    I extend to them my heartfelt condolences and pray that God's holy  spirit will comfort them and mend their broken hearts. Today, we honor  a life of service.   Harry, we love you.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas, my good  friend, Congressman   Michael Cloud, for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, the Biden regime has focused all its time and energy on  benefiting those who have done it all wrong. Fascist governors imposed  draconian lockdowns and sent their States into economic disaster. So  Biden passed the blue State bailout.   Did you commit a felony? This administration wants you to vote.   And now this administration wants to give special privileges to those  breaking Federal law and crossing the southern border.   Mr. Speaker, it is past time that we fix the broken immigration  system and secure the border. That is my hard line. That means building  the wall, properly funding Border Patrol, and enforcing the laws we  have on the books--exactly what President Trump did, which led to  record low illegal crossings. This is the right and humane thing to do.   Getting children out of the hands of cartels and coyotes, and making  it clear that the American government will put those coming the right  way, the legal way, they will be rewarded. But, no, this administration  has become a marketing wing for the cartels, urging folks from all  around the world to flood our southern border.   These cartels are making billions of dollars on human smuggling  alone, and billions more on drug trafficking. The result of Biden's  collaboration with cartels is the highest number of unaccompanied  minors we have ever seen. Thousands of criminals, and even individuals  on the FBI's terrorist watch list, crossing our border.   Mr. Speaker, this administration is incentivizing unaccompanied  minors to make the hazardous and potentially fatal journey across our  southern border. That is child abuse. This administration has signaled  that we will not fortify our southern border, and we have seen those on  the terrorist watch list try to enter. That is a dereliction of duty.  And we have seen this administration fail to uphold and enforce the  laws of our Nation. That is a betrayal of the American people.   The most moral thing we can do is build a wall and secure our  southern border. It is shameful and immoral to signal to poor and  desperate people that if you break our laws, if you cross our borders,  if you somehow make it, if you somehow don't get caught and survive,  then we will take care of you with our hard-earned tax dollars. Let's  ask California how that is working for them.
