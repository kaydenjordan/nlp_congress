 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership  on this issue.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 50, the Unfunded  Mandates Information and Transparency Act.   One of the laws of physics states: For every action in nature, there  is an equal and opposite reaction. The same thing happens in our  economy.                                time  0930    Well, I can confidently say that, for every action made in  Washington, D.C.'s bloated bureaucracy, there is going to be an  unfunded mandate for private businesses and State, local, and Tribal  businesses to grapple with.   In 1995, Congress passed the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act to help  stop the burden of these costly Federal unfunded mandates. However,  over the last 23 years, many unfunded mandates have slipped through the  cracks due to loopholes or failed analyses, costing taxpayers more of  their hard-earned money.   As a small-business owner for more than 40 years, I am a strong  advocate for scrutinizing every tax dollar spent and holding agencies  accountable.   As Dr. Foxx mentioned of her travels in her district and my travels  in my district, for the last 500 days since this administration and  this President took office, it is like somebody flipped on the light  switch. More jobs are being created; wages are rising; and the economy  is growing.   Jobs are being created. There are more jobs available today than  there are people seeking jobs.   H.R. 50 does this. It closes loopholes in the current law,  strengthens analysis requirements to identify harmful Federal mandates,  and requires detailed assessments of authorized funding levels.   Mr. Chair, I encourage all my colleagues to join me in supporting  H.R. 50 today.
