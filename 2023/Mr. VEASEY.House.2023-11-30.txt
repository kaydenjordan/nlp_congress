 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the  extraordinary life of Trinidad Garza, better known in our community as  ``Trini.''   Trini was just a tremendous individual, a great person. I cannot say  enough about this man. He loved trying to help kids when it came to  education in the community. He was an incredible businessman. He served  our country in the U.S. Navy. He did so much for the city of Dallas. I  love the Oak Cliff neighborhood that he lived in.   He was just such a tremendous leader. He was part of the city's first  Mexican-American Leadership Conference.  [[Page H6032]]  He was also educated here in the north Texas area.   He was the first Hispanic member of the board of trustees at one of  our local colleges. He was also appointed as a regional director of the  U.S. Department of Education under President Clinton.   The life and legacy of Trini Garza just goes on and on and on. He is  going to be deeply missed by so many because of everything he has done  and accomplished. Everything that is going to be said about him and how  it will be commemorated will be well deserved.   Great job, Trini. Please rest in peace. My condolences to his entire  family.                            ____________________
