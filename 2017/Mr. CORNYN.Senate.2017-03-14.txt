 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time  until 5:45 p.m. today, including quorum calls, be equally divided in  the usual form, with 15 minutes of the Democratic time being reserved  for the use of Senator Wyden or his designee; further, that at 5:45  p.m., the remaining time on H.J. Res. 42 be considered expired, the  resolution be read a third time, and the Senate vote on the resolution  with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, today the Senate Finance Committee has  considered the nomination of Mr. Robert Lighthizer to be the country's  next Trade Representative. This position serves as a vital role in our  country's economic policy by negotiating trade agreements on behalf of  the American people and making sure they are enforced according to  their terms.   President Trump has made clear that his administration will be  devoted to getting the very best trade deals possible for the American  people. For Texas, my State--the Nation's top exporting State--trade is  incredibly important. Many of our jobs and industries rely on trade  agreements, like NAFTA, so that our goods and services can find new  markets and more customers. As a matter of fact, 5 million American  jobs depend on binational trade with Mexico alone, which gives us a  sense of how important trade is to our economy at large.   I am happy to support Mr. Lighthizer for this important post. He has  served in the Senate as a staffer on the Senate Finance Committee for  the former chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Bob Dole, and as  the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative during the Reagan administration  as well. In his nearly three decades in the private sector, Mr.  Lighthizer has represented a number of U.S. commercial interests  through trade enforcement cases, while also focusing on opening up  foreign markets to American ranchers, farmers, and small businesses. I  look forward to working with him to improve existing trade deals and to  cut better ones for the benefit of the American people.                           American Health Care Act    Mr. President, last week the House of Representatives unveiled a plan  to repeal and replace ObamaCare with one that provides more options for  the American people at a price they can afford. This was in direct  response to what has been an ObamaCare disaster--one that led to  skyrocketing healthcare costs, insurers leaving markets left and right,  and a big government solution to a complicated problem that fails to  actually deliver on its promises.   We have all heard it a hundred times if we have heard it once.  President Obama said: If you like your policy, you can keep it; if you  like your doctor, you can keep your doctor; and a family of four would  see a decrease in their premium costs by $2,500. Obviously, that did  not prove to be the case.   There is really no denying that ObamaCare isn't working, and the  status quo is unacceptable. Under ObamaCare, tens of millions are  uninsured--almost 30 million people now in America, which, to me, is  one of the most supreme ironies of ObamaCare. It was sold to us on the  premise that everyone would have insurance. Yet 30 million people are  uninsured, and 20 million of those 30 million are either people who  have paid a penalty because they haven't bought the government-  [[Page S1795]]  approved healthcare and thus are not complying with the individual  mandate or they are people who claimed a hardship exemption, saying  they simply can't afford to buy the policy that the government mandates  they purchase, so the government has supplied them an exemption. So 30  million are uninsured under ObamaCare, and 20 million of those 30  million have either paid the penalty or have been otherwise excused  from complying with the mandate.   We know that under ObamaCare, tens of millions are uninsured,  premiums have skyrocketed, and mandates have crushed job creators.   I remember several conversations with employers--restaurant owners  and one gentleman in an architectural firm--saying: When does the  employer mandate kick in? In other words, when do you get penalized for  not complying with the ObamaCare requirements?   He said: I am going to hire fewer people because I don't want to come  within the ambit of that employer mandate.   Then I remember one restaurant in East Texas where a single mom  basically was laid off of her full-time job and forced to work two  part-time jobs to make up for that lost pay because her employer  couldn't comply with the employer mandate under ObamaCare, so what he  decided to do was lay off his full-time workers and hire people on a  part-time basis. ObamaCare is riddled with stories like that, which  demonstrate its flaws.   Consider that a 24-year-old individual in Texas could spend up to 30  percent of their gross income just paying for their healthcare premiums  and their out-of-pocket costs--hardly affordable healthcare. We really  should have called it the un-Affordable Care Act. We have begun the  first step to repeal and replace it.   Yesterday, the Congressional Budget Office offered us a glimpse into  the impact the legislation would have. But I hasten to add that this is  just the first step out of multiple steps, and there is additional work  to be done, first of all, by the Secretary of Health and Human  Services, who has enormous discretion in terms of how to administer  healthcare policy at the national level and the authority to delegate a  lot of that responsibility, along with the money that goes with it,  back to the States where it historically has been done, to offer people  lower cost health insurance that suits their needs--not a government  mandate--and offers them more choices.   There is a number of additional things in the Congressional Budget  Office report yesterday which are important to consider.   First, the CBO estimates the American Health Care Act would lower  premiums by 10 percent over time. We know ObamaCare raised premiums for  many families across the country; they skyrocketed to an unaffordable  level. So this is a start in the right direction, but I hasten again to  add that it is just a start.   The Congressional Budget Office also confirmed that the American  Health Care Act is a fiscally conservative bill that puts forward  responsible solutions to our Nation's healthcare woes. CBO estimates  that we could reduce the Federal deficit by $337 billion by passing the  American Health Care Act.   It also reforms Medicaid. Many of our most vulnerable population get  their healthcare through Medicaid. This bill provides a way of sending  that money and authority back to the States and lets them manage the  growth of the Medicaid Program according to a Consumer Price Index. So  people who are on Medicaid now, including those in the expansion  States, can stay on Medicaid, but ultimately the responsibility is  going to be sent back to the States, along with the money to pay for  it, and grow--not to cut it, but to grow--according to a Consumer Price  Index, which makes sense. That change alone saves taxpayers another  $880 billion--$880 billion. This is the most significant entitlement  reform in certainly a generation.   The bill repeals ObamaCare's job-killing taxes like the individual  employer mandate and the medical device tax, which has moved jobs  offshore to places like Costa Rica because of its impact on innovation.  We also repeal the payroll tax, the tax on investments, and the tax on  prescription drugs. The fact is, middle-income Americans and our job  creators will find massive tax relief as a result of this legislation-- to the tune of more than $800 billion.   Put simply, the American Health Care Act dismantles, repeals, and  stops ObamaCare in its tracks.   I should point out that the CBO doesn't take into account other steps  Congress and the administration will take in order to make our Nation's  healthcare system a vibrant marketplace where more options and better  quality healthcare exist.   I might say that a lot of the news yesterday on the CBO report had to  do with the reduction in the number of people who would actually buy  health insurance under this new legislation, but the reason for the  change is in large part, as the Congressional Budget Office said, that  when you don't punish people through a penalty for not buying  government-approved health insurance, as ObamaCare did, people may well  decide in their own economic self-interest not to purchase that  government policy, particularly when their choices are so limited.   I believe this is a first step in unraveling this convoluted puzzle  called ObamaCare and getting our Nation's healthcare back on track. The  American people have demanded better than ObamaCare. Families are  forced to pay for insurance they can't afford that provides subpar  care, and they are tired of being forced to pay a penalty because they  don't want to opt into a government program that fails to deliver on  its most basic promises.   Let me just say this in closing: I know some of our friends across  the aisle have a dim view of this proposal. They say the CBO score  demonstrates that not enough people will be covered by this alternative  to ObamaCare. But my question to them is, What are you going to do  about the current meltdown in ObamaCare that is forcing people into  insurance they don't want and denying them any real choice, where the  premiums are skyrocketing, and where the deductibles are so high you  are effectively denied the benefit of any health insurance coverage?  What are they going to do about that? I would simply say that if they  don't like the alternative we have offered, I invite them to join us in  trying to solve this problem.   One of the lessons of ObamaCare is that partisan healthcare  legislation isn't very durable and doesn't survive. I hope at some  point the fever will break, and Democrats and Republicans alike will  find a way to work in the best interests of our constituents, the  people we serve--the American people.   We can't afford another one-size-fits-all approach to healthcare. The  American Health Care Act will provide the first important steps of  relief from this unworkable, unsustainable system that was created  based on false promises made to the American people. At the end of the  day, our goal is to deliver more access, more options, and better  quality care for families across the country. I look forward to getting  it done soon.   In the House, the Budget Committee will take up the healthcare bill,  which passed the Ways and Means Committee and the Energy and Commerce  Committee, and then it will move to the floor of the House where I  presume it will be open to some amendments. Then it will come to the  Senate where, under the Senate rules, it will also be open to  amendments.   If people have a better idea, I hope they will join us in trying to  come up with the very best solutions possible. But to simply hang back  and sort of enjoy the difficulty of trying to reform this broken  ObamaCare system for partisan reasons, to me, seems to be beneath the  dignity of what we are sent here to do by our constituents.
