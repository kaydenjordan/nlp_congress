 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of strong national  security policies, policies like the remain in Mexico policy,  enforcement of our existing interior immigration laws, and the  completion of key miles of fencing and technology that protect our  southwest border--policies, Madam Speaker, that President Biden hastily  removed on his first day in office, without any plan to replace them.   President Biden and the Democrats in the House and Senate supported  ending those Trump-era policies. Those policies, Madam Speaker, were  working to rein in the flow of illegal immigration.   Now, with no plan and no substitution, the result is pure political  theater, simply because those were Trump policies. While they were  working, President Biden stopped them.   President Biden appointed Vice President Harris to serve as the  border czar. One would think that she would act in critical ways to  replace those national security policies that were working under the  Trump administration and that President Biden ended. Not only did she  not present solutions to the historic number of hundreds of thousands  of immigrants who were pouring across our southern border, but she  refused to visit the border for nearly 100 days since being appointed  border czar.   She even laughed at the idea of visiting the border, comparing it to  taking a trip to Europe. Finally, after cries from the American people  and calls from House and Senate Republicans, she did agree to take a  trip to the border.   Madam Speaker, I have been to the border seven times over the past  5\1/2\ years, most recently in April. Specifically, I traveled to the  Rio Grande sector in the Rio Grande Valley. The conditions I found  there were worse than I have seen on my previous trips. In fact, Border  Patrol estimates that the drug cartels in Mexico made $400 million in  February alone in human trafficking.   Think about that, Madam Speaker: $400 million in one month by  charging $5,000 to $9,000 to traffic hundreds of thousands of people  across the border, some innocent, some not.   These drug and human trafficking challenges are just part of the  crisis at the border because while Customs and Border Patrol are  working on the humanitarian elements of this crisis, drugs are coming  across the border and criminals are coming across the border.   In fact, Madam Speaker, we have interdicted in the first 6 months of  this year enough fentanyl to kill all in America. It is shocking that  we have interdicted that much fentanyl drug that it could kill everyone  in this country because it only takes the amount in a Sweet'N Low  packet, Madam Speaker, to kill 500 Americans. This is a deadly drug.   The Vice President chose to visit El Paso. El Paso is nearly 1,000  miles west of the Rio Grande Valley, where this crisis has its  epicenter. If she had gone to the Rio Grande Valley, she would have  seen cartels dropping off migrant families by the dozens and holding  camps for migrant families struggling to get the water, time, and care  that they need.   Regardless of who designed the policies, the Biden administration  should be for stronger national security policies on the border. But  the Biden border crisis is out of control, and it is going to take more  than a short public relations visit to El Paso to fix it.  [[Page H3299]]    I encourage the Vice President and the administration to come to the  table with Republicans in the House and Senate and implement strong  national security borders and reform our broken illegal immigration  system.                    Announcing American Hostage Task Force     Madam Speaker, I rise today to announce that the  Congressional Task Force on Americans Wrongfully Detained Abroad has  been initiated by Congressman Ted Deutch from Florida and myself.   The inspiration for me to form this task force was Majd Kamalmaz, a  former resident of central Arkansas who was traveling to Syria to  attend a family funeral where he was wrongfully detained and has been  held in Syria ever since. I am dedicated to bringing him home safely to  his family.   Having a loved one detained or held hostage abroad is unimaginable.  It is a heartbreaking experience for any family.   Representative Deutch and I created this task force not only to help  these struggling families but to be a resource for our colleagues in  the House, as there are over 50 families here in America who are  struggling with a member of their family held abroad. We want to help  Members of Congress help their constituents cope with this issue.   Every channel of the United States Government should be working to  bring these Americans home and to disincentivize the wrongful detention  of Americans in the future, by state actors or nonstate actors.   Madam Speaker, I am committed to bringing Majd Kamalmaz home to his  family. Ted Deutch and I are committed to using this task force to  bring other Americans wrongfully detained home, into the arms of their  loved ones.                       Marking 100th Anniversary of CCP     Madam Speaker, a century ago, the Chinese Communists took  control of one of the great countries in global history. The Chinese  Communist Party marks, this month, a century since the beginning of  China's descent into authoritarianism.   Just as the Chinese Communist Party used violence to impose its will  onto the Chinese people during the Chinese Civil War, now it uses that  same violence and threat of violence to crush any dissent within its  borders.   We saw this last summer, when the CCP silenced the democratic voices  of Hong Kong, swiftly marching troops into the city to stop  demonstrations for freedom. Beijing has blatantly ignored the terms of  its 50-year treaty with the United Kingdom and ignored Hong Kong's  legislature, arresting pro-democracy activists and lawmakers en masse  and crushing a long history of press freedom with the recent closing of  Apple Daily.    As I speak, over a million Uighurs and other Muslims have been  interned in concentration camps for reeducation. Families have been  separated, lives destroyed, and cultures all but erased in the name of  the magnificent Chinese Communist Party's ultimate authority.   Respect for human rights is a fundamental tenet of American foreign  policy. The continued suffering of the Uighurs, the citizens of Hong  Kong--and all other individual rights of speech, privacy, assembly, and  religious belief are trampled by the Chinese Communist Party.   It is no 100-year celebration here on the House floor, Madam Speaker.  The American people stand with the hardworking people of China. The  Congress of the United States stands with the hardworking people of  China, and we will work to continue to advocate for freedom of people,  assembly, belief, and press in China.                          Applauding FBI Cyber Busts     Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the tireless  dedication of members of the FBI in recently seizing approximately $2.3  million from the hacker group responsible for the Colonial Pipeline  ransomware attack.   After the Colonial Pipeline paid the hackers the entire $4.4 million  ransom, and with the money seemingly lost forever due to bitcoin  encryption, these FBI agents were able to recover more than half of the  demanded sum.   I am also proud to recognize that the FBI conducted 800 arrests in 16  countries thanks to an encrypted messaging app it developed as part of  a 3-year digital sting operation on international crime.   Just as encrypted, untraceable communications have become pervasive  in how criminal enterprise operates on a global scale, ransomware  attacks have been on the rise as they prey on the digital vulnerability  of our businesses and infrastructure, often with little hope of  recovery or justice.   I applaud the vigilance and ingenious methods of the investigating  agents and encourage their continued efforts to ensure safety in our  digital age.                  Reintroducing Coptic Christian Resolution     Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my resolution, H.  Res. 117, which calls on the Egyptian Government to end the culture of  impunity for attacks on Christians and to undertake the arrest,  prosecution, and conviction of individuals who carry out attacks on  Copts and other Christians in Egypt.   I was the lead on a nearly identical resolution in previous  Congresses. I truly appreciate the support I received from my original  cosponsor, the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), and nearly  50 of my House colleagues who have cosponsored the resolution in this  Congress.   Madam Speaker, Egypt and the United States are important partners in  the fight against terrorism. Egypt's role at Camp David has led to some  of the closest ties between the United States, Egypt, and Israel in  their history, and we are grateful for their most recent engagement  between the terror group Hamas in the Gaza Strip and the Government of  Israel.   Madam Speaker, I respect President el-Sisi and his good relationship  with the Coptic Pope. He has attended Mass on multiple occasions. He  has had some churches reconstructed, and he has constructed the largest  Christian cathedral in the Middle East in the new administrative center  in Egypt. And President el-Sisi is relentless in holding terrorists  accountable for their atrocities.                                time  2045    People all around the world, regardless of their religious  affiliation deserve the same freedom to practice their chosen religion  like we have enjoyed here in the United States for more than 200 years.   The respect for human rights and religious freedom is a fundamental  tenet of American foreign policy. I will continue to advocate for the  Coptic Christians and all Egyptians, be they Christian or Muslim, who  together take their water from the Nile.             Arkansans Should Check the Status of Their Passports     Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge all Arkansans to check  the status of their passports well before traveling.   Due to backlogs in the State Department, passport renewals by mail  are taking longer than usual. There is a backlog of up to 10 weeks for  their expedited service and 18 weeks for their regular service.   This lag in service at the State Department is affecting Arkansans  wanting to travel for mission trips, study abroad, or take a family  trip in the aftermath of the pandemic.   So far, my office has helped 70 people this year receive their  passports, and we have opened more than 90 cases in the past 6 months.  And this compares to opening cases and receiving passports of only  about 200 in the 5 previous years   So, to my friends in Arkansas, check your passport prior to your  trip, and if it is expired, get it renewed as soon as possible   I encourage everyone to stay up to date on passport services and  travel advisories and to check COVID-19 protocols, masks, testing, and  quarantine issues before you travel.                        Arkansans Must Get Vaccinated     Madam Speaker, I rise today to encourage all Arkansans who  are not currently vaccinated for COVID-19 to consult with their doctor  about getting the COVID-19 vaccine.   The best way to combat the spread of these COVID variants is by  receiving the vaccine. As more information and research develops around  the delta variant of the coronavirus, I want to ensure that all  Arkansans stay safe and remain healthy as we prepare for this spread.   The only way that we can fully reopen our economy and get truly back  on our feet is with more people being vaccinated for COVID-19.  [[Page H3300]]    Each FDA conditionally approved vaccine is backed by science and  doctors who have worked hard over the past year to develop,  manufacture, and distribute these critical vaccines.   So work with your physician. Help protect your family and the  Arkansas community by getting a vaccine shot soon.                       Recognizing Great Outdoors Month     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize that June is Great  Outdoors Month and recognize the great conservation work of my  colleagues in Arkansas in the Governor's office and at the Arkansas  Department of Parks and Tourism.   As a lifelong outdoorsman living in The Natural State, I have a lot  of pride in recognizing June as Great Outdoors Month. For 9  generations, my family has lived in Arkansas and enjoyed the  extraordinary natural beauty throughout our State.   I agree with many of the earliest conservationists in protecting our  wildlife and our wild places and that can be done through reasonable  and realistic means, and I am proud to continue my work in central  Arkansas.   Just last week, I joined Governor Asa Hutchinson and Secretary of  Parks and Tourism Stacy Hurst in announcing the new Office of Outdoor  Recreation and the addition of a great new wild place in central  Arkansas: Blue Mountain just west of Pinnacle Mountain. Just west of  Rattlesnake Ridge, Blue Mountain will be a new opportunity for hiking,  mountain biking, and enjoying the extraordinary view of Lake Maumelle  from the Nature Conservancy and the Arkansas Department of Heritage's  latest partnership to expand outdoor recreation.   In the same announcement, the Governor announced that our parks and  tourism department would work with the Ouachita National Forest and  open up Lake Sylvia Recreation Area and the old Camp Ouachita to year- round participation by Arkansans. This is a great partnership between  the Federal Government and the State government to offer more outdoor  recreation opportunities for our families to enjoy in The Natural  State.            The National Personnel Records Center Must Go Digital     Madam Speaker, I rise today to bring awareness to the  difficulty for many to obtain a critical document for our veterans:  That is their form DD-214.   You can't do anything as a veteran without a copy of your DD-214.  This paperwork is required to verify for our servicemembers their  benefits, how to obtain a disability claim, funeral service, research  about lost medals. We need a copy of your DD-214.   Well, the pandemic has not been good for this need for the millions  of veterans in our country. The National Personnel Records Center shut  down, and as we come out of the pandemic when our veterans need these  resources, they are still terribly behind, despite Congress  appropriating more money.   It is critical that the National Personnel Records Center go digital  so that we can properly verify these servicemembers and give better  service for those who have served their country in such a valuable way.   It should not be difficult for our veterans to get their DD-214 to  pursue their benefits or claim healthcare at our Veterans  Administration. It shouldn't be a burden to a spouse, to a family of a  fallen veteran to have the proper paperwork to have a proper funeral.   So I urge my colleagues to join me and continue to press the National  Archives to improve their service for the bravest men and women and  their families.                           Recognizing Steve Wells     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  accomplishments and retirement of Catholic High School teacher and  longtime friend Mr. Steve Wells.    Mr. Wells has been teaching at Catholic High School in Little Rock,  Arkansas, for 38 years. His decision to end his long service at the  school, having graduated there in 1973, is recognized by many as the  end of an era at CHS.   Steve's a native of north Little Rock and came back to the school as  a substitute English teacher in 1983. The teacher for which he was  substituting never returned, and Steve Wells has been teaching there  ever since.   When you walk into our beloved Catholic High there is a quote that is  above the front door. It says: ``Come boys, so that you may become  men.''   Mr. Wells did exactly that. And he served as a teacher and a role  model for generations of students throughout the years.   I congratulate my friend, Steve Wells, on a dedicated career of  helping boys become men and wish him the very best in his retirement.                     Recognizing Arkansas' Women Veterans     Madam Speaker, today I rise in honor of Women's Armed  Services Integration Act. I am proud to recognize the more than 20,000  women veterans in Arkansas.   Women have been serving in the military in different capacities for  more than a century. Women like Deborah Sampson, who fought in the  Revolutionary War, and Loretta Walsh, America's first official enlisted  woman of any service.   They pioneered the way for women to serve in the United States Armed  Forces. And with more women serving now than ever before at any time in  our history, action is being taken to continue and build a positive  environment for women in the armed services. Further, our Veterans  Administration continues its efforts to enhance families, facilities,  and services for our growing number of female veterans in Arkansas.   I thank the women of our armed services for their dedication and  service to our country.   Recognizing Gracie Lee, Alyssa Huie, Randilynn Stripling, and Catherine                                   Mills     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize four incredible  young women on the Clinton Arkansas Future Farmers of America team.   Together, Gracie Lee, Alyssa Huie, Randilynn Stripling, and Catherine  Mills made history by being the first all-female team to win not one,  but two State competitions in electricity.   Due to the pandemic, the team was allowed to compete in the State  contest a second time, making them back-to-back State champions in  electricity.   This team serves as a great example to all the young Arkansans that  are committed to working hard and being pioneers in their fields. I  applaud them for their diligence and determination.   This team demonstrated great dedication, and I am incredibly proud to  represent these history-making young women and all young Arkansans in  central Arkansas.                         Recognizing Melvin Williams     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the determination  of Little Rock native, Melvin Williams. A terrible and unfortunate  injury in high school ended his football dreams. His grades slipped,  and Melvin dropped out of school.   Years later, Melvin had earned his high school diploma at a program  at Goodwill Industries. The Excel Center at Goodwill is a fully  accredited and cost-free public high school in Little Rock for adults  19 and older.   Not only is Mr. Williams now working toward a business degree at the  University of Arkansas Pulaski Tech, he is one of Goodwill's newest  employees. He is in charge of recruitment and retention at Goodwill.   Goodwill Industries of Arkansas CEO Brian Marsh says, ``Melvin is  exactly who we need for this role.''   I congratulate Melvin on his accomplishments and for being a  wonderful representative for Goodwill Industries.                          Congratulating Ellis Freel     Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Miss Ellis  Freel on being a recipient of the Congressional Award Gold Medal.   The Congressional Award Gold Medal requires the recipient to complete  a minimum of 400 hours of volunteer service, 200 hours of personal  development, and 200 hours of physical fitness and 5 days of  exploration or expedition.   Miss Freel cites the most challenging obstacle in completing the  requirements of being a gold medalist as her 5-day wilderness  expedition. Due to restrictions from the pandemic, Ellis had to make  adjustments that taught her patience and flexibility.   Miss Freel serves as a wonderful asset to her hometown of Bryant,  Arkansas, her college campus at the University of Arkansas and to  Arkansas' Second Congressional District.  [[Page H3301]]             Recognizing Finalists of the Arkansas State Coding Competition     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the finalists from  central Arkansas in the fifth annual Arkansas State Coding competition  and a finalist for the Arkansas Computer Science Educator of the Year  Award.   The team taking third place at the State coding competition this year  was from eStem High School in my hometown of Little Rock. The three- person team included Elijah Keen, Spencer Knight, and Sergio Markin.  Each student received a 529 college savings plan worth $500, in  addition to winning $4000 for their school.   Also, a special congratulations to Kimberly Raup for being a finalist  in the 2021 Computer Science Educator of the Year Award. She teaches at  Conway High School, and she received a $2,500 award for being named a  finalist.   Congratulations to these students and to Ms. Raup on their awards,  and a special thank you to the University of Arkansas at Little Rock  for hosting this event.   It is events like this that allow our central Arkansas students to  showcase their coding and STEM talents to show the importance of  computer science for our youth.                            Happy Birthday America     Madam Speaker, I bring birthday greetings to our beloved  Nation. I rise today to celebrate freedom and independence and  democracy right here in the United States.                                time  2100    Madam Speaker, 245 years ago, our brave Founding Fathers gathered  together in Philadelphia to sign the Declaration of Independence. And  on that hot July, in that stuffy room in Philadelphia, they came  together to change world history, to change history here in the United  States, and to open up a lifetime of opportunity for generations of  Americans yet unborn.   Madam Speaker, what amazes me about that time is that small committee  of Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, thinking through of  how would we break with Great Britain, how would America leave Great  Britain.   Madam Speaker, Jefferson was concerned. In his rough draft, he said  of Great Britain and the United States: ``We might have been a free and  great people together.''   Those words are not placed in the final copy of the Declaration of  Independence, but it shows the struggle that the Founding Fathers had  and Thomas Jefferson had as a principal author of how to make that  break with a people they had respect for, and a king and a king's  policies they despised.   ``We might have been a free and great people together.''   But think of the momentous feelings they had, the prayers they had  every day on their knees for strength to take on the most powerful  country in the world, with the most powerful Navy and military in the  world.   As Jefferson said: `` . . . it becomes necessary for one people to  dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another . .  . '' To pursue life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.   Jefferson, while he didn't include that statement about being  partners as a free people going forward, he argued, ``we have appealed  to their''--the British--``native justice and magnanimity.'' And they  were rejected.   Madam Speaker, think of the bravery there. As the signers of the  Declaration, those Founders came together and said in the final closing  words of the Declaration of Independence: ``And for the support of this  Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine  Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes,  and our sacred honor.''   And they did that for those generations of Americans unborn in this  great land.   So 245 years later, we have proven our resilience and our strength  once again in coming through the pandemic, defeating COVID-19. And I am  optimistic about the future of our beloved country. While it has been  challenging over the last year and a few months, but compared to the  challenges those Founders faced, compared to the challenges this  country has faced many, many times before, we show our strength, we  show our true mettle, we pull through as one Nation under God many  times before.   So on this Fourth of July, I invite all Americans to celebrate our  country's birthday with their friends and family. Honor our cherished  freedoms. And may we never forget the sacrifices of those generations  before us in public service, in uniform, on the battlefield, who have  sacrificed so much so that we may enjoy those freedoms that we have  today. God bless each of you and God bless our great country.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
