 Mr. Speaker, as the farm bill conference  committee begins their negotiations, I rise today to urge conferees to  include a provision important to Delaware farmers.   Many of our farmers utilize cost share programs under the  Environmental Quality Incentives Program, known as EQIP. The program  provides growers with funds to make necessary farm improvements, while  also mitigating environmental risks.   Farmers know what they need. They should be able to access these  funds when they anticipate a problem, not after one has cropped up.  That is why, this morning, I join my Delaware colleagues, Senators  Carper and Coons, in urging the farm bill conference committee to  include updates to the EQIP program so farmers can get access to the  funds sooner, reducing their costs and environmental footprint, while  promoting stewardship of our cherished farmland.   Tweaking the EQIP program may seem like a small change, but it  produces big wins for Delaware's farmers and our environment. I urge my  colleagues to include this language in the conference report.                            ____________________
