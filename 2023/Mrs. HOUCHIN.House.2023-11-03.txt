 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of the  General of IU basketball, the legendary Coach Bob Knight.   Growing up in southern Indiana, there were three things that shaped  my childhood: family, faith, and IU basketball.   Any game day, TVs across our towns would play the game, and on the  screen was Coach Bob Knight. During those games, my mom really only had  two emotions: frustration, yelling, Come on, boys; or elation,  celebrating game play.   I was a student during Coach Knight's last year at IU, and I always  said that you haven't really seen an IU game unless you were able to  witness one that he had coached or had been kicked out of.   Coach Knight's legacy was complex to say the least, but that didn't  stop Hoosiers from loving him and through him the game of basketball.  Boy, did he create champions on and off the court. He brought home  three national championship banners to the walls of Assembly Hall and  902 wins, more than any other coach in IU history.   Under Coach Knight, IU basketball wasn't just a sport about wins and  championships, it was a way of life.   In his honor, today we remember what it means to be an IU Hoosier.                            ____________________
