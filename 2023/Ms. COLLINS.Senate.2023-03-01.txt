 Madam President, I rise today, along with my colleague  Senator Brown, to introduce the Social Security Fairness Act. The  bipartisan bill would repeal two Social Security provisions that  unfairly penalize many public servants in Maine and in other States.   Social Security is the foundation of retirement income for most  Americans. This crucial program has made the difference between poverty  and a comfortable retirement for millions of seniors. Yet, some  teachers, firefighters, police officers, and other public servants  often see their earned Social Security benefits unfairly reduced by two  Social Security provisions: the windfall elimination provision and the  Government pension offset.   The Windfall elimination provision or W-E-P affects public servants  who receive a pension from a job where they did not pay into Social  Security but who also worked long enough in another job to qualify for  Social Security benefits. Due to the WEP, their Social Security  benefits are calculated using a different formula, which can reduce  their monthly benefits. For workers who become eligible for benefits in  2023, the WEP reduction can be up to $557.50 per month, subject to  other adjustments.   The Government Pension Offset GPO affects public servants who receive  a pension from a job where they did not pay into Social Security and  are also eligible to receive a Social Security spousal or widow(er)'s  benefit. However, the GPO reduces Social Security spousal or  widow(er)'s benefits by an amount equal to two-thirds of the noncovered  pension.   According to the Social Security Administration, in December 2022,  more than 2 million people, including nearly 20,500 people in Maine,  had their Social Security benefits reduced by the WEP. Similarly,  nearly 735,000 people were affected by the GPO in December 2022,  including more than 8,100 people in Maine. While the effects of the WEP  and GPO are most acute in certain States, including Maine, data from  the Social Security Administration indicate that these provisions  affect public servants in all 50 States.   Many Maine teachers have spoken with me about how the WEP and GPO  affect their retirement security. I recently heard from a special  education teacher in Kennebuck who has spent more than 40 years  teaching and also held a second job in the private sector to help  support her family after becoming a single parent. Due to the WEP, she  is concerned about her financial security once she retires. A retiree  in Mount Desert also reached out to me recently to share his story. He  wants to make sure his wife, who is a public servant, will be taken  care of after he is gone. Due to the GPO, he is concerned that any  Social Security widow's benefits his wife receives will be  substantially reduced.   The bill we are introducing today, the Social Security Fairness Act,  would repeal both the WEP and the GPO for Social Security benefits  payable after December 2023. This means current Social Security  beneficiaries would have their benefits recalculated without applying  the WEP and GPO. Teachers, firefighters, police officers, and other  public servants currently in the workforce would no longer have to  worry about having their Social Security benefits unfairly reduced in  the future. Those who are considering careers in public service would  no longer have to weigh the potential negative effects of this choice  on their future retirement security.   Our dedicated public servants, such as our teachers who help prepare  our  [[Page S571]]  children for future success and our police officers who help keep our  communities safe, should receive the full Social Security benefits they  have earned. It is time for us to take action to address the WEP and  the GPO. I urge my colleagues to support the Social Security Fairness  Act.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise today, along with my colleague  Senator Brown, to introduce the Social Security Fairness Act.
