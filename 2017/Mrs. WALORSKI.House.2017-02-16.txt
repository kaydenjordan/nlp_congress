 Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Black.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.J. Res. 43. This  resolution will overturn an Obama administration rule that forces  States to direct Federal funds to abortion providers like Planned  Parenthood.   States receive Federal funding to support family planning services,  and they have the discretion to distribute these title X funds in the  way that best serves their communities. Many States have exercised  their discretion to direct title X funding to community health centers  and family health clinics that do not provide abortions and withhold  funding from abortion providers like Planned Parenthood.   It is just common sense that States know the needs of their people  and their communities better than Washington bureaucrats do. The States  should be able to decide how these Federal funds are distributed.   Unfortunately, the Obama administration disagreed, so they issued a  last-minute regulation in their final days in office that would force  States to distribute funding to abortion providers. Their rule would  take away States' abilities to direct title X funds to providers that  offer comprehensive care but do not participate in abortion. It would  force States to enable the flow of funds to Planned Parenthood and  others in the abortion industry. I think it is reprehensible.   Now Congress has the opportunity to right this wrong and undo the  massive overreach. We are taking action to defend taxpayers and defend  life by using the Congressional Review Act to overturn this rule.  Overturning this rule won't reduce funding for women's health care. In  fact, it will let States direct these funds in the way that is best for  their citizens. It will ensure States can support women's heath as well  as protect the unborn.   Madam Speaker, this resolution is essential to rolling back executive  overreach and standing up for the sanctity of life. I urge my  colleagues to join me in supporting H.J. Res. 43.   Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her  leadership.   This is not about States, and it is not about the Federal Government.  It's about women and the rights of women. H.J. Res. 43 could impact  nearly 4 million primarily low-income patients that receive family  planning services at title X sites, annually, across the United States.   Of those 4 million patients, approximately 69 percent had incomes at  or below the Federal poverty line, while 61 percent of those patients  claimed the title X clinic as their only regular source of health care.  About 60 percent of women who access care from family planning health  centers consider it their main source; 4 in 10, it is their only source  of care.   Approximately 1.5 million Planned Parenthood patients benefit from  the Nation's family planning program. Approximately 20 percent of these  patients identify as Hispanic and approximately 50 percent as African  Americans.   Every public dollar invested in Planned Parenthood, $7.09 is saved in  Medicaid-related costs. Planned Parenthood centers are roughly one- third of the program's clients, although Planned Parenthood health  centers comprise 10 percent of the publicly supported safety and family  net.   This resolution for which we should vote ``no'' is going to take away  money from people who are in need, who need  [[Page H1272]]  health care. Where are the Republicans on women's rights?   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.J. Res. 43, a  congressional resolution rescinding a rule promulgated by the U.S.  Department of Health and Human Services providing important protections  to ensure that women, men, and young people can see trusted  reproductive health care providers, like Planned Parenthood, through  the Title X family planning program.   I oppose the disapproval resolution because it is nothing more than a  blatant attempt to persecute Planned Parenthood and make it easier for  the state politicians to take away people's health care, specifically,  the four million people who rely on Title X for birth control and other  care.   From birth control, to well-woman exams, to cancer screenings,  millions of Americans nationwide turn to Planned Parenthood and other  safety net reproductive health providers as their trusted source of  health care.   Many of these Americans, including low-income women, women of color,  and those living in rural areas, are uninsured and rely on important  public health programs for affordable health care, including Medicaid  and the Title X family planning program.   But their access to health care is under attack across the country  because in recent years because politicians in at least 14 states have  taken action to block access to care through Title X, willfully  ignoring the law, the recommendations of public health experts, and the  clear and present need in their communities.   In September 2016, HHS issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM)  titled ``Compliance With Title X Requirements by Project Recipients in  Selecting Subrecipients'' aiming to explicitly bar these types of  actions.   HHS opened the proposed regulation to public comment, which closed in  October 2016 and garnered widespread support, with 91% of the roughly  145,000 responses in favor of the rule.   Madam Speaker, Title X provides lifesaving, preventive care to  millions of people and is cost-effective.   Title X helps ensure more than four million persons of low-income  have health care in this country.   In fact, Title X is the only way that millions of low-income women or  uninsured women have access to birth control, cancer screenings, STI  tests, and other basic care.   Eighty-five percent of the people served by Planned Parenthood's  family planning program have incomes below 200 percent of the federal  poverty level, and 48 percent are uninsured.   In 2015 alone, Title X provided nearly 800,000 Pap tests, breast  exams to 1 million women, nearly 5 million tests for STIs, and 1  million HIV tests.   About 60 percent of women who access care from a family planning  health center consider it their main source of health care; for 4 in  10, it is their only source of care.   Approximately 1.5 million Planned Parenthood patients benefit from  the nation's family planning program, 78 percent of whom live with  incomes of 150 percent of the federal poverty level or less, the  equivalent of $35,775 a year for a family of four in 2014.   Approximately 20 percent of these patients identify as Hispanic; and  approximately 15 percent identify as African American.   For every public dollar invested in family planning, $7.09 is saved  in Medicaid-related costs; that is savings to both federal and state  governments and taxpayers.   Planned Parenthood health centers serve roughly one-third of the  program's clients, although Planned Parenthood health centers comprise  10 percent of publicly supported safety net family planning centers.   Planned Parenthood health centers are located in the communities  where access to care is most needed.   More than half of Planned Parenthood's health centers across the U.S.  are in rural and underserved communities with limited access to health  care.   Seventy-five percent of Planned Parenthood patients have incomes at  or below 150 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL).   The idea that other providers could absorb Planned Parenthood's  patients has been resoundingly dismissed by experts.   In fact, the American Public Health Association called the idea  ``ludicrous.''   Planned Parenthood health centers are also considerably more likely  to offer Title X patients a broader range of contraceptive methods than  other providers.   In a study of Community Health Centers (CHCs), among CHCs that  reported an independent family planning clinic in their largest site's  community, 69 percent reported referring their patients to providers  specializing in reproductive health services, like Planned Parenthood  health centers, for family planning care.   H.J. Res. 43 is a blatant effort to embolden states to try to block  women from getting birth control and other preventive care at highly  qualified family providers.   By issuing this important protection, the Obama Administration made  sure that politicians cannot ignore the law and stand in the way of the  care that women need.   I urge all Members to vote No on H.J. Res. 43.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter and article in  opposition to this resolution.     =========================== NOTE ===========================        February 16, 2017, on page H1272, the following appeared: Madam  Speaker, I include a letter . . .      The online version has been corrected to read: Madam Speaker, I  include in the Record a letter . . .    ========================= END NOTE =========================                                                   February 14, 2017.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Senate Majority Leader,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles Schumer,      Senate Minority Leader,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Leader McConnell, Speaker Ryan, Leader Schumer and       Leader Pelosi: As organizations committed to improving access       to health care for all people, the undersigned groups write       to strongly oppose H.J. Res. 43 and S.J. Res. 13, legislation       to overturn the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services       (HHS) final rules updating the regulations governing the       Title X family planning program. This critical rule clarifies       and reinforces the longstanding requirement that health care       providers may not be excluded from the program for reasons       unrelated to their qualifications to perform Title X-funded       services.        The Title X family planning program is a vital source of       family planning and related preventive care for low-income,       uninsured, and young people across the country. Every year,       more than 4 million individuals, including LGBTQ people and       people living in rural and medically underserved areas,       access life-saving care such as birth control, cancer       screenings, and testing for sexually transmitted infections       (STIs) including HIV at Title X-funded health centers. Title       X cannot succeed unless states and other Title X grantees       include providers that are optimally qualified to furnish the       range of Title X-funded services according to national       standards of care. This task becomes all but impossible if       experienced, reputable reproductive health care providers are       arbitrarily barred from fair consideration.        An increasing number of states have nevertheless tried to       block trusted reproductive health care providers from       participating in Title X. To date, at least 14 states have       taken official action to target and exclude otherwise       eligible providers from the program. Other states have       threatened to follow suit. Mounting evidence shows that the       exclusion of reproductive health care providers from publicly       funded health programs harms health outcomes, widens       disparities, and erects new barriers to care. When the very       providers that are best suited to deliver Title X-funded       services are targeted for exclusion based on factors wholly       unrelated to the program's objectives, federal health care       resources are poorly and inefficiently distributed and care       is less likely to reach individuals in need.        Ideological exclusions of trusted, highly qualified       providers from federally supported health programs undermine       health care access and jeopardize the health of the patients       these programs serve. Title X patients deserve the       opportunity to obtain high-quality family planning care from       the providers that are best equipped to provide it. As such,       we strongly support HHS's rule reinforcing that grantees must       design their provider networks based on the ability to       provide care to Title X patients in an effective manner--not       based on the political preferences of state lawmakers.        We strongly urge you to oppose H.J. Res. 43 and S.J. Res.       13, legislation that will overturn this important rule and       embolden states to attempt to block women from getting birth       control and other preventive care at highly qualified family       providers.

But the clinic closed in October, along with more than a       dozen others in the state, after financing for women's health       was slashed by two-thirds by the Republican-controlled       Legislature.        The cuts, which left many low-income women with       inconvenient or costly options, grew out of the effort to       eliminate state support for Planned Parenthood. Although the       cuts also forced clinics that were not affiliated with the       agency to close--and none of them, even the ones run by       Planned Parenthood, performed abortions--supporters of the       cutbacks said they were motivated by the fight against       abortion.        In December, the Department of Health and Human Services       finalized a rule that would prohibit states from withholding       federal funds--including Title X family planning money--from       Planned Parenthood. On Monday afternoon, a Republican senator       introduced a bill that would reverse it, along with a second       bill that would prohibit Planned Parenthood from receiving       any federal funding--including Medicaid.        The bills, from Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), would redirect       federal funds away from Planned Parenthood to other health       care providers. The Hyde Amendment already prohibits federal       funds from being used for most abortions, but this       legislation would bar low-income women who rely on Medicaid       and Title X funding for subsidized care from obtaining other       women's health care services at Planned Parenthood.        ``With a pro-life president in the White House and pro-life       majorities in the House and Senate, we will continue to work       together this year to undo the damage done by the Obama       administration,'' wrote Ernst and Rep. Diane Black (R-Tenn.)       in an op-ed published in the Washington Examiner on Friday,       the day of the annual anti-abortion March for Life.        The text of one of the bills, S. 241, explains that other       entities, including ``state and county health departments,       community health centers, [and] hospitals,'' will be able to       fill women's health care needs, including contraception, STI       testing, and cervical and breast cancer screening. Many       health experts say other health providers would not be able       to absorb Planned Parenthood's patients. An analysis       conducted by the Guttmacher Institute, which publishes       research on reproductive health, found that in two-thirds of       the counties that have a Planned Parenthood center, these       centers serve at least half the women seeking publicly funded       contraceptive care. In one-fifth of those counties, Planned       Parenthood is the only provider offering subsidized       contraceptive care.        ``If passed, these bills will cause a national health care       crisis, leaving millions with nowhere to go for basic care,''       said Dana Singiser, vice president of public policy and       government affairs for the Planned Parenthood Federation of       America, in a statement.        Texas offers an example of what women's health care looks       like when Planned Parenthood is excluded from public funding.       In 2011, the state stopped state funds from going to Planned       Parenthood, leading to numerous clinic closures. Other health       centers attempted to step in, but Medicaid contraception       claims declined by 35 percent, suggesting that fewer low-      income women were obtaining contraceptive care. There was       also an increase in childbirths among women receiving       Medicaid who'd previously received contraception from Planned       Parenthood clinics.        A bill to deny federal funds to Planned Parenthood passed       both chambers of Congress last year, but was vetoed by then-      President Barack Obama. Trump is likely to sign Ernst's       version of this bill should it cross his desk: Throughout his       campaign, Trump promised that defunding the women's health       care provider would be a priority for his administration.
