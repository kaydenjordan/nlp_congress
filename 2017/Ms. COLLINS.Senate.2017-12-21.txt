 Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the point  of order that will be offered by the Senator from Kentucky, which would  have the effect of allowing harmful, indiscriminate budget cuts to be  triggered. While there are certain safety net programs like Medicaid,  food stamps, and Social Security that are exempt from these automatic  cuts, the Medicare Program is not exempt, and there are a number of  other vital programs in addition to Medicare, including Federal  education programs, agricultural support for farmers, and funding for  Citizenship and Immigration Services, among others, that would be  subject to immediate automatic cuts if we failed to take action tonight  to avert that outcome.   It has been deeply disturbing to me to see seniors frightened about  the possibility that a $25 billion cut in Medicare--that is a 4-percent  reduction--would be automatically triggered. By waiving this point of  order, we will prevent such cuts from taking place, reassuring our  Nation's seniors and their loved ones.   Although the law that could cause this reduction has been waived some  16 times--and indeed never implemented since it was enacted--I felt  that it was essential that our leaders publicly commit that Medicare  reductions would not be triggered, given the amount of fear, anxiety,  and misinformation that is out there.   I wrote to the Senate majority leader, urging that we immediately  remove the threat of an automatic cut in Medicare's funding. In  response, I am pleased to say that both the majority leader and the  Speaker of the House released a joint statement that pledged this will  not happen, and that is the issue before us tonight.   Medicare provides essential healthcare benefits to our Nation's  seniors. We must remove, immediately, the threat that an automatic  reduction in the program's funding could occur, which would affect  healthcare providers and diminish access that beneficiaries--including  our seniors and disabled individuals--have to the services they need.   Earlier this month, AARP sent a letter to the House and the Senate  leadership, alluding and supporting my inquiry and warning Congress of  the potential consequences. The letter says:         The sudden cut to Medicare provider funding in 2018 would       have an immediate and lasting impact, including fewer       healthcare providers participating in Medicare and reduced       access to care for Medicare beneficiaries. Healthcare       providers may choose to stop accepting Medicare patients at a       time when the Medicare population is growing by 10,000 new       beneficiaries each day. . . . Furthermore, Medicare Advantage       plans and Part D prescription drug plans may charge higher       premiums or cost sharing in future years to make up for these       cuts now.    These potential cuts would have an enormous impact on our hospitals,  our nursing homes, our home health agencies, and other essential  healthcare providers who play a critical role in providing healthcare  services and also as important economic drivers in our communities.   It is critical for Congress to act quickly, to act tonight before we  go home, so seniors do not have the anxiety of wondering whether the  tax bill will somehow negatively affect their healthcare. We can act  tonight to remove that anxiety and assure them it will not.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the exchange of letters I  had with Majority Leader McConnell and also the letter from AARP be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    U.S. Senate,                                  Washington, DC, November 28, 2017.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader McConnell: I write to express my deep       concerns with the Congressional Budget Office's determination       that an automatic four percent cut to Medicare, estimated to       be roughly $25 billion for fiscal year 2018, could be       triggered by the passage of tax reform legislation as a       result of the Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (PAYGO) even though       there is no intention for such a reduction to occur.        Since I do not believe it is anyone's intention to allow       automatic cuts to Medicare to occur, I urge swift action to       waive the PAYGO requirements. Medicare provides essential       benefits to our nation's seniors, and we must remove       immediately the threat that an automatic reduction in the       program's funding could occur.        Since PAYGO was enacted, sixteen laws that would have       otherwise triggered PAYGO's automatic spending cuts have       included provisions to exclude all or part of the law's       budgetary impact, including the American Taxpayer Relief Act       of 2012 that was enacted under the previous Administration.        I look forward to working with you to ensure that no       Medicare cuts are triggered under PAYGO, a goal I believe is       supported by members on both sides of the aisle. Thank you       for your attention to this critical issue.            Sincerely,      Susan M. Collins, U.S. Senator.                                   ____                                                      U.S. Senate,                                   Washington, DC, December 1, 2017.      Hon. Susan Collins,      Dirksen Senate Office Building,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Collins: Thank you for your letter expressing       concern about the across-the-board spending cuts. You will be       pleased to know that Speaker Paul Ryan and I issued the       following joint statement earlier today:        ``Critics of tax reform are claiming the legislation would       lead to massive, across-the-board spending cuts in vital       programs--including a 4-percent reduction in Medicare--due to       the Pay-Go law enacted in 2010. This will not happen.       Congress has readily available methods to waive this law,       which has never been enforced since its enactment. There is       no reason to believe that Congress would not act again to       prevent a sequester, and we will work to ensure these       spending cuts are prevented.''        Again, thank you.            Sincerely,                                                   Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader.                                   ____                                                   AARP,                                                   December 7, 2017.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      U.S. Senate,      U.S. Capitol, Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles E. Schumer,      U.S. Senate,      U.S. Capitol, Washington, DC.      Hon. Paul D. Ryan,      House of Representatives,      U.S. Capitol, Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      House of Representatives,      U.S. Capitol, Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader McConnell, Minority Leader Schumer,       Speaker Ryan, and Minority Leader Pelosi: On behalf of our       members and all Americans age 50 and older, AARP is writing       to express concerns about the potential for automatic cuts to       Medicare beginning in January 2018. AARP, with its nearly 38       million members in all 50 States and the District of       Columbia, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, represents       millions of individuals whose health care depends on       Medicare. We urge you to act now to prevent these cuts to       Medicare.        The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) recently provided an       explanation of the impact H.R. 1 and its $1.5 trillion       deficit increase will have on Medicare and other programs.       The CBO estimated that because of statutory pay-as-you-go and       the increase in the deficit, Medicare providers will be       subject to an automatic $25 billion cut in fiscal year 2018,       and additional cuts in subsequent fiscal years. According to       CBO, the automatic cuts, or sequester, would begin as soon as       January, 2018.        In a statement responding to Senator Collins's inquiry on       statutory pay-as-you-go and the risk of Medicare cuts, Leader       McConnell and Speaker Ryan provided the following assurance:       ``Congress has readily available methods to waive this law,       which has never been enforced since its enactment. There is       no reason to believe that Congress  [[Page S8235]]       would not act again to prevent a sequester, and we will work       to ensure these spending cuts are prevented.'' It is of       paramount interest to our members, and other older Americans,       that you act to prevent these spending cuts as soon as       possible.        The sudden cut to Medicare provider funding in 2018 would       have an immediate and lasting impact, including fewer       providers participating in Medicare and reduced access to       care for Medicare beneficiaries. Health care providers may       choose to stop accepting Medicare patients at a time when the       Medicare population is growing by 10,000 new beneficiaries       each day. Cutting reimbursement in 2018, and possibly each       year thereafter, would discourage health care providers from       treating this growing population. We need to protect and       strengthen the Medicare program and ensure there is a health       care workforce able and willing to take on new patients.       Furthermore, Medicare Advantage plans and Part D prescription       drug plans may charge higher premiums or cost-sharing in       future years to make up for the cuts now. These cuts also       come at a critical time in the program when providers are       adopting the new payment systems according to MACRA (P.L.       114-10) which overwhelmingly passed Congress in 2015. An       across-the-board cut to provider reimbursement will leave       health care providers fewer resources to invest in their       practices, and make them less inclined to take on risk in new       alternative payment models. The sudden payment cut will       stifle the transition toward payment based on value, having       implications for future Medicare cost growth. In any event,       Medicare beneficiaries will pay the price for these sudden       and significant cuts.        Our members and other older Americans are counting on you       to preserve their access to Medicare services, including       their doctors and hospitals. We urge you to act swiftly to       prevent automatic cuts to Medicare. If you have any questions       or need additional information, please feel free to contact       me or contact Joyce Rogers, Senior Vice President of       Government Affairs.            Sincerely,                                                 Jo Ann C. Jenkins,                                           Chief Executive Officer.     I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Young). The majority leader.                            ____________________     Mr. President, we simply cannot allow these harmful,  indiscriminate budget cuts to be triggered. It is so disturbing to see  our seniors worried about the possibility of a $25 billion cut in the  Medicare Program. That is a 4-percent reduction. That would affect  healthcare providers and healthcare services. There is no need for this  indiscriminate cut to occur.   It is critical that Congress act tonight, act immediately, so that  seniors and our disabled citizens do not have the anxiety of wondering  whether the tax bill will somehow negatively affect their healthcare.  By voting to waive the point of order, we can remove that anxiety and  prevent the indiscriminate cuts in Medicare and other essential  programs from occurring.   Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and  the waiver provisions of applicable budget resolutions, I move to waive  all applicable sections of that act and applicable budget resolutions  for purposes of the House message to accompany H.R. 1370, and I ask for  the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague from Rhode  Island, Senator Reed, in introducing the Museum and Library Services  Act of 2017. This bill would reauthorize the core programs administered  by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), which support  libraries and museums in Maine and across the country. This bill  includes important updates to improve the abilities of libraries and  museums to meet the needs of local communities.   The Museum and Library Services Act represents a commitment to  supporting libraries and museums that enrich our communities. Libraries  provide not only a wonderful learning tool, full of books, public  documents, and internet access, but also are community hubs where  citizens can meet to share and explore ideas. Likewise, great museums  do more than accumulate artifacts--they tell stories. The programs  reauthorized in this bill would help libraries and museums across Maine  and the United States better serve the public by helping with research,  planning, and programming.   The Museum and Library Services Act would make important improvements  to IMLS's ability to collaborate with states and communities. It would  reauthorize the Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA), the only  federal program that helps public libraries meet their community's  needs, enhance their services through technology, reach underserved and  rural populations, and recruit new professionals to the library field.  Ensuring that federal resources reach our rural communities is  particularly important to me, and I am pleased that this bill  highlights support for rural and tribal areas.   Every state in our country receives its share of the LSTA, which  leverages the federal investment with a state and local funding match.  In Maine, the LSTA has helped libraries lend books and other materials  by mail to reach residents in communities that do not have libraries  nearby or who are homebound. It has helped Maine libraries serve  individuals with disabilities through access to book recordings and  special media players, including braille and audio downloads. It has  helped my state improve online access to magazines, newspapers, and  reference books, and spurred innovative collaborations with schools  statewide.   The bill would also reauthorize the Museum Services Act, providing  support for museums to collaborate with schools, libraries, and  colleges and universities, and to encourage new technologies to extend  the reach of programs and museum collections. As with the LSTA, museums  are incentivized to leverage other sources of support to match the  federal investment.   This reauthorization underscores the role that libraries and museums  play in community revitalization. Libraries are important information  centers for workforce development, health information, and digital and  financial literacy. Museums are also vital community partners that work  to connect our communities to the cultural, historical, natural, and  scientific pieces of our heritage.   From providing job search resources and free internet access to  exposing children and families to enriching literary and educational  experiences, libraries and museums serve vital roles in our  communities. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.                                  ______                                         By Mr. SULLIVAN (for himself and Ms. Murkowski):   S. 2273. A bill to extend the period during which vessels that are  shorter than 79 feet in length and fishing vessels are not required to  have a permit for discharges incidental to the normal operation of the  vessel; considered and passed.                                  S. 2273         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. EXTENSION OF MORATORIUM.
