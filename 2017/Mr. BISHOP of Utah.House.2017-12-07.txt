 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from  the Speaker's table the bill (H.R. 4300) to authorize Pacific Historic  Parks to establish a commemorative display to honor members of the  United States Armed Forces who served in the Pacific Theater of World  War II, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration  in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when  the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet on Monday next, when it  shall convene at noon for morning-hour debate, and 2 p.m. for  legislative business.
