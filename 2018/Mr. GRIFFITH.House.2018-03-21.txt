 Mr. Speaker, I have heard people say that they don't  want to support a bill that makes things worse. We have people who are  terminal, whose life expectancy is measured in months, not in decades,  and how do you make things worse?   I said last week, and I repeat it today, that if I--if, and I am not,  thank God--but if I were faced with one of these heart-rendering  situations, I would take any risk, including injecting monkey urine, if  that meant I could spend a few more days, months, or years with my  children.                                time  1330    I think many people are in that same boat, and the American people  deserve a right to try. When we were doing our hearings on this, we had  an Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health hearing where Lieutenant  Commander Matthew Bellina, who graduated from Virginia Tech in my  district and served in the United States Navy, testified before us. He  said, in the conclusion of his comments: ``I know that it is probably  too late for me, and I have made my peace with that. I need to know  before I die that, if my children find themselves in this unenviable  position, this Nation that I proudly served will respect their  liberties and their right to make their own decisions about their  medical treatments.''   He suffered from ALS, as I said. I have had three friends during my  lifetime die of that: Ray Robrecht, my predecessor a couple terms back  in the Virginia House of Delegates; Julie Mullins, whose family I have  known for decades; and Mike Ahern, who was connected with the United  States Senate through his sister. All of these folks were people who  lived in Salem County or Roanoke County, and they all died from ALS.  They were all brave people. They should have had the right to try to  see if they could make an improvement for others.   Even more poignant are my family friends who lost both a grandparent  and their mother to Huntington's chorea. I was their family lawyer. I  did their will. I would like to believe, and I know they would have  liked the option, that their mother would have chosen the right to try,  knowing that, even if it failed, it might help another generation  because, as you know, Huntington's chorea is a genetically transmitted  disease.  [[Page H1744]]    So I do not understand why people are afraid of letting people try  who have no other hope, whose life is going to be cut short, without  taking that Hail Mary pass. And so I hope that everyone will support  this reasonable, measured effort to let people have a choice and a  right to try.
