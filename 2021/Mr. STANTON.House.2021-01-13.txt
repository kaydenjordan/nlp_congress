 Madam Speaker, Donald Trump is the first President in  the history of this Republic to incite a violent insurrection against  our own government, against our own people. It is a shocking betrayal  of his oath of office and our American values. We don't know yet if the  President will face criminal charges, but we do know he must be held to  account.   Each one of us in this House took an oath to protect and defend our  Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic, even if that  enemy is the President.   We must move forward as a nation from these darkest days, but we  can't move forward without accountability. We must impeach this  President.
