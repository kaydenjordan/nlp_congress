 Mr. President, along with my colleagues Senator  Mike Crapo and Representative Mike Simpson, I rise to congratulate the  Paulos Family on their 100th anniversary of having a Chevrolet  Franchise continuously in operation.   On February 22, 1922, Con Paulos' grandfather, Gus A. Paulos, opened  a Chevrolet franchise in Magna, UT. After Gus was killed in an  automobile accident, his sons carried on the family business for 42  years in Utah.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S611, February 9, 2022, in the second column, the  following appears: On Februav 22, 1922, Con Paulos' grandfather,  Gus A. Paulos, opened a Chevrolet franchise in Magna, UT      The online Record has been corrected to read: On February 22,  1922, Con Paulos' grandfather, Gus A. Paulos, opened a Chevrolet  franchise in Magna, UT    ========================= END NOTE =========================      In 1975, Pete G. Paulos and Ernest A. Paulos, along with their sons    Con P. Paulos and Gus E. Paulos, moved the store from Magna to West  Valley City, UT. In 1979, Con P. Paulos moved to Jerome, ID, and opened  Con Paulos Chevrolet, which is the only Paulos family-owned store that    continues to operate.With the help of his outstanding staff, Con has  built his business reputation on providing quality automobiles to his  loyal customers honestly and ethically. Con has not only created a  successful business, he has also become an important part of the Magic  Valley region and the State through his community leadership. He is  committed to growing, improving, and developing the local economy,  while furthering opportunities for fellow Idahoans. For years, Con has  participated in many community service projects and organizations: 60  Hours to Fight Hunger, Santa's Cause, Sleep in Heavenly Peace, Sub for  Santa, Boys & Girls Club, Rising Stars, Valley House, Business Plus,  Chamber of Commerce, the Greater Twin Falls Area Transportation  Committee, and the Rotary Club, to name just a few.   In our tenure serving Idaho in the statehouse and in Congress, we  have had the opportunity to work with Con on many important State and  national issues. He is someone we trust to provide valuable insight and  advice on many subjects. In addition, we have had the pleasure of  recreating with Con in various settings, including a duck blind in  Hagerman and on the links of Blue Lakes Country Club. Con is a straight  shooter in the field, on the golf course, in his business, family,  community, and his life.   Today, the fourth generation of the Paulos family, Peter ``Costa''  Paulos, is actively helping Con operate the dealership, continuing the  family's legacy. Costa also recently added a new member to the Paulos  family with the birth of Gus, Con's new grandson. Foreshadowing the  future, Baby Gus could possibly keep the Paulos family Chevrolet line  intact for a remarkable fifth generation.   Congratulations to Con, his family, and all the employees of Con  Paulos Chevrolet on 100 years of outstanding service to Magic Valley,  ID and the Nation. You make our great State proud, and we look forward  to your continued growth and success.                            ____________________
