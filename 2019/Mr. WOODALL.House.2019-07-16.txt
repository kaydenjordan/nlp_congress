 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I don't want to put any pressure on you, Mr. Speaker, but it comforts  me to see you as the Chair up there today. There are those days where  you need particular leaders to be there at a particular time, and I  will tell you that I am not telling anybody in this Chamber anything  they don't already know: You have made an entire career in this  institution reaching out, building unlikely alliances, making it work  where other folks said it could not work. And when my friend from  Maryland, whom I thank for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, talks  about what it is our constituents expect, what it is our citizenry  expects, I think they expect that, Mr. Speaker, and we have one of  those bills before us today in the intelligence reauthorization act.   There is more in this rule, Mr. Speaker, than I believe I have seen  in any rule in my 9 years in Congress and years serving on staff here.  We packed it all in there last night, and I don't want to miss the lead  on this rule, which is an intelligence bill that is named after two  congressional staffers who passed away last year. They spent their  lives in service to this institution and to the intelligence community,  and we are grateful for that service.   If you have not looked at the intelligence community recently, Mr.  Speaker, you will see Devin Nunes on the Republican side of the aisle  and Adam Schiff leading it on the Democratic side of the aisle. I can  picture those two faces because I usually see them on split screens on  FOX or MSNBC, and I can't think of many things they have had to say  where they agreed with one another over the past 4, 5 years, and yet we  have a bill today in sharp contrast to the partisan nonsense that was  the NDAA operation last week.   We have a bill that has come out of the Intelligence Committee with  two strident, passionate Republican and Democratic leaders there on the  Intelligence Committee, that came out unanimously, that they presented  unanimously in front of the Rules Committee last night and we have a  chance to pass here on the floor of the House.   You also find in this rule, Mr. Speaker, 31 amendments that have been  made in order to that intelligence reauthorization bill. Even though we  found bipartisanship in the committee, even though we found unanimity  in the committee, the Rules Committee, in its wisdom, last night,  decided to make 31 more ideas available to be considered here on the  floor of the House.  [[Page H5838]]    You see in this rule, Mr. Speaker, the ability for the House to take  up Arms Export Control Act measures. These are also measures you are  going to find bipartisan support for, also measures that you will find,  again, as my friend from Maryland referenced, the House doing what you  would expect the House to do, what our bosses back home sent us here to  do.   I know, Mr. Speaker, that there are times when folks feel their  deeply held beliefs cannot be compromised for the sake of  bipartisanship. I find that trying to find a way to get to yes is  better than trying to find a way to get to no. There is always a reason  to get to no.   Instead of looking for ways to oppose our political rivals, we have  to act as the Intelligence Committee did, in a manner where we can find  issues on which we agree. It is the only way to move this process  forward.   Mr. Speaker, America's national security and that of our allies,  which is what the intelligence community helps to protect and support  every day, is about more than scoring political points.   I mentioned those split screens on the TV where you do see folks  lobbing accusations back and forth. Sometimes it seems to be political  sport instead of serious legislating.   The measure we have before us today is not political sport; it is  serious legislating. And we are going to have a chance to come together  as a House not just to discuss it, not just to improve it, but to  implement it.   Mr. Speaker, among the things that you will find in this bill, the  foreign influences around the globe, and we have talked about them in  all of their various incarnations here on the floor of the House over  the last 2 weeks. This bill requires a report on China's influence over  Taiwanese elections.   Chinese influence around the globe is at an unparalleled high. We are  now rivaled by the Chinese in every single aspect of international  influence and policy, but they have outsized influence in Taiwan, and  we require that report.   We require a report not just on Russian interference in our  elections, Mr. Speaker, but in elections across the globe. It would be  naive to suggest that the Russians would limit their influence in  elections to trying to manipulate the greatest and freest country in  the world. They are working across the globe to influence elections  wherever free people live.   Combating Chinese and Russian aggression in elections, Mr. Speaker,  is not something, as is so often told in the media, that divides us; it  is something that unites us. We saw that in the Intelligence Committee,  and we are going to see that here on the floor of the House, and I am  very proud of that. I wish we could have continued that effort, Mr.  Speaker.   I agree with every word my friend from Maryland said about standing  up for Article I. Of all of my frustrations of 9 years in this  institution, the deference of the United States Congress to the  executive branch has been my greatest frustration. It exists for one  reason and one reason only, and that is that men and women, colleagues  like my friend from Maryland and I, have been unable to find a way to  speak with one voice on issues that are Article I versus Article II  issues.   Go down the list in your time in Congress, Mr. Speaker, whether it is  the contempt resolution this institution passed for former Attorney  General Eric Holder, that contempt resolution that passed on party-line  votes in committee and party-line votes here on the floor of the House  and went down to the executive branch where absolutely no action was  taken on it whatsoever; take production of papers, whether on Fast and  Furious or whether on the Census, production of papers, whether from  the President's counsel or from the President's press secretary, we  have these discussions and we cannot--no, we have not found a way to  come together to speak with one voice.   We have an opportunity, a model. You will remember some number of  weeks ago--now, months ago, Mr. Speaker--where we were very concerned  in this Chamber about anti-Semitic remarks that were broadcast in the  public domain. We came together as an institution to speak out against  anti-Semitism.   It didn't happen overnight. In fact, my friend from Maryland authored  that resolution, to his credit. But he didn't sit down with a pen and  put some words on a page and bring it here to the floor for  consideration. He had to work it. And I don't mean work it a little  bit; I mean work it hard: it was coming; it was not coming; it was  coming again; it was not coming. To find a pathway forward so that this  House speaks with one voice instead of divided voices was an effort  that was put in.   Now, granted, at the end of the day, it was a little more milquetoast  than the resolution that I would have drafted, but sometimes that is  the trade you make to be able to expand the acceptance of a resolution,  Mr. Speaker.   Every single time in this Chamber, as it comes to reining in Article  II or reining in the judicial branch, every single time we speak with a  divided voice, we weaken this institution.   I have never seen a resolution that tried to hold two Cabinet  Secretaries in contempt at the same time. Maybe that has happened  historically; I don't know that answer. I have not seen it in my time.   I heard last night from the chairman of the House Oversight Committee  and the ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, and the  ranking member was unwavering in his commitment to Article I and our  preeminence in the constitutional model. But he was also unwavering in  his commitment to there is more that we could do to work with the  administration as opposed to begin to poke that sharp stick, and so  this resolution does not have his support.   Well, if we begin our effort to do oversight over the administration  and we are already divided before that bill even leaves committee, I  tell you, Mr. Speaker, we are not going to have the outcome that we  want here on the floor of the House.   And then, of course, this rule in those contempt efforts is targeting  a United States citizenship question that would have gone on the  Census. We talk about that as if that is an outrageous thing.   I appreciate the kind words my friend from Maryland had to say about  President Lincoln. I am going to have to get the Clerk to read them  back to me because I am going to use that over and over again about a  wonderful Republican President, but I want to use the words that Mr.  Raskin used.   But when President Lincoln was presiding over this land, it was  common practice to have a citizenship question on the United States  Census.                                time  1300    In fact, every single Census from 1820 to 1950 had a citizenship  question on it. It was noncontroversial. In 1950, we took it off of the  short form; it moved to the long form. And so from 1970 to 2000, that  question was on the long form every single Census. And then in 2000, we  took it off the long form and we put it onto the American Community  Survey, that half-decade measure that goes out to create the data that  Mr. Raskin rightly noted is so important to all of our communities back  home.   If, for the first time in American history, in the history of the  Census, we decide that citizenship is somehow now a forbidden topic,  that we can't find a way to discuss it, that it is not important to who  we are as a Nation and how it is that we look at ourselves, fair  enough.   That is not what the Supreme Court case was about, Mr. Speaker. As we  well know, the Supreme Court case simply said: You can put a question  about citizenship on the Census if you want to. You just didn't do it  the right way, and so we are going to ask you not to do it that way.  There are those ways and means of getting that done. You just didn't do  it the right way.   I raise that, Mr. Speaker, not because I am a Census guru. I am not.  I don't serve on any of those relevant committees. But in this era of  outrage, where folks have begun to confuse civility with weakness--and  that is a confusion that I think is to all of our detriments--the  desire to have a question about citizenship on the Census has nothing  to do with this President, this administration, Republicans, Democrats.  It has been that way since 1820.   Thoughtful men and women, concerned men and women, serious  legislators have been interested in this information for over 100  years.   If we want to have the conversation that somehow citizenship can't be  discussed anymore and we should ban it  [[Page H5839]]  from all Census documentation forever, I don't think that would  succeed, but it is certainly a legitimate topic of debate. But what is  not legitimate is to suggest that the only reason that anyone would ask  about citizenship is to pursue some sort of nefarious, xenophobic  purpose. It is simply not true.   I represent a majority minority constituency, Mr. Speaker. Twenty-six  percent of my bosses are first-generation Americans. You want to find  folks who love America, come down to where I live, find folks who have  waited in line, folks who have paid their money, folks who pinned all  their hopes and dreams to, ``If and only if I can get there, my  children and my grandchildren will have a better life.''   That is what brought us all here at one generation or another.  Whether you came in 1650 or whether you came in 1950 or whether you  came yesterday, those are the dreams that bring us here.   There is a lot to be outraged about in today's culture, but I haven't  seen any of it get fixed by being more outraged.   I have seen it get fixed by men and women like yourself, Mr. Speaker,  who value trust, who value candor, who value honesty, and who value  real relationships.   Anything that is hard, I can't solve with someone I don't trust. If  one side is good and one side is evil, where do you go from there? What  does that negotiation look like? That is not a conversation; that is  you have got to now destroy one another. That seems to be the path that  folks too often opt for in politics today.   There is more that unites us than divides us in this constitution and  in this country, Mr. Speaker. You might not know that by the parts of  this rule that are going to get the most attention today.   Adam Schiff, Devin Nunes, there are not two Members in this  institution who feel more strongly and differently about the direction  of public policy than those two men, and they came together, not to  advance themselves, but to advance the Nation. They came together, not  because it was easy, but precisely because it was hard and necessary,  and brought us this bipartisan package we have today.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Massachusetts, the chairman of  the Rules Committee, for bringing that resolution to the floor, and I  hope we will have ample time to celebrate those successes.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I think I misunderstood my friend from Massachusetts. I  think what my friend said is he does not care whether his words coarsen  this institution, he does not care whether or not his positions  diminish us as an institution, he does not care about the rules of this  institution, which prohibit exactly the kind of words that he knows  they prohibit and yet he uses anyway.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to ask my friend if he believes that his  cause of admonishing this President is going to be advantaged by  diminishing this institution?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern).    Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time. If the President  believes every word that he said, does that excuse his behavior, in the  gentleman's mind? Does it excuse his behavior to believe it?    Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time. It is a perfectly  legitimate assertion and attestation my friend from Massachusetts  makes, and of course we all share that belief.   Mr. Speaker, when I was down here for the rule last week with my  friend from Massachusetts, the other side was admonished, not once, but  twice for violating the House rules for coarsening our debate, for  diminishing our civility, for violating our rules; not a social  contract about how we ought to treat each other, but rules where we  have committed about how we will treat each other.   Today during 1 minute speeches, Mr. Speaker, not once, but twice the  Chair admonished the other side to say: You are breaking our rules of  civility. You are violating our standards of decorum. Our children are  watching, and your behavior doesn't pass muster.   And now my friend--and he is my friend and I admire his work--he is  passionate in the causes for which he advocates, and I believe that it  is his passion, not his contempt for this institution, that leads him  to say those things that he says. I believe he loves this institution,  but he is misguided, when the Chair admonishes him again today now, and  he has no apologies for his colleagues, no apologies for this  institution.   We do have serious issues. I am not meaning serious like Russia and  China, which those are serious, I don't mean serious like the hate that  is fomenting in this country, which is serious. I mean all of it that  is serious that nobody in this institution can solve unless we solve it  together, and I want to find that pathway forward. This isn't it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend, the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. McGovern).                                time  1315     Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time.   Mr. Speaker, does the gentleman remember when   Joe Wilson  apologized, which is more than what my friend from Massachusetts has  done when the House has condemned him from the Chair today?   I remember when my friend Mr. Wilson lost his temper. I do remember  it. And I remember him apologizing for it because he didn't want to  bring shame on this institution.   I would welcome any time the Chair admonishes either side of the  aisle for violating our rules, coarsening our debate, doing those  things that we all agree we don't want our children to see on TV, I  welcome folks to correct that behavior.   Mr. Speaker, I fear my comments are falling on deaf ears, but I hope  I am mistaken.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                            Parliamentary Inquiry     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   While my friend from Texas is sometimes known for running over the  gavel at the end of her comments, it is only because it comes from the  heart. When I think about Members in this institution who are  unhampered by a lack of passion, I think of my friend from Texas. But  when I look for an honest broker, who will be true to her word and  partner when partnership is required, my friend from Texas embodies  that, as well. I appreciate both her words and her restraint here this  morning.    I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I thank my friend from  Texas. I think that is a welcome invitation.   Mr. Speaker, thinking about the policies before us today, if we  defeat the previous question, I will amend the rule to bring H.R. 3965  to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record immediately preceding the vote on the previous  question.    Mr. Speaker, you have heard a lot about the  controversial citizenship question in the Census. Whether or not it  should be controversial is a different issue altogether.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Comer).    Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time is remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Jordan), my good friend and the ranking member on the House  Oversight and Reform Committee.    Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, again, I regret that there is so much that is packed  into this rule. It is one of the reasons I urged defeat of the rule  today.   Everyone in this Chamber wants to vote to have this debate on the  national intelligence reauthorization bill. Everybody wants to be a  part of that. Again, 31 amendments made in order will improve that  bill, a bipartisan product coming out of a very contentious committee.   The rest of these issues are more complex. And I don't mean complex  because we shouldn't discuss them. We should. I mean complex because we  haven't discussed them.   I think I am prepared to yield time if the gentleman needs it. I know  my friend from Maryland is not the author of the resolution condemning  the President, but the gentleman mentioned my friend from Texas (Mr.  Olson) and Mr. Olson's comments on the Republican side of the aisle.   I ask the gentleman, was Mr. Olson consulted to try to create the  language that we see before us today?   I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Was the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Olson) consulted as we  tried to draft this language that is before us today?   I yield to the gentleman.    Reclaiming my time, was Mr. Upton, who the gentleman  referenced as having sympathetic words to say, was the gentleman  consulted about the drafting of this resolution?   I yield to the gentleman.    Reclaiming my time, so Mr. Kasich was also not consulted  and Ms. Murkowski also not consulted.   Mr. Speaker, if we are talking about a serious issue and we are going  to craft a serious response and we want to speak with one voice from  this institution, might it be a good idea for there to be at least one  conversation between Democrats and Republicans about how to proceed?   Might it be a good idea to have more than one conversation?   Might it be a good idea to put partisanship aside and actually do  those things that I know my friend from Maryland wants to do and I want  to do arm in arm with him?   We keep missing opportunities in this Congress, Mr. Speaker,  opportunities to make this institution stronger, opportunities to make  this Nation stronger. We are missing them, and we are creating scars  along the way.   What could be an operation in building trust has become an operation  in building distrust.   What could be an operation designed to heal, I suspect, is going to  be an operation that brings more needless pain.   We have a good bill in the intelligence reauthorization, Mr. Speaker.  We have a good series of bills in arms export control. We could be down  here talking about those because of the bipartisan work that has gone  into it already.   Not one conversation has been had between tweets over a weekend and a  resolution condemning those on the floor of the House, not one effort  made to speak with one voice in the United States House. That tells you  just about everything someone needs to know about why this resolution  is on the floor with these two contempt resolutions in this place at  this time.   Mr. Speaker, I urge defeat of the rule. I urge defeat of the previous  question.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
