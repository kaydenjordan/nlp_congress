 Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay  tribute to a valued member of my staff, Rosaline Cohen, who is retiring  after more than two decades of exceptional service to the United States  House of Representatives.   Since 2007, Rosaline has been the chief Democratic counsel for the  Committee on Homeland Security, where she has had an enviable track  record of legislative accomplishments and a reputation for reaching  bipartisan agreement.   Rosaline has been a steadfast and strategic partner of mine since I  was named ranking member of the committee in 2005, and her service has  spanned some two decades. We are so privileged to have had her.   Rosaline was working for former Congressman Ken Bentsen of Texas on  September 11, 2001. When her office was evacuated, Rosaline sheltered  most of her colleagues in her basement apartment on Capitol Hill.   Little did she know that 6 years later, in her first year as chief  counsel of the Homeland Security Committee, Rosaline would spearhead  House-Senate conference negotiations over legislation I introduced on  behalf of the Democratic majority to fully implement the  recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. It was called H.R. 1, and we  thank her for that.   I know Rosaline's many accomplishments are a source of pride for her  family. On behalf of the Homeland Security Committee members, past and  present, the entire committee staff, I ask my colleagues to join me in  congratulating Rosaline on her retirement and wishing her all the best  in the future.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman  from Connecticut for yielding.   I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 5525, a bill more designed  to appease the extreme MAGA wing of the Republican Party than to stave  off a government shutdown.   With just hours remaining before our Nation is thrust into an  unnecessary shutdown, the House is being forced to waste time on a  measure that would impose draconian cuts to vital Federal programs and  compel the enactment of H.R. 2, the child deportation act.   When we considered H.R. 2 in May, I called it a cruel, extreme,  unworkable immigration and border security measure.   Time has not been kind to the bill.   It still would wreck our economy, cripple our ports of entry, destroy  the asylum system, criminalize visa overstays, force unaccompanied  children into dangerous situations, jail families and children  indefinitely, and on top of all that, worsen conditions at the border.   The child deportation act would upend CBP's ability to process  migrants at ports of entry and bar funding to humanitarian  organizations that provide shelter, transportation, and legal  assistance to children and families fleeing horrific conditions.   Moreover, it does nothing to stem the deadly flow of fentanyl into  the United States.   The Senate will not take up H.R. 5525, and it will never go to the  President's desk. The House must come together today and stop coddling  extreme MAGA members looking to get former President Trump's failed  illegal and immoral policies enacted into law. I urge my colleagues to  join me in defeating H.R. 5525 and call upon the Speaker to have the  House consider the Senate's bipartisan continuing resolution.
