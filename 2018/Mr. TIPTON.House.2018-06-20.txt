 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for  yielding.   This is really about creating jobs on American soil, creating  opportunities, literally, for our families to be able to have better  prospects for the future.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to be able to talk about, not only America,  but the world's energy future. In my district of Colorado, we benefit  from vast energy resources. In 2016, we learned that one of these  resources, natural gas, has even greater potential than initially  thought.                                time  1800    The U.S. Geological Survey announced that the Mancos shale formation  in Piceance Basin had the potential to be the second largest natural  gas deposit in the United States. The abundance of natural gas in  western Colorado puts us in the unique position to be able to create  jobs here at home and also to supply American allies with reliable  sources of energy well into the future.  [[Page H5355]]    For too long, our Nation's adversaries have supplied America's allies  with energy resources. We cannot let countries like Russia lead in the  global energy market when the U.S. has the resources to be able to  supply countries in Europe and Asia with affordable and reliable  energy.   Last year I called on the administration to examine a project that  would allow for the U.S. to send LNG to Asian markets. The proposed  Pacific Connector Gas Pipeline would transfer the natural gas from  Piceance Basin in western Colorado to the Jordan Cove terminal in Coos  Bay, Oregon.   The Jordan Cove terminal is estimated to have the capacity to be able  to transport 7.8 million metric tons of LNG annually to the Pacific  Northwest and Asia. Unfortunately, under the previous administration,  the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission denied the application for the  Jordan Cove project, citing a lack of global demand. Not long after the  application was denied, Jordan Cove procured an agreement for 75  percent of the pipeline's capacity, proving that there is demand for  U.S. LNG in Asia.   It is my hope that FERC will soon approve the resubmitted application  for the Jordan Cove project and we can bring good-paying jobs to  western Colorado and send clean, affordable, and reliable energy to  Asia.   As the U.S. works to advance technologies that decrease the  environmental footprint of energy production, it cannot be ignored that  countries like China and India continue to be some of the world's top  polluters. We can responsibly develop U.S. natural gas resources to be  able to benefit communities across our Nation and by transporting our  energy resources to countries around the globe. The United States can  have a measurable impact on the economies and environmental health of  communities overseas.   The United States cannot sit back and let other countries lead the  world into the energy future. The time for responsible development of  natural gas is now and to be able to create jobs here at home.
