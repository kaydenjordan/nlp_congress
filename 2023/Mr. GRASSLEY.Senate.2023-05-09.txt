 Mr. President, in 1988, President Ronald Reagan first  recognized May as National Foster Care Month. Every year since then,  the month of May has been recognized as a time to bring awareness to  the needs of America's young people who are placed in foster care. It  is also important to recognize organizations in Iowa and around the  country tirelessly serving kids and families in our foster care system.   I salute these organizations and individuals for their year-round  efforts to support the kids, kids who are most in need.   In 2021, there were nearly 400,000 kids in foster care. More than  4,000 of those 400,000 are in my home State of Iowa.   Older youth in foster care and adults who experienced foster care as  a child can speak to what worked for them and what didn't work. They  should have a seat at the table and a voice in making policy about  foster care.   When I founded the Senate Caucus on Foster Youth in 2009, the very  special focus of the caucus was to hear directly from young people in  foster care. We also wanted to hear from those who had been aged out of  the system without having a permanent place to call home.   Over and over again, I have heard an urgent point of view from these  young people and also the teenagers who are in foster care. What I  heard was that they would like some permanence. They would say it like  they would like to have a mom and dad. They would like to have a  family. They would want a place to call home, instead of being shuffled  around--maybe two or three different schools in 1 year, which means two  or three different foster homes in that year.   All children, no matter of their circumstances then, deserve a  permanent, loving home. They need consistent, caring adults in their  lives. This year during foster care month, I want to give special  recognition to families who answer the call to help vulnerable children  and the teens in their communities.   My resolution recognizing National Foster Care Month also marks May  31 as a very particular day to celebrate and show appreciation to  foster parents.   Throughout my years in the U.S. Senate, I have worked to keep  families together. For example, I have expanded access to prevention  services to help parents safely keep custody of their children during  substance abuse treatment. The family, as we all know, is the bedrock  of our society, so we must work to strengthen the family in the hopes  of keeping vulnerable children out of foster care in the first place.   At the same time, it is important that we support the very people who  are taking care of these kids--the ones we call foster parents. They  answer the call to take into their homes children and teens who have  experienced trauma in their very young lives. Foster parents--all of  them--deserve recognition and support.   In Iowa, almost every county has a shortage of foster parents who are  able to provide temporary homes for these young people. Without  volunteer foster parents, kids who cannot remain safely at home often  end up sleeping in hotels or in offices of social workers.   I have introduced a bipartisan bill called the Recruiting Families  Using Data Act. This legislation would improve how States recruit  foster parents and help ensure that they are supported and actually  heard. It would help States conduct targeted recruitment for specific  areas of need and help kids get matched with the best families for  their individual circumstances.   We know that having at least one loving adult in the lives of these  young people can meaningfully improve the academic, the social, and the  emotional well-being of these kids. That positive experience lasts long  into adulthood.   When family reunification is not an option--and that ought to be the  first  [[Page S1562]]  option--we know that adoption can provide a permanent, loving home for  a child in need. Recent data show that adoptions from foster care is  declining, with 12,000 fewer children having been adopted in 2021 than  in 2019. Currently, more than 100,000 young people in foster care are  waiting for adoption across our country, including more than 1,000 in  my State of Iowa. By improving support for foster families, we can help  increase adoptions for kids who are placed in foster care.   Moving forward, Congress must continue to work to find more solutions  and secure better outcomes for youth in foster care. Whether the best  choice is family reunification or adoption or living with relatives,  the goal is always and must be the same: to protect kids from neglect  and from abuse and to provide them with love and with support.   I urge my colleagues to pass my resolution to recognize May as  National Foster Care Month.   Once again, I will continue to lead efforts with members of our  bipartisan Senate Caucus on Foster Youth to help these young Americans  achieve their full potential and have a place to call home for the rest  of their lives.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today, May 9, is National Fentanyl  Awareness Day. In the last 12 months, over 108,000 Americans have died  from drug overdoses, mainly from fentanyl and its analogues. Fentanyl  overdoses are the number one cause of death for Americans between the  ages of 18 and 45, so I come to the floor to do two things.   First, I am here to introduce a bipartisan resolution supporting the  goals of National Fentanyl Awareness Day. The resolution aims to  increase awareness of the impact of fake or counterfeit fentanyl pills  on families and young people. And it applauds the work of Federal,  State, and local law enforcement agencies that combat the proliferation  of counterfeit pills.   And second, I am here to reintroduce my bipartisan legislation, the  Stop Pills That Kill Act. This bill creates new penalties for  counterfeit pill production. There is a surge throughout the United  States of counterfeit pills laced with fentanyl and fentanyl analogues.  People unknowingly take these counterfeit pills. Many of them die. Drug  traffickers have been marketing and selling these fake pills using  social media. The Stop Pills That Kill Act will ramp up criminal  penalties to deter this illegal activity and save lives.   Later this week, the Senate Judiciary Committee will mark up another  bill I cosponsor, the Cooper Davis Act. This bipartisan bill requires  social media companies, the same places where these fake pills are  being sold, to report information to Federal Agencies relating to  illicit online fentanyl on their platforms. The reporting requirements  will help law enforcement root out and dismantle international crime  networks and save lives. I look forward to reporting the bill out of  committee and quickly getting it to the President's desk.   Whether it is at my roundtables in Iowa or during my 99-county  meetings, parents continue to come up to me and tell me about the  children they have lost to fentanyl poisoning. It is heartbreaking to  see the pain on their face and hear it in their voice, as they share  what the fentanyl crisis has done to their family.   I hope we see action to move these bills and permanently schedule  fentanyl related substances. I am as committed as ever to cracking down  on fentanyl and its analogues, and I hope my colleagues will join me  soon.                            ____________________
