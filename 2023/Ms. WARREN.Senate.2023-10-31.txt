 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my chief of  staff, Jon Donenberg, be allowed to join me on the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an extraordinary  public servant who is leaving my office for a new role.   Jon Donenberg has been one of my most trusted senior advisers since  2011, when I first ran for the U.S. Senate. After his stint advising me  on policy during the 2012 campaign, I asked Jon to serve as my first  legislative director in my Senate office. Jon was my LD for 6 years,  then senior adviser and policy director for Warren for President, and,  for the last 4 years, he has served as my chief of staff.   After nearly a dozen years of working together, I have come to know  Jon pretty well. So I can say with some authority that he is one of the  best policy nerds and sharpest minds on economic policy in the  business.   When I arrived in the Senate, I knew more than pretty much anybody  else in the world about a very specific slice of commercial law. I also  spent a lot of time thinking about how middle-class families were  getting crushed by an economy that didn't work for them and thinking  through how to fix it. And this was a good a start. But being a Senator  means doing work on a much, much broader range of issues.   Jon was the person I turned to for counsel as I developed that  broader agenda, drawing on his deep expertise with policy, his facility  for digging into data, and his formidable technical training. Also,  importantly, Jon has good values--the longstanding belief that  government is here to serve not the richest and most powerful, not  those who can hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers, but here to serve  the people who are trying to build a future for themselves and their  families.   Jon and I were a good match, and, when I say that, I am not saying  that we always saw our next moves the same way. But he has a lightning- quick mind, a staggering command of both domestic and foreign policy  topics, and instincts honed by years of working in Congress, and those  qualities allowed him to see around corners I didn't even know existed.  He is good with numbers, and he has never been afraid to change his  mind based on what the data has shown him.   Our relationship has always been energetic. Jon hasn't been afraid to  tangle with me when he thought I was getting something wrong. He would  tell me I was making a mistake, and I would tell him he didn't know  what he was talking about. We would size each other up, and I would  start lobbing fastballs at him, just like I was back in the classroom,  trying to figure out if a student had done reading and was on solid  ground in their arguments.   Jon, of course, has always, always done the reading. He would grab  those fastballs out of the air and zing them back at me with a spin,  often highlighting an aspect to the issue I had failed to consider.   Sometimes, I would try a new angle and play the devil's advocate to  see if he could defend his position, back and forth, until I had--often  in the space of 10 or 15 minutes--pressure-tested an argument more  thoroughly than seemed possible. Now, I am not saying Jon won all of  those arguments, but I would give him a 50-50 lifetime record, which is  pretty respectable in my book. And I would also say this: 100 percent  of the time, my thinking about an issue got deeper and sharper as a  result of running my views through the gauntlet of Jon's scrutiny.  [[Page S5250]]    Given all of these attributes, it should come as no surprise that Jon  had a very specialized skill that is rarely employed among adults  outside elected office: Jon was a wiz at debate prep. He has worked  with me and several other Senators during our races, helping candidates  prepare for preelection debates. He put all of us through our paces,  forcing us to confront the frustration--and the opportunities--of  butting heads with our opponents, and doing it in 1-minute chunks. For  all of us who managed to survive those debates far better than we  expected, we owe Jon our thanks.    When he came to work for me, Jon brought with him years of experience  in Congress. Before joining my office, Jon served as chief counsel to  Senator Richard Blumenthal. Before then, he served as a health law  advisor to Representative Henry Waxman on the House Oversight and  Government Reform Committee and the House Energy and Commerce  Committee.   I asked Henry Waxman for a few words about Jon, and he had this to  say:         Jon started his congressional career as a precocious young       staffer in my office working on the Affordable Care Act. He's       leaving Senator Warren's staff as a veteran chief of staff       with many distinguished legislative accomplishments. What's       been constant is the gratitude and respect he has earned from       everyone who has been lucky enough to work with him along the       way.    Jon's first experience working in Congress has a special resonance  for me: Jon was a legal fellow for Senator Ted Kennedy, the senior  Senator from Massachusetts who served for 47 years in the seat I now  hold. I think Senator Kennedy would be pleased to know that the young  man he first brought in for work in the Federal legislature ended up  contributing so much to this work.   There is one more aspect of Jon's leadership that I want to make sure  to highlight. He is a dedicated mentor who has trained scores of policy  staffers in how to make this country work better for families who don't  always have someone in government looking out for them. Year after  year, I have observed as Jon invests in the staff on my team and  throughout government--supporting them, teaching them, and challenging  them, and always, always, always making them better at what they do.   Congress is a hard place to work in, in a lot of ways. Jon often  tells me that trying to make change by working in the Senate can feel a  lot like running face-first into a brick wall, over and over and over  again. You have to keep standing up and sprinting back at the wall  because, even though history suggests you are going to smack right into  it, just like last time, the only way you will ever smash through the  bricks is by taking one more run at it.   Jon is the kind of colleague who makes you want to take one more run  at knocking down the wall that has never been knocked down before--the  one who will help you dust yourself off and then sprint along beside  him.   I have watched as these staffers who Jon has trained have transformed  from eager, gifted beginners into seasoned strategists. Jon and I have  stood proudly, side by side, as we have seen them leave our office and  take their talents to go make change somewhere else. Jon's commitment  to mentorship means that today we have more dedicated public servants  doing topnotch work all around the country and doing it better because  of their time learning from him.   Now Jon is the one who is taking his talents to another public  service post. He is headed to the White House to serve as Deputy  Director of the National Economic Council. I know Jon will bring with  him to this position an abiding commitment to helping working families,  as well as one of the best policy brains in the business.   One last note: Jon is a good man. He is honest. He is principled. He  is generous. He is funny. He cares about people. He loves his family  deeply, and he is always there for his friends. He tries to live his  life every day according to deeply held moral values. I admire him.   So, Jon, I am grateful down to my toes for the years that we have  worked together. I will miss having you by my side, but I know that the  President, the Nation, and the world will be better off because of the  challenges you will help tackle in this new role. Thank you for your  work, both past and present and future. Thank you.   I yield the floor.
