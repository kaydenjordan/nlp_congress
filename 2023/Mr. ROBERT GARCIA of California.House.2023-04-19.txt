 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman  for yielding time.   Mr. Chair, I rise today in anger and strong opposition to this bill.  Now, I know how painful life can be as an openly gay person, but that  pales in comparison to what transgender Americans face every day.   Our voters send us here to address our country's biggest challenges,  but instead of taking that responsibility seriously, House Republicans  are choosing to bully and belittle trans children. This is about  attacking a small group of children, and it is shameful.   These people don't give a damn about women or girls. If they did, we  would be talking about the very real problems of paid equity and  ensuring sports are safe from sexual harassment and abuse, but instead,  they are peddling open bigotry and its disgusting BS culture war right  here from the House floor. Why are Republicans so obsessed with  attacking trans youth and children? We need answers.   To the trans and nonbinary youth that are watching this, I am so  sorry your government is failing you today. We will never stop fighting  to defend your dignity and your humanity. We love you.
