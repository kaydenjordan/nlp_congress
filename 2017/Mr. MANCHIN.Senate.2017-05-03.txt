 Mr. President, first of all, I cannot express how  humbled I am and how proud I am of all of us, and my colleagues here,  my dear friend Senator Warner. We were Governors together. We split the  Virginias--Virginia and West Virginia. We worked together. He has the  same constituency base I have in West Virginia, in Southwest Virginia,  and all of West Virginia. He knows the mining industry. He knows the  hard-working people.   To Senator Donnelly from Indiana, we have been there together with  the coal miners and the people who moved the coal and do the hard  lifting. To Senator McCaskill from Missouri, Senator Casey from  Pennsylvania--Pennsylvania has a rich tradition in coal mining--Senator  Klobuchar and everyone who has spoken, and I want to thank the  Presiding Officer too. He was an original cosponsor from Arkansas. So  this is truly bipartisan. From Arkansas, the Presiding Officer  understands hard-working people. He signed on to the bill without  hesitation. I want to thank him. So it was really a team effort.   People have been talking about all of the things and the passion we  have for different things. My passion comes from the people I was born  and raised and grew up with in the coal mining towns. So all I ever saw  in my life was people around me who nurtured me and guided me and  taught me who were truly coal miners or coal miner families. That is  all I knew. My Little League coach was a coal miner. My Boy Scout  leader was a coal miner. A lot of my teachers were coal miners,  basically, off and on, trying to supplement their incomes. My teammates  whom I played ball with through high school became coal miners. My  grandfather was a coal miner. My uncle was a coal miner who lost his  life in a 1968 mine explosion. My next-door neighbor in 1954--I  remember I was 7 years old, and I wanted to throw a ball all the time.   I would come home from school, and Pinchy would be there. He would  throw a ball with me. I can still remember this so vividly. One day I  was ready to play ball and Pinchy did not come home. I asked Mercia,  his wife: Mercia, where is Pinchy?   She said: Joe, honey, he is going to be a little late today.   Well, we just had a mine explosion. I did not know anything about the  mine explosion, but I knew there was no Pinchy to throw a ball with. So  the second day, I asked: Mercia, where is Pinchy?   Well, they still didn't know the outcome. The rescue was going on.  They did not know if they lost their lives or not or what had happened.  So they were still in limbo.   She said: Joe, Pinchy has to work over again tonight.   That was her explanation to me, the little boy. The third day, she-- by that time they knew. She had to tell me. So she is probably--I know  Mercia had to labor with this. How is she going to tell this 7-year-old  neighborhood kid who played ball with Pinchy?   She said--this is a tough one. She said: He is not going to come  home.   When you think about the hard-working people who suffered--she never  had anything. If it was not for healthcare and if it wasn't for a  pension, Mercia would have had nothing. So I know the families and I  know the sacrifices. What you all saw was my passion for the people I  grew up with. So when I say thank you, I thank the President for  supporting miners--President Trump--I thank my Republican colleagues,  and I thank all 48 Democratic Senators who never wavered.   A lot of them don't even know a coal miner. What they know today,  after 5 years that we have been talking about this and working toward  this, is that you would not have the country you have today if it  hadn't been for those people who sacrificed, who worked hard, never  asked for a thing, gave everything they could back, took care of their  families but took care of their country.   Basically, the energy they produced gave us the country. People,  whether in California today, wherever they may be, understand that coal  miners produced the energy that allowed us to win World War I, World  War II, and every war we have been in, that supported the industrial  might that we have that built the middle class.  [[Page S2703]]    I am so thankful for all of that. I get choked up when I think about  it because that is what we were fighting for. They never asked for a  thing. My grandfather was run out of the mines in 1927 because he was  trying to organize and say: We can't make it.   If you have ever heard the song lyric, ``I owe my soul to the company  store,'' my grandfather owed his soul. He never had any money. He had  script. He said: We have to do something different. We can't live like  this.   They blackballed him. On Christmas Eve, 1927, my grandmother was  pregnant with my uncle. She already had four children. My dad was the  oldest. They came to the house and threw them out of a company house in  the middle of a snowstorm. That happened in 1927.   So we know it. We lived it. In 1946, they talked about the history.  In 1946, the Krug-Lewis amendment--Krug was Secretary of the Interior  and John L. Lewis was at the United Mine Workers, and they said: You  have to give those people something so they have something to live for.  They have no health care. They have no pension. They have given you  everything they have.   Harry Truman said: We are going to take care of them. You can't go on  strike because if you do, our economy collapses. This is in 1946. So  that is how this came about. Now, people said: Well, I have heard this.  They are going to bail them out. We are not asking for a bailout. You  understand, these people basically made an agreement that every ton of  coal that was mined from 1946, the United Mine Workers basically, there  would be an amount of money set aside that came from every sale of a  ton of coal that went into this fund.   Every union contract negotiation, they contracted and they left money  in their contract to pay for their benefits of healthcare and pensions  and did not take money home to their families that they could have  used. They made all of these sacrifices for all of these years. It  wasn't their fault that the bankruptcy laws that were passed in  Congress allowed companies to walk away and leave them high and dry.   It was not their fault. They did everything. So finally we have all  come together to do the right thing that should have been done. It  shouldn't be played politics with today. Everyone says we have winners  and losers. We are all winners. If you can get something like this  accomplished and be part of it, then you have to feel good about it. It  gives you a reason to even be here.   That is what I am so appreciative of. I am so proud of everyone who  has stood together on both sides, my colleague Shelley Moore Capito, a  dear friend of mine, a Republican. I am a Democrat. You know what, we  are Americans and we are West Virginians. That is what we were fighting  for. That is the winner today. The winner is this great country that  basically stood up and protected the people who gave them everything  they needed to be the superpower of the world. That is what we fought  for.   So there is enough praise and enough accolades for everyone to take  home and say: We all did it, and we all did a job well done. We do have  pensions now. These are not big pensions. These are $300, $400, $500  pensions. It supplements the way of life that is not extravagant by any  means. So we are going to start working as soon as this is finished  this week, and next week we will start on that.   To the 22,600 miners and their families who say thank you--I have  heard from most of them--to all of the people who came up here, they  were coming up here, a lot of them every week driving just to be here,  to be part of it and put a face, put a family, put basically the  challenges they would have being able to even exist or live without  this healthcare--they made it possible. I want to thank all of them.   To Cecil Roberts, president of United Mine Workers, who was so  diligent on this, Phil Smith, all of the people who worked so hard, I  thank them, but really thank all of our Senators and the Congressmen.  My congressional delegation, I am appreciative of them, our Republicans  and Democrats on the House side who voted. They are voting now as we  speak. The Senate is poised tomorrow for us to vote and support this.   I know President Trump will sign it. People are saying they used it,  played bargaining games with it. I am not going to get into that  because I don't know how you could ever sincerely mean that you were  using people's livelihoods and the healthcare for them and their  families as a bargaining chip. I don't think anybody meant to do that.  Maybe it came out in something that should have not been said, but with  that, we have to forget all of that.   Let me just say thank you. To the Presiding Officer, to all of my  colleagues, thank you. Thank you for a job not only well done but  basically very appreciated that it was done, and people's lives will be  different because of what we did. God bless each and every one of you.  Thank you.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a  colloquy with the Senator from West Virginia, my friend and colleague,  Senator Capito.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                        Coal Miner Healthcare Benefits     Mr. President, I wish to thank my friend from West  Virginia, my colleague, Senator Capito, for her support and leadership  in our fight to keep the promise made in President Truman's White House  more than 70 years ago.   For the past two Congresses, Senator Capito has been an original  cosponsor  [[Page S2715]]  of the Miners Protection Act with me, and I am proud to say that the  healthcare portion of that bill is included in the Omnibus  appropriations bill that we are set to vote on later this week. Before  sending this permanent fix to the President's desk for his signature, I  want to confirm our specific understanding of how the language would  apply to the eligibility for benefits of the former employees of  Patriot Coal, Alpha Natural Resources, and Walter Energy.    The language states that anyone who would have received  retiree healthcare coverage from one of these three companies, but for  the orders entered in their bankruptcy proceedings terminating the  employer's obligations to provide these benefits, becomes a participant  in the UMWA 1993 Benefit Plan.   I understand that the language encompasses anyone who would have  received such coverage from the bankrupt employers and not just those  who meet the 1993 plan's general eligibility requirements. This  includes miners or widows who might have been specifically bargained  into the plan, such as the miners who worked at the ill-fated Upper Big  Branch Mine. We all know the drastic situation of those great miners.   Also included are miners who do not meet the 1993 plan's general  eligibility requirements because their employers rejected their  collectively bargained obligations and withdrew from the UMWA 1974  Pension Plan but who would have become eligible if their service for  the bankrupt employer or its successor were included in determining  their eligibility.    Let me say that both of us representing the great State  of West Virginia from both sides of the aisle--a main purpose has been  protecting the people who did all the heavy lifting in this great  country and gave us the energy we needed to be the superpower of the  world.   I know that Senator Capito is as proud as I am. I am proud to be  working with her to make this happen. This is truly a bipartisan  effort. It is the way legislation used to be done, and it is the way it  should be done, and hopefully we can start something anew here. I thank  my colleague.    I think we have both been able to educate not only our  fellow colleagues, our Senators, but basically the entire country on  the hard work the miners have done and what they have provided for this  country for us to be the superpower of the world--to respect the work  they have done and continue to do.   With that, I am so proud of everybody who worked so diligently on  this issue and this effort, for the Republicans, our President, and our  leaders on both sides, Democratic and Republican, making sure this was  first and foremost the main obligation for us to accomplish. I thank my  colleagues.    With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
