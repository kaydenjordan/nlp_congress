 Mr. President, as I discussed on the floor yesterday,  returning to regular order in the appropriations process is at the  forefront of the Senate's agenda.   Thanks to the bipartisan work of the Appropriations Committee, led by  Chairman Shelby, Ranking Member Leahy, and the subcommittee chairmen,  it is actually becoming a reality. Their efforts have already produced  thoughtful legislation for the full Senate to consider, beginning this  week with the combined measures for the Legislative Branch, for Energy  and Water, and for Military Construction and the Veterans  Administration. It is those last components I would like to discuss  this morning.   This year, 2018, has already brought significant legislative progress  for America's men and women in uniform. Earlier this year, Congress and  the President did away with arbitrary funding limits that had eroded  our forces' comparative advantage. We delivered the largest year-on- year increase in funding for our troops in 15 years. Now, with the  Military Construction-VA funding bill before us this week, the Senate  can keep the ball rolling.   The committee's package would deliver mission-critical maintenance  and improvements that are needed on installations both at home and  abroad. It would support Active-Duty personnel, as well as National  Guard and Reserve units. It would allocate significant resources for  projects that reinforce key alliances and extend our influence around  the world.   In my home State of Kentucky, it would mean major improvements to  training facilities at both Fort Knox--home of the Army Cadet, Human  Resources, and Recruiting Commands--and at Fort Campbell, where the  101st Airborne Division and Special Operations forces prepare for  evolving missions.  [[Page S4254]]    But while underpinning the ongoing missions of our Active Forces, the  legislation before us would also take critical steps to meet the  individual needs of America's warfighters and their families here at  home. It would allocate over $1.5 billion to operate and maintain  military family housing facilities. It would provide for vital safety  updates at overseas American military schools, part of a system that  serves more than 66,000 children. Hundreds of millions in additional  funding would go to build and improve the network of military medical  facilities, which provide care to nearly 10 million servicemembers and  military families.   Finally, within the Military Construction legislation is important  funding to support our veterans. In addition to funding the maintenance  and upkeep of VA health facilities, it goes further in allocating  targeted resources to address the system's shortcomings.   Especially when we talk about access to prompt, quality care, the  status quo is simply not good enough for America's veterans. For the  more than 300,000 Kentucky veterans and for the millions of veterans  nationwide, we can and we must do better. That is why this bill  includes billions of dollars to improve claims processing and to cut  down on backlogs. There is funding for treatment, mental health  services, and preventing opioid misuse.   There are plenty of good reasons to support this appropriations  package, but one of the most compelling is the support it will deliver  to our all-volunteer military and those who have served our country in  uniform. So let's keep this legislation moving this week.                               Rescissions Bill    On another matter, Mr. President, speaking of government spending, we  will soon have an opportunity to save some of the money taxpayers  entrust to us. Thanks to the hard work of Members, including Senator  Lee and Chairman Enzi, we will soon turn to a House-passed bill that  acts on the President's request to rescind nearly $15 billion in  previously appropriated money that has gone unspent. This modest belt- tightening would in no way infringe on the bipartisan spending deal  that Senators on both sides agreed to earlier this year. This savings  package is 100 percent unrelated to that agreement.   Let me say that again. This savings package is 100 percent unrelated  to the bipartisan agreement we reached earlier this year. It is totally  separate. It simply pulls back a small amount of unspent funds from a  variety of government accounts. If we, the people's elected  representatives, want to speak seriously about stewarding taxpayer  money, surely we can vote to recapture these unspent funds that are not  even currently in use.   The President's modest rescissions request is entirely reasonable. It  should be without controversy. I look forward to voting for it myself,  and I urge my fellow Members to do the same.                                  Tax Reform    Now, on one final matter, Mr. President, today marks 6 months since  the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed Congress. On Friday, it will be 6  months since the President signed it into law. What a 6 months it has  been.   Already, Americans have seen their paychecks grow as the IRS  withholds less of what they earned. Already, families are reaping the  fruits of a new business tax code that gives American employers more  ability to increase pay and create jobs. Six months in, these tax cuts  have already led employers to issue tax reform bonuses, raises, and new  benefits to 4 million workers and counting. That is welcome relief for  middle-class families. But what about the long term?   Republicans know that enduring prosperity needs thriving businesses  competing to hire American workers. So we designed tax reform to flip  the Obama-era script and make America a more attractive place to  invest, expand, and create jobs.   For large companies, capital investment might mean breaking ground on  new locations or purchasing state-of-the-art technology. If you are a  midsized employer, it might mean filling your factory floor with new  equipment. If you are a Main Street family business, it could mean  expanding into the vacant storefront next door or buying new tools that  will transform your day-to-day operations.   In every case, you are placing a bet on your community and on your  country. You are betting on American land, American equipment, and,  most importantly, the future of the American workforce. You are putting  down roots here instead of shipping jobs overseas. This is precisely  what we have seen in the past 6 months.   Earlier this year, Apple announced plans to make $30 billion in  capital investments over the next 5 years--new facilities, new data  centers, and more than 20,000 new jobs.   Chipotle Mexican Grill announced a $50 million investment in  upgrading and refurbishing their restaurants.   Carpenter Technology is using tax reform to speed up a new $100  million facility in Redding, PA. Their new state-of-the-art mill will  allow them to compete in precision electronics manufacturing. New  equipment can't be easily outsourced; neither can the jobs it will  create. Sure enough, Carpenter is partnering with a local community  college to train a 21st century workforce.   Remember, these businesses aren't just creating new opportunities  themselves. These projects also mean prosperity for American  contractors and construction crews, and it is not just the big guys.   In West Palm Beach, FL, tax reform means new kitchen appliances for  the Don Ramon Restaurant. In my home State of Kentucky, at Glier's  Meats, tax reform meant a new quarter-million-dollar machine to speed  up production of their famous sausages. For a small business with fewer  than 30 employees, that is a noteworthy opportunity. Everywhere you  turn, businesses large and small are going all in on the future of the  United States.   There is one more interesting thing the last 6 months have revealed:  just how impossible it is for our Democratic colleagues to set aside  their outdated, tax-and-spend ideology. Every Democrat in the House and  in the Senate voted on party lines to block tax reform. They insisted  the law wouldn't help American workers one bit. They said that it would  be a disaster. Of course, the facts have debunked those predictions.  But are our Democratic friends admitting they were wrong? No. They are  doubling down on this silliness.   By now, we are all familiar with the House Democratic leader's  comments from January. She laughed at the four-figure bonuses that  working families were celebrating and called them ``crumbs.'' Earlier  this month, she doubled down:         Hip, hip hooray, unemployment is down. But what does that       mean for me?    Well, my Democratic friends seem hopeful they can convince Americans  that tax cuts, bonuses, and a stellar job market are nothing to  celebrate. Talk about a tall order.   But while those rhetorical gymnastics keep them busy, Republicans  will keep up the fight for middle-class families.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk for  amendment No. 2910.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk for  the bill H.R. 5895.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum  calls be waived.    Mr. President, here is where we are. I filed cloture,  but we anticipate that will not actually be necessary and we will be  able to vitiate the cloture motions tomorrow because we anticipate  being able to process additional amendments throughout the day and wrap  the bill up sometime tomorrow afternoon. But there will be an  opportunity during the day to continue to process amendments, and we  should be able to finish the bill this week without resorting to  cloture.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I understand that there are two bills  at the desk, and I ask for their first reading en bloc.    Mr. President, I now ask for a second reading, and I  object to my own request, all en bloc.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  now proceed to the en bloc consideration of the following Senate  resolutions, which were submitted earlier today: S. Res. 553, S. Res.  554, and S. Res. 555.   There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the  resolutions en bloc.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolutions be agreed to, the preambles be agreed to, and the motions  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, all en bloc.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs be discharged from  further consideration of H.R. 770 and the Senate proceed to its  immediate consideration.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Murphy  amendment at the desk be considered and agreed to, and the bill, as  amended, be considered read a third time.    I know of no further debate on the bill.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9:45 a.m.,  Thursday, June 21; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed. Finally, I ask that  following leader remarks, the Senate resume consideration of H.R. 5895.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order, following the remarks of our Democratic  colleagues.
