 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation. This  package is the product of our work on the Energy and Commerce Committee  under the leadership of Chairman Walden. This legislation accomplishes  the very important goals of reauthorizing the Children's Health  Insurance Program, renewing funding for community health centers, and  extending critical resources for Medicaid in Puerto Rico.   One of the first votes I cast in Congress was for CHIP, creating a  fiscally responsible health program that now serves 8.5 million  children in the United States.   I continue to support community health centers and the work they do  in areas like Dover and Somerville, New Jersey, in the district I  serve.   We also cannot forget about the many families and children in Puerto  Rico, who also benefit from the Medicaid program. That is why I have  teamed up with Resident Commissioner Gonzalez-Colon, to make sure low- cost Federal healthcare continues to be made available to our American  children in Puerto Rico.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this legislation and for the United  States Senate to act as soon as possible.
