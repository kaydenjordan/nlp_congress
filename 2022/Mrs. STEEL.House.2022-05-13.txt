 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ao Dai Day this  Sunday, May 15. I am proud to represent nearly 200,000 Vietnamese  Americans in my district in California.   My district is a home to Little Saigon which has the largest  Vietnamese population outside of Vietnam. Many of these men and women  fled communism in Vietnam in search of freedom here in America. They  have worked hard to build their American Dream.   The Ao Dai, which I am wearing today, is a traditional dress that  represents the adaptability and strength of the Vietnamese people. It  is a symbol of beauty and pride in Vietnam's unique and wonderful  culture.   Last year, the State of California officially approved a resolution  to recognize May 15 as Ao Dai Day. I join them in celebrating this  special day and the many Vietnamese families in my district who are  proud to call our great country home.                            ____________________
