 Mr. Speaker, on this the 80th anniversary of Pearl  Harbor, it is only right to honor a marine who served in the South  Pacific. I rise today to honor the life and legacy of fellow  Michigander and U.S. Marine Raymond Heise.   On Thursday, November 18, Ray passed away after nearly a century of  service to his community and to our Nation. I met Ray back in June 2016  when we exchanged personal stories of our time in the Corps.   At only 19 years of age, he enlisted and joined the Marine Corps  during World War II. He truly made a difference, both in the South  Pacific and in Michigan. The commitment and courage that he and so many  others displayed during that time is unmatched. As Admiral Nimitz  famously said of those Marines involved in our victory on Iwo Jima:  ``Uncommon valor was a common virtue.''   Ray will be remembered for his caring and calming personality toward  anyone who had the opportunity to meet him. I encourage my colleagues  to join me in remembering the life and selfless service of Raymond  Heise, United States marine.   May God rest his soul and comfort his family.                            ____________________
