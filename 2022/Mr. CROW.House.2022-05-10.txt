 Mr. Speaker, as a former Army Ranger, I rise today in  support of S. 1872, a bill to award United States Army Rangers veterans  of World War II a Congressional Gold Medal.   In World War II, the U.S. Army formed six all-volunteer Ranger  battalions and one provisional battalion. Some of the most important  battles of the war relied on their skill, sacrifice, and unending  courage.   They fought throughout Europe, including D-day landings at Omaha  Beach, and liberated 500 prisoners from a Japanese POW camp in the  Philippines known as the Great Raid.   Of the 7,000 Rangers who served in World War II, only 15 are alive  today. They live across our Nation, on each coast and in the heartland.   As an Army Ranger who followed in their immense footsteps, I thank  them for their service, sacrifice, and example.   I also thank Senator Ernst for her partnership on this bill, and I  urge my colleagues to join me in supporting its passage when it comes  to a vote today.    ``Rangers Lead the Way.''                            ____________________
