 Mr. President, the resolution by the distinguished  Senator from Wisconsin is a resolution to say to the plumber who is  making $60,000 a year in Wisconsin or Tennessee: We want to keep your  insurance prices high. We don't want to reduce them by 70 percent, and  we want to keep 1.7 million people, according to the Urban Institute,  uninsured.   Let me say that again. If this resolution passes--if you vote yes-- you are saying to the plumber who makes $60,000 a year, who can't  afford to buy ObamaCare because his insurance premium is $20,000: We  are going to do everything we can to keep your insurance costs so high  that you can't afford it, and we are going to do everything we can to  keep 1.7 million Americans, according to the Urban Institute, from  having the option this short-term rule allows.   Let's see what we are talking about. We just heard eloquent comments  about preexisting conditions. This resolution has nothing to do with  preexisting conditions. It doesn't change one single word in the  Affordable Care Act, which guarantees that if you have a preexisting  condition, you have a right to buy ObamaCare, and you can't be charged  more because of it.   Let me say that again. This rule, which the Senator from Wisconsin  seeks to overturn, not only keeps you from lowering your cost 70  percent, but it has nothing to do with preexisting conditions because  it doesn't change one single word of the Affordable Care Act guarantee  that if you have a preexisting condition you can buy insurance and you  can't be charged more. A rule can't change a law. It couldn't if it  tried. That is one thing.   The second thing is that the rule that the Senator from Wisconsin  seeks to overturn is the same rule that was in effect during all of  President Obama's term. President Obama's administration allowed 1 year  of short-term plans for people who couldn't afford insurance, couldn't  find it anywhere else, or who might be between jobs. Even after the  Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, President Obama and the Democratic  Congress thought it was a good enough idea to allow these short-term  plans to continue that they kept them in the law. The law supporting  these plans has nothing to do with the Affordable Care Act. It was  passed in the 1990s for the purpose of giving people who need a short- term option, which might cost less because it has less coverage, the  chance to buy insurance.   States can regulate these plans. States may decide what protections  they should have. States may decide what the price should be, but,  typically, in 2016, the difference between the cost of an ObamaCare  plan was $393 a month for an unsubsidized ObamaCare plan and for a  short-term plan it was $124. In other words, the short-term plan, which  the Democrats and the Senator from Wisconsin seek to overturn, which  was in existence all during the Obama administration and was authorized  in the 1990s, would cut the plumber's insurance cost by 70 percent.   Now, why should we put up with that? Why should we put up with that?  The Urban Institute, not known as a conservative organization, has said  that up to 1.7 million Americans will take advantage of President  Trump's short-term plan, which was the same as the Obama short-term  plan, except that under the Trump rule, you may do it for as much as 3  years instead of just 1 year. It says that 1.7 million Americans will  take advantage of that. That is a lot of people.   Eighty-three percent of Americans who buy ObamaCare have a subsidy to  help them pay for it. It is the 17 percent who don't have a subsidy who  are most likely to be helped by this. Many simply can't afford a  $20,000 health insurance plan if they don't qualify for a subsidy, and  this says: We understand that. You can buy a different sort of plan if  your State permits it. You can pay less with less coverage and at least  you will have some insurance. At least you will have some insurance.   But our Democratic friends say: Oh, no, we don't want to do anything  that would lower the cost of health insurance.   Sometimes I think our Democratic friends have elevated to the level  of the status of the 67th book of the Bible the Affordable Care Act, or  ObamaCare. They will not even change parts of it that they agree with.   Earlier this year, Senator Murray and I, and then Senator Nelson and  Senator Collins, all worked together with many Senators in a great  bipartisan way to come up with a piece of legislation that would  temporarily help with the high prices of health insurance. Make no  mistake about it. In Tennessee, health insurance has gone up about 170  percent since ObamaCare was passed. That means the plumber or the  farmer or the person making 50, 60, or $70,000 a year can't afford to  pay the $20,000 premium they might be required to pay.   So we had this temporary Alexander-Murray-Collins-Nelson proposal. I  can still see Senator Collins standing on the floor offering it saying,  as she said: Oliver Wyman--the respected Oliver Wyman agency--says this  will lower insurance premiums by 40 percent over 3 years for people in  the individual market--people who don't get a subsidy, hardworking  people who can't afford health insurance.   What happened? Even though the Democratic leader said it contained  provisions that every single Democrat could support, the Democrats  pulled the rug out from under it at the last minute by insisting on a  radical version of abortion funding that they had not required since  1976, except in the ObamaCare law.   In other words, they deliberately kept health insurance prices 40  percent higher than they otherwise would have been. Was it to have an  issue in the Presidential election or in the election this year? I have  no idea, but I could think of no reason why not to do that.   Then, there is another example. Secretary of Labor Acosta has come up  with another very good idea that has been talked about a lot within  this body before: Why not give employees of smaller companies the right  to buy the same kind of insurance that employees of IBM or big  companies buy?   About half of all of us who have insurance get it on the job. We are  pretty happy with it. It has a lot of protections in it--not as many as  ObamaCare but, apparently, Democrats thought those protections were  sufficiently strong, including preexisting condition, and sufficiently  strong not to tamper with it. So the idea was this: Let's let the  people who work in the company with 10 or 15 or 20 employees in Alaska,  Tennessee, or Wisconsin have the same opportunity to buy insurance as  the employee of a big company has.   Democrats said absolutely not.   So we don't want to lower rates by 40 percent by a temporary proposal  supported by President Trump, Speaker Ryan, Senator McConnell, and let  the Democratic leaders say all Democrats could vote for that policy. We  don't want to let employees of smaller companies have the same options  that employees of big companies have that would lower their insurance  and give them more choices. And now we are being asked to say you can't  have a 70-percent reduction in your health insurance--the same kind of  proposal you had all during the Obama years. Let me say that again.  President Obama thought it was just fine to have short-term healthcare  plans for up to 1 year during the entire Obama administration. They  changed the rules 22 days before the end of his term and reduced it to  3 months that you could buy these plans, but that wasn't enforced until  April.   So let's keep it simple. If you needed insurance, if you lost your  job, if you couldn't afford insurance during the Obama years, if  ObamaCare got too expensive for you during the Obama years, you could  buy short-term insurance for up to 1 year if your State allowed it.   What the Democrats are saying is this: No, we are not even going to  do what President Obama would do. So we are going to keep your  insurance high today with a yes vote. We are going to  [[Page S6740]]  say to 1.7 million people who are uninsured: No, you can't buy this  insurance because we know more than you do.   Some people who might know more than we do is the National  Association of Insurance Commissioners. Senate Democrats wrote to them  asking them about these short-term plans and raising questions about  them.   Here is what the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, a  bipartisan organization, wrote back:         Short-term, limited duration insurance meets the needs of       consumers for whom other types of coverage may not be       appropriate, affordable, or available.    State Insurance Commissioners say short-term limited duration  insurance, the type that a ``yes'' vote today would ban--those are my  words--meets the needs of consumers for whom other types of coverage  may not be appropriate, affordable, or available.   I hope that across this country, as Americans look at this today, you  would ask the Senator from Wisconsin and her Democratic colleagues: Why  do you want to kill a rule that President Obama favored, that existed  all during ObamaCare while he was there, that gave people who might  lose their jobs or couldn't afford ObamaCare a chance to buy insurance  that might be 70-percent cheaper? Why would you want to keep 1.7  million Americans who don't have insurance, according to the Urban  Institute, from being able to afford this short-term rule? What do you  have against lower cost insurance that doesn't change one word of the  Affordable Care Act's protection guarantee of preexisting conditions?   In other words, with this rule, if you still want to buy ObamaCare  and need preexisting insurance protection, you have it. This could not  possibly change that because it is a rule, not a law.   I hope today that we vote no and that we affirm the Trump rule, which  is the Obama rule, which is the rule that supports the Wisconsin,  Oklahoma, and Alaska plumber who makes $60,000 a year, can't afford  $20,000-a-year ObamaCare, gets no government subsidy, and needs this in  order to insure his family.   I yield the floor.
