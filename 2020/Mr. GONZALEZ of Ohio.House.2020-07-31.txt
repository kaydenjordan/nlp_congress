 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the  heroic efforts of Dustin Nist from New Franklin, Ohio.   On June 11, 2020, Dustin witnessed a car run a stop sign, drive off  the road, and descend into the Tuscarawas River. Without hesitating,  Dustin ran to help.   Seeing the car had been partially submerged, Dustin ran to the nearby  fire station to alert the rescue crew and then ran back to the scene of  the accident. Dustin made his way down a hill into the water, swimming  to the passenger side of the vehicle in order to break out the window.  Unsure about the passenger's injuries, Dustin was hesitant about  removing the woman from the car but stayed with her until the rescue  crews arrived.   Unfortunately, the driver of the vehicle, Franklin D. Roffe,  succumbed to his injuries; but due to Dustin's heroic efforts and the  work of the New Franklin Police and Fire Departments, Clinton Fire  Department, Ohio State Highway Patrol, and the staff of Summa Akron  City Hospital, the woman's life was saved.   Today, we honor Kent State University student and New Franklin  resident Dustin Nist for his heroic actions and keep everyone involved  in this tragic accident in our prayers.                            ____________________
