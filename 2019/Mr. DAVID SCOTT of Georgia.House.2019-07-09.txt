 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Waters  for her support and encouragement to us to continue this.   Mr. Speaker, I want to make this opening statement because it is very  important for us to realize the importance of this bill because, today,  according to the latest data from the Veterans Administration, we are  losing 20 of our military veterans every single day to suicide.   This is a clarion call from our veterans for help, and what we are  doing today is one small step. But, as I will explain as I go on, we  are doing much, much more because we need to bring this suicide rate to  a stop.   So much of it is caused by disappointment, discouragement, and giving  up. But, after today, with this vote, we will send a powerful message  to this Nation and especially to our precious veterans that help is  indeed on the way.   Now, I first of all want to thank my bipartisan friends Mr.   Andy  Barr, Mr. Zeldin, all of them, for this is truly a bipartisan effort,  and I thank them for their support as we move forward with this.   Now, Mr. Speaker, I want to take my time and I want to go through  this, and I want folks to really understand why this is so important.  Mr. Barr touched on it.   Last year, when Congress passed S. 2155, which was called the  Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, it  included a set of bipartisan reforms to refinancing requirements for  loans to protect our veterans from the predatory act of loan churning.   Mr. Speaker, this shows you the deviousness of it, that here you have  these predatory lenders who are out here targeting our veterans and  charging them over and over for the same payment on these refinancings.   How devious--how evil--can you be to do this to our veterans over and  over again? And they do this to generate these fees and profits for  these predatory lenders, while offering little to no benefit for our  veteran homeowners--just using them.   So, in order to prevent this, S. 2155 codified new refinancing  requirements, requiring lenders to demonstrate a material benefit to  consumers when financing their mortgages and allowing for the initial  loan to mature for at least 210 days before a borrower can refinance.   Now, these reforms were necessary to ensure that our veterans are  adequately protected from these bad actors, these predatory lenders, so  that our veterans can have access to the safe and affordable  homeownership opportunities that they have earned and deserve.   Upon implementation of S. 2155, however, as Mr. Barr mentioned, a  technical error in the language of S. 2155 caused a deviation in how  this 210-day seasoning period was calculated, between what was written  in the text and the requirement in place at Ginnie Mae.   For those who may not know, Ginnie Mae is the Government National  Mortgage Association.   Now, this, combined with the lack of clarity around time lines to  implement these new requirements, has caused 2,500 refinanced veteran  loans that met Federal requirements at the time of closing and were  guaranteed by the VA to be barred from this Government National  Mortgage Association, Ginnie Mae's securitization, which resulted in  making these veteran loans orphan loans.   They are there but no longer eligible for the secondary investment  market opportunities that they deserve, despite meeting all Federal  requirements, as well as backing from the VA, and it is clear that it  was not the intent of Congress to orphan these veteran loans.   But, rather, our intent when we passed the Senate bill was to ensure  that there were strong and enduring protections in place to prevent  future loan churning.   Can you imagine somebody sending you a bill and you paying for the  same thing over and over? How evil is that?   This bill that we have today will put a stop to that predatory type  lending and the abuse that it has caused our veterans.   And this is also necessary, Mr. Speaker, because it preserves  liquidity while maintaining strong refinancing requirements to keep  these bad actors out and ensuring that our veterans, our men and women  of the military who have served our country through their outstanding  bravery, their courage, their great sacrifice for us, have access now  to safe and affordable home ownership opportunities.                                time  1645    Mr. Speaker, without this needed legislative fix, VA lenders may need  to sell or refinance these mortgages at a loss, causing damage to the  VA home loan market and potentially hindering their ability to  originate similar loans in the future or raising borrowing costs and  rates for other qualified veterans who will be suffering the same  abuse.   Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned before, I am especially proud to have  worked with my colleagues on this: Mr. Lee Zeldin on the Financial  Services Committee; Ms. Waters, our chairwoman; and Mr.   Andy Barr,  who sits on this committee. I also want to mention Mr.   Mike Levin,  who sits on the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.   We provided bipartisan common sense to fix this for our beloved  veterans. Through this bipartisan work of my colleagues on these two  committees, we have been able to move this bill through the House,  ensuring that the dream of homeownership continues to be preserved for  our Nation's precious veterans, to whom we owe the deepest debt of  gratitude.   Mr. Speaker, I mentioned in my remarks about this great tragedy, and  I want to take this opportunity to let veterans who may be hearing this  discussion this afternoon know that this Congress stands with and  around them, and there are Members of Congress that have many bills and  many different programs to get financial resources.   Dr. Bucshon, my Republican colleague, and I, for example, have a  process going where we are addressing the shortage of psychiatrists. We  are working with the American Psychiatric Association and the American  Medical Association to pay those doctors' student tuitions and give  them scholarships so that they can come into the VA to work.   For the project I am working on with my good friend, Senator Johnny  Isakson over in the Senate, we are trying to get more resources to open  up more health clinics for our VA. And there are other things going.   I want people to know that down in my home State of Georgia, in my  district, in the next month, on August 10, the doctors, nurses, and  hospitals all over Atlanta, Georgia, are coming together, giving their  time, along with the top administrators from the VA. They will be there  in Jonesboro at Mundy's Mill High School.   We can cut down this suicide rate. It is a shame. It is a disgrace  for this country. We are doing something about it in this Congress.  Members on both sides of the aisle understand that this isn't a  Democratic problem or a Republican problem. It is America's problem,  and our veterans deserve our help.
