 Madam Speaker, this week, the House should  consider legislation responding to the threat of COVID-19, called the  coronavirus, that poses a significant threat to our Nation.   Since the end of December, over 3,000 people worldwide have died from  the virus, and there are over 91,000 confirmed cases. Without a  specific treatment protocol or vaccine, the virus is dangerous and will  likely reach the level of a pandemic.   We need to fund scientific research that can quickly diagnose and  provide therapies to prevent and treat the virus.  [[Page H1447]]    We need to give our first responders, doctors, nurses, and public  health workers who are on the front lines fighting this virus the  resources and support that they need.   We need to all look after each other.   Madam Speaker, I hope to support this legislation, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same.                            ____________________
