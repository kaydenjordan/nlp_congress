 Mr. President, someday, 100 years from now, a family will  camp on a mesa in Utah or a hillside in North Carolina or a canyon in  New Mexico or they will hike the rocky coast of Maine. They will play  on a ballfield in Kansas, and it will be because of the work that we  are going to do this week in this Congress.   They will not know King or Daines or Alexander or Portman or Warner  or Manchin or Gardner or all the others who are going to support our  efforts. Our names will be long forgotten, but what we do will be  benefiting this country for generations.   There are very few things we can do in our work here that are  permanent. Bills can be repealed. Programs can be amended. Times  change, and all can change with it.   What we are talking about this week in the Great American Outdoors  Act is making a gift to our fellow Americans. Setting aside special  places, setting aside opportunities for outdoors and recreation is a  sacred trust, and it is one that goes back to the beginning of this  country.   As I said, there is very little we can do that is permanent, but this  is one of those things. It is the right thing to do, but it also makes  sense from the economy's point of view in all of our States.   Acadia National Park in Maine generates more than $300 million a year  in economic activity in the surrounding communities. Our new Katahdin  Woods and Waters National Monument is already generating economic  activity in the area where it is located. A visit to Maine to see the  seacoast and the forest at those two sites would be rewarding for any  family.   What we are doing today will enable families to continue to make  these kinds of journeys--the next generation and the next and the next.  That family will see a sunrise on the coast of Maine, a sunset on a  mesa in Arizona. They will not know who it was, but they will know what  we did.   In Maine there is a wonderful mountain, Mount Katahdin, the highest  point in the State, and it was proposed to be set aside for the people  of Maine by the Governor named Percival Baxter in the twenties, one of  my predecessors.   The legislature of Maine said: No, we don't have to do that. We  shouldn't really do that. Who is going to pay for the roads? We are  going to take property out of the tax base. What about the trees?   There were all kinds of reasons for not doing it, so it didn't  happen.   It didn't happen while Percival Baxter was Governor, but he dedicated  the rest of his life to making it happen. Individually, privately, he  purchased full parcels of land to assemble what is now Baxter State  Park, one of the gems in this country that contains, at its center,  Mount Katahdin. He did this as one of the greatest acts of private  philanthropy in the history of the United States. It was the legacy of  a lifetime.   Few of us will have an opportunity to do what Baxter did, but we have  that opportunity now. Where does the money come from? It comes from the  people, in the sense of revenues from the use of Federal lands for  mineral extraction. This is an idea that was brought forth in 1965 when  the Land and Water Conservation Fund was created, and the idea was  this: We are using the public's resources and assets, and, therefore,  the money that flows from that should go back to the people and should  go back into conservation. It is a beautifully symmetrical idea.   The problem is that the fund that was created in 1965 has been  systematically looted by the Congresses in successive years. There have  been only 2 years since then that it has been fully funded with the  funds that are available.   Today, this week, we are going to correct that historic error and  make a commitment not only to the people of the United States today but  to people we don't even know--the children and grandchildren and great- grandchildren of today's citizens.   The other thing this bill will do is begin to fund the backlog of  maintenance at our national parks, bureau of public lands, and other  public lands across the country. This sounds pretty boring, pretty  mundane, and some of my friends are going to say: Well, you can't do  this. We are going to raise a budget point of order.   This is money, again, coming from excess funds in the generation of  minerals, oil, and gas. But they are going to say: No, no. You can't do  that.   What we are doing here is paying a debt. Deferred maintenance is a  debt.   When I was Governor, I used to go to New York to kiss the ring of the  rating agencies and hope and beg that they would give us a high bond  rating so that our interest costs for our State debt would be low. At  one point, I was making a presentation about how prudent Maine was. We  didn't have much debt. We paid it off in 10 years, and we really needed  this high bond rating.   One of the analysts stopped me, and he said: Governor, don't forget  that if you are not maintaining your infrastructure, that is debt just  as sure as if you borrow money from the bank, and it is debt that is  going to have to be paid, and it is going to have to be paid in the  future, which means it is going to cost more.   I had never thought of it that way, but that is what we are doing  here. That is why what we are doing here is eminently fiscally  responsible because we are paying off a debt, and we are preserving  these wonderful, incredible places for people to visit and enjoy.   Believe me, after this spring, people really want to get outdoors. In  Maine, for example, Acadia National Park has more than 3\1/2\ million  visitors a year. That is a big number. It is a really big number when  you realize that more than twice the population of our whole State  comes to visit this one small, beautiful, incredible spot on the coast  of Maine on Mount Desert Island. So what we are talking about today is  paying a debt and making a contribution to the well-being of the  American people for generations to come.   When Baxter completed the acquisition of Katahdin and the area that  is now Baxter State Park, he had an amazing quote that I think applies  to what we are talking about today. He said:         Man is born to die. His works are short-lived. Buildings       crumble, monuments decay, and wealth vanishes, but Katahdin       in all its glory forever shall remain the mountain of the       people of Maine.    Areas across our country in all their glory will forever be part of  the legacy for the people of America.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
