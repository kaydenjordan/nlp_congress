 Mr. Chairman, I rise to engage the  gentlewoman in a colloquy on the importance of the Butler County  workforce to Federal background investigation operations. The National  Background Investigations Bureau has approximately 1,500 employees and  contractors in Boyers, Pennsylvania, which is in my district, who  handle the intake and processing of Federal background investigations.   As you know, the NDAA last year split the NBIB between the Office of  Personnel Management and the Department of Defense. This misguided move  would have disrupted operations and negatively affected the critical  workforce.  [[Page H5791]]    I applaud the Trump administration for announcing last week that it  will be keeping the NBIB intact and shifting it entirely to the DOD.  This action will keep all background investigations under the same  agency and will retain economies of scale to efficiently perform these  critical operations.   On Monday, I met with the DOD officials responsible for the transfer.  They assured me that there are no plans to move any jobs outside Butler  County. This is good news for my constituents, but more communication  is necessary.   These 1,500 people perform an incredible service to our Nation, and  these jobs are critical to Butler County. This workforce has the  expertise and experience to perform this sensitive work that keeps our  Nation secure. Any efforts to reduce backlog in background  investigations must utilize this talented and hardworking workforce.   Chairman Granger, would you agree that the NBIB workforce in Butler  County is integral to our country's background checks operations?    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for  her dedication to this issue. It is important to not lose sight of the  significance of this workforce to my district.
