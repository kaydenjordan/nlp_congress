 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 1156,  building on 20 years of success of the McGovern-Dole International Food  for Education and Child Nutrition Program.   For two decades, the McGovern-Dole nutrition program has led the way  in alleviating hunger and improving food security around the world. I  deeply believe in the core values of this nutrition program because, as  a teacher, I saw with my own eyes that hungry kids don't learn.   It is one of the greatest investments Congress can make. By providing  at least one nutritious meal per day to vulnerable children in schools  across the world, we are also investing in their development and their  education. Beyond these children and their families, we also continue  to support U.S. producers.   During my time as the 2016 National Teacher of the Year, I traveled  abroad to many countries as an ambassador for education. While abroad,  I learned the degree to which other countries look to us to lead the  way for food security and childhood nutrition. I was greeted by  numerous children on the African continent who thanked me as the  American teacher for all of the American programs.   Our international food aid programs are not just an exercise of good  will. They are absolutely critical to communities protecting themselves  from the devastation of food insecurity. It is our moral obligation to  ensure that we contribute to the food security of the global  community--particularly children, pregnant women, and new mothers-- whenever possible.   I have been a proud supporter of McGovern-Dole funding during my time  in Congress, and I will continue to do so. I urge my colleagues to vote  for this in support of the House Resolution.
