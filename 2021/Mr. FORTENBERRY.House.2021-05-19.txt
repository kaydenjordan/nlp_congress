 Mr. Speaker, a while back, I visited a small  business called Craft Axe Throwing and Beer. What an interesting  combination of activities, I thought. I had driven by it a number of  times, but I stopped in one day. Seeing this team make a living,  enjoying themselves, I thought to myself, that is what it is all about.   Mr. Speaker, the main driver of new jobs in America is small  business. The good news is that unemployment has been on a steady  downward trend. But now, the hard news: the April jobs report. It was  bad. At the same time, small business owners report that they can't  fill the job openings that they have. Why? Earlier necessary government  assistance during the pandemic is now interfering with the successful  transition back to meaningful work.   A little good news: Wages are going up. Let's let America run.                            ____________________
