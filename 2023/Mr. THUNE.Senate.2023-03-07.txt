 Mr. President, at the end of last week, I joined several  of my Republican colleagues to travel down to our southern border. It  was my second visit to the border during the Biden administration--my  third overall. My first during the Biden administration was almost  exactly 2 years ago, after border numbers started to soar in the wake  of the President taking office.   I would have to say unfortunately little has changed since my list  visit. Thanks to the fact that President Biden spent the first 2 years  of his Presidency refusing to even acknowledge this crisis, much less  actually address it, we are still facing a disastrous situation at our  southern border.   I talked to Border Patrol agents who have spent 2 years dealing with  recordbreaking numbers of illegal immigrants and are still looking for  support from the Biden administration that never seems to come. Again  and again, Border Patrol agents told me that not only do they not feel  supported by the Biden administration, but they feel like the Biden  administration has actually impeded their ability to do their jobs.  ``Just let us enforce the law,'' one agent told me. It is something  that was echoed by other law enforcement officers that we spoke to. To  give you just  [[Page S663]]  one example, we heard from the individual in charge of the border for  the State of Texas, who told us that they have a number of panels for  the congressionally mandated border wall that are ready to go into the  ground. The State of Texas and law enforcement personnel would like to  install these panels to help them stem the flood of illegal  immigration--at their own expense, an expense of the State of Texas.  But the Biden administration has, so far, refused to grant the  permissions needed to do that. I can only imagine how much harder the  jobs will get when the Biden administration ends title 42 border  policies, coming up on May 11.   I was also stunned to learn that President Biden's supposed border  czar, Vice President Harris, has never spoken to the border czar for  the State of Texas or to the leadership of the Border Patrol down  there. That is right. The person who is supposedly in charge of  addressing the chaos at our southern border has never spoken to the  individual in charge of border issues for the State that makes up the  greatest portion of our southern border or to the Border Patrol  leadership in the State.   Mr. President, from his campaign on, President Biden was fixated on  distancing himself from the immigration policies of his predecessor and  satisfying the open borders caucus that makes up a huge part of today's  Democratic Party, so much so that, in his first week in office or so,  he repealed somewhere on the order of 94--94--executive policies of the  previous administration with respect to the border. The moment he took  office, he set about dismantling those policies of the previous  administration without apparently taking even a minute to think about  what effect his actions would have.   Well, we know now what effect they had. President Biden's actions  declared to the world that the United States' borders were effectively  open, and we have seen 2 years of recordbreaking illegal immigration as  a result.   In January, President Biden finally--and I say ``finally''--began to  take some steps to address the crisis at our southern border, including  reestablishing versions of some of the border security policies he did  away with on taking office. Predictably, even the mild steps he has  taken have garnered criticism from open borders Democrats who,  apparently, think that border security and border enforcement are  somehow uncompassionate.   Well, Mr. President, do you know what is uncompassionate? The kind of  lax border policies we have had over the past 2 years that have  encouraged individuals to attempt to illegally cross our border; that  have encouraged individuals to pay huge sums to dangerous individuals,  to cartels, and smugglers for illegal passage; that have exposed  unaccompanied children to the hazards of extreme weather and criminal  activity or exploitation by sponsors once they arrive in this country.   At least 853 people died attempting to cross our southern border  illegally in fiscal year 2022--the highest number ever recorded. That  is a lot of lives lost. There is nothing compassionate about the  policies that encourage them to attempt the crossing.   I think many people think of those attempting to illegally cross our  border as economically disadvantaged individuals from Mexico or Central  America. But the truth is that U.S. Customs and Border Protection  apprehends individuals at our southern border from all over the world,  some from hostile countries. One law enforcement official I spoke with  said that the number of Chinese nationals attempting to cross illegally  in the Rio Grand Valley Sector has increased by 488 percent year over  year--488 percent. Now, I have no doubt that some of those were  individuals merely hoping to relocate from communist China to a land of  freedom. But it is equally possible that some were hostile agents of  the Chinese Government, and that is a serious security concern.    In fiscal year 2022, Customs and Border Protection apprehended 98  individuals on the terrorist watch list attempting to cross our  southern border. That is an average of one approximately every 3 or 4  days. And that is just the individuals Customs and Border Protection  managed to apprehend. There have been at least 1.2 million known ``got- aways,'' which are individuals the Border Patrol saw but was unable to  apprehend, since President Biden took over. Now, that is in addition to  the almost 4.7 million--4.7 million--people whom they actually did  apprehend trying to come across our southern border since President  Biden took office.   It is more than possible that terrorists or agents of hostile powers  have been able to make their way into our country undetected while our  Border Patrol agents have been struggling to deal with the  recordbreaking number of individuals coming across the border  illegally. The chaos that we have been experiencing at our southern  border is an invitation to dangerous individuals, from terrorists to  drug cartels.   Our Nation is currently in the midst of a fentanyl crisis, which is  largely being fueled by fentanyl trafficked across our southern border.  And I would be very surprised if the flow of fentanyl into this country  isn't being facilitated by the chaos at our border.   Our current fentanyl crisis is also a good reminder that illegal  activity at our southern border affects every State in our country. I  have talked to sheriffs in South Dakota--about as far from our southern  border as you can get--who are dealing with fentanyl that has been  trafficked across the border from Mexico. Last year, Minnehaha County  Sheriff Mike Milstead estimated that 90 percent--90 percent--of  fentanyl and methamphetamine in our State--the State of South Dakota-- comes through Mexico and across our southern border--90 percent.   Every State is a border State, and recordbreaking floods of illegal  immigration at our southern border aren't just a problem for actual  border States, like Texas and Arizona. They are a problem for every  State in our country.   For 2 years, the Biden administration has been missing in action at  our southern border. While I am glad that President Biden is finally,  at least halfheartedly, acknowledging that we are facing a border  crisis, I want to see him follow through on actually enforcing our laws  and doing what the Border Patrol agents are simply asking: Enforce our  laws.   He has all the authority he needs to secure or border, and he owes  the American people nothing less.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
