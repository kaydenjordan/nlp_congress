 Mr. Speaker, let me tell you about 17 remarkable  people: Zachary Asselta, Robert Cuff, Alexandra Kukal, Ozlem Akilli,  Justin Billman, Ashley Burkey, Kevin Sheppard, Lindsey Wettstein,  Gabrielle Akiatan, Karen Chainey, Andrew Crain, San'aa Doss, Anthony  Kukal, Megan Majewski, Genevieve Morgan, Jayme Sooy, and Joshua  Whitaker.   Who are they? A group of impressive young students from Millville,  New Jersey, who have been recognized as Congressional Award winners.  These young people worked hard to complete countless hours of volunteer  work, as well as personal and physical activity and multiple day  expeditions and explorations.   Together, believe it or not, these 17 students have accomplished over  3,500 hours of volunteer work.   I am so proud of the hard work and service these students have  brought to south Jersey. They deserve to be Congressional Award  winners.                            ____________________
