 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Sayed  Obaidullah Amin, who served heroically in Afghanistan and risked his  life as a translator for U.S. forces in Sangan Valley.   Sayed had a pending SIV, P1, and P2 application to get to the United  States. He had the help of marines who he served with, as well as the  help of my office. Unfortunately, he and his wife were killed at Abbey  Gate during the Kabul airport attack fighting to get to safety. Their  two infant children survived, and they are P1, P2 applicants, and they  need the help of our State Department to get to safety.   My heart continues to be with his children, the marines he served  with, and all those who worked so hard to get him to safety. Our  mission is not over. We have lives to save.                            ____________________
