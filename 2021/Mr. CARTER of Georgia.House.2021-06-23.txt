 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  honor O.V. Lewis of Blairsville, Georgia, for his 90th birthday on June  16.   O.V. has dedicated the majority of his life to Young Harris College.  He served as an instructor of accounting for 48 years, and registrar  for 31 years at Young Harris College, and retired with the longest  tenure of any previous employee.   During his time at the school, Lewis had an unparalleled commitment  to his students, both inside and outside the classroom, that has lasted  well beyond graduation. Those who have been influenced by Lewis, such  as myself, praise his positive impact on their education and career.   Throughout his whole life, Lewis has been generous with his time,  talent, and resources as he continues to devote his life to improving  those around him.   As a graduate of Young Harris College, I am proud to rise today to  recognize O.V. Lewis's 90th birthday and lifetime of mentoring and  inspiring our future generations.                     Celebrating the Life of Fritz Noack     Mr. Speaker, I rise to remember and honor the  life of Fritz Noack, who passed away on June 3, 2021.   After serving as an organ building apprentice in Germany, Fritz  immigrated to the United States and founded the Noack Organ Company in  1960 in Lawrence, Massachusetts.   As a leading figure of the organ revival movement, Fritz influenced  the American organ building scene during the late 20th century. After  priding himself on the production of first-rate organs for 55 years,  Fritz retired in 2015.   Fritz directed the construction of 160 organs during his time in the  industry. His instruments are found across America, as well as Iceland  and Japan. In fact, Fritz's 100th organ is located at Wesley Monumental  United Methodist Church in Savannah, Georgia. The music provided by  this organ has entertained the congregation of Wesley Monumental for  many years, and I am certain Fritz's legacy will continue through his  instruments around the world.                     Honoring the Service of Harry Strack     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  honor Harry Strack for his remarkable service to our country.   Harry was drafted into the military in 1968, and completed his basic  training at Fort Bragg. He served in Vietnam from 1969 to 1970, in the  196th Light Infantry Brigade.   Harry has become a recognized veteran in the Sea Isle community by  sharing his story and honoring those who served alongside him. Since  returning from Vietnam, Harry has been proud to honor those who made  the ultimate sacrifice for our country.   During the Sea Isle Memorial Day ceremony, Harry received a Quilt of  Valor to recognize his selfless service and sacrifice. Harry's pride in  his service and duty to honor and remember those who made the ultimate  sacrifice is extraordinary, and I am honored to recognize him today.   I know that everyone in Georgia's First Congressional District thanks  him for his service.           Recognizing Reverend James Owens as a Provisional Elder     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Reverend James Owens' commission as a provisional elder in the South  Georgia Conference of the United Methodist Church.    Reverend Owens has served at Wesley Monumental United Methodist  Church in Savannah, Georgia, for the past 7 years. Before moving to  Savannah, Reverend Owens earned a bachelor of arts in journalism from  the University of Georgia and a master of divinity from Denver Seminary  and Duke University Divinity School.   As a provisional elder, Reverend Owens will faithfully serve Wesley  Monumental United Methodist Church and the Savannah community. With his  passion to share and teach the gospel, I know Reverend Owens will  continue his tremendous work as a provisional elder at Wesley  Monumental United Methodist Church.   I am proud to rise today to recognize Reverend Owens for his  tremendous achievement, and I know that he will continue to inspire his  congregation.                            ____________________
