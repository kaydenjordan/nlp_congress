 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and add extraneous material on H.R. 987, the Strengthening Health Care  and Lowering Prescription Drug Costs Act.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak in favor of H.R. 987, the Strengthening  Health Care and Lowering Prescription Drug Costs Act. This legislation,  Mr. Chairman, is a big step in our commitment to delivering on our  promise to make healthcare and prescription drugs more affordable.   It brings together seven bills that passed out of the Energy and  Commerce Committee last month. Taken together, these bills will  strengthen our Nation's healthcare system, reverse the Trump  administration's sabotage of the Affordable Care Act, and help lower  the costs of healthcare and prescription drugs.   The first title of this bill contains three bipartisan measures  intended to address high prescription drug costs by promoting greater  competition in our pharmaceutical marketplace. One of the most  effective ways to bring down the cost of prescription drugs is to  ensure that generics can come to market as soon as possible.   The first proposal would address so-called exclusively parking, a  practice where a first-time generic is blocking the approval of other  generics from entering the market.   The second proposal prohibits the use of pay-for-delay agreements  between brand and generic drug manufacturers that delay generic entry  into the market.   And finally, the third drug pricing measure would address situations  where some brand drug companies are delaying or impeding generic entry  by denying generic drug manufacturers access to samples or to single,  shared system REMS.   By eliminating these three barriers, we will prevent some  manufacturers from manipulating the system to extend their monopolies  at the expense of consumers, and this will make prescription drugs more  affordable for all Americans.   Now, the second title of this bill, Mr. Chairman, will help lower  Americans' healthcare costs, protect people living with preexisting  conditions, and reverse some of the most harmful actions the Trump  administration has carried out to sabotage the Affordable Care Act.   Two of the proposals will restore funding for the navigator program  and outreach and enrollment efforts that help provide consumers with  the support and information that they need to make the right healthcare  decisions for their families. Restoring this funding is critical,  considering that the Trump administration gutted funding for consumer  outreach and marketing by 90 percent. It cut navigator funding by 80  percent, leaving huge swaths of the country without access to fair and  unbiased enrollment help.   H.R. 987 will also provide States with funding to establish their own  State-based marketplaces, which will help make healthcare more  affordable. In 2018, premiums in these State marketplaces were 17  percent lower than in the federally facilitated marketplace, and  enrollment was higher for the State plans.   And, finally, Mr. Chairman, H.R. 987 will reverse the Trump  administration's regulation to expand junk insurance plans, known as  short-term limited duration health insurance. The Trump administration  expanded these junk plans from the current 3-month term and made these  plans available for up to 3 years.   These junk plans are exactly that, Mr. Chairman: They are junk. They  discriminate against people with preexisting conditions. They set  higher premiums for people based on age, gender, and health status.  They deny access to basic benefits like prescription drugs, maternity  care, and mental health and substance abuse treatment, and they set  arbitrary dollar limits for healthcare services leading to huge  surprise bills for consumers. This legislation would prevent the  administration's expansion of these plans from taking place.   In closing, Mr. Chairman, I believe this is an important bill that  will lower healthcare and prescription drug costs, protect people with  preexisting conditions, and end some of the administration's ongoing  sabotage of our Nation's healthcare system.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Jeffries), the Democratic Caucus chair.    Mr. Chairman, I think I am prepared to close, but I just  want to ask about the time on each side once more.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I want to acknowledge the many Members who wanted to lend  their strong support to this legislation but were unable to add  themselves as cosponsors due to this package being combined for floor  consideration as part of the Rules Committee proceedings. Those Members  include the sponsors of the individual bills incorporated into this  package, as well as Members like Representative Sheila Jackson Lee who  strongly support our efforts to make healthcare more accessible and  affordable.   Let me say, Mr. Chairman, in closing, as Democrats, we promised, and  we will fulfill the promise, that we are going to make healthcare more  affordable, that we are going to bring down the costs of prescription  drugs, that we are going to make sure people who have preexisting  conditions are protected, and that we are offering robust,  comprehensive plans with all the essential benefits as part of the  package.   That is what this bill is about. That is what the bill last week was  about as well, guaranteeing that if you have a preexisting condition,  you will get affordable health coverage, and saying that in the case of  prescription drugs, 90 percent of prescription drugs now have or could  have a generic alternative to bring down costs.   They bring them down considerably, but the brand-name drug companies  have conspired, in many cases, to make it more difficult for generics  to come to market and delayed them coming to market. That drives up the  costs of prescription drugs.   We have watched this Trump administration sabotage the Affordable  Care Act and put out junk plans so people don't have comprehensive  coverage and people with preexisting conditions have trouble finding  affordable coverage. They have made it more difficult for people to  even know what to buy in the marketplace by cutting back on navigators  and the outreach that makes people aware. They have also made it so  that many people, unfortunately, don't even have options.   We are going to do whatever we can. Republicans may like some bills,  and they may not like others, but we are going to move forward with a  package today and also in the future on whatever we can to make  premiums more affordable and to bring down drug prices.   Mr. Chair, I urge support for these bills for those reasons, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment sponsored by myself and the ranking  member of the full committee, Mr. Walden.   We have been considering the CREATES Act and legislation like it for  years, and it has long been one of my top priorities. So I was pleased  to announce a bipartisan amendment that gained the support of our  Republican colleagues during the Energy and Commerce Committee's  consideration of the CREATES bill.   There was only one outstanding concern still to be resolved after  that amendment was adopted. And I am pleased now to offer a bipartisan  solution to address that concern today.   The concern raised during our full committee markup was that there  was a lack of specificity in the provisions that describe the  communication requirements related to the request and the delivery of  the requested samples between the eligible product developer and the  license holder.   This bipartisan amendment filed by myself and my colleague, the  ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr. Walden, will  provide the additional needed clarity to ensure that communication  requirements in these negotiations are understood so that there is  certainty for both parties.   So I think we have found agreement with our colleagues across the  aisle around a shared goal of discouraging anti-competitive conduct and  providing certainty to both brand and generic manufacturers about the  sample requests and delivery process.   I appreciate the ranking member and his staff for working with me in  good faith on this legislation and urge all my colleagues to vote in  support of this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1445     Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the comments from the  gentleman from Illinois.  [[Page H3874]]    Again, this is an effort to try to make sure that when a patent  expires that the samples or formula are given to generic, so they can  develop a generic alternative. That is what the CREATES Act is all  about.   I would urge support for my amendment, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself 2 minutes.   Mr. Chairman, I am very disappointed that my Republican colleagues  want to strike all of the ACA stabilization measures that we passed  through our committee.   These are important bills that should have strong bipartisan support,  but, unfortunately, my Republican colleagues continue to be unwilling  to work together on commonsense proposals that would lower healthcare  costs for consumers.   Funding for outreach and marketing, why is this even controversial to  my Republican colleagues? Outreach and advertising are critical to  ensuring that people know about the option to enroll in comprehensive  coverage.   We know that last year just one in four uninsured people who buy  their own insurance were aware of the open enrollment season and the  deadline to enroll in coverage.   Another commonsense proposal to lower healthcare costs is to provide  funds to States to set up State-based marketplaces. Again, why is this  controversial? Over the last few years, State-based marketplaces have  had lower premiums and better enrollment than the Federal marketplace.   Enrollment on healthcare.gov has declined due to the Trump  administration's sabotage. Enrollment in the State-based marketplaces  has actually increased. The navigator funding provisions the  Republicans are trying to strike from the bill, again, this is a  program to help hard-to-reach individuals sign up for comprehensive  coverage.   Finally, the Republicans want to remove protection that would block  the Trump administration's expansion of junk insurance plans that  discriminate against people with preexisting conditions.   I really can't understand why my Republican colleagues who claim to  support protections for preexisting conditions want to defend these  plans that discriminate against preexisting conditions and put  consumers at extreme financial risk, other than the fact this is a  Trump administration initiative, so they don't want to oppose it.   In addition to discriminating against people with preexisting  conditions, these junk plans exclude coverage for many important  benefits, such as maternity care. And even when you think you are  covered, if you get sick while you are on one of these, the insurance  companies find a way to avoid paying the bill.   So in closing, this amendment demonstrates what we all know clearly:  that Republicans don't want to do anything to actually help lower  healthcare costs for Americans or safeguard preexisting condition  protections.   Mr. Chair, I urge opposition to this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Florida (Ms. Castor).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Delaware (Ms. Blunt Rochester).    Mr. Chair, I would just ask Members to oppose this  amendment because it guts the effort to improve the Affordable Care  Act.  [[Page H3876]]    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I just think that the navigator program is  so important, and all the outreach that we have in these bills is very  important. I obviously support the gentlewoman's amendment because  every effort to reach out and educate people about their options in the  marketplace is so important.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that in the  engrossment of the bill, H.R. 987, the Clerk be authorized to make  technical corrections and conforming changes to the bill.
