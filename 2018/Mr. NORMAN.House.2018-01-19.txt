 Madam Speaker, as a father of 4 and now 16 grandchildren,  I strongly support the sanctity of human life, and I believe that life  begins at conception. Madam Speaker, a person is a person, no matter  how small.   Whether a baby is still in the womb, if a child is born prematurely,  or even if a child is born alive following an attempting abortion, they  still have a life that is worth protecting.   Therefore, I am a proud cosponsor of H.R. 4712, the Born-Alive  Abortion Survivors Protection Act, sponsored by my good friend,  Representative Marsha Blackburn. This bill will be do so much to  protect our most vulnerable. I will continue to support legislation and  advocate for those who cannot advocate for themselves.
