 Mr. President, when I arrived in Washington this  morning, I fully intended to object to the certification of the  electoral votes. However, the events that have transpired today have  forced me to reconsider, and I cannot now, in good conscience, object  to the certification of these electors.   The violence, the lawlessness, and siege of the Halls of Congress are  abhorrent and stand as a direct attack on the very institution my  objection was intended to protect: the sanctity of the American  democratic process. And I thank law enforcement for keeping us safe.   I believe that there were last-minute changes to the November 2020  election process and serious irregularities that resulted in too many  Americans losing confidence not only in the integrity of our elections  but in the power of the ballot as a tool of democracy. Too many  Americans are frustrated at what they see as an unfair system.  Nevertheless, there is no excuse for the events that took place in  these Chambers today, and I pray that America never suffers such a dark  day again.   Though the fate of this vote is clear, the future of the American  people's faith in the core institution of this democracy remains  uncertain. We as a body must turn our focus to protecting the integrity  of our elections and restoring every American's faith that their voice  and their vote matter.   America is a divided country with serious differences, but it is  still the greatest country on Earth. There can be no disagreement that  upholding democracy is the only path to preserving our Republic.   I yield the floor.   (Applause.)   The VICE PRESIDENT. The Democratic leader.
