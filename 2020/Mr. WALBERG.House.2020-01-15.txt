 Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1230.   Let's be clear. All of us are against workplace discrimination of any  kind, and, Mr. Chairman, at my age I am certainly against age  discrimination.   All of us want to protect all American workers from discrimination,  but contrary to the bill's title, this legislation will end up harming  workers. It is a payout to trial lawyers by muddying legal standards  under the guise of a nice-sounding bill. Any plaintiff who files a  discrimination lawsuit under this bill is extremely unlikely to receive  any monetary awards, but the trial lawyers will still get paid for  their time.   Right now we have an economy that is booming. More than 7 million  jobs are unfilled across this country--that is 7 million jobs going  wanting right now. The pro-growth policies we put in place are working.  Our focus should be on protecting workers and encouraging greater  workforce participation and not rewarding lawyers through increased  opportunities to garner legal fees.   Sadly, this legislation was rushed through the Education and Labor  Committee for partisan purposes. It did not receive a thoughtful  consideration of bipartisan ideas. We can do better but, once again, we  are using precious time to debate political messaging bills instead of  solving problems.   Mr. Chairman, protecting our older workers and encouraging  appropriate job training are outcomes we can all agree on. But the crux  of this bill is designed to help attorneys, not workers.   I urge my colleagues to look beyond the title and vote ``no'' on this  payout to trial lawyers. We can do better, and we can protect all  workers, including those of age, from age discrimination.                                time  1400     Mr. Speaker: ``Around her neck hung a gold necklace that  said `Best Mom,' a Christmas present from her two daughters.   ``Stefanie closed her eyes, just as she does at the dentist. `That  way I don't have to see what's going on,' she said.   ``Ten minutes later, the sleepless nights, the tighter jeans, the  third child that she said would have strained the family's finances,  were a memory.''   That shocking article was in the Chicago Tribune 17 years ago, 2003.  That child who would have strained the family's finances would have  been a senior high school student and who knows what more.   Back then, 40 million babies had been aborted since Roe v. Wade.  Today, 61 million. January 22 marks the 47th ignominy of Roe v. Wade.   As recently as yesterday, in committee, I heard abortion defended as  a ``woman's constitutional right to choose what is best for her own  body and interests.''    Now, someone decried the fact that there are so many men standing and  speaking today, but we men have always stood to defend the innocent and  to defend our families. So, proudly, today, we do the same.   Charles Darwin said, ``great is the power of steady  misrepresentation.''  [[Page H286]]  And so we have created a lie. We have chosen a lie. We have been sold a  lie. We have lived a lie. We have even tried to make it the truth, but  it is still a lie. And children, innocents, and women have been hurt  because of it; and, ultimately, all life has been cheapened and  diminished.   May God change our hearts.   Our children are not our burdens; they are our hope. Our children are  tomorrow's dreams and ideas and imagination. Our children are the  pioneers who unlock more secrets of God's universe, harness new  technologies for peace, strive to create a world freer from want, and  bring forth long-awaited cures for dreaded diseases. They are our  artists, our poets, who will make life more vivid and colorful, and the  faithful who will serve God and their fellow beings.   Babies aren't a choice once they are conceived; they are a gift from  our loving creator, God. Thomas Jefferson wisely stated: ``The God who  gave us life, gave us liberty at the same time.''   And so I end by saying human liberty is inseparably linked to human  life. God help us as a nation to choose life and liberty.
