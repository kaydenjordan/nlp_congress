 Mr. Speaker, 1 year ago, almost to this very day, is the  day when COVID-19 was officially declared a pandemic. One year ago, we  didn't know that this pandemic would infect millions of Americans or  kill thousands of Texans in my home State and hurt so many  disadvantaged communities.   But after a year of darkness, we are finally seeing the light because  the  [[Page H1180]]  House will pass, tomorrow, the American Rescue Plan, a comprehensive  plan that the Biden-Harris administration and our Democrat-led House  and Senate has crafted which will give constituents in the district  that I represent, and all Americans, the chance for some relief.   Our plan will help crush the COVID-19 virus and get the economy  moving again by getting vaccines into arms across the country. Because  in places like my home State of Texas, where Greg Abbott, who is the  Governor, is prematurely lifting COVID-19 restrictions, the best thing  we can do to combat a potential surge against the virus is to make sure  that everybody has a vaccine.   Mr. Speaker, that is why I am a proud supporter and will vote for the  American Rescue Plan tomorrow, because we need a bold solution like  this one for our country and economy to get back on the right track and  to get back to normal.                            ____________________
