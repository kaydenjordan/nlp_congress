 Mr. Speaker, our Nation is in the middle of a youth  tobacco epidemic driven by the increasing popularity of flavored e- cigarettes. In my home State of New York, youth e-cigarette use rose by  160 percent between 2014 and 2018.   I want to commend Chairman Frank Pallone for his work on H.R. 2339  which will help turn the tide in this crisis. I would also like to  thank the chairman for including my provisions in section 107 which  update youth tobacco prevention awareness campaigns to include  programming for Americans between the ages of 18 and 21.   My provisions will help ensure that this group of young Americans is  not left out and receives the support and education they need to avoid  starting dangerous tobacco products.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support Chairman Pallone's legislation and help pave the way for the  first generation of tobacco-free Americans.                            ____________________
