 Mr. President, on Monday, I explained that the  thinness of Judge Jackson's appellate record makes this week's  Judiciary Committee hearings all the more important. Well, we are 2  days in. Judge Jackson is receiving a calm, respectful process, unlike  the treatment that Senate Democrats typically inflict on Republican  Presidents' nominees.   But, unfortunately, thus far, many of Judge Jackson's responses have  been evasive and unclear. She has declined to address critically  important questions and ameliorate real concerns.   First and foremost is the simple question of Court packing. The far- left fringe groups that promoted Judge Jackson to this vacancy want  Democrats to destroy the Court's legitimacy through partisan Court  packing or unconstitutional term limits. She was literally the Court  packers' pick for the seat, and she has repeatedly refused to reject  their position.   Both of the liberal legal giants, Justice Ginsburg and Justice  Breyer, had no problem--no problem--defending the Court and denouncing  Court packing. Both Ginsburg and Breyer denounced Court packing. As  sitting Justices, they commented freely on the subject. The Justices  knew that expressing a  [[Page S1718]]  clear view and defending their institution was not--I repeat, not-- judicially inappropriate in any way.   But Judge Jackson has refused to follow in the footsteps of Ginsburg  and Breyer. She refuses to rule out what the radical activists want.  She told Senator Kennedy that she does have an opinion on Court  packing, but it is ``not a strongly held opinion,'' and, in any event,  she wouldn't tell Senators what it was.   But the nominee made sure to quietly signal openness--openness--for  the radicals' position. She told Senators she could see both sides of  the Court-packing debate. Where Justices Ginsburg and Breyer slammed  the door, Judge Jackson leaves it open. She even told the Committee:         I would be thrilled to be one of however many Congress       thought appropriate to put on the Court.    `` . . . thrilled to be one of however many Congress thought  appropriate to put on the Court.'' ``[H]owever many''? I am not sure  Judge Jackson's secret opinion on Court packing is as secret as she  thinks it is.   Judge Jackson also displayed a remarkable lack of candor during basic  questions about judicial philosophy. When asked about judicial  philosophy, the nominee tried to punt by simply restating the most  basic elements of a judge's job description. She said she looks at the  facts and treats litigants fairly. That is not explaining a judicial  philosophy. That is just rewording the judicial oath. It is, basically,  a nonanswer.   These are pivotal questions. They require clear responses, and  previous nominees had much less trouble providing them. A year and a  half ago, now-Justice Barrett gave the Committee an intellectual master  class in her textualist and original judicial philosophy. She described  her interpretive approach in great detail. She helpfully compared and  contrasted her philosophy with past and present Justices to provide  Senators with points of comparison. But Judge Jackson either cannot or  will not do any of that.   Senator Sasse said that in his meeting with the nominee more than 2  weeks ago, he asked the judge to compare and contrast her own thinking  with Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan to give Senators a point of  reference. At that time, the judge apparently told the Senator that she  needed to think about it but would get back to him. He followed up  yesterday, and Judge Jackson said actually she had been too busy to  give it any thought.   She could not or would not even supply a clear summary of just the  philosophy of Justice Breyer. Justice Breyer is Judge Jackson's former  boss for whom she clerked. He has written entire books detailing his  judicial approach, but Judge Jackson either could not or would not  describe it.   In one jaw-dropping moment, Judge Jackson tried to dodge questions  about constitutional interpretation by claiming that she does not have  enough experience--does not have enough experience.   Here is what she said:         I would say, just as an aside . . . that while I have been       on the bench for nine-plus years, the issue of constitutional       interpretation in that sense doesn't come up very often. It       comes up to the Supreme Court for sure, but it doesn't come       up very often in the lower courts.    In other words, at least in that moment, a nominee for the U.S.  Supreme Court tried to tell the Committee that her professional  experience had not prepared her--not prepared her--for an in-depth  discussion of constitutional interpretation.    The White House and Senate Democrats keep saying Judge Jackson's  district court experience is perfect preparation for the Supreme Court,  but it sounds like the nominee herself may actually disagree with that.   Let's be very clear. If Judge Jackson truly feels she lacks  sufficient experience with constitutional interpretation, then the  Senate certainly should not confirm her. But if she does not actually  feel that way, then she owes the Senate much more candor about her  approach.   For decades, liberal activists have preferred judges who do not limit  themselves to applying the text of our laws and our Constitution, but  rather make new policy from the bench.   Sure enough, Judge Jackson spent all day yesterday trying to explain  what amounts to a passionate policy disagreement with existing  sentencing guidelines for certain horrible crimes. In a number of  instances, she has given out sentences far, far below the sentencing  guidelines and far below the government prosecutors' request. In cases  ranging from child exploitation to fentanyl trafficking, she has used  every possible ounce of discretion to essentially remake sentencing  policy from the bench.   Under questions from Senator Cotton, Judge Jackson said it would be  inappropriate for her to comment on the proper durations of criminal  sentences as this was a policy matter for legislators and not judges.  But at other times, she justified her own past leniency by explaining  that judges have huge amounts of discretion and latitude on sentencing  criminals. Either subjective questions about sentencing are fair game  for the judicial branch or they are not. Certainly, the nominee cannot  have it both ways.   Today, Judge Jackson will have another chance--another chance to  defend the institution of the Court, like Justices Ginsburg and Breyer  had no trouble doing; another chance to give Senators a clear  explanation of her judicial philosophy, like Justices Gorsuch and  Barrett had no trouble doing; another chance to explain whether and how  her clear policy views on the merits of sentencing criminals will  continue to impact her judicial judgment.   The Senate and the country will be watching.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
