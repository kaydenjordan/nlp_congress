 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank him for his important work on this urgent bill.   It is too late to overstate the urgency of the climate crisis. It has  already assumed emergency status in parts of the world, including parts  of States like Florida.   The threatened withdrawal of the U.S. from the Paris climate accord  should be considered an international crime. The United States is the  only nation to threaten to withdraw from the agreement, but others,  such as Brazil, seem willing to follow our lead.   I am encouraged, though, that in our country, even though we have  record polarization today, Americans overwhelmingly want the United  States to remain in the agreement. The absurdity of sealing our own  fate by faking blindness to the climate catastrophe is not lost on the  American people we represent. This is the most serious issue faced by  the Congress of the United States in our history. We must vote for the  life, not the end of the planet.
