 Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on the portion of this rule  which would once again throw our student loan system into crisis.  Congress' failure to address the student debt crisis has left American  borrowers with over $1.6 trillion in student loans, and Pennsylvania  borrowers hold some of the highest student debt in the Nation.   This crippling burden is preventing generations of Americans from  taking public service jobs, from buying homes and cars, and from fully  participating in our economy.   The resolution we are considering today does nothing to solve the  student loan crisis. It would undermine the income-based repayment  program authorized by Congress years ago and will create more chaos and  confusion for student loan borrowers.   Nearly 5.5 million borrowers across the country have enrolled in the  SAVE plan in just the past 3 months. In my district alone, 13,700  people have signed up in anticipation of an average relief of $1,200 a  year.   If this resolution were to pass, millions of borrowers enrolled in  this program will be left in limbo again, unsure how they can meet  their student loan obligations and keep food on the table and a roof  over their heads.   Instead of shooting down every attempt to address this crisis,  Congress must take action to provide comprehensive, long-term solutions  to make higher education more affordable and simplify the repayment  process for student loan borrowers.   Mr. Speaker, I oppose this rule.
