 Mr. President, today I come back to the floor of the  Senate to talk again about the opioid crisis that has gripped the  country and my State of Ohio.   I want to focus on the issue of fentanyl. This is the most deadly of  the drugs now. It is a drug that is causing the most overdoses at a  time in which we have unprecedented numbers of overdoses.   Fentanyl is a synthetic form of heroin and opioids. It is coming  through the mail. It is coming mostly from one country--China. It is  the poison that has contributed more in the last few years to the rise  in opioid use than anything else.   Over the past week, we have made some significant progress in pushing  back against fentanyl, and I want to report on that today.   As I am talking today, the U.S. House of Representatives is going to  take up legislation called the STOP Act, which we have been working on  here in the Senate for a couple of years. I am very pleased about that.  I suspect the vote today will be bipartisan. I suspect it will pass the  House.   I also want to report that here in the Senate we have had a  breakthrough in the last week. Not only have we negotiated something  with the House that is, in my view, an improvement from the legislation  that passed the House Ways and Means committee a couple of weeks ago,  but also, in the Senate Finance Committee this week, we had a markup  and got a commitment from the chairman and ranking member that the  Finance Committee will also mark up the same legislation--identical  legislation--as is likely to pass the House of Representatives today.   I thank Chairman Orrin Hatch and Ranking Member Ron Wyden for working  with us to ensure we could get this legislation marked up in committee  and onto the floor of the U.S. Senate as part of whatever we do in  terms of the opioid crisis here in the coming days and weeks.   Of course, I also commend my House colleagues for the vote today and  for the work they have done on this, particularly the Ways and Means  Committee chairman, Kevin Brady, Representatives  Mike Bishop, Dave  [[Page S3946]]  Reichert, Bill Pascrell, and  John Faso for their efforts on this bill  to combat the opioid crisis. Again, my hope is the bill that passes the  House today will be identical to the bill we will take up here on the  floor of the U.S. Senate, so we can ensure we can get this bill to the  President for his signature as soon as possible.   This is an urgent issue. This is not just an important issue; it is  an urgent issue. We need to push back, and we need to push back hard.   The drug fentanyl is so dangerous that a couple milligrams of it, a  few flecks of it, can kill you. Again, it is something that is causing  the most overdoses right now. It is not just affecting those who are  overdosing on it; it is affecting all of us, including our first  responders, including young children who come in contact with it. The  stories of kids exposed to fentanyl are really heartbreaking, perhaps  because someone left it behind at a party, perhaps because their  parents or other family members left it behind, and these young  children are overdosing and dying. This is happening in my State. This  is happening around the country.   First responders are being affected. I hear stories about it when I  am home, whether it is a firefighter, someone in the healthcare  industry, or someone who is in law enforcement. A story, which I have  mentioned before, is about an East Liverpool, OH, police officer. He  pulls over two suspects, notices they are spreading white powder inside  the car, trying to hide it. Wisely, he puts on gloves and a mask. He  makes the arrest. When he is back at the police station booking these  individuals--not for the traffic violation so much as for the  fentanyl--he looks at his shirt and notices a couple of flecks of  something white on his shirt, and brushes it off like that. His fingers  are exposed to the fentanyl. Immediately, he falls to the ground  unconscious and has to be revived by Narcan, not once, not twice, but  for Chris Green, a big guy--6 feet 2 inches, 200-some pounds, in great  shape--four doses of Narcan were necessary to save his life and keep  him alive.   As his police chief said, if they weren't right there with him, what  would have happened? What would have happened if he had gone home, had  those flecks on his shoulder, and hugged his kids? This is an  incredibly dangerous substance, and we have to deal with it.   Last year, law enforcement officials in Massachusetts said that with  two doses of Narcan, they revived a man who said he had been smoking  only marijuana. How could this be? It was because fentanyl was mixed  with that marijuana.   I was in Lorain, OH, last week for a meeting with folks involved in  pushing back against this substance abuse problem--law enforcement,  social workers, treatment providers. Law enforcement told us a story  that was very much the same--a young man who had to be revived by using  Narcan. He said: I was just smoking dope.   It couldn't be. Sure enough, when they checked, they found out the  marijuana had been laced with fentanyl. It is also going into cocaine.  It is also going into crystal meth. In fact, crystal meth now is  becoming a bigger problem in my home State of Ohio, and we know for a  fact that this is a bigger problem in part because it is being mixed  with fentanyl.   The Dayton area recently released its county overdose report. The  Dayton area experienced three times as many crystal meth-related  overdose deaths in 2017 as compared to 2016. Again, they believe  fentanyl mixed into these drugs is the contributing factor.   The county coroner from Cincinnati said that she has now seen  fentanyl mixed with cocaine and marijuana, as well as a number of  street drugs. Fentanyl and its variants are now the deadliest drugs of  the opioid epidemic.   One of the takeaways I have had from my meetings around the State,  talking to people about how we push back on fentanyl, is a growing  consensus that we need to make much more progress in keeping the  fentanyl from coming into our communities in the first place. Again, we  know this is what is causing the big increase in overdoses and deaths  at a time when we are doing more at home to address the opioid crisis.  If not for fentanyl, I strongly believe we would be making progress. We  would be seeing a reduction in overdoses.   This body has passed the CARA legislation--the Comprehensive  Addiction and Recovery Act; it has also passed the 21st Century Cures  Act. I have been at different places in the State in the last few weeks  where they have been using that funding well, to do things like quick  response teams--when somebody is revived with Narcan, the miracle drug  that reverses the effects of the overdose, then, be sure you are  getting that person treatment by working with law enforcement,  treatment providers, and social workers together. It is working.   In one case where they are using funding from the CARA legislation,  80 percent of the people whom they are coming into contact with are  going into treatment. That is a tremendous improvement from,  unfortunately, what is generally happening, which is that very few  people are actually going from the Narcan overdose saving the person's  life into treatment. We have to deal with that gap.   So we are making progress, yet the fentanyl is overwhelming the  system. So it is time for us to figure this out, and push back harder.   In 2013, in my home city of Cincinnati, we experienced a 1,000- percent increase in fentanyl deaths. In the first 5 months of this  year, more than 90 percent of the drugs seized by the Hamilton County  crime lab contained fentanyl--more than 90 percent.   Most of the drugs we talk about pushing back against--think of  cocaine, heroin, even crystal meth--come in overland, mostly across the  southern border from Mexico. What law enforcement tells us and what the  intelligence community tells us is that fentanyl comes in primarily by  the U.S. mail system. So instead of coming overland--and the need for  helping to secure our southern border is clear partly because of that-- here we have a situation where this drug is coming in through our own  Federal agency, the U.S. mail service. They tell us it comes primarily  from one country--China. It is made in a laboratory in China, and it is  shipped over here.   We spent about 18 months studying this issue. We went undercover and  contacted a lot of different websites, and they all told us the same  thing, which is this: If you are going to buy from us, ship it by U.S.  mail. If it comes by U.S. mail, we guarantee delivery. If you don't  send it by U.S. mail, we are not so sure we can guarantee it.   Why is that? Because 16 years ago, this body and the U.S. House of  Representatives, after the tragic incidents of 9/11, decided we were  going to tighten up on packages coming into our country and the law  enforcement screening of those packages. So we required all the private  carriers--FedEx, UPS, DHL, and others--to provide law enforcement data  about those packages, where they were from, what was in them, where  they were going. They had to provide that data electronically and in  advance so that law enforcement could use big data and use analytics to  determine what packages were suspect to be able to pull them offline.   I have been to those facilities where this happens. It is very  impressive. It is also very dangerous. These packages, once identified,  have to be taken into a room where there is adequate ventilation and  other precautions taken--gloves and masks and so on--because of the  danger of fentanyl.   But the U.S. Post Office was not required 16 years ago to provide  that information. Instead, the legislation said that the post office  needed to study the issue, leaving it clear in legislative history that  Congress considered it a problem but wanted to give the post office  time to look into it. Specifically, they asked the Postmaster General  and Department of Homeland Security to come up with a report. It never  happened.   So here we are, 16 years later. The post office doesn't have that  requirement, and these other ways you can send packages mailed into the  United States do have that requirement. So guess where the traffickers  go.   The post office in the last year or so has begun to step up its  efforts, and I am happy about that. I believe they did it because of  our hearings and because of the pressure from Congress and because of  this legislation called the  [[Page S3947]]  STOP Act. They now say that they are screening about 36 percent of  their packages. Again, that is a big improvement. However, there are  about 900 million packages a year. That means about 315 million  packages are being looked at, and this is a big improvement, but we  still have so many hundreds of millions of packages not receiving that  kind of screening.   In addition, we learned through our hearings and investigation that  20 percent of the time, when law enforcement had identified a Postal  Service package that was suspect, it was not presented to law  enforcement. In other words, it went into the community anyway.   Clearly, we have a big problem. We are not screening adequately, we  are not providing the information for enough packages, and we are not  giving law enforcement the tools they need to do their job. By the way,  with regard to the private carriers, it is 100 percent required.   So the legislation we are proposing is to tell the post office: This  poison has to be stopped in every way we possibly can. This is a  crisis. This is not just important; it is urgent. It is something we  want you to address.   So it says that by 2020 we have to have 100 percent of packages  screened, and we have to give law enforcement the tools they need. Law  enforcement, of course, is desperate to get this information. If they  have the information, they can help. They can help to keep these  packages out of our country. They can also help to raise the price.   Some packages that are stopped, of course, would otherwise have gone  to a post office box or someone's home or an abandoned house and been  distributed. Packages that could have poisoned hundreds of thousands of  people and killed hundreds of thousands of people have been seized in  the State of Ohio. There was a package found recently in Nebraska that  could have killed millions of people. In a relatively small quantity,  this is incredibly powerful, dangerous stuff.   Now, with this legislation, we will be able to identify more of these  packages and get them offline and, again, at a minimum, be able to  raise the cost.   One of the reasons fentanyl has taken over and pushed out other  drugs--by the way, it is 50 times more powerful than heroin. One reason  is that it is relatively inexpensive. This will raise the price and  reduce the volume and help to save lives.   We now have over one-third of the U.S. Senate as cosponsors of this  legislation, including Senator Hatch and Senator Wyden. Again, I  appreciate their support and their work on this. We also have about  half of the House of Representatives who have supported the STOP Act in  the other Chamber.   It is time for us to take the next step: pass this legislation, get  it in place, and immediately tell countries like China, if you want to  send packages to us, you have to provide this information.   We have done everything we can in other ways to encourage China to  crack down on these labs, the evil scientists who are continuing to  make this product. We are taking other steps, of course, to do that. We  are taking other steps to deal with this issue in terms of increased  prevention and education efforts. That is in the CARA legislation.  There is $10 million right now available for the administration to come  up with a national media campaign that I would strongly support. They  have already started a smaller media campaign with the private sector.  I support that as well. We need to push back every way we can, letting  people know the dangers, including the fact that any street drugs you  take now potentially can have deadly consequences, including fentanyl.   We need to do more in terms of getting people into treatment. This is  a disease, and it needs to be treated as such. We are not going to be  able to make progress unless we take people who are already addicted  and get them into the treatment and longer term recovery they need.  Longer term recovery is funded by CARA and Cures. This is the first  time Congress has done this. It is very important because if you get  people into longer term recovery programs--sober housing and group  discussions, helping to support them--you have a much higher likelihood  of somebody getting clean, being successful, being able to get back on  track, getting back with their family, getting back to their job.   Finally, we have to do more in terms of helping law enforcement.  Again, that is partly what we are doing here, giving them the tools to  be able to stop some of this poison from coming in, in the first place.   I am encouraged with the progress we made just in the last week. We  now have a House bill that is being voted on, as I speak. We now have a  Senate bill that has been agreed to be reported out of committee coming  onto the floor. They are identical. They both do the job. They both  tell the post office we have to change behavior.   By the way, in terms of the post office, someone told me today that  the postal union was concerned about this legislation. I encourage you  to talk to rank-and-file mail carriers, postal carriers, and ask them  what they think. They don't want to be carrying this poison into our  communities. They don't want to be potentially exposed to this poison,  should a package leak, because of the danger of it.   The people I talk to agree, we absolutely have to crack down on this.  We are not asking the post office to do it alone. We are providing  funding to Customs and Border Protection to be there with them. The  postal inspectors, the folks who are actually local law enforcement,  are desperate to ensure that we can do this because they are tired of  it. They are tired of seeing this stuff come in, like an avalanche  coming into our country, and creating all these problems across the  board in our communities, every sector of our community being affected.  People are desperate for solutions because they acknowledge the  problem.   I had a tele-townhall meeting last week in Washington where I called  in and spoke to thousands of Ohioans at once. We do this on a monthly  basis. For the last few years, we have been asking questions about  opioids in our survey. It is a very simple question. It says: Have you  been directly affected? Has anybody you know been directly affected by  this opioid crisis?   Unbelievably, we have gotten typically about 50 percent of the people  who called--again, these are thousands of people randomly selected-- saying: Yes, my family or someone I know has been directly affected by  opioids.   At the call last week, two-thirds of the people on the call said they  have been directly affected or someone they know has been directly  affected. That is why people are desperate for a solution because it is  affecting them. It is affecting their lives. It is affecting their  families. It is affecting our communities. It is affecting every single  aspect of our community--the healthcare system, the foster care system,  the prison system, the court system. It is time for us to step up and  do more. Yes, prevention, treatment, longer term recovery but also  helping law enforcement to be able to push back and stop some of this  poison from coming into our communities in the first place.   Let's pass the STOP Act to give law enforcement the tools they need  against this new scourge of this epidemic, and by doing so, we will  save lives.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, while my vote would not have changed the  outcome, I would have voted ``yea'' on the motion to invoke cloture on  the Toomey amendment. I was questioning nominees at the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee hearing on nominations at the time of the vote.                            ____________________
