 Mr. Speaker, earlier this week, the USS  Fitzgerald collided with a container ship off the coast of Japan. Seven  of our brave servicemembers were killed in the collision.   I ask my colleagues to join me in a moment of silence to honor the  brave sailors who gave the ultimate sacrifice for our country.
