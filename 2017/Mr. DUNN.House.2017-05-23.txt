 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2288, the Veterans  Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017.   This important legislation will update and streamline the  bureaucratic nightmare that is the disability appeals process. This  bill breaks appeals down into three lanes to expedite decisionmaking  and improves the ability of veterans to offer new information about  their condition. The bill requires Secretary Shulkin to provide a  comprehensive plan of how he plans to implement the crucial changes  which are supported by both the VFW and the American Legion.   Our men and women in uniform served with the assurance that they  would be well treated when they came home. They earned and they deserve  timely service from their government. Instead, veterans wait years to  hear from an out-of-date, backlogged appeals system. Sometimes that  process takes 5 years--5 years. That is an insult to their service, and  it is an insult that we cannot tolerate.   Our veterans fought for their country abroad. Now it is our job to  ensure that they don't have another fight when they come home. Mr.  Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this important  legislation.
