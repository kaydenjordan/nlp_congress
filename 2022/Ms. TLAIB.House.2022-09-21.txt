 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Resolution  Recognizing the Human Rights to Utilities.   I read an article about a couple in their seventies in Detroit who  had to melt snow in a bucket in front of their home so they can flush  their toilet. That is when I knew when I came to the United States  Congress, I had to introduce water as a human rights act.   Millions of our neighbors across our country right now struggle with  utility insecurity, fear of shutoffs, and are subject to inhumane  living conditions.   I proudly stand with Representatives Bush and Bowman and other  colleagues in the House in changing the conversation around what we all  deserve.   The resolution ensures that everyone has access to water, sanitation,  electricity, heating and cooling, public transit, and broadband  communications all as a basic human right.   It is past time that we take the profit motive out of providing the  basics of a good life for many of our neighbors who continue again to  struggle. I appreciate everyone that is working on this issue and the  advocates out there that know that this is important to our country.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the ever-amazing partner in good  trouble, Congressman Bowman, for hosting this Special Order hour on one  of the most critical issues facing our Nation, youth mental health.   As a mother of two young boys, I know that there are few people who  see this mental health crisis amongst our children quite like our  teachers and our educators. They are on the front lines of it every  single day, and it is in no way an exaggeration to say America's  teachers are the ones saving lives in the face of a tidal wave of  trauma and grief brought about by many crises impacting our young  people today.   From COVID-19 to schools turning into war zones, severe economic  hardship, and an education system that continues to be underfunded for  a number of issues that, again, our kids are dealing with, we are  seeing that trauma is at the center of it.   I know according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, 57.8  percent of Michiganders from the age of 12 to 17 who have experienced  depression did not receive any care in the last year, and high school  students with depression are more than two times more likely to drop  out than their peers.   These are just a few of the compounding traumas impacting our young  people today. These traumas have stolen our children's sense of safety  and our children's support systems. So, the fact that the rates of  youth in mental health distress have skyrocketed should be a surprise  to no one, especially not anyone in this body.   We have failed to address gun violence. We have failed to protect  basic human rights. We have failed to ensure that every child in the  richest nation on Earth has access to the clean air, safe water, and  healthy food that they need to grow and thrive. We have failed to truly  address childhood poverty.   Instead of investing in schools, combating poverty, and taking action  on reducing violence, this body continues to double down on failed  approaches.   I know I continue to be asked in my community: What good is another  100 F-35s when our children go to sleep on empty stomachs? What is the  point of spending more money on militarization of our communities than  any other country spends on defense instead of making sure that our  children have safe drinking water and that they are not exposed to lead  and PFAS?   While our children are crying out for help as loud as they can, over  in the Senate, their elected leaders, many of whom have been bought and  paid for by the fossil fuel lobby, are working hard to--you guessed  it--sell out their chances at a livable future and improve the lives of  many of our folks in the future.   This body, this Congress, isn't just failing to address this youth  mental health crisis. It is turbocharging it.   I know in my community, we have the most polluted ZIP Code in the  [[Page H8052]]  State of Michigan, 48217, where we see high rates of asthma. When I go  read to children in the third grade class during March Reading Month, I  ask how many children there know what I do for a living, and they don't  know, usually, and I have to give them a civics lesson. I tell them  that I am trying to fight for clean air. I ask them: ``How many of you  have asthma or are suffering from asthma?'' A third of the class always  raises their hands.   I ask them: ``It hurts to have an asthma attack, doesn't it? It is  hard to breathe. Isn't it hard to breathe?'' They shake their heads.   Every day, we fail. We fail them by not taking action on climate for  a livable future.   Please know this: Our children cannot learn if they are hungry, but  they also cannot learn if they are breathing dirty air, if they are  being poisoned by lead-infested water, so we must take action.   I know that we also have failed to enact real, meaningful gun control  that our children can be proud of, that our teachers can feel is  meaningful and that it actually does keep them safe.   Every day that we have failed to enact bold reforms to resurrect and  protect our democracy is a day closer to dooming our children to a  fascist future where their rights are stripped from them.   This isn't new for our communities, but I know for many of the young  people of color in my community, the LGBTQI youth, our immigrant youth,  our religious minorities, these failures have been amplified by the  horrifying pandemic of racism, bigotry, and hate that has exploded in  our country.   Make no mistake, the crisis of hate facing our country is 100 percent  the result of continued political motivation that is literally a factor  in pushing elected officials and social leaders in spewing out fear  rather than trying to address the root causes of the issues that our  children are facing.   I know the only solution here is fundamental overhaul of what we  govern. We must put our children before corporations, people before  profits, and community solidarity before hate and fear.   Madam Speaker, I cannot thank my colleague enough for his incredible  leadership. Sometimes it is our lived experiences that we bring into  this Chamber that give us the passion and inspiration to work hard. I  am so honored to be able to serve with somebody that not only was a  principal but is also a father himself and understands and has been on  the front line and seen the lack of action in this body for our youth  mental health crisis in our country.
