 Madam Speaker, Wednesday marked the 1-month anniversary  of the terrible shooting that happened in my hometown of Las Vegas.   Today I rise to remember the life of Dorene Anderson from Anchorage,  Alaska, a woman who was known for her kindness and her smile.   Dorene was a loving wife, mother, sister, aunt, and friend who always  went above and beyond for everyone in her life. Not only was she a  dedicated mother to her two daughters, she was known as a mother to her  community.   Dorene loved hockey and was the treasurer of the Cowbell Crew, a  nonprofit hockey organization that supported hockey at all levels.   Her friends describe her as an all-around wonderful Alaskan who had a  heart of gold, a person who was friendly to everyone.   I would like to extend my condolences to Dorene's family and friends.  Please know that the city of Las Vegas and the State of Nevada and the  whole country grieve with you.                            ____________________
