 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk and ask  for its consideration.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to ensure that the  pay raises are equally distributed to all Federal employees at the  National Aeronautics and Space Administration.   In the Houston area that I represent, there are more than 3,000  Federal civil servants who do important work at the Johnson Space  Center. While most of these employees work under the traditional GS pay  scale and would be covered by the base pay scale adjustment, there are  certain employees who would not.   NASA, like many technical agencies, can authorize certain pay  flexibilities under different chapters of the code to recruit talented  individuals. My amendment merely clarifies that these employees are  equally deserving of this pay raise.   After the shutdown, it is now more important than ever to work to  retain talented civil service employees around our country, especially  at NASA.   I would like to thank my colleagues for working with me on this  amendment and urge their support to ensure that the hardworking civil  servants get the pay raise that they deserve.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I just want to reiterate that the  purpose of this amendment isn't to address the underlying issues that  the gentleman from North Carolina raised, but it is really to just  ensure that the language of this amendment may be applied equally and  that no one at NASA is left behind because of differences in the way  that their compensation structure is currently scheduled. This is a  clarifying amendment, and it is just dedicated to the purpose of making  sure that these employees may be included and not excluded from this  act.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
