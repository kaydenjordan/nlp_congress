 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak against this rule  and H.J. Res. 69, which we will be debating tomorrow.   Last year, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service updated its regulations  for national wildlife refuges in Alaska to prohibit the cruelest  killing methods of wolves, grizzly bears, and other native mammals in  Alaska.   The rule FWS put forward makes sense. It even makes clear that it  does not apply to subsistence hunting or restrict the taking of  wildlife for public safety purposes or in defense of property. Yet,  here we are, just 6 months later, and Republicans are pushing through  this resolution to overturn the rule and make egregious and cruel  hunting methods common practice in Alaska.   They are inhumane methods, such as denning of wolves and their pups,  using airplanes to scout and shoot grizzly bears, and trapping grizzly  bears with steel-jawed traps. These cruel methods should never be  allowed anywhere. This resolution is irresponsible and inhumane.    As with other Congressional Review Act resolutions, H.J. Res. 69 will  have a chilling effect. This and future administrations would be  prohibited from ever issuing a similar rule, making inhumane and  reprehensible hunting methods the law of the land.   This resolution handcuffs our Federal wildlife managers from  protecting our refuges, our national resources, and our wildlife. We  must ensure that our children and grandchildren will someday enjoy the  majestic national beauty of the native mammals in Alaska and across our  great Nation.   I urge my colleagues to reject this rule and also vote ``no'' on H.J.  Res. 69.
