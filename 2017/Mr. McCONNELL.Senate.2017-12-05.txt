 I thank my friend from Illinois.                            ____________________     Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate voted to advance  the nomination of Kirstjen Nielsen to be Secretary of Homeland  Security. Now it is time for us to vote to confirm her so she can get  to work for the American people. By confirming Ms. Nielsen's nomination  to lead the DHS, this Senate will take a serious step toward  strengthening our Nation's security.   Ms. Nielsen will be charged with leading the Department at a critical  time. With her understanding of the challenges facing our Nation and  her experience in prevention and preparedness, I believe she will excel  as the next Secretary of Homeland Security. Her leadership will also  help in providing continued assistance to the men and women still  suffering from the effects of the recent natural disasters in our  country. Our Nation faces a myriad of threats, and I look forward to  working with Ms. Nielsen to address each of them.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as we all know, we must pass  legislation to fund the government before the end of the week. By  approving a short-term bill, we can continue the crucial functions of  the Federal Government while we work with our colleagues in the House  and the Trump administration to finalize a long-term plan.   The temporary funding measure will come before the House soon, and I  expect the Senate to consider it shortly thereafter. It is a clean  bill, free from any sort of objectionable policy riders. In addition,  it includes a provision to assure States of the future of the  Children's Health Insurance Program while a bipartisan reauthorization  agreement is completed. All Members should be able to support this  noncontroversial, short-term legislation.   We will continue working to pass a funding agreement that advances a  number of American priorities--something we will be discussing with the  President on Thursday, along with Democratic leaders of the House and  Senate.   Yesterday, the Senate Democratic leader expressed his opposition to a  government shutdown. I certainly agree with him. So I hope he and his  fellow Democrats will continue to work with us in good faith to pass  this short-term funding bill and maintain the critical functions of the  Federal Government.                            ____________________     Mr. President, one final matter. Last night, our  colleagues in the House voted to send the tax reform legislation to a  conference committee. There, Members from both Chambers will work to  resolve the differences in our bills and eventually enable us to send a  final product to the President for his signature.   The House's action last night is more progress in our years-long  effort to deliver real relief to the men and women we represent. I am  grateful to our friends in the House for their willingness to continue  working with us to help shift our economy into high gear. I look  forward to the Senate voting to join the conference later this week.   In the end, both Chambers will have an opportunity to pass the final  legislation to help families keep more of their hard-earned money, to  create good jobs, and to jump-start economic growth. I look forward to  working with all of our colleagues to get this done.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session for the consideration of the following  nomination: Executive Calendar No. 455.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  vote on the nomination with no intervening action or debate; that if  confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action; that no further motions be in order; and that any statements  relating to the nomination be printed in the Record.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of the following nomination: Executive  Calendar No. 501.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  vote on the nomination with no intervening action or debate; that if  confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action; that no further motions be in order; and that any statements  relating to the nomination be printed in the Record.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time  to be determined by the majority leader, in consultation with the  Democratic leader, the Senate proceed to executive session for  consideration of Calendar No. 321, the nomination of Joseph Balash to  be an Assistant Secretary of the Interior. I further ask that there be  1 hour of debate on the nomination, equally divided in the usual form;  and that following the use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote on  confirmation with no intervening action or debate; and that if  confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I understand that there is a bill at  the desk, and I ask for its first reading.    Mr. President, I now ask for a second reading and, in  order to place the bill on the calendar under provisions of rule XIV, I  object to my own request.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Wednesday, December 6; further, that following the prayer and pledge,  the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be  approved to date, and the time for the two leaders be reserved for  their use later in the day; finally, that following leader remarks, the  Senate be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to  speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order, following the remarks of our Democratic  colleagues.
