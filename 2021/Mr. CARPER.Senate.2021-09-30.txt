 Madam President, before you leave, I want you to know  that sitting next to me is Emily Spain from Santa Barbara, CA, where I  think you might have been married, who is leaving today as my chief of  staff.   The VICE PRESIDENT. Welcome. Welcome. It is a beautiful place. I did  get married in Santa Barbara.    You are wonderful for coming to preside today and helping  us to send her off.   Now, if there is an extra box of Kleenex up there for me to use for  my remarks, I would appreciate it.   Godspeed. Godspeed.   Madam President--soon to be Mr. President.    Mr. President, I have already telegraphed my pitch here,  but I rise today to thank from the bottom of my heart the woman who has  spent nearly two decades serving in this institution, and luckily for  me, nearly 13  [[Page S6811]]  of those years have been spent as a member of my team.   Emily Spain has written many speeches like the one I am about to  give, Mr. President, but today I have the privilege of giving a very  special speech thanking Emily for her great service.   Emily may have been born and raised in California, but she has become  an honorary Delawarean, and we are so proud to have had the blessing of  her service and her friendship.   Anybody would be hard-pressed to find others who have been able to do  all the things that Emily has done. She has helped to win campaigns,  including a number of mine.   She has worked in the House of Representatives for her hometown  Congresswoman, Lois Capps, whom the Presiding Officer served with, I  believe, in the House.   She has helped to pass historic legislation that improved the lives  of millions of Americans, like the Affordable Care Act. When people ask  me what I am proudest of that I have worked on in the U.S. Senate, I  always say the extension of healthcare to millions of people who  otherwise wouldn't have it, through the Affordable Care Act. Without  Emily's support, I am not sure that it would have become law.   She has served not only as our communications director but also as  our legislative director and as our chief of staff. For folks who are  not familiar with Washington, DC, that may not sound like maybe a lot,  but in this game, in this business, it is a hat trick. It is a hat  trick. You don't often find someone as talented or, frankly, as  tireless as Emily Spain.   Many of my colleagues know this about me, but I like to start my days  off by going for a run or going to the YMCA in Wilmington for a  workout, and then I head to the train station, the Biden Station, and  jump on a train and come down here and come to work with all our  colleagues. I am used to having a pretty full day of meetings and  committee hearings and votes and events. And then almost every night, I  go back to Union Station and climb on a train and take the train in the  opposite way, back to Biden Station in Wilmington. It is a full day  every day. I enjoy it because I like to be busy, and I like to get  things done.   Well, let me just say, in terms of getting things done, I have met my  match--fortunately, I met her about 15 years ago--because the person  who always, without fail, demonstrates more energy in her small finger  than I do in my whole body is Emily Spain. It is incredible. It is  incredible. Her tenacity, her strength, her conviction--this woman is  literally tireless and somehow manages to get it all done and more.   She has an incredibly demanding job managing a staff of nearly 50  people between our DC offices and my three offices back in the State of  Delaware.   Dealing with the latest in Congress often requires, as the Presiding  Officer knows, one's attention 24/7 and especially of late. On top of  all that, she is raising a young family and managing to give back to  her community in ways big and small. Ask anyone who knows Emily--her  energy is boundless, and you will never hear her complain--never hear  her complain. She dives in headfirst to whatever task is before her,  and she just gets things done.   I know the Presiding Officer feels this way, but I love to be  surrounded by people who are good at getting things done. I always like  to be surrounded by people who are smarter than me. That is not a high  bar for me, but for others, it probably is. But she is smart as a  whip--smart as a whip.   I also consider myself a glass-half-full kind of person. My wife  likes to say I am an eternal optimist, and Emily and I share that trait  too. I think it is easy for people to come to Washington and, maybe  after a couple years here, become cynical, maybe even jaded. That has  never happened with her, even after all these years--not Emily. She  always sees the best in other people. She always sees the potential for  what could be in a person or in a piece of legislation, and if a bill  can be made better, Emily will give it all that she has to make it  happen.   If an intern in our office wants advice on how to succeed on Capitol  Hill, Emily will take an hour out of her incredibly busy day to help  that intern. If partisan politics are getting in the way of getting  things done, Emily is not afraid to cross the aisle, make a connection,  and get something over the finish line.   There is a reason that, when I walk around the Capitol with Emily,  she is the one people recognize and say hello to, and that is because,  from staff to Senators alike, Emily has an incredible ability to  connect with people from all walks of life. No matter how busy she may  be, she always takes the time to really listen to others. She is a  really good listener. My father used to say: God gives us one mouth and  two ears; we should use them in that relation. And she is a great  listener.   Many people in this town will offer to help, but far fewer actually  mean it. People say: If I can ever be of help, let me know. When Emily  says that, you know she means it. She always follows through. No matter  how much success she had throughout her career, no task was ever too  small for her to take on. She is a team player in the best sense of the  word, through and through. She is always willing to jump in and lend a  hand to whoever might need it, whether that means negotiating an  infrastructure deal or helping to put binders together.   The late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said:         You can disagree without being disagreeable.    Emily is proof of that, living proof of that.   She believes fiercely that climate change is the greatest challenge  of our lifetime; that every American deserves quality, affordable  healthcare; and that every child, no matter what their ZIP Code may be,  should have clean air to breathe and clean water to drink. She has  spent her time in Congress fighting--fighting to advance those policies  without fighting with others.   She has a great deal of reverence for this institution and for her  colleagues, no matter their political affiliation. She is respected and  beloved by people on both sides of the aisle. That is why I say-- sitting here for a number of minutes before we were brought back into  session, I had the opportunity to get recognized and give these  remarks. It is interesting how many people came up to her, Senators and  staff alike, to say hello and to thank her and to wish her well. She  treats people with respect, and she earns their respect in return.   Our country could use a lot more Emily Spains these days, and I  believe she is an example to anyone--to anyone--who may have hopes of  having a career in public service and a career in political life as  well.   There is no doubt that Emily has had enormous professional success,  but I know that her most important job has always been and I think  probably always will be being a wonderful mom to Jack and Emma Spain.  And the days they come to our office are some of the happiest days of  the week.   Over the last decade, Emily has spent a great deal of time in  Delaware. She has gotten to know my family. My wife Martha and I have a  couple sons of our own, Ben and Christopher. I have been lucky to get  to know Emily's husband Ken and have gotten a chance to know their  children. They are wonderful children, young children, just kids whom  any mom or dad would be delighted to be able to call their own. Family  is important to both Emily and to me. She has always gone out of her  way to make sure that what we call Carpertown--that is the extended  Carper team family--is a family-friendly place. It is always a good day  when Jack Spain comes in and tells us about his latest baseball game,  and we find Emma coloring in Emily's office.   At our annual Carper holiday Christmas party, there is now a table  filled with gingerbread houses to decorate and all kinds of arts and  crafts, and that is because of Emily. She knows it is not enough to  just say that we value family; she walks the walk. She makes sure that  our policies reflect our priorities, and for that and many other  things, I am very, very appreciative.   For folks who may not be all that familiar with the work or the role  of chief of staff, Senate chief of staff, and a full-time mom, let me  just tell you, neither one is easy. Put them together, and they are  really hard. But no matter what the circumstances, she has risen to the  challenge in both roles--in both roles--without fail.   I just want to note that Emily has led our office under particularly  difficult conditions and has done so with  [[Page S6812]]  grace and compassion. Her tenure included, among other things, two  impeachments; an attack on this very building on January 6 of this  year; an unprecedented global pandemic, the worst in 100 years; and the  worst economy since the Great Depression.   There was no handbook for how to handle any of these things, let  alone all of them at once. There was no guide to show her how to keep  our office firing on all cylinders in remote settings so that we could  keep our staff safe while also helping the people of Delaware when they  needed that help the most. There was certainly no instruction manual to  help her console our staff during an insurrection at this place of  work. I know these were challenges that Emily never anticipated when  she took on this role--none of us could have anticipated these  challenges--but I am immensely grateful that she was the leader on our  team during such turbulent and trying times.   You know, one of the glories of knowing someone like her is, she has  had the compassion, as we have gone through this pandemic this year, to  literally call just about everybody on our team in Delaware and our  offices here, our three offices in Delaware and the folks who work  here, including the members of the Environment and Public Works  Committee, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations that I  have been privileged to help lead, and to make sure that they are doing  OK, that they and their families were doing OK as we go through this  pandemic. That is the mark of a great and wonderful human being and a  great leader.    There was, again, no guide to show her how to keep our office firing  on all cylinders in a remote setting so that we could keep our staff  safe while also helping the people of Delaware with what they needed  the most. And there was certainly no instruction manual to help her  console the staff during the insurrection of this place of work, right  here in this building. I know these were challenges Emily never  anticipated when she took on this role, but I am immensely grateful  that she is, again, the lead and one on our team during such critical,  turbulent, and trying times.   I will close with this. From the bottom of my heart, I want to thank  Jack and Emma--son and daughter of Ken and Emily Spain--for sharing  your mom; and Ken for sharing your wife with all of us for these years.  I know it has been a lot of early mornings and probably more late  nights than you want to think about, and some unexpected things over  too many weekends. But what we love to call Carpertown is better for  your mom's dedication, your wife's dedication to this job and the  people of Delaware, and I think the country is better off because of  her dedication.   I want to sincerely thank Emily for her service to the Senate, to the  country, and to the people of Delaware. Sometimes it is hard to really  know that we have made a difference, but I can assure Emily and her  family that she has. She has left her mark on 513 Hart. That is where  we have been for 20 years--all 20 years since I have come here--and  made her mark on 515 Hart and on the First State, and she will be  sorely missed.   In the Navy, when people do an especially good job--I have had the  privilege of serving for, I guess, 23 years all in, plus midshipman  before that. And we have a saying that we like to--when people do an  extraordinary job, do a terrific job, we say: Bravo Zulu. Bravo Zulu.   And I will say to Emily over and over again: Bravo Zulu. I probably  say it just about every day of her service. But thank you for a  remarkable, remarkable congressional career that has been an  inspiration to me and, I know, all of Delaware that you served.   When people are ready--in the Navy, when they are ready to weigh  anchor and sail off to their next chapter or their next adventure, we  say these words: Fair winds and following seas.   So I will say those today to Emily and her family, and I say those  words with reluctance but also with joy that comes from having been  able to know her, to work with her, and to get to know her and her  family.   We are lucky in life when we get the chance to work with people who  push us to be the best versions of ourselves, who make our loads  lighter, and who bring us people from all walks of life. Joy. Joy every  day.   And I am very lucky--we are very lucky in our team that Emily Spain  has, in my case, let me work for her for all these years, and she has  kept me on the payroll and, in no small way, helped make sure that I  stay on the payroll here to be able to do all these things together.   But Em, we will miss you, but we wish you and the Spain family  nothing but the best.   I yield the floor.
