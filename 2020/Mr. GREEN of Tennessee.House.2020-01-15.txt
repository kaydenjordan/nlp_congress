 Mr. Speaker, for almost half a century, we  have watched our Nation dehumanize an entire group of people based on  their age with the Roe decision allowing the killing of 60 million  unborn children. This is the largest human rights violation of our  time.   As Martin Luther King, Jr., said: ``There is no graded scale of  essential worth'' among people.   This truth is something the evil organization Planned Parenthood  deliberately chooses not to see, ending lives and selling baby parts  for the sake of science. As America's largest abortion provider, it  performs over 320,000 every single year, all in the name of freedom.  But there is quite obviously absolutely no such thing as a right or  freedom to end someone else's life.   As Ronald Reagan said, isn't it interesting that all who support  abortion have already been born?                                time  1830    We must defend the equal right to life for everyone. If we can't do  that, what are we even doing here?
