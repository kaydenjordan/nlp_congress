 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 2547) to expand the Department of Veterans  Affairs medical professionals who may qualify to perform physical  examinations on eligible veterans and issue medical certificates  required for operation of a commercial motor vehicle, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2547          Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans Expanded Trucking       Opportunities Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2.

(b) Conforming Amendments.--Section 5403 of the FAST Act       (49 U.S.C. 31149 note; 129 Stat. 1548) is amended--        (1) in subsection (a)--        (A) by striking ``physician-approved veteran operator,''       and inserting ``veteran operator approved by a qualified       examiner,''; and        (B) by striking ``qualified physician'' and inserting       ``qualified examiner'';        (2) in subsection (b)(1)--        (A) by striking ``the physician'' and inserting ``the       examiner''; and        (B) by striking ``qualified physician'' and inserting       ``qualified examiner'';        (3) in subsection (c)--        (A) by striking ``qualified physicians'' and inserting       ``qualified examiners''; and        (B) by striking ``such physicians'' and inserting ``such       examiners''; and        (4) in subsection (d)(1)--        (A) in the paragraph heading by striking ``Physician-      approved veteran operator'' and inserting ``Veteran operator       approved by a qualified examiner''; and        (B) by striking ``physician-approved veteran operator'' and       inserting ``veteran operator approved by a qualified       examiner''.        (c) Rulemaking.--The amendments made by this section shall       be incorporated into any rulemaking proceeding related to       section 5403 of the FAST Act (49 U.S.C. 31149 note; 129 Stat.       1548) that is being conducted as of the date of enactment of       this Act.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Graves) and the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia  (Ms. Norton) each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Missouri.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 2547, as  amended.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Missouri?   There was no objection.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 2547, as  amended.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Missouri?   There was no objection.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, the Fixing of America's Surface Transportation Act, or  the FAST Act, created a process only for doctors at the Department of  Veterans Affairs to qualify to perform physical examinations on  eligible veterans and then issue the medical certificates that are  required in order to operate a commercial vehicle.   H.R. 2547 would expand who is eligible for the process to all VA  medical professionals as long as they are authorized by the State in  which they are licensed, certified, and registered to perform physical  examinations and they meet other requirements.   H.R. 2547 would ensure that the list of eligible medical  professionals within the VA matches the list of eligible medical  professionals that can become certified under the traditional FMCSA  process.   This is a bipartisan bill. It is going to ease the regulatory burdens  that help create employment opportunities for our veterans.   Madam Speaker, I would urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2547, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Woodall).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Woodall).    Madam Speaker, with that, I would urge my  colleagues to join me in supporting this important piece of  legislation.   I yield back the balance of my time.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        June 26, 2017, on page H5144, the following appeared: Mr.  GRAVES.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 1684, as  amended.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Missouri?   There was no objection.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, the Disaster Assistance Support for Communities and  Homeowners Act of 2017 would allow FEMA to provide technical assistance  to some community associations regarding their application for disaster  assistance. The bill also seeks recommendations from FEMA on how condos  and co-ops may be eligible for disaster funds to repair common areas  which are affected by these disasters.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Nadler) for working with the committee on this issue. The House passed  similar language last year as part of the FEMA Disaster Assistance  Reform Act.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to  please support H.R. 1684, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 2258) to require that certain standards for  commercial driver's licenses applicable to former members of the armed  services or reserves also apply to current members of the armed  services or reserves, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Missouri?   There was no objection.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act, or  FAST Act, authorized the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration to  exempt veterans from certain requirements in order to obtain a  commercial driver's license if they had qualified experience while  serving in the armed services or Reserve components.   H.R. 2258 would extend this exemption to individuals who are  currently serving in either the armed services or Reserve components.   This is a bipartisan bill that will help current members of the armed  services or Reserve components find employment in the private sector.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2258, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers,  and I reserve the balance of my time.
