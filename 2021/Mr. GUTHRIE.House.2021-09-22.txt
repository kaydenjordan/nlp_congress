 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Alabama for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to express concerns with the Thompson amendment  No. 427. The amendment requires the Department of Homeland Security,  DHS, to establish a medical countermeasures program for preparedness  and response capabilities. It also requires DHS to maintain and pre- position a stockpile of medical countermeasures.   After dealing with the ongoing pandemic for the past year and a half,  we can all appreciate the necessity of being prepared to deal with  these threats. However, this new program is completely duplicative of  existing initiatives at HHS.   Currently, under HHS, the Strategic National Stockpile, or SNS, is  part of the Federal medical response infrastructure for such attacks.  The Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise  determines optimal allocation of resources and organization of the  stockpile to best address high-priority threats.   This interagency coordination already includes the input of the  Department of Homeland Security and coordinates Federal efforts to  combat these threats. While I do believe we should evaluate our  country's pandemic response given the COVID-19 pandemic, we do not need  to create a duplicative program that will only lead to confusion and  hinder coordination.
