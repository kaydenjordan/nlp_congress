 Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to vote  in favor of President Biden's historic Build Back Better agenda.   Already, congressional Democrats have come together to pass part one  of the Build Back Better agenda. The bipartisan Infrastructure  Investment and Jobs Act is the largest investment in United States  infrastructure in nearly a century, and it will benefit my State of  Alabama in so many ways.   It will provide $5.2 billion to repair Alabama's roads, $225 million  to fix Alabama's bridges, and $100 million to connect every Alabamian  to high-speed internet.   Now we have the opportunity to pass part two, the Build Back Better  Act. That, too, will invest in Alabama by creating millions of good- paying jobs; providing affordable childcare for over 300,000  Alabamians; lowering healthcare costs for families, including 300,000  Alabamians who fall into the Medicaid coverage gap; and delivering  universal pre-K to over 110,000 Alabama 3- and 4-year-olds.   As co-chair of the Ways and Means Racial Equity Initiative, I have  fought to ensure that equity remains a central focus, and I am proud  that these bills will uplift our most vulnerable communities in so many  transformative ways.   It is fully paid for. I ask my colleagues to vote in favor of the  Build Back Better Act.                            ____________________
