 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 4:30 p.m.  today, all postcloture time with respect to the Garcia nomination be  considered expired and the Senate vote on confirmation of the  nomination.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today to recognize  and bid farewell to a valued member of my team, our legislative  director, Elvia Montoya.   Five years ago, our office had the fortune of bringing Elvia onboard  as a legislative correspondent--or LC--working on issues of education,  equal rights, and healthcare. These are incredibly important issues.  And she did such an incredible job working on them that it wasn't long  at all before she was promoted to handle them as our legislative  assistant.   And time and time again, year after year, no matter what new task she  took on or what challenge was thrown at her, she succeeded and thrived.  Every Oregonian, every American, across this Nation is better off  today, thanks to her tireless efforts.   Seventy-two thousand children in our State, for instance, who  normally get free or reduced-priced lunches during the school year  continue to get healthy and nutritious meals during the summer months.  They have Elvia to thank for that because she is the one who included  language in the fiscal year 2020 Further Consolidated Appropriations  Act to reinstate the program.   Thousands of nurses are on the job today saving lives because we  invested in the training and workforce development that are key to the  future of this critical profession through the Nursing Workforce  Reauthorization Act of 2019. And Elvia wrote that bill and helped get  it passed as part of the CARES Act; and thank goodness she did, or the  nursing shortage today would be much worse than it is.   And Elvia was always three steps ahead in the lead-up to the COVID-19  pandemic. In January of 2020, over 2 months before life as we knew shut  down and people were only vaguely aware of a new virus coming out of  China, she saw right away that this had the potential to upend life  around the Globe.   By the end of that month, she had persuaded me to lead a letter  calling on the World Health Organization to declare a public health  emergency of international concern.   By the end of February, our office had a resource page for Oregonians  who were starting to hear about this new, dangerous virus and were  growing nervous. This was phenomenal timing because Oregon had its  first confirmed case on Friday, February 28, 2020. The announcement  came well after working hours.   But even late on a Friday evening, she was on the ball, alerting me  and other senior staff and starting to prepare for the long battle  ahead as she led our team in that battle for the next year-plus.   She kept tabs on the virus, day in and day out, leading briefings for  our team and providing daily updates on the spread and impact of the  virus. And she led my team's efforts to help enact the COVID relief  bills as we took up and passed them here on the Senate floor--from the  Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act  to the Families First Coronavirus Response Act; the CARES Act to the  Paycheck Protection Program and Healthcare Enforcement Act.   And she wasn't just invested in policy. She was also invested in the  logistical challenges we faced under COVID. One night, when a truck was  supposed to be delivering supplies of personal protective equipment--or  PPE, as we call it--delivering it from the national stockpile to the  main resource warehouse in Oregon, from where it would be distributed  to hospitals and clinics and other places the following morning, things  went awry.  [[Page S375]]  The security guards at the facility hadn't received the right paperwork  when the tractor trailer pulled up. So they turned the truck away.    Now, at that time, we were in such short supply of PPE, and our  healthcare practitioners were risking their lives because of that  shortage. So this was incredibly important that we get these supplies  delivered.   Doctors and nurses and other first responders on the frontlines of  the pandemic were counting on that delivery of supplies that was now  headed in the wrong direction. So Elvia jumped into action. She started  calling folks at HHS and other Federal and State agencies. She woke  people up. She tracked down cell phone numbers, including the numbers  of the guards who were on duty. Eventually, she got that truck turned  around and those supplies were delivered.   She was able to do this because she had worked for months and months  to build connections and relationships with folks working, at every  level, on responding to the pandemic. Thus, when an incident like this  occurred, she knew how to make sure the bureaucratic redtape didn't  stop people from getting the help and resources they needed.   And so it was when our previous legislative director left to go to  the State Department in January of 2021, it was clear that Elvia's  tenacity, resourcefulness, humor, warmth, professionalism would make  her the perfect choice to ably step up and fill that role.   Almost overnight, she went from focusing exclusively on healthcare  and education to overseeing the entire pantheon of our team's  legislative activities, with all of the added responsibilities--like  staffing vote-aramas--that came along with the role.   As legislative director, she has personally taken point on our  efforts to protect American democracy and ensure every American's right  to vote. She quickly and deeply immersed herself in the intricacies of  the issues of voter suppression, of dark money, and gerrymandering that  we sought to address in the For the People Act and its derivative, the  Freedom to Vote Act.   On top of that, Elvia got familiar with the history and arcane  procedures of this body that are so much in need of reform today,  helping to craft workable options to restore the Senate to being a  better legislative body that our Founders intended it to be.   And even now, she has continued to take the lead on my ``Mysteries of  the Senate'' project, where every week we prepare a memo for the caucus  explaining another aspect of the Senate's arcane history and  procedures. This is valuable, I hope, because I believe we cannot begin  to improve the way we function unless Members understand better the  Senate's history and the web of rules and precedents that guide how we  operate.   It would be an understatement to say that Elvia has excelled at every  task and every issue she has taken on over these last 5 years. It has  been a pleasure for me to work with her. It has been a pleasure for the  entire team to work with her. And she has contributed greatly to the  future of our team nurturing and bringing along new staffers, making  sure they not only are up to speed on the issues but fully integrated  participants in our collective effort to improve policies to benefit  Oregonians and to benefit Americans.   Elvia, all of us on the team--all of us on team Merkley--thank you  deeply for your dedication. We wish you all the best in your next  chapter as you take your talents back home to Oregon. I think all of us  are a bit jealous of that opportunity to be fully back home. And we  know that wherever you are, you will never stop fighting to build a  better world.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I have four requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate.
