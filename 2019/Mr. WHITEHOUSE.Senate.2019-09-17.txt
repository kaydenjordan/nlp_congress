 We are here tonight when we should not be, because  the epidemic, the pageant of gun violence in this country should have  been addressed by us by now. We have not acted. We have not acted in  large part because we are engaged in a bizarre, self-inflicted  political experiment in this country in which we allow big special  interests to use secret money in elections to manipulate our politics.   This ought to be easy. There have been 293 mass shootings since  January 1, 2019--this year alone. These tragedies have galvanized the  American public in support of sensible restrictions on guns, and the  amount of agreement among the American public is astounding. Eighty-six  percent of Americans support implementing what we call red flag laws  that allow a judge to remove guns from someone who is determined to be  a danger to himself or others. You could barely get 86 percent of the  Senate to agree on the day of the week. Additionally, 89 percent  support expanding Federal background checks to cover private sales and  to close the gun show loophole, 86 percent support an assault weapons  ban, and 70 percent support a ban on large-capacity magazines. These  are large, popular majorities, and in a functional democracy, we would  listen to them, we would hear them, we would honor them, and we would  respond to this bloodshed. Why we have not done that takes us on a  sordid crawl through the sewers of modern politics inhabited by the  National Rifle Association.   The National Rifle Association spent $30 million supporting President  Trump. No wonder they can undo all of our work with a simple phone call  to the Oval Office. But it is much worse than that. Reports emerged  last year that the NRA accepted money from foreign sources, including  Russian banker and Putin ally Aleksandr Torshin, and spent that money  in politics in America.   Senator Wyden sent letters to the NRA and to the Treasury Department  [[Page S5535]]  about these reports. The NRA responded maintaining that it properly  segregates any foreign donations so that they are not used for  political purposes. Fat chance of that, with money being fungible. I  joined Senator Wyden on a followup letter renewing the request  following the arrest of Maria Butina, an evident NRA go-between.   The IRS, under President Trump, took no action against the NRA in  response to these allegations. In August, the Federal Election  Commission deadlocked 2 to 2 on whether to investigate this matter at  all. The FEC is so locked up on this now that they wouldn't even  investigate.   FEC Commissioner Weintraub in desperation wrote:         Some allegations are too serious to ignore. Too serious to       simply take [the NRA's] denials at face value. Too serious to       play games with. Yet in this matter, my colleagues ran their       usual evidence-blocking play and the Commission's attorneys       placed too much faith in the few facts [the NRA] put before       us.    So we can't even look into the extent of Russian interference in our  politics through the NRA.   It goes on. Last fall, the Campaign Legal Center and Giffords Center  filed complaints with the Federal Election Commission alleging that the  NRA was evading the anti-coordination rules of our election between the  Trump campaign and with various Republican Senate campaigns. The  complaints allege that the NRA and the campaigns coordinated spending  through a GOP media consulting firm. What had the media consulting firm  done? It had set up a series of shell corporations through which the  campaigns paid.   We have all used media consulting firms in getting to the Senate.  Which of those media consulting firms set up shell corporations?   In fact, these shell corporations--these supposedly separate  companies--shared staff, office space, and other resources, so that the  firm coordinated the ad buys between the NRA and the campaigns. Once  again, the FEC did nothing, so the Campaign Legal Center had to sue the  Federal Election Commission in district court.   The NRA's political spending has more than quintupled since the  Supreme Court--I should say more specifically, since five Republican  appointees on the Supreme Court--allowed unlimited, anonymous money  into our political system--from $10 million in 2010, the year of the  Citizens United decision, to about $55 million in the 2016 election.  The NRA now spends unlimited amounts of dark money on political ads.  They can come after people. They can threaten people. They can make  promises to people. That is why 86 percent, 89 percent of the U.S.  public gets ignored around here.   When Representative Raskin and I wrote the NRA and the consultants  about this coordination scheme, guess what the supposedly independent  groups did? They wrote back to us in the same letter from the same  lawyer--some independence. Of course, we are still waiting on the FEC  to take any action at all.   By way of a visitor's guide to the sewer of modern politics inhabited  by the NRA, I ask unanimous consent that a September 17 article from  The Trace titled ``Guide to Every Known Investigation of the NRA'' be  appended to my remarks as an exhibit.   I will close where I began. There have been 293 mass shootings since  January 1 of this year, and the American public has an extraordinarily  common voice for red flag laws, for expanding Federal background  checks, closing the gun show loophole, banning assault weapons, and  banning large-capacity magazines, and we don't listen to the popular  will here because of the menace that the NRA has become in our  politics--the anti-Democratic menace that the NRA has become.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                      [From the Trace, Sept. 17, 2019]     Bang for the Buck--A Guide to Every Known Investigation of the NRA    Here are the facts about all ten active inquiries into the gun rights                                   group                              (By Daniel Nass)         The National Rifle Association is caught up in a rapidly       expanding tangle of investigations--eight launched this year       alone. Investigators in the House, Senate, New York State,       and D.C. are scrutinizing the gun group's nonprofit status       following alleged financial misconduct exposed by The Trace,       while other probes have their sights on the NRA's ties to       Kremlin-linked Russians and to Donald Trump's presidential       campaign, as well as several potential campaign finance       violations.        Because it's challenging to keep track of these probes,       we've rounded them up below. We included only investigations       that directly involve the NRA or its staff. We'll keep this       post updated to reflect the latest developments, and will add       new investigations to the list, should they arise.                          WHAT'S UNDER INVESTIGATION         A fourth investigation of the NRA's nonprofit status is       underway, this one initiated by D.C. Attorney General Karl       Racine. Racine's office is seeking documents from the gun       group and its affiliated foundation regarding ``financial       records, payments to vendors, and payments to officers and       directors.'' The NRA Foundation is chartered in Washington,       D.C. NRA attorney William Brewer said in a statement that       ``the NRA has full confidence in its accounting practices and       commitment to good governance.''                          WHAT'S UNDER INVESTIGATION         Amid the ongoing strife between the NRA and its former       communications firm Ackerman McQueen, another congressional       committee is attempting to determine whether the NRA has       violated its tax-exempt status. In a letter to Wayne       LaPierre, House Ways and Means Committee member       Representative Brad Schneider demanded documents related to       internal audits, financial misconduct, and conflicts of       interest. It's the third probe of the NRA's finances launched       since The Trace and The New Yorker first reported on alleged       financial improprieties in April. In August, Schneider       expanded the inquiry, sending a letter to Ackerman CEO Revan       McQueen requesting documents related to the firm's past       relationship with the NRA.                          WHAT'S UNDER INVESTIGATION         Three Democratic members of the Senate Finance Committee,       which oversees tax-exempt organizations, are probing alleged       financial impropriety within the NRA. Letters addressed to       NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre and ex-President       Oliver North request documentation of alleged financial       misconduct raised by North during a public power struggle for       control of the gun group, which culminated with North's       ouster from his leadership role. A third letter requests       documentation from Revan McQueen, the CEO of top NRA vendor       Ackerman McQueen, due to LaPierre's claim that Ackerman had       prepared a damaging memo in order to blackmail him. The feud       erupted after reporting by The Trace and other news       organizations revealed a culture of self-dealing and       financial mismanagement within the NRA, particularly around       its relationship with Ackerman. The NRA has refused to       cooperate with the investigation, and a letter from Ackerman       McQueen to the senators indicates that the NRA has not given       the vendor permission to share relevant materials.                          WHAT'S UNDER INVESTIGATION         New York Attorney General Letitia James has opened an       investigation into the NRA's nonprofit status, asking the       organization, its charitable foundation, and other affiliated       groups to preserve financial records. The probe, first       reported by The New York Times, also touches the gun group's       ``related businesses,'' although information about the       parties involved is not yet public. James has jurisdiction       because the NRA was chartered in New York in 1871. In August,       the attorney general's office expanded the inquiry, issuing       subpoenas to more than 90 current and former NRA board       members, including former president Oliver North.        The probe follows a series of media reports about financial       misconduct within the NRA, including a Trace investigation       detailing allegations that former IRS official Marc Owens       said ``could lead to the revocation of the NRA's tax-exempt       status.''                          WHAT'S UNDER INVESTIGATION         The NRA is among more than 80 organizations and individuals       that received requests for documents as part of a wide-      ranging House Judiciary Committee probe which aims to       establish whether President Trump and those in his orbit have       engaged in ``obstruction of justice, public corruption, and       other abuses of power.'' A letter from committee Chairman       Jerrold Nadler to NRA boss LaPierre demands information on       the gun group's contacts with and about Russia and the Trump       campaign during the run-up to the 2016 election. The NRA has       reportedly submitted nearly 1,500 pages of documents in       response to the request.                          WHAT'S UNDER INVESTIGATION         Representatives Ted Lieu and Kathleen Rice, concerned by a       ``lack of transparency'' around the NRA's 2015 visit to       Moscow and its other ties to Russia, have launched a new       investigation intended to illuminate those connections.       Another probe of the gun group's Kremlin connections is       underway in the Senate, but House Democrats, unlike their       counterparts in the Senate, hold the majority required to       issue subpoenas.                          WHAT'S UNDER INVESTIGATION         A joint House-Senate probe is investigating possible       ``illegal, excessive, and unreported in-kind donations'' made       by the NRA to Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and       to several Republican Senate candidates. Sparked by The       Trace's reporting, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and Congressman       Jamie Raskin have contacted NRA  [[Page S5536]]       Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre and five campaign       advertising vendors to request information about the groups'       relationships. ``The evidence shows the NRA is moving money       through a complex web of shell organizations to avoid       campaign finance rules and boost candidates willing to carry       their water,'' Whitehouse told The Trace.                          WHAT'S UNDER INVESTIGATION         As part of a probe into security clearances issued by the       Trump administration, House Oversight Committee Chairman       Elijah Cummings has requested documents from the NRA       regarding Trump national security advisor John Bolton's       contacts with Russia. In 2013, Bolton appeared in a video for       The Right to Bear Arms, the Russian gun-rights group linked       to Maria Butina and Alexander Torshin. He also headed the       NRA's subcommittee on international affairs, which Cummings       has also requested information about. The Oversight Committee       investigation came months after Cummings and Representative       Stephen Lynch first sought information from the White House       about Bolton's ties to Russia.                          WHAT'S UNDER INVESTIGATION         An NRA delegation's trip to Moscow in 2015 is under the       scrutiny of the Senate Intelligence Committee, headed by       Senators Richard Burr and Mark Warner, which in November       requested documents about contacts with high-profile Russians       during the excursion. In January, investigators grilled       former Trump aide Sam Nunberg about the links between the       Trump campaign, the NRA, and Russian nationals including       Maria Butina. Burr, the committee's chair, has received ample       campaign support from the NRA.                          WHAT'S UNDER INVESTIGATION         Senator Ron Wyden, the ranking member of the Senate Finance       Committee, has sent a series of requests to the NRA and the       Treasury Department seeking information about the gun group's       financial ties to Russian official Alexander Torshin and       other Putin-linked politicians. After the arrest of self-      confessed Russian agent Maria Butina in July, Wyden and       committee members Sheldon Whitehouse and Bob Menendez       followed up with the Treasury requesting further information       about Butina's financial links to the NRA. Butina later       pleaded guilty to conspiring in the United States. Earlier       this month, the Finance Committee launched a separate probe       into a conservative think tank linked to Butina and Torshin.       Senator Charles Grassley, who chairs the Finance Committee,       has ties to the NRA.        A few other investigations bear mentioning. An inquiry by       the House Intelligence Committee and the FBI's reported       investigation of Alexander Torshin both probed the gun       group's ties to Russia, although there is no hard evidence       that the NRA or its employees have been pulled into either of       those probes. Watchdog organizations have filed a series of       complaints with the Federal Election Commission regarding the       NRA's campaign finance activities, and two groups are now       suing the regulator for its failure to act on those       complaints.        We'll update this post as new information comes to light.    I yield the floor.
