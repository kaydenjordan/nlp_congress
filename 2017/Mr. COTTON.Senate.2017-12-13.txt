 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, a month ago, we lost another Medal of  Honor recipient, CAPT Thomas J. Hudner, who died at the ripe old age of  93. Not long after, we lost a second one, Col. Wesley L. Fox, who died  at the distinguished age of 86. These are two different men who led two  different lives, each equally deserving of praise and honor. Still, I  can't help but wonder if there is a reason their deaths came so  suddenly and close together. It is almost as if our Lord took them in  one fell swoop so the greater loss would inspire greater gratitude for  their sacrifice.   What Captain Hudner of the U.S. Navy did to earn his medal is  remarkable for the simple fact that he could have been court-martialed  for doing it. It was December 1950 in Korea. Just days before, the  Chinese People's Liberation Army had crossed the Yalu River and thrown  back U.S. forces on the cusp of victory. Then-Lieutenant Hudner was a  naval aviator flying one of six Navy Corsairs near the Chosin  Reservoir, 5 miles behind enemy lines, when he saw his squadron mate,  ENS Jesse L. Brown, get hit by enemy fire and crash-land on a snowy  mountainside.   What Lieutenant Hudner probably should have done is stick to the  plan. What he did instead was an act of pure bravery. He intentionally  crash-landed his plane not far from Ensign Brown's, tried to rescue him  from the burning wreckage--all in subzero temperatures--but Ensign  Brown was trapped. His knee was crushed between the fuselage and the  control panel. When help arrived, their hatchet couldn't hack through  the plane's metal, and no one could get close enough to amputate his  leg. They had to leave him behind. Ensign Brown's last words were:  ``Tell Daisy I love her.''   It might be appropriate to note here that Ensign Brown was Black and  Lieutenant Hudner was White, but I mention it almost as an afterthought  because to the two of them, that is just what it was--a postscript, an  addendum, a mere detail. They were comrades in arms, wearing the red,  white, and blue, not seeing the color of each other's skin. The only  color that mattered to them, and that they shared in common, besides  the color of our flag, was the navy blue of their uniform. Just 2 years  after Harry Truman had integrated the Armed Forces, Lieutenant Hudner  and Ensign Brown's friendship was a symbol of America's promise. He  went on to have a successful career, but for giving us a moral example  from that day, we should all be thankful.   Colonel Fox, meanwhile, was a legend in the Marine Corps. He served  for 43 years, leaving only when forced to by mandatory retirement at  the age of 62. In that time, he held every enlisted rank except  sergeant major and every officer rank except for general. He once  admitted:         My first four years as a Marine I didn't own one stitch of       civilian clothes--everything I did was in a Marine uniform.       I'd go home on leave, working in the hay fields or whatever,       I wore my Marine utilities. Go in town to see the movies, I       wore my Marine dress.    That is just how proud Wesley Fox was to be a marine, and it was that  deeply felt love for his fellow marines that drove him in his service.  Like Lieutenant Hudner, he fought in Korea. In fact, he was wounded,  and after he recovered, he was so eager to get back to the fight that  he wrote to the commandant asking to be deployed once again.   The battle that earned him his place in history was in the jungles of  Vietnam. It was February 1969, deep in the A Shau Valley in Vietnam.  Then-First Lieutenant Fox was fighting in the last major Marine  offensive of the war--Operation Dewey Canyon. His unit was Alpha  Company, 1st Battalion, 9th Marines. It earned the nickname ``The  Walking Dead'' for suffering so many casualties during the war. They  came under heavy fire from a larger force. Yet the fearless Lieutenant  Fox led a charge against the enemy. He was wounded but refused medical  attention, instead concentrating on leading the attack, coordinating  air support, and supervising the evacuation of the dead and injured.   It was a stunning show of valor, and for it, he, too, would earn the  Medal of Honor. His citation read, in part:         His indomitable courage, inspiring initiative and       unwavering devotion to duty in the face of grave personal       danger inspired his Marines to such aggressive action that       they overcame all enemy resistance and destroyed a large       bunker complex. Captain Fox's heroic actions reflect great       credit upon himself and the Marine Corps, and uphold the       highest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service.    As I said, these were two different men and two different stories but  the same courage and service to the same great country. They showed the  same selflessness--one risking his life for his friend and the other  risking his life for his marines. So I think it is fitting that we  celebrate their lives together because they both showed us the utter  selflessness of courage. They didn't fight and display such bravery  because they hated our enemies but because they loved our country, and  they loved their comrades in arms. It is a good lesson, I would say,  for this time of year.   So I want to honor the memory of CAPT Thomas J. Hudner and Col.  Wesley L. Fox. They were true American patriots, and may they rest in  peace.
