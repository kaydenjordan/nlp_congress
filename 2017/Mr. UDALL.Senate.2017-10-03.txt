 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Mr. President, I am joined today by my colleague from New  Mexico, Senator Heinrich. We thought we would come to the floor  together and talk about Senator Domenici, our former colleague who  passed away recently.   Pietro Vichi Domenici was born to Italian immigrants in Albuquerque,  NM, in 1932. He was a grocer's son. He worked in his parents' store and  attended Catholic school. He graduated from our own University of New  Mexico. He pitched in college on the Albuquerque Dukes' farm team, and  he taught high school mathematics. He went to law school and built a  law practice. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1973 and became New  Mexico's longest serving Senator.   He was a husband, father, and grandfather. He married Nancy Burke  right out of law school, and his beautiful wife of 59 years was key to  his long and successful career. She is a good friend of ours, and we  spent an hour with her in Albuquerque a little over a week ago. She is  still very strong, and she is still very focused, as one would expect  as a mother and grandmother of her children and grandchildren.   Pete Domenici was a statesman. He worked across party lines to find  pragmatic solutions for the American people. New Mexicans will always  remember him as one of the strongest fighters our State will ever know.   Senator Domenici and I belonged to different political parties, and  we didn't always agree on things, but I always appreciated that he  cared deeply about the issues, and he put the Nation and New Mexico's  interests first as he saw them. I join all of New Mexico in thanking  him and in mourning his passing.   Senator Domenici's math skills and his beginnings in local government  served him well during his 36 years in the U.S. Senate. Anyone who has  served in city government knows the importance of a budget. Sitting as  chair or ranking member on the Senate Budget Committee for 22 years, he  held the Federal Government to the same rigorous, logical standard. He  mastered the complexities of the Federal budget and served longer in a  leadership position on that committee than any other Senator. He was a  budget deficit hawk and a realist. He understood that supply-side  economics do not work and that big tax cuts will not result in growth  leading to a balanced budget. He went up against his own party, and he  went up against President Ronald Reagan on the same budget issue.   In the 1990s, he worked with President Clinton to produce a budget  surplus for fiscal year 1998--the first surplus in our budget since  1969. His willingness to work with Democrats, his pragmatism, and his  stature with his own party made it possible.   On the Budget Committee, he understood how to align New Mexico and  national interests.   He recognized the potential of our National Labs--Los Alamos and  Sandia--and the potential they had for our State. He understood their  importance to the national interest. He championed their work for  decades. Our Labs provide thousands of good jobs in central and  northern New Mexico, and the breadth and depth of their research and  scientific contributions to our Nation are nothing short of  astonishing. Pete Domenici played a critical role in the Labs'  developments.   He also had a key appreciation of the importance to New Mexico and  the Nation of our military bases. In 2005, Cannon Air Force Base in  southern New Mexico was slated to close. This would have cost New  Mexico lots of jobs and would have had a devastating impact on the  overall economy of the State. Senator Domenici, along with the entire  delegation and Governor Richardson, worked to secure a different and  critical mission for Cannon Air Force Base. Today, the 27th Special  Operations Wing is going strong at Cannon. Six thousand men and women  are employed, and rural Roosevelt and Curry Counties benefit from the  base's $500 million economic impact.   Senator Domenici's fingerprints are not only all over the Budget  Committee but are all over the Energy and Natural Resources Committee-- which he chaired for 4 years in the early 2000s--and the Indian Affairs  Committee, which I am fortunate to sit on today. He helped position the  United States to be energy independent through the Energy Policy Acts  of 2005 and 2007--the last time we really had bipartisan energy acts.  He was a strong advocate on behalf of Tribes, working  [[Page S6279]]  to advance Indian healthcare and resolve longstanding water rights  disputes, protecting Native art from counterfeiting, and improving  reservation roads.   My Uncle Mo talked a lot about the importance of being able to  disagree without being disagreeable and to work together, if possible.  Senator Domenici understood that while the delegation was divided by  party, it was united in its love for New Mexico. He knew that New  Mexico would be stronger if everyone worked together. It is partly  thanks to him that our delegation continues a tradition of working  together regardless of party.   Senator Domenici's commitment to bipartisanship did not end in 2009  with his Senate tenure; he continued to try to find solutions that  worked for everyone as a senior fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Center  in Washington.   The Pete V. Domenici Institute for Public Policy at New Mexico State  University in Las Cruces carries on his tradition through scholarship.  The Senator said:         It's time for us to join together and take these [partisan]       issues out of politics. The problems we face are so big,       people from both sides need to sit down and say, ``We can't       approach this the normal way.'' Some great leadership is       needed.    We could really use that commitment to bipartisanship in the Senate  halls today.   Senator Domenici was in Washington for many years, but he never was  out of touch with everyday New Mexicans. Whether it was the acequia  repairs in the Espanola Valley, creating a port of entry at Santa  Teresa, funding new fighter jets at Kirtland Air Force Base in  Albuquerque, establishing the Petroglyph National Monument, protecting  Valles Caldera, forming the Hispanic Cultural Center and Museum in  Albuquerque, Pete Domenici identified New Mexico's needs and came up  with solutions.   Pete and Nancy had a special passion for people who live with mental  illness, borne from his own family's experience. This is an issue that  he and I talked a lot about and that our two families shared. He worked  across the aisle for many years to achieve parity in insurance coverage  between mental healthcare and medical services. Any family who  experiences serious mental illness understands that the two should be  treated the same and that adequate mental healthcare is absolutely  necessary.   In 2008, Congress passed the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental  Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act. That Federal law means that  millions of persons with mental illness and substance abuse disorders  have better access to the care they really need.   Senator Domenici spoke passionately and personally about mental  health. He also did so on immigration. His mother originally immigrated  to the United States illegally. During World War II, she was taken in a  raid aimed at ``Italian sympathizers.'' Those of us who were here  during the immigration debates in 2006 remember his plainspoken and  moving speech on the floor of the Senate, where he said:         I understand this whole idea of a household with a father       who is American and a mother who is not, but they are living,       working, and getting ahead. I understand that they are just       like every other family in America. There is nothing       different. They have the same love, same hope, same will and       same aspirations as those of us who were born here have.    I couldn't agree more.   Pete Domenici, my good friend, son of Italian immigrant grocers, a  great Senator, a great American, and a great New Mexican, thank you for  your remarkable contributions. You leave an exceptional legacy for New  Mexico and for the Nation.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.
