 BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)    BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I am someone who  believes in this institution. So, Madam Speaker, this week, to me, has  been an embarrassment. It is an embarrassment that we here in the House  can't have a real, genuine bipartisan investigation by our Intelligence  Committee.   Fortunately, this afternoon, the chairman and ranking member--one  Democrat and one Republican--of the Senate Intelligence Committee have  signaled in a joint press conference that they are interested in having  a real investigation.   Wouldn't it be nice if the House of Representatives would do the  same?   Madam Speaker, it gives me no pleasure to say this, but the chairman  of our House Intelligence Committee has acted in a way that makes a  real  [[Page H2550]]  investigation in our House impossible. He should do the right thing and  recuse himself, and this House should join the Senate in having a real  investigation.                            ____________________
