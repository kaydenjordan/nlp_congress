 Madam President, the role of Federal funding to schools  for COVID relief is to help support our schools in implementing public  health protocols aligned with local public health guidance in order to  safely reopen.   The President has made clear that he would like the vast majority of  K-8 schools to reopen in the next 100 days, but any amendment offered  today attaching extraneous conditions to those funds is simply a  political show. If we withhold funds and schools cannot implement  health safety protocols, then we are acting counter to actually getting  students back into the classroom.   Making sure our Nation's educators receive a vaccine is an important  step; however, vaccinations are just one piece of safely transitioning  back. Safely reopening schools means providing schools the resources to  implement public health protocols, physical distancing, consistent  mask-wearing, ventilation, testing, and contact tracing. This amendment  would prohibit schools from getting critical resources to implement  those public health protocols, and, as a result, this amendment would  make that much harder for schools to reopen for in-person instruction.   The best way for our schools to reopen as soon as possible is to give  schools the resources they need. I urge my colleagues to oppose this  amendment.
