 Mr. Chief Justice, I submit a question to the desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senator Romney is for the counsel for the  President:         On what specific date did President Trump first order the       hold on security assistance to Ukraine and did he explain the       reason at that time?    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senator, thank you for the  question.   I don't think that there is evidence in the record of a specific  date--the specific date--but there is testimony in the record that  individuals at OMB and elsewhere were aware of the hold as of July 3,  and there is evidence in the record of the President's rationale from  even earlier than that time. There is an email from June 24 that has  been publicly released. It was publicly released in response to a FOIA  request that is from one DOD staffer up to the Chief of Staff of DOD-- excuse me, sorry--from the Chief of Staff down to a staffer from DOD  relating on the subject line: POTUS follow-up. Follow-up from a meeting  with POTUS, President of the United States, explaining questions that  had been asked about Ukraine assistance, which were specifically: What  was the funding used for, i.e., did it go to U.S. firms; who funded it;  and what do other NATO members spend to support Ukraine?   So from the very beginning, in June, the President had expressed his  concern about burden-sharing, what do other NATO members do. Similarly,  in the July 25 transcript, there was--the President asked President  Zelensky specifically. He raised the issue of burden-sharing. Again,  showing that was his concern. In addition, there was, I believe, Mr.  Morrison, who testified that he was aware from OMB that the President  had expressed concerns about corruption and that there was a review  process to consider corruption in Ukraine.   So the evidence in the record shows that the President raised  concerns at least as of June 24; that people were aware of the hold as  of July 3; the President's concerns about burden-sharing were in the  email on June 24; they were reflected in the July 25 call. Similarly,  there is testimony from later in the summer that the President had  raised concerns about corruption in Ukraine. So that is the evidence in  the record that reflects the President's concerns. Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel. The Senator from Nevada.
