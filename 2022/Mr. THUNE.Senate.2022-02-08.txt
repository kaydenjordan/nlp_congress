 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I don't need to tell anyone--except perhaps  the Democratic Party here in Congress--that our country has a major  inflation problem. The first year of the Biden administration has been  characterized by a huge increase in inflation. Inflation is currently  at a 40-year high. Let me just repeat that. Inflation is currently at a  40-year high. The last time inflation was this bad, ``E.T.'' was just  premiering in movie theaters and ``Return of the Jedi'' hadn't even  come out yet.   Inflation is so bad that despite wage increases in 2021, Americans  saw a de facto pay cut. A December survey by the New York Times found  that just 17 percent of Americans said their wages had kept up with  inflation.   The White House Chief of Staff may think inflation is ``a high-class  problem,'' but for the mom at the grocery store wondering if she can  afford to buy ground beef this week or for the young worker just  starting out who is wondering if she can afford to fill up her car,  inflation is a very real problem.   Americans are struggling. They are facing huge price increases at the  grocery store; huge price increases at the gas pump; big increases in  the cost of household goods, like furniture and bedding and laundry  equipment; massive increases in the cost of fuel oil and gas service;  higher electric bills; and on and on.   Inflation is weighing down businesses, too, from larger businesses to  family farms and ranches. A recent survey from the National Federation  of Independent Business found that 22 percent of small businesses  consider inflation to be the biggest challenge facing their business, a  20-point increase from the beginning of 2021--a 20-point increase.   It is no wonder that 69 percent of Americans disapprove of the  President's handling of inflation and 56 percent disapprove of his  handling of the economy.   Inflation is a major burden for American families and businesses--a  fact that seems utterly lost on members of the Democratic Party. While  American families struggle, Democrats' focus is on anything but  inflation.   What is worse, many Democrats are still hoping to pass elements of  their reckless tax-and-spending spree, the so-called Build Back Better  plan, despite the fact that it was a bloated Democrat spending spree  that helped get us into this inflation mess in the first place. Yes,  while the pandemic created inflationary pressures, a big reason we are  in our current inflation mess is because of Democrats' decision to push  through an unnecessary and partisan $2 trillion spending bill last  March.   When Democrats took office last January, inflation was well within an  acceptable range, what is known as the target inflation rate. It might  have stayed there had Democrats not decided that they needed to pass a  massive government spending spree under the guise of COVID relief and,  I might add, mere weeks after Congress had already passed a major COVID  bill. That is right. December 2020 saw Congress pass its fifth  bipartisan COVID relief bill, and that one was a nearly $1 trillion  piece of legislation that met essentially all current pressing COVID  needs. But the ink was barely dry on the page before Democrats decided  that they needed to take advantage of the COVID situation to pass yet  another bill--this time, a hyperpartisan $1.9 trillion piece of  legislation packed with unnecessary government spending and payoffs to  Democrat interest groups.   Again, there were five bipartisan COVID bills, the last of which  passed in December of 2020. It was a $1 trillion  [[Page S554]]  bill that took care of all the outstanding COVID needs. Yet, within  weeks, Democrats here in Congress were proposing another $2 trillion,  most of which had little to do with COVID or the pandemic and a lot  more to do with their partisan agenda.   But the point is, the definition of ``inflation'' is ``too many  dollars chasing too few goods and services.'' That is exactly the  situation the Democrats helped create with their so-called American  Rescue Plan. They sent too many Federal dollars into the economy, and  the economy overheated as a result. Now we are sitting here with the  worst inflation in 40 years, and instead of trying to address our  inflation crisis, Democrats still--still--want to double down on the  strategy that helped get us into this mess in the first place.  ``Reckless and irresponsible spending'' is putting it mildly.   In January, Senator Tim Scott and I introduced the Inflation  Prevention Act, a bill to stop Congress from considering any  legislation that contains new spending and is estimated to increase  inflation if the year-over-year inflation rate exceeds 4\1/2\ percent.  One would hope that legislation like this wouldn't be necessary at a  time when inflation far exceeds the target inflation rate, but, as we  have seen with Democrats' reckless tax-and-spending spree, that isn't  the case.   So Senator Tim Scott and I, along with several of our Republican  colleagues, have introduced this bill, which would help prevent  reckless spending legislation, like the Democrats' so-called Build Back  Better Act, when inflation is high.   Again, let me just point out that on top of a $2 trillion spending  bill a year ago in March--less than a year ago in March--the Democrats'  prescription now is another $5 trillion in spending, financed in part  with tax increases, which also fuels inflation, and about $3 trillion  in debt on top of the $30 trillion in debt we already have.   So we have rampant pandemic inflation, attributable largely to the  massive spending bill passed on a partisan basis last March. Now,  instead of tackling inflation and putting policies in place that would  help drive inflation down, the solution Democrats are proposing is a $5  trillion spending bill.   Americans are struggling. Everywhere they turn, they are facing  higher prices, stretching their budgets to the limit. If Democrats  really want to help American families, they should abandon the reckless  tax-and-spending spree once and for all and focus on mitigating damage  they have already done with their inflationary spending.
