 Madam Speaker, I rise to echo the pain and  suffering experienced by Federal workers and their families in my  district during this reckless McConnell-Trump shutdown and also the  important work that they do as public employees.   One is a constituent who is a proud African American TSA agent out of  the Oakland airport, who has been working without pay for more than a  month. He must pay to get to work, though, buy his own lunch and gas,  but has no paycheck coming in. He can't borrow from his family because  eight of his relatives also work for the Federal Government.   His story resonates with so many African Americans who work for the  Federal Government. But now with this shutdown, the Black community has  been deeply affected, like everyone else.   While African Americans account for 12 percent of the population, 18  percent  [[Page H1195]]  of the Federal workforce is African American. This is, of course, due  to discrimination against African Americans in the private sector. The  Federal Government has provided good-paying jobs and a path into the  middle class.   My grandfather worked for the Postal Service. He was a letter  carrier. My mother worked for Social Security.   Another constituent has been furloughed from the Food and Drug  Administration. He told me that he and his husband both rely on their  incomes to afford rent on their one-bedroom apartment.   I urge President Trump and Senator McConnell to stop playing games  with people's lives. Let's reopen the government and get workers the  paychecks that they deserve.                            ____________________
